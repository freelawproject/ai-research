**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting.  The Court holds today, as I understand its opinion, that Nevada, lacking personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Vanderbilt, had no power to adjudicate the question of support, and that any divorce decree purporting so to do is to that extent wholly void — presumably in Nevada as well as in New York — under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pursuant to the doctrine of Pennoyer v. Neff, <citedDecision>95 U. S. 714</citedDecision> .  I cannot agree with such a holding.  In the first place, as I see this case, there is no necessity to pass on this question at all. Our problem should be, initially at least, not whether this decree, insofar as it affects property, is “void” for lack of due process, but whether it binds New York *429 under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  In other words, we need not, in the first instance, decide what the Due Process Clause forbids Nevada to do, but merely what the Full Faith and Credit Clause compels New York to do.  One of the wisest of our constitutional commentators has warned us to beware the “constricting necessitari-anism” of deeming the two questions to be one and the same: “In a problem so fraught with infelicities whatever mediation is devised, there is wisdom in confining pronouncements closely to what is imperative in the particular case. It is not logically necessary to deny Nevada’s mastery within her own boundaries in order to deny her power of projection beyond them.  Freedom of home manufacture and consumption does not necessarily entail freedom of export.  Only if it is inexorable that what is meant by ‘jurisdiction’ must be either wholly absent or wholly unlimited need frailty in sister states be conditioned on total impotence at home.” T. R.
