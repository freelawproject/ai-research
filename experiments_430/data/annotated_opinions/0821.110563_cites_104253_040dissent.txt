**Dissenting Opinion**
 Likewise, the Court’s analysis indicates that Montana’s severance tax would not run afoul of the Commerce Clause even if it raised sufficient revenue to allow Montana to eliminate all other taxes upon its citizens.  11 The Court’s prior cases neither require nor support such a startling result.  12 The Court often has noted that “‘[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business.’ ” Complete Auto Transit, 430 U. S., at 279 (emphasis added), quoting Western Live Stock, 303 U. S., at 254 .  See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 754 .  Accordingly, *647 interstate commerce cannot claim any exemption from a state tax that “is fairly related to the services provided by the State.” Complete Auto Transit, 430 U. S., at 279 .  We have not interpreted this requirement of “fair relation” in a narrow sense; interstate commerce may be required to share equally with intrastate commerce the cost of providing “police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and ‘the advantages of a civilized society.’ ” Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980), quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 445 (1979).  See, e. g., Nippert v. Richmond, <citedDecision>327 U. S. 416, 433</citedDecision> (1946).  Moreover, interstate commerce can be required to “pay its own way” in a narrower sense as well: the State may tax interstate commerce for the purpose of recovering those costs attributable to the activity itself.  See, e. g., Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252 (1919).  13 *648 The Court has never suggested, however, that interstate commerce may be required to pay more than its own way.  The Court today fails to recognize that the Commerce Clause does impose limits upon the State’s power to impose even facially neutral and properly apportioned taxes.  See ante, at 622-623.  In Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157, 163 (1954), Texas argued that no inquiry into the constitutionality of a facially neutral tax on the “taking” of gas was necessary because the State “has afforded great benefits and protection to pipeline companies.” The Calvert Court rejected this argument, holding that “these benefits are relevant here only to show that the essential requirements of due process have been met sufficiently to justify the imposition of any tax on the interstate activity.” Id., at 163-164 .  The Court held, id., at 164 , that when a tax is challenged on Commerce Clause grounds its validity “ ‘depends upon other considerations of constitutional policy having reference to the substantial effects, actual or potential, of the particular tax in suppressing or burdening unduly the commerce,’ ” quoting Nippert v. Richmond, <citedDecision>327 U. S., at 424</citedDecision> .  Accordingly, while *649 the Commerce Clause does not require that interstate commerce be placed in a privileged position, it does require that it not be unduly burdened.  In framing its taxing measures to reach interstate commerce, the State must be “at pains to do so in a manner which avoids the evils forbidden by the commerce clause and puts that commerce actually on a plane of equality with local trade in local taxation.” Nippert, <citedDecision>327 U. S., at 434</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  Thus, the Court has been particularly vigilant to review taxes that “single out interstate business,” since “[a]ny tailored tax of this sort creates an increased danger of error in apportionment, of discrimination against interstate commerce, and of a lack of relationship to the services provided by the State.” Complete Auto Transit, 430 U. S., at 288-289, n. 15 .  14 Moreover, the Court’s vigilance has not been limited to taxes that discriminate upon their face: “Not the tax in a vacuum of words, but its practical consequences for the doing of interstate commerce in applications to concrete facts are our concern.” Nippert, <citedDecision>327 U. S., at 431</citedDecision> .  See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 756 .  This is particularly true when the challenged tax, while facially neutral, falls so heavily upon interstate commerce that its burden “is not likely to be alleviated by those political restraints which are normally exerted on legislation where it affects adversely interests within the state.” McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., 309 U. S. 33 , 46, n. 2 (1940).  Cf. Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U. S. 429, 446-447 (1978).  In sum, then, when a tax has been “tailored” to reach interstate com *650 merce, the Court’s cases suggest that we require a closer “fit” under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test than when interstate commerce has not been singled out by the challenged tax. As a number of commentators have noted, state severance taxes upon minerals are particularly susceptible to “tailoring.” “Like a tollgate lying athwart a trade route, a severance or processing tax conditions access to natural resources.” Developments in the Law: Federal Limitations on State Taxation of Interstate Business, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 953 , 970 (1962).  Thus, to the extent that the taxing jurisdiction approaches a monopoly position in the mineral, and consumption is largely outside the State, such taxes are “[economically and politically analogous to transportation taxes exploiting geographical position.” Brown, The Open Economy: Justice Frankfurter and the Position of the Judiciary, 67 Yale L. J. 219, 232 (1957) (Brown).  See also Hellerstein, Constitutional Constraints on State and Local Taxation of Energy Resources, 31 Nat. Tax J. 245, 249-250 (1978); R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 510-514 (2d ed. 1977) (Posner).
