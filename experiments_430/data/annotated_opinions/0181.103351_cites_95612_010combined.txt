**Combined Opinion**
Me. Justice Erankfueter delivered the opinion of the Court. This is an appeal under § 237 (a) of the Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U. S. C. § 344 , to review a judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas sustaining the *144 constitutionality of a Texas anti-trust law, and therefore upholding an indictment under it.  Appellant was charged with participation in a conspiracy to fix the retail price of beer.  Such a conspiracy is made a criminal offense by Title 19, Chapter 3, of the Texas Penal Code. Because the provisions of this law do not “apply to agricultural products or live stock in the hands of the producer or raiser,” Art. 1642, Tigner challenged the validity of the entire statute and sought release in the local courts by habeas corpus.  His claim has been rejected by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.  132 S. W. 2d 885 .  Essentially his contention is that the exemption granted by the Texas statute falls within the condemnation of Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co., <citedDecision>184 U. S. 540</citedDecision> , as offensive to “the equal protection of the laws” which the Fourteenth Amendment safeguards.  If that case controls, appellant contends, the Texas Act cannot survive and he must go free. The court below recognized that the exemption was identical with that deemed fatal to the Illinois statute involved in Connolly’s case. But it felt that time and circumstances had drained that case of vitality, leaving it free to treat the exemption as an exercise of legislative discretion.  A similar attitude has been reflected by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, Northern Wisconsin Cooperative Tobacco Pool v. Bekkedal, 182 Wis. 571, 593 ; 197 N. W. 936 , and appears to underlie much recent state and federal legislation.  Dealing as we are with an appeal to the Constitution, the Cormdlly case ought not to foreclose us from considering this exemption in its own setting.  The problem, in brief, is this: May Texas promote its policy of freedom for economic enterprise by utilizing the criminal law against various forms of combination and monopoly, but exclude from criminal punishment corresponding activities of agriculture?  *145 Legislation, both state and federal, similar to that of Texas had its origin in fear of the concentration of industrial power following the Civil War.  Law was invoked to buttress the traditional system of free competition, free markets and free enterprise.
