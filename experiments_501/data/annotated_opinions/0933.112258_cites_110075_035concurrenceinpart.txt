**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 Id., at 129 .  It also approved the officials’ refusal to deliver bulk packets of union literature to specific inmates for distribution to others.  Applying Equal Protection Clause as well as First Amendment standards, the Court held that the restriction was reasonable because it was limited in scope and because the union retained “other avenues of outside informational flow .  .  .  .” Id., at 131 ; see id., at 133, 136 .  In the third case, Bell v. Wolfish, <citedDecision>441 U. S. 520</citedDecision> (1979), the Court upheld a regulation that allowed only publishers, bookstores, and book clubs to mail hardbound books to pretrial detainees.  Hardbacks might serve as containers for contraband, jail administrators argued.  Since the risk of improper use by publishers and similar sources was low, the jail delivered books from them but not from other outsiders.  <citedDecision>Id., at 549</citedDecision> .  The Court found this explanation acceptable and held that the rule did not violate the detainees’ First Amendment rights.  <citedDecision>Id., at 550</citedDecision> .  Although the Court did not expressly address the rights of nonprisoners, the fact that softcover publications were delivered without restriction, see <citedDecision>id., at 552</citedDecision> , minimized the abridgment of outsiders’ rights.  The approval in <citedDecision>Wolfish</citedDecision> of greater protection for publishers than for individual citizens reinforces Martinez’s view that the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners must be carefully weighed and undermines the Court’s approach today.  Most recently, Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), confirmed the vitality of Martinez for evaluating encroachments on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners.  The Court relied on the three interim “prisoners’ rights” cases to establish a reasonableness standard for reviewing inmate-to-inmate correspondence.  Id., at 89.  But in its unanimous invalidation of a restriction on inmate marriages, the Court acknowledged that “because the regulation may entail a ‘con *427 sequential restriction on the [constitutional] rights of those who are not prisoners,’” Martinez might posit the correct level of review.  482 U. S., at 97 (quoting Martinez, 416 U. S., at 409 ).  It did not “reach this question, however, because even under the reasonable relationship test, the marriage regulation does not withstand scrutiny.” 10 " 482 U. S., at 97 .
