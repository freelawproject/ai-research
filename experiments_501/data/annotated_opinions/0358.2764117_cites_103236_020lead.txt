**Lead Opinion**
 The action was brought pursuant to the provisions of Mass. Gen. Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 209, § 36.  Petitioner testified that for many years prior to her departure for Florida, respondent had made frequent allusions to the fact that petitioner’s mother had been committed to a mental institution and had suggested that petitioner was revealing the same traits of mental instability.  Petitioner testified that as a result of these remarks and other acts of cruelty, her health had been undermined and that it had therefore become necessary for her to leave respondent.  In order to insure her departure, she had represented that her stay in Florida was to be only temporary, but from the outset she had in fact intended not to return.  Petitioner testified further that both before and after the Florida decree of divorce had been entered, she had intended to reside permanently in Florida and that she and Phelps had returned to Massachusetts only after receiving a letter stating that Phelps’ father was in poor health.  320 Mass. 351 , 69 N. E. 2d 801 (1946).  See Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U. S. 226, 233-234 (1945); cf. Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., <citedDecision>308 U. S. 66, 78, note 26</citedDecision> (1939).  No Florida case has been called to our attention involving a collateral attack on a divorce decree questioning the domicile of the parties, and hence the jurisdiction of the court which entered the decree, where both parties appeared in the divorce proceedings.  See generally Everette v. Petteway, 131 Fla. 516, 528-529 , 179 So. 666, 671-672 (1938); State ex rel. Goodrich Co. v. Trammell, 140 Fla. 500, 505 , 192 So. 175, 177 (1939).  But cf. Chisholm v. Chisholm, 98 Fla. 1196 , 125 So. 694 (1929); Dye v. Dolbeck, 114 Fla. 866 , 154 So. 847 (1934), involving attacks on jurisdictional findings made in ex parte divorce proceedings.  Bell v. Bell, 181 U. S. 175 (1901).  See note 3 supra. Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men’s Association, 283 U. S. 522 (1931); Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165 (1938); Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U. S. 371 (1940); Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U. S. 381 (1940); Jackson v. Irving Trust Co., 311 U. S. 494 (1941).  And see Forsyth v. Hammond, 166 U. S. 506 (1897); Heiser v. Woodruff, 327 U. S. 726 (1946).  American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, 287 U. S. 156 (1932); Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., <citedDecision>308 U. S. 66</citedDecision> (1939).  And see Chicago Life Insurance Co. v. Cherry, 244 U. S. 25 (1917).  Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32, 40 (1938).  And see Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 172, note 13 (1938).  See cases discussed supra. We, of course, intimate no opinion as to the scope of Congressional power to legislate under Article IV, § 1 of the Constitution.  See note 1 supra. Justices Brewer, Shiras, and Peckham dissented.  Mr. Justice Holmes took no part in the case. Thus, in the Andrews case, before the divorce decree was entered by the South Dakota court, the defendant withdrew her appearance in accordance with a consent agreement.
