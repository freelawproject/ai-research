 The Import-Export Clause clearly prohibits state taxation based on the foreign origin of the imported goods, but it cannot be read to accord imported goods preferential treatment that permits escape from uniform taxes imposed without regard to foreign origin for services which the State supplies.  See, e. g., May v. New Orleans, 178 U. S. 496, 502-504, 507-509 (1900).  It may be that such taxation could diminish federal impost revenues to the extent its economic burden may discourage purchase or importation of foreign goods.  The prevention or avoidance of this incidental effect was not, however, even remotely an objective of the Framers in enacting the prohibition.  Certainly the Court in Brown did not think so. See 12 Wheat., at 443-444 .  Taxes imposed after an initial sale, after the breakup of the shipping packages, or the moment goods imported for use are committed to current operational needs are also all likely to have an incidental effect on the volume of goods imported; yet all are permissible.  See, e. g., Waring v. The Mayor, 8 Wall. 110 (1869) (taxation after initial sale); May v. New Orleans, supra (taxation after breakup of shipping packages); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, <citedDecision>358 U. S. 534</citedDecision> (1959) (taxation of goods committed to current operational needs by manufacturer).  What those taxes and nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes share, it should be emphasized, is *288 the characteristic that they cannot be selectively imposed and increased so as substantially to impair or prohibit importation.  [7] Finally, nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes do not interfere with the free flow of imported goods among the States, as did the exactions by States under the Articles of Confederation directed solely at imported goods.  Indeed, importers of goods destined for inland States can easily avoid even those taxes in today's world.  Modern transportation methods such as air freight and containerized packaging, and the development of railroads and the Nation's internal waterways, enable importation directly into the inland States.  Petitioner, for example, operates other distribution centers from wholesale warehouses in inland States.  Actually, a quarter of the tires distributed from petitioner's Georgia warehouse are imported interstate directly from Canada.

 [3]  Madison noted the States' aversion to the transfer of power to a central government "notwithstanding the urgent demands of the Federal Treasury; the glaring inadequacy of the authorized mode of supplying it, the rapid growth of anarchy in the Fedl.  System, and the animosity kindled among its members by their conflicting regulations." 3 Farrand 544.  See also, e. g., 1 id., at 19 (Mr. Randolph's comments concerning defects of Articles of Confederation); id., at 462 (Mr. Ghorum, in explaining why small States should not object to the formation of the Union, notes: "Should a separation of the States take place, the fate of N. Jersey wd.  be worst of all. She has no foreign commerce & can have but little.  Pa. & N. York will continue to levy taxes on her consumption"); 3 id., at 328-329 (Mr. Madison's remarks during debate at the Virginia Convention).  [4]  See, e. g., Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 439 (1827); Cook v. Pennsylvania, 97 U. S. 566, 574 (1878); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, <citedDecision>358 U. S. 534, 555-556</citedDecision> (1959) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); The Federalist Nos. 11 (Hamilton), 12 (Hamilton), 42 (Madison), 44 (Madison); 2 Farrand 135, 157-158, 169 (notes of Committee of Detail); id., at 441; 3 id., at 520-521 (letter of James Madison to Professor Davis); id., at 547-548.  [5]  See, e. g., Brown v. Maryland, supra, at 439 ; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. <citedDecision>Bowers, supra, at 556</citedDecision> (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); The Federalist No. 12.  [6]  See, e. g., Brown v. Maryland, supra, at 440 ; Cook v. Pennsylvania, supra, at 574 ; Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. <citedDecision>Bowers, supra, at 545</citedDecision> ; <citedDecision>id., at 556-557</citedDecision> (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); 2 Farrand 441-442, 589; 3 id., at 519 (letter of James Madison to Professor Davis).  [7]  Of course, discriminatory taxation in such circumstances is not inconceivable.  For example, a State could pass a law which only taxed the retail sale of imported goods, while the retail sale of domestic goods was not taxed.  Such a tax, even though operating after an "initial sale" of the imports would, of course, be invalidated as a discriminatory imposition that was, in practical effect, an impost.  Nothing in the opinion in Brown v. Maryland should suggest otherwise.  The Court in Brown merely presumed that at these later stages of commercial activity, state impositions would not be discriminatory.  But merely because Brown would have authorized a nondiscriminatory charge on even an importer's use of the services of a public auctioneer, see 12 Wheat., at 443 , does not mean that it would have disapproved the holding of Cook v. Pennsylvania, 97 U. S. 566 (1878), which invalidated a tax on the sale of goods by auction that discriminated against foreign goods.
