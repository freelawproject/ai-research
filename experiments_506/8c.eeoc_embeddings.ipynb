Talley v. Stephens, 247 F.Supp. 683 (E.D.Ark.1965). Chief Judge Henley in Talley granted, in\\npart by consent, a substantial measure of relief, including restraint against forcing prisoners to work beyond their\\nphysical capabilities, against the withholding of reasonable medical attention, against the infliction of corporal\\npunishment until \\\"appropriate safeguards\\\" were established, and against reprisals for seeking access to the\\ncourts. Neither side appealed.\\nThe present cases were filed in the Eastern District of Arkansas and were assigned respectively to Judge Young\\nand Judge Harris. Upon agreement, the judges consolidated the three actions and, as a panel of two, jointly\\nheard and decided them. After a full hearing, the court granted relief against \\\"[t]he use of any such devices as the\\ncrank telephone or teeter board\\\" and against \\\"[t]he application of any whipping to the bare skin of prisoners.\\\" It\\nalso restrained the use of the strap \\\"until additional rules and regulations are promulgated with appropriate\\nsafeguards * * *\\\" Jackson v. Bishop, 268 F. Supp. 804, 816 (E.D.Ark.1967).\\nThe use of the strap, therefore, as in the Talley case, was not totally renstrained. Because it was not, the plaintiffs\\nappeal and seek here to remove that vestige. The defendant Superintendent has taken no cross appeal. Thus,\\nthe relief granted in the district court remains effective and is not in issue before us.\\n\\nWe conclude that the plaintiffs are correct in their position and that Arkansas' use of the strap, irrespective of\\nsafeguards, is to be enjoined.\\n573 These actions were instituted in 1966 by handwritten petitions employing varying titles.[2] Each plaintiff asked \\n*573 for the appointment of counsel and permission to proceed in forma pauperis. Those requests were granted.\\nAppointed counsel then filed amended complaints which have been treated by all concerned as petitions for\\ninjunctive relief under the civil rights statutes, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1343(3) and (4). We are satisfied\\nas to jurisdiction. We are also satisfied, as were the district judges, that the cases are appropriately to be\\nregarded as class actions within the scope and reach of Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P.\\nWe initially commend Edward L. Wright of Little Rock and William S. Arnold of Crossett, court-appointed counsel\\nfor the plaintiffs, and Don Langston, who argued the cases for the defendant, for their candid, unemotional and\\nfair and able presentations. The services rendered by Mr. Wright and Mr. Arnold, and the expenses they have\\nincurred, were without anticipation of reimbursement.\\nAlthough we are advised that a substantial percentage of the Arkansas prison population is black, the three\\nplaintiffs, the prison officials concerned, and the witnesses are all white. No issue of race, as such, is present.\\n[3]\\nThe facts, at this stage of the litigation, are in no real dispute.  Anyone interested in all the details may refer to\\nthe facts recited by Chief Judge Henley in his opinion in Talley v. Stephens, supra, and to those set forth in the\\nopinion of the district judges in this case. We regard the following history and facts as particularly pertinent for our\\nreview:\\n1. The Arkansas penal institutions are under the general supervision of a five-man \\\"honorary\\\" commission known\\nas the State Penitentiary Board. Ark. Stat.Ann. \\u00a7\\u00a7 7-201(6) and 7-202 and \\u00a7 46-101. Actual day-to-day\\nsupervision is delegated by the Board to a full-time compensated superintendent. \\u00a7\\u00a7 46-104 and 46-104.1. The\\nBoard also serves as a board of pardons and paroles and meets monthly. \\u00a7 43-2801.\\n2. The State's penitentiary system contains two farm units. Cummins Farm, near Grady, Arkansas, has 15,500\\nacres and over 1,600 inmates. Tucker Farm, near Tucker, Arkansas, has about 4,500 acres and approximately\\n250 inmates. The Superintendent resides at Cummins. An assistant superintendent is at Tucker. The units are\\nabout 50 miles apart.\\n3. The Board has the duty to publish and appropriately post all rules and regulations it promulgates with respect\\nto prisoner conduct. \\u00a7 46-132. The Superintendent has \\\"general supervision and control of\\\" and is \\\"solely\\nresponsible for, the discipline, management, and control\\\" of all inmates. \\u00a7 46-133.\\n4. The Superintendent, by statute, is authorized to use trusties as guards. \\u00a7 46-122. In fact, trusties are used at\\nCummins and Tucker in supervisory and overseeing capacities in the barracks and fields and as guards. Trusties\\nare selected by the Superintendent or his assistant. There are also supervisory wardens at both units.\\n5. The primary activity of inmates is agricultural work with row crops and garden produce. However, a dairy herd\\nand a beef herd are also maintained. The system is virtually self-sustaining so far as food is concerned.\\n6. The Board, by statute, \\u00a7 46-158, has the duty to prescribe the mode and extent of punishments for violation of\\nprison rules. One who inflicts, or causes to be inflicted, punishment more severe than is prescribed by the Board\\nis guilty of a felony. Section 46-158, however, does not itself specify the type of punishment which may be\\nimposed.\\n574 *574 7. Corporal punishment in the Arkansas system was authorized formally only in 1962 but evidently it had\\nbeen employed for many years. At that time the Board, by resolution, authorized such punishment whenever, in\\nthe Superintendent's judgment, its infliction was necessary in order to maintain discipline. The resolution did not\\nprescribe form or limit of punishment.\\n8. In the Talley action, the three petitioning inmates sought injunctive relief with respect to certain prison practices\\nincluding the infliction of corporal punishment. The respondent there, a predecessor superintendent, consented to\\n\\nthe granting of relief with respect to work requirements beyond a prisoner's physical capability and with respect to\\nreasonable medical attention. 247 F. Supp. at 687. Chief Judge Henley found that, at that time, there were no\\nwritten rules as to whipping; that such punishment was administered in the sole discretion of the one inflicting it,\\nsubject to an informal requirement that the blows not exceed ten for a single offense; and that two of those three\\npetitioners had been whipped and one beaten by a field-line supervisor-trusty. The judge noted that the Supreme\\nCourt of Arkansas, over 80 years ago, deplored the whipping of convicts, Werner v. State, 44 Ark. 122 (1884),\\nand that the Arkansas statutes do not themselves specifically prescribe whipping even as a punishment for crime.\\n[4]\\n He observed, however, that corporal punishment had not been viewed historically as a constitutionally\\nforbidden cruel and unusual punishment. The court concluded that it was not prepared to say that such\\npunishment was unconstitutional per se. Nevertheless, Judge Henley said, 247 F.Supp. at 689, this conclusion\\npresupposes that the infliction of such punishment is surrounded by appropriate safeguards, that is, it must not\\nbe excessive, it must be inflicted dispassionately and by responsible people, and it must be applied under\\nrecognizable standards so that the convict knows what conduct will cause him to be whipped and how much\\npunishment his conduct will produce. The court found that those safeguards did not exist in the Arkansas system\\nand enjoined further corporal punishment of the petitioners until they were established.\\n9. The Talley opinion was filed on November 15, 1965. As a result, the Board issued written rules and regulations\\non January 10, 1966. These were in effect until the district court decision in the present case was rendered June\\n3, 1967. In addition to a number of other provisions, the rules state that certain \\\"major offenses will warrant\\ncorporal punishment.\\\" The ones listed are homosexuality, agitation, insubordination, making or concealing\\nweapons, refusal to work when medically certified able to work, and participating in or inciting a riot. They further\\nstate:\\nNo inmate shall ever be authorized to inflict any corporal punishment under color of prison\\nauthority on another inmate.\\nPunishment shall not, in any case, exceed Ten lashes with the strap, the number of lashes to be\\nadministered shall be determined by a Board of inquiry, consisting of at least two officials of the\\nArkansas State Penitentiary, The Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent, and the head\\nWarden or an associate Warden. The Board of Inquiry will request that the accused inmate appear\\nbefore the Board and speak in his own behalf. No Punishment will be administered in the field.\\n10. The straps used in Arkansas vary somewhat but all are similar. Each is of leather and from 3\\u00bd to 5\\u00bd feet in\\nlength, about 4 inches wide, and \\u00bc inch thick. Each has a wooden handle 8 to 12 inches long.\\n11. Since Talley, whippings are administered by wardens. The prisoner lies face down and the blows are to his\\n575 buttocks. Supposedly, they are administered *575 while the prisoner is fully clothed. Petitioners Ernst and Mask,\\nhowever, testified without contradiction that they were required to lower their trousers and that they received\\nlashes on the bare buttocks. There is corroborating and other evidence to the same effect with respect to other\\ninmates and there was proof, some offered through the State Police, of deep bruises and bleeding.\\n12. Whipping is the primary disciplinary measure used in the Arkansas system. Prisioners there have few\\nprivileges which can be withheld from them as punishment. Facilities for segregation and solitary confinement are\\nlimited.\\n13. There is testimony that the strap hurts the inmate's pride, that it has been needed in order to preserve\\ndiscipline, and that the work level improves after its administration. Contrarily, there is testimony that the whipping\\ngenerates hate in the inmate who is whipped and that this hate flows toward the whipper, the institution and the\\nsystem.\\n14. The circumstances relative to the punishment administered to the plaintiffs as well as to others and relative to\\nvarious disciplinary matters are set forth in detail in the district court's opinion. 268 F.Supp. at 809-813. The\\ntestimony of James V. Bennett, former Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and that of Fred T. Wilkinson,\\nDirector of the Department of Corrections of the State of Missouri (and former Deputy Director of the Federal\\nBureau of Prisons) are summarized in the district court's opinion. 268 F.Supp. at 813-814. This testimony is to the\\neffect that, among other things, corporal punishment has not been used for disciplinary purposes in federal\\n\\nprisons for years and that only Mississippi, in addition to Arkansas, uses it officially. Testifying as a penologist, it\\nwas Mr. Bennett's opinion that the whippings administered to the three plaintiffs were \\\"cruel, degrading and\\ncertainly they were unusual in this day and age.\\\" Mr. Wilkinson testified that use of the strap \\\"is cruel and unusual\\nand unnecessary.\\\"\\n15. On July 20, 1966, six months after the issuance of the January 1966 regulations, plaintiff Ernst received two\\nwhippings of ten lashes each to the bare buttocks within a period of 45 minutes.\\n16. In August 1966 the Superintendent became aware of irregularities. An investigation disclosed violations of\\nserious import. A number of wardens resigned or were discharged. The plaintiffs' cases were filed while this\\ninvestigation was under way. The present Superintendent candidly does not seek to defend everything which has\\ntaken place.\\n17. The district judges concluded that the post-Talley rules and regulations of January 1966 still did not provide\\nadequate safeguards. The use of the strap was therefore enjoined until further safeguards were provided. The\\ncourt observed that more than one person's judgment should be required for a decision to administer corporal\\n[5]\\npunishment.\\n576 *576 So much for the facts. Certain legal principles, which have general application here, are well established\\nand admit of no real controversy:\\n1. Lawful incarceration may properly operate to deprive the convict of certain rights which would otherwise be his\\nto enjoy. Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948). A classic example is\\nArkansas' denial to the felon of the right to vote. Ark.Const. art. 3, \\u00a7 1 (as amended by Amendment No. 8); Ark.\\nStat.Ann. \\u00a7 3-101 (Repl.1956); City of Newport v. Smith, 236 Ark. 626, 367 S.W.2d 742 (1963). Other states do\\nthe same. See, for instance, N.D.Const. art. V, \\u00a7 127, N.D.Cent.Code \\u00a7 16-01-04 (1960), and State ex rel. Olson\\nv. Langer, 65 N.D. 68, 256 N.W. 377 (1934); Mo. Const. art. VIII \\u00a7 2, VAMS \\u00a7 111.060 (1966), and State ex rel.\\nBarrett v. Sartorious, 351 Mo. 1237, 175 S.W.2d 787, 789-790, 149 A.L.R. 1067 (1943); Minn.Const. art. 7, \\u00a7 2.\\n2. The only federal restraint to state action of this kind lies in the Constitution and in the statutes in enforcement\\nthereof, specifically, the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection and due process clauses, and the Fifteenth\\nAmendment's proscription of the denial to citizens of the United States of the right to vote \\\"on account of race,\\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.\\\" Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 647, 86 S.Ct. 1717, 16 L.Ed.2d\\n828 (1966); Harper v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 665, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966); \\nCarrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 775, 13 L. Ed.2d 675 (1965); State ex rel. Olson v. Langer, supra,\\n256 N.W. at 385-386. But previous criminal record has been referred to as among the \\\"obvious examples\\nindicating factors which a State may take into consideration in determining the qualifications of voters.\\\" Lassiter v.\\nNorthampton County Bd. of Elections, 360 U.S. 45, 51, 79 S.Ct. 985, 990, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1959); Davis v.\\nBeason, 133 U.S. 333, 346-347, 10 S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637 (1890).\\n3. On the other hand, a prisoner of the state does not lose all his civil rights during and because of his\\nincarceration. In particular, he continues to be protected by the due process and equal protection clauses which\\nfollow him through the prison doors. Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L. Ed.2d 1030 (1964); Ex\\nparte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034 (1941).\\n4. Despite earlier comments to the contrary, see, for example, In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 446, 10 S.Ct. 930,\\n34 L.Ed. 519 (1890); O'Neil v. Vermont, 144 U.S. 323, 332, 12 S.Ct. 693, 36 L.Ed. 450 (1892); and Collins v.\\nJohnston, 237 U.S. 502, 510-511, 35 S.Ct. 649, 59 L.Ed. 1071 (1915), the Eighth Amendment's guarantee\\nagainst the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments seems now to have come to be regarded as directly\\napplicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Robinson v. California,\\n370 U.S. 660, 666, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962), and Mr. Justice Douglas in concurrence at 675, 82 S.Ct.\\n1417; Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 522 (2 Cir. 1967). See State of La. ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S.\\n459, 463, 67 S.Ct. 374, 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947) and Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 531-532, 88 S.Ct. 2145, 20\\nL.Ed.2d 1254 (1968).\\n577\\n\\n*577 5. The federal courts, including this one, entertain a natural reluctance to interfere with a prison's internal\\ndiscipline. This is true with respect to federal institutions, Glenn v. Ciccone, 370 F.2d 361, 363 (8 Cir. 1966); \\nSutton v. Settle, 302 F.2d 286, 288 (8 Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 930, 83 S.Ct. 876, 9 L.Ed.2d 734; Garcia\\nv. Steele, 193 F.2d 276, 278 (8 Cir. 1951), see Holland v. Ciccone, 386 F.2d 825 (8 Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390\\nU.S. 1045, 88 S.Ct. 1646, 20 L.Ed.2d 307, as well as to state prisons, Douglas v. Sigler, 386 F.2d 684, 688 (8 Cir.\\n1967); Lee v. Tahash, 352 F. 2d 970, 971 (8 Cir. 1965); Wright v. McMann, supra, 387 F.2d at 522.\\n6. However, the courts, including this one, have not hesitated to entertain petitions asserting violations of\\nfundamental rights and, where indicated, to grant relief. In Glenn v. Ciccone, which we have just cited, this court\\nclearly indicated that \\\"a factual showing of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment\\\"\\nwould support interference by a federal court. 370 F. 2d at 363. We have made a like statement in many other\\ncases. Carey v. Settle, 351 F.2d 483, 485 (8 Cir. 1965); Haynes v. Harris, 344 F.2d 463, 466 (8 Cir. 1965); Harris\\nv. Settle, 322 F.2d 908, 910 (8 Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 910, 84 S.Ct. 1171, 12 L.Ed.2d 179. Although\\nthe Eighth Circuit cases just cited concern a federal institution, the principle, of course, has equal application to a\\nstate penitentiary. Wright v. McMann, supra, 387 F.2d at 522; Howard v. Smyth, 365 F.2d 428 (4 Cir. 1966), cert.\\ndenied, 385 U.S. 988, 87 S.Ct. 599, 17 L.Ed.2d 449.\\nThis takes us then to a consideration of the meaning and scope of the Eighth Amendment's proscription of the\\ninfliction of \\\"cruel and unusual punishments.\\\" The phrase appeared in the English Bill of Rights of December 16,\\n1689, 1 W. and M. s.2, c.2 but seems to have had still earlier antecedents in Magna Charta and elsewhere. IV\\nBlackstone, Commentaries, 379.\\nThe Supreme Court long ago acknowledged, \\\"Difficulty would attend the effort to define with exactness the extent\\nof the constitutional provision which provides that cruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted * * *.\\\" \\nWilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130, 135-136, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1878). This difficulty, and the absence of an exact or\\nexhaustive definition of the Amendment's ban, has been repeatedly noted. In re Kemmler, supra, 136 U.S. at 447,\\n10 S.Ct. 930; Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 368-371, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910); Trop v. Dulles,\\n356 U.S. 86, 87, 99, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958).\\nThere are, however, indications, by specific holdings and other observations, which bear upon the extent and\\nreach of the Eighth Amendment's proscription. Thus in Wilkerson v. Utah, execution by public shooting, and in In\\nre Kemmler, execution by electrocution, were classified as outside the ban. But in Wilkerson, 99 U.S. at 136, the\\nCourt observed \\\"it is safe to affirm that punishments of torture * * * and all others in the same line of unnecessary\\ncruelty, are forbidden * * *\\\" In Kemmler, 136 U.S. at 446-447, 10 S.Ct. at 933, the Court describes, as within the\\nconstitutional prohibition, punishments which are \\\"manifestly cruel and unusual, as burning at the stake,\\ncrucifixion, breaking on the wheel, or the like\\\" and, as cruel, those which \\\"involve torture or a lingering death.\\\"\\nAnd it said that the word \\\"cruel,\\\" as used in the Eighth Amendment, \\\"implies there something inhuman and\\nbarbarous, 00 something more than the mere extinguishment of life.\\\" 136 U.S. at 447, 10 S.Ct. at 933. In O'Neil v.\\n97\\nVermont, supra, 144 U.S. at 339-340, and 364, 12 S.Ct. 693, Mr. Justice Field, in dissent (joined by Justices\\nHarlan and Brewer, 144 U.S. at 370-371, 12 S.Ct. 693), advanced the thought that the Amendment's \\\"inhibition is\\ndirected, not only against punishments of the character mentioned, but against all punishments which by their\\n578 excessive length or severity are greatly disproportioned to the offenses *578 charged.\\\" He went on to say that\\nalthough a state has the power to whip for petty offenses, \\\"repulsive as such mode of punishment is,\\\" the\\nincrease of such punishment by accumulation for multiple offenses could be both unusual and cruel. 144 U.S. at\\n340, 12 S.Ct. at 699.\\nIn Weems v. United States, supra, the Court observed, 217 U.S. at 373, 30 S. Ct. at 551, that \\\"a principle, to be\\nvital, must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true of\\nconstitutions.\\\" The majority condemned a Philippine statute on the ground that the disparity between the\\npunishment it imposed (cadena temporal for 15 years, that is, among other things, \\\"hard and painful labor,\\\" with a\\nchain at the ankle, hanging from the wrists, and with outside assistance denied) for a false entry in a public\\nrecord and that imposed for more serious crimes made it repugnant to the Philippine Bill of Rights forbidding\\ncruel and unusual punishment.\\nIn State of La. ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, supra, 329 U.S. at 463, 67 S.Ct. at 376, the Court spoke of the\\n\\\"traditional humanity of modern Anglo-American law\\\" and \\\"unnecessary pain\\\" and the \\\"wanton infliction of pain,\\\"\\n\\nand the dissent referred, at page 473, 67 S. Ct. at 381, to that which \\\"shocks the most fundamental instincts of\\ncivilized man.\\\" Mr. Justice Douglas, concurring, in Robinson v. California, supra, 370 U.S. at 676, 82 S.Ct. at\\n1425, said, \\\"The Eighth Amendment expresses the revulsion of civilized man against barbarous acts 00 the `cry of\\n97\\nhorror' against man's inhumanity to his fellow man.\\\" In Rudolph v. Alabama, 375 U.S. 889, 84 S.Ct. 155, 11\\nL.Ed.2d 119 (1963), three dissenters to the denial of certiorari spoke of \\\"standards of decency more or less\\nuniversally accepted,\\\" of disproportion between offense and punishment, and of \\\"unnecessary cruelty.\\\" In Dyke v.\\nTaylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U.S. 216, 223, 88 S.Ct. 1472, 20 L.Ed.2d 538 (1968), Mr. Justice Douglas, in\\ndissent, referred to the historical fact (noted by Mr. Justice Harlan, in dissent, in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S.\\n145, 191-192, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491, 522 (1968)) that petty offenses once entailed whipping as\\npunishments, but said, \\\"I am loath to hold whippings * * * as `petty.'\\\"\\nThis court has added its word. It has described the situation where a court will interfere with prison discipline as\\none \\\"of such character or consequence as to shock general conscience or to be intolerable in fundamental\\nfairness, and so to amount to illegal administration of prison sentence.\\\" Carey v. Settle, supra, 351 F.2d at 485.\\nJudge Johnsen there went on to say that it is possible for the form or extent of institutional treatment to offend the\\nEighth Amendment. In a later case concerning a state prisoner, Judge Johnsen repeated these observations and\\nsaid,\\n\\\"Such treatment is entitled to be held to be within the ban of the Eighth Amendment as\\nrepresenting cruel and unusual punishment and so constituting unlawful administration of prison\\nsentence. It may be observed in this connection that penal admeasurements made by general\\nconscience and sense of fundamental fairness doubtless will not be without some relationship to\\nthe humane concepts and reactions of present-day social climate.\\\" Lee v. Tahash, supra, 352 F.2d\\nat 972.\\nThe principal opinion in Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed. 2d 630 (1958), although it\\ncommanded the votes of only four justices a decade ago, is, in our view, practicularly pertinent. The issue was\\nthe validity of a federal statute which would denationalize a native born citizen who deserts the military service in\\ntime of war and is convicted thereof by a court-martial and dismissed or dishonorably discharged. The opinion\\nprovides guidelines and overtones which we feel safe in regarding as illustrative of the general thinking of a\\nmajority of the justices on the subject today. The opinion casts aside the death penalty \\\"as an index of the\\n579 constitutional *579 limit on punishment,\\\" for it \\\"has been employed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is\\nstill widely accepted, it cannot be said to violate the constitutional concept of cruelty.\\\" 356 U.S. at 99, 78 S.Ct. at\\n597. The Eighth Amendment's basic concept \\\"is nothing less than the dignity of man\\\" and assures that a state's\\npunishment power \\\"be exercised within the limits of civilized standards.\\\" Fines, imprisonment, and even\\nexecution may be imposed \\\"but any technique outside the bounds of these traditional penalties is constitutionally\\nsuspect.\\\" 356 U.S. at 100, 78 S.Ct. at 598. The scope of the Amendment is not \\\"static.\\\" It \\\"must draw its meaning\\nfrom the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\\\" 356 U.S. at 102, 78 S.Ct.\\nat 598. Virtually all the world's civilized nations refuse to impose statelessness as punishment for crime. 356 U.S.\\nat 102, 78 S.Ct. at 598.\\nFrom that opinion we glean a recognition of, and a reliance in part upon, attitudes of contemporary society and\\ncomparative law. And the emphasis is on man's basic dignity, on civilized precepts, and on flexibility and\\nimprovement in standards of decency as society progresses and matures. Finally, it is \\\"any technique\\\" outside\\nthe traditional bounds which \\\"is constitutionally suspect.\\\"\\nIn summary, then, so far as the Supreme Court cases are concerned, we have a flat recognition that the limits of\\nthe Eighth Amendment's proscription are not easily or exactly defined, and we also have clear indications that the\\napplicable standards are flexible, that disproportion, both among punishments and between punishment and\\ncrime, is a factor to be considered, and that broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity,\\nand decency are useful and usable. We recognize that some of these utterances by the Court were made in\\nconcurrence or dissent or in the approach, evidently now superseded, through the Fourteenth Amendment's due\\nprocess clause rather than jointly through the Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments. All this, however, strikes us as\\nof no import because we read and ascertain in the totality of the language used the basic attitude of the entire\\nCourt to the Eighth Amendment.\\n\\nWith these principles and guidelines before us, we have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the use of the\\nstrap in the penitentiaries of Arkansas is punishment which, in this last third of the 20th century, runs afoul of the\\nEighth Amendment; that the strap's use, irrespective of any precautionary conditions which may be imposed,\\noffends contemporary concepts of decency and human dignity and precepts of civilization which we profess to\\npossess; and that it also violates those standards of good conscience and fundamental fairness enunciated by\\nthis court in the Carey and Lee cases.\\nOur reasons for this conclusion include the following: (1) We are not convinced that any rule or regulation as to\\nthe use of the strap, however seriously or sincerely conceived and drawn, will successfully prevent abuse. The\\npresent record discloses misinterpretation and obvious overnarrow interpretation even of the newly adopted\\nJanuary 1966 rules. (2) Rules in this area seem often to go unobserved. Despite the January 1966 requirement\\nthat no inmate was to inflict punishment on another, the record is replete with instances where this very thing took\\nplace. (3) Regulations are easily circumvented. Although it was a long-standing requirement that a whipping was\\nto be administered only when the prisoner was fully clothed, this record discloses instances of whippings upon\\nthe bare buttocks, and with consequent injury. (4) Corporal punishment is easily subject to abuse in the hands of\\nthe sadistic and the unscrupulous. (5) Where power to punish is granted to persons in lower levels of\\nadministrative authority, there is an inherent and natural difficulty in enforcing the limitations of that power. (6)\\nThere can be no argument that excessive whipping or an inappropriate manner of whipping or too great\\n580 frequency of whipping or the *580 use of studded or overlong straps all constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\\nBut if whipping were to be authorized, how does one, or any court, ascertain the point which would distinguish the\\npermissible from that which is cruel and unusual? (7) Corporal punishment generates hate toward the keepers\\nwho punish and toward the system which permits it. It is degrading to the punisher and to the punished alike. It\\nfrustrates correctional and rehabilitative goals. This record cries out with testimony to this effect from the expert\\npenologists, from the inmates and from their keepers. (8) Whipping creates other penological problems and\\nmakes adjustment to society more difficult. (9) Public opinion is obviously adverse. Counsel concede that only\\ntwo states still permit the use of the strap. Thus almost uniformly has it been abolished. It has been expressly\\noutlawed by statute in a number of states.

See Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S. at 100 n. 32, 78 S.Ct. 590. We would not wish to place\\nourselves in the position of condoning punishment which is shown to be only \\\"cruel\\\" but not \\\"unusual\\\" or vice\\nversa. In any event, the testimony of the two expert penologists clearly demonstrates that the use of the strap in\\nthis day is unusual and we encounter no difficulty in holding that its use is cruel.\\nNeither do we wish to draw, in this context, any meaningful distinction between punishment by way of sentence\\n581 statutorily prescribed and punishment *581 imposed for prison disciplinary purposes. It seems to us that the\\nEighth Amendment's proscription has application to both.\\nThe district court's decree is vacated and the case is remanded with directions to enter a new decree embracing\\nthe injunctive relief heretofore granted but, in addition, restraining the Superintendent of the Arkansas State\\nPenitentiary and all personnel of the penitentiary system from inflicting corporal punishment, including the use of\\nthe strap, as a disciplinary measure.\\n[1] Plaintiff Jackson is presently on parole.\\n[2] Jackson (\\\"Petition for a writ of habeas corpus\\\"); Ernst (\\\"Petition for writ of mandamus\\\"); Mask (\\\"Motion and\\npetition for physical examination * * * also a federal restraining order * * *\\\").

These list the major offenses which \\\"will warrant punishment.\\\" They recite that no\\ninmate shall ever be authorized to inflict corporal punishment on another. Before punishment is imposed, a full\\nhearing before a Board of Inquiry is required. The accusing warden may not sit on the Board of Inquiry or take\\npart in carrying out the punishment. Punishment may include solitary confinement, reduction of rations, corporal\\npunishment, loss of mail, recreation and other privileges, loss of future good time, and recording the offense for\\nparole purposes. Corporal punishment shall not exceed ten lashes with the strap and a period in solitary\\nconfinement. In no case may the strap be applied to the bare buttocks. An accuser or other inmate shall not\\nadminister the strap. The strap shall not be used in the fields. No inmate shall be whipped within 24 hours of any\\npreceding whipping. Each inmate sentenced to corporal punishment has the right of appeal to the superintendent\\nor the assistant superintendent and this official or his designee may change the sentence. It is stated that\\ncorporal punishment is not deemed necessary at Tucker because the inmates are youthful first offenders. \\nWe were also advised that at a meeting of the Board held February 29, 1968, with all members in attendance, a\\nresolution was adopted that corporal punishment in any form \\\"be abolished as a means of discipline in the\\ninstitution.\\\"\\nThese changes, of course, do not render the present appeal moot.

YOUNG, District Judges.\\nThese are suits in equity brought under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 by three inmates of the Arkansas State Penitentiary\\nagainst O. E. Bishop, Superintendent of the Penitentiary. The cases first became known to the court through\\nhandwritten petitions filed by each of the prisoners seeking various forms of relief. The court allowed the petitions\\nto be filed in forma pauperis and treated each one as a complaint for equitable relief under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983.\\nCounsel was appointed for the prisoners, and after investigation an amended complaint was filed seeking an\\ninjunctive relief and making the cases class actions. Although one of the cases was assigned to Judge Harris and\\nthe other two to Judge Young, they were consolidated for trial due to the similarity of the issues presented, and\\nboth judges sat as a panel of two for the trial.\\nThe plaintiffs make several alternative claims or contentions for themselves and other prison inmates:\\nFirst, they contend that the infliction of corporal punishment in any form constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\\ncontrary to the prohibitions of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as made applicable by the\\nFourteenth Amendment to the States.\\nSecondly and alternatively, they contend that the use of the strap or \\\"hide\\\" as a means of punishing inmates in\\nthe Penitentiary under any circumstances is cruel and unusual so as to be unconstitutional.\\nThirdly, they contend that the imposition of administrative rules or regulations concerning the use of the strap\\ndoes not make it a constitutionally permissible method of prison discipline.\\nPlaintiffs' fourth contention is actually twofold: (1) they claim that the rules concerning corporal punishment\\nadopted by the Arkansas State Penitentiary Board do not adequately protect the prisoners from unconstitutional\\n[1]\\ntreatment nor do they conform to the requirements that this court set out in the Talley  decision; and (2) the\\nrules which have been promulgated by the Prison Board have been violated in the administration of corporal\\npunishment upon the inmates.\\n\\nFinally, each of the plaintiffs contends that although he has some physical impairment which would prevent him\\nfrom doing the work of an average man, he nevertheless is classified as \\\"average\\\" for prison work purposes, is\\nrequired to perform difficult physical labor, and is whipped when he fails to perform. Each claims that this is\\ncontrary to his constitutional right to due process and equal protection of the law and that it is also\\nunconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.\\nThe defendant denies that corporal punishment per se or use of the strap as carried out by prison officials is cruel\\nand unusual in the constitutional sense. He relies primarily upon this court's earlier decision in the Talley case\\nand upon the rules and regulations adopted by the Penitentiary Board pursuant to that decision. He admits that\\ncertain rule violations and other unlawful acts occurred at the Penitentiary but claims that these matters have\\nbeen remedied by administrative action. Defendant denies that any injunctive relief for these plaintiffs or anyone\\nin their class is necessary or justified.\\nThe court appointed Edward L. Wright of Little Rock and William S. Arnold of Crossett, both highly respected and\\n807 experienced members of the Arkansas Bar, to represent the plaintiffs without *807 charge. They have done so\\nmost capably, and the court thanks them for their services.\\nThat the court has jurisdiction and that these are proper cases to be brought under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 is not\\nquestioned by either party. These matters are fully discussed in the Talley decision supra at 686. However, at the\\noutset we want to point out that the court is especially conscious of the limitations of its function in cases of this\\nkind.\\nIt is well settled that the administration of state prison discipline is the primary responsibility of state officials, and\\nfederal courts have an extremely limited area in which they may act pertaining to the treatment of prisoners\\nconfined to state penal institutions. State officials must of necessity have wide discretion and control over\\ndisciplinary measures in order to properly maintain the prison system as well as to protect the public. Wright v.\\nMcMann, 257 F.Supp. 739 (D.C.N.Y.1966). United States ex rel. Atterbury v. Ragen, 237 F. 2d 953 (7 Cir. 1956). \\nTalley v. Stephens, supra (and cases cited therein). Therefore this court cannot and will not become appellate in\\nnature and review each prison administration decision to punish a prisoner.\\nHowever, it is equally well settled that there are exceptions to these rules when special circumstances exist and\\nconstitutional rights are involved. See Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030; Childs v.\\nPegelow, 321 F. 2d 487 (4 Cir. 1963); Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034; Talley v.\\nStephens, supra.\\nAs was said in Talley, page 686 of 247 F.Supp., \\\"Although persons convicted of crimes lose many of the rights\\nand privileges of law abiding citizens, it is established by now that they do not lose all of their civil rights, and that\\nthe Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment follow them into the prison * * *\\\"\\nWe feel that the complaints in these cases raise several constitutional questions which merit the court's attention.\\nIn order to understand the issues in their proper perspective, it is necessary to set out some of the facts about,\\nand the recent history of the Arkansas State Penitentiary.\\nThe Arkansas Penitentiary System is under the general supervision of a fiveman honorary commission known as\\nthe State Penitentiary Board but actual supervision is by them delegated to a Superintendent.\\nThe plant of the System consists of two farms. One is known as Cummins Farm and contains approximately\\n15,500 acres, with 8,200 acres being under cultivation. Cummins Farm is located near Grady, Arkansas, and\\nnormally houses approximately 1,600 inmates; Superintendent O. E. Bishop resides at Cummins Farm. The other\\nfarm is known as Tucker Farm and contains approximately 4,500 acres, with approximately 3,000 acres being\\nunder cultivation. Tucker Farm is situated at Tucker, Arkansas, and normally houses approximately 275 inmates.\\nCummins Farm and Tucker Farm are approximately fifty miles apart by highway.\\nPersonnel, other than inmates under sentence, at Cummins Farm consists of the Superintendent and 25 paid\\nemployees, with 20 being supervision wardens; and at Tucker Farm consists of an assistant superintendent and\\nfive paid employees, but only three supervision wardens. Customarily both farms make use of inmates, called\\n\\ntrusties, in supervisory and overseeing capacities in the fields, in the barracks, and as security guards. The\\nprimary activity of inmates at both farms is agricultural work with row crops and garden type produce being\\nplanted, cultivated and harvested principally by hand labor. A dairy herd and a beef herd are also maintained for\\n[2]\\nfood.\\n808 *808 In the fall of 1965 certain irregularities at the Penitentiary were brought to the court's attention by three\\ninmates who filed suits similar to the ones now before the court. This court, with Judge Henley presiding, heard\\nthose cases and rendered its decision in November 1965. Talley v. Stephens, supra. The chief contention of the\\nplaintiffs in those cases was that the use of corporal punishment at the Arkansas State Penitentiary for\\ndisciplinary purposes was cruel and unusual and violative of the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs.\\nThe court found that it could not say that corporal punishment per se was unconstitutional. It went on to say:\\n\\\"But, the Court's unwillingness to say that the Constitution forbids the imposition of any and all\\ncorporal punishment on convicts presupposes that its infliction is surrounded by appropriate\\nsafeguards. It must not be excessive; it must be inflicted as dispassionately as possible and by\\nresponsible people; and it must be applied in reference to recognizable standards whereby a\\nconvict may know what conduct on his part will cause him to be whipped and how much\\npunishment given conduct may produce.\\\"\\nShortly after this decision, the Superintendent of the Penitentiary resigned; and on January 1, 1966, Mr. O. E.\\nBishop, the present Superintendent, was appointed. On January 10, 1966, the Penitentiary Board through Mr.\\nBishop promulgated a set of rules and regulations for the Penitentiary which include, inter alia, the following rules\\nsetting forth the offenses which merit corporal punishment as well as the procedures to be followed in\\nadministering such punishment.\\n\\\"OFFENSES AND PUNISHMENT:\\n\\\"A great part of your time here will be spent in the barracks you are assigned to. Barracks rules\\nand procedure will be posted in the barracks. Your conduct, personal cleanliness and attitude\\nwhile in the barracks is an important part of your prison record. \\\"These major offenses will warrant\\ncorporal punishment:\\\"\\n(1) Homosexuality.\\n(2) Agitation (defined as one who creates turmoil and disturbances).\\n(3) Insubordination (resisting authority or refusing to obey orders).\\n(4) Making or concealing of weapons.\\n(5) Refusal to work when medically certified able to work.\\n(6) Participating in or inciting a riot.\\n\\\"(7) No inmate shall ever be authorized to inflict any corporal punishment under color of prison\\nauthority on another inmate.\\n\\\"Punishment shall not, in any case, exceed Ten lashes with the strap, the number of lashes to be\\nadministered shall be determined by a Board of inquiry, consisting of at least two officials of the\\nArkansas State Penitentiary, The Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent, and the head\\nWarden or an associate Warden. The Board of Inquiry will request that the accused inmate appear\\nbefore the Board and speak in his own behalf. No Punishment will be administered in the field.\\\"\\n(Although these rules were adopted as a result of the Talley case, they were never approved by\\nthe court.)\\nEach inmate, as well as the employees of the Penitentiary, was given a copy of the rules and was instructed to\\nbecome familiar with and understand each of them. New prisoners were similarly instructed.\\n\\nIn August of 1966 Superintendent Bishop became aware of irregularities at the Tucker Prison Farm and\\nrequested that the Criminal Investigation Division of the Arkansas State Police conduct an investigation. The\\ninvestigation disclosed rank violations of the rules by certain of the Prison officials. Shortly thereafter all of the\\nwardens at Tucker Farm were discharged or allowed to resign. Since that time there have been three new\\n809 assistant superintendents in *809 charge of Tucker Farm in quick succession, as well as other personnel\\nchanges.\\nSubsequently the Arkansas Legislature through a special commission, as well as the Penitentiary Board,\\nconducted various investigations of the penal system. As a result, many desirable changes have been brought\\nabout in the administration of the two farms.\\nThese cases were filed in the fall of 1966 and it was during their preparation for trial that the aforementioned\\ninvestigations were taking place. Therefore, by the time of the trial many of the activities complained of had\\nceased and many of the individuals involved no longer were employed by the Penitentiary.\\nThe trial of these cases lasted some three days, in which the court heard testimony from fifteen prisoners, several\\nmembers and ex-members of the Prison personnel, one doctor, and two expert penologists. Some of the\\ntestimony pertained to strappings and other whippings which took place prior to the Talley decision in 1965. The\\ncourt ruled that this testimony would be admitted only for the purpose of showing the background or history and\\nwould not be relevant to the type of punishment used in the Prison system since the changes brought about by\\nthe Talley decision, or more particularly since the rules were promulgated in January of 1966.\\nThe strap which is referred to throughout this opinion is made of leather and is between four and five feet long\\nand four inches wide. This leather is bradded to a wooden handle approximately six inches in length. The strap is\\nabout one-fourth inch thick at the end attached to the wooden handle and is gradually tapered toward the end\\nwhich comes in contact with the person being whipped. The evidence showed that there is more than one strap\\nused at the Penitentiary but all are of approximately the same construction. Some of these straps are depicted in\\nplaintiffs' exhibit No. 4.\\nEvidence relating to the petitioners herein.\\nThe evidence showed that the plaintiff Jackson, age 28, entered the prison in 1963 to serve a five year sentence\\nfor burglary. Jackson testified to having been subjected to physical beatings three times since he has been in\\n[3]\\nprison. First, in 1965, James Pike, a trusty and long line rider,  (an escapee at the time of this trial) hit him\\nseveral times with his fist, as well as kicking him two or three times. The testimony was unclear as to what the\\n[4]\\npurpose of this whipping was. In November of 1965 Jackson was whipped with the strap by Captain  Harmon, a\\nfield warden at the Penitentiary, for not picking enough cotton. He has been whipped only once since the rules\\nwere promulgated in January 1966.\\nOn July 29, 1966, Jackson and seven other inmates received eight lashes with the strap for leaving okra in the\\nfield. Jackson testified that he was charged by the long line rider with overlooking okra and was taken by Captain\\nHarmon to the office of Clay Smith, Head Warden at Cummins Farm. In the process of conducting a hearing on\\nthe matter, Captain Smith informed the inmates of the charges against them and asked if each was familiar with\\nthe rules of the Penitentiary. He then asked if anyone would like to make a statement, and Jackson told Captain\\nSmith that he had picked all the okra he could see and that he was having eye problems and needed glasses.\\nCaptain Smith called for Jackson's medical record to determine the condition of Jackson's eyes. After checking\\nthese records and finding that Jackson had been certified as physically able for normal work, he then sentenced\\neach prisoner to receive eight lashes with the strap. These lashes were administered by Captain Dean, another\\n810 warden at the *810 Prison. Prisoners were required to lie face down on a concrete floor while Captain Dean\\nadministered the licks to the buttocks. Jackson testified that the whipping caused much pain and left his buttocks\\nbruised and sore for a number of days. The prisoners were returned to the field, where they continued to pick\\nokra for the rest of the day without incident.\\n\\nFurther evidence shows that at the time of the whipping Jackson had, and still has, a visual defect of the left eye.\\nThere is also a slight variance from normal vision in the right eye but this is within the normal vision for reading.\\nShortly after the whipping he was taken to the nearby city of Pine Bluff for an eye examination and the examining\\n[5]\\ndoctor did not recommend glasses for him.\\nPlaintiff Ernst is 24 years old and has been in the penitentiary (Tucker Farm) since January 19, 1963. He has\\nreceived seven whippings during his entire stay. The first three of these were administered before the rules were\\npromulgated. They involve charges of scuffling in the barracks, not working hard enough in the fields, and cursing\\na trusty guard.\\nIn January of 1966, shortly after the rules were promulgated, Ernst received ten lashes upon a charge of talking\\n[6]\\nback to an overseer known as a yardman.  He was called to Assistant Superintendent Bruton's office on the\\nmorning following the alleged offense and was told that he was charged with talking back to the yardman, was\\nrequired to lie face down on the floor, and receive ten licks with the strap. No other wardens or other prison\\nofficials were present during the charge or the whipping.\\nSometime later in 1966 he received ten licks from Captain Mayes for throwing his hat across the Prison yard. The\\nprisoners are told that they must wear their hats in the field and also that they must care for and not misuse the\\nclothing issued to them. Ernst testified that on this evening as he returned to the barracks from the field he took\\noff his hat and threw it across the Prison yard onto the ground. Upon seeing this, Captain Mayes called him over,\\ntook him into the barracks, made him lie down and gave him ten lashes with the strap. There were no other\\nwardens or other prison personnel present at this whipping.\\nOn July 20, 1966, plaintiff Ernst was picking cucumbers in the field and was charged by the long line rider with\\nnot working and leaving cucumbers on the vines. Ernst responded by saying that he was working the best he\\ncould on the food that was fed him and that he was feeling ill. The rider reported Ernst to Captain Mayes, who\\ntook him from the fields to the barracks and gave him ten lashes with the strap. This time Ernst was required to\\nlower his pants and was whipped on the bare buttocks, which he testified cut and bruised him and caused a great\\ndeal of pain. There was no hearing or formal charge and there were no other wardens present. Ernst was then\\nreturned to the field to continue his work. Some forty-five minutes or an hour later, the long line rider approached\\nErnst and started picking cucumbers back down the row upon which Ernst had just been working. He picked\\napproximately a half bushel of cucumbers from the area in which Ernst had been working since returning from the\\nfirst whipping. The rider again reported Ernst to Captain Mayes. Ernst was returned to the barracks and taken to\\nCaptain Bruton, who was shown the cucumbers and told what had happened. Captain Bruton instructed Captain\\nMayes to give Ernst ten lashes. He was again required to lower his pants and lie face down on the concrete floor\\n811 to receive the licks. Ernst testified that this whipping left large bruises and caused *811 him to bleed. Captain\\n[7]\\nBruton was present during this whipping and when it was over he ordered Ernst to stand on the \\\"teeter board\\\"\\ninside the barracks until he was told to get off. Ernst testified that he was required to remain on the teeter board\\nfor the rest of the day or about three or four hours. According to Ernst this treatment caused his legs and ankles\\nto swell and ache. He has not been whipped since that day.\\nPlaintiff Mask is twenty years old and has been in prison since November 12, 1965. He spent his first four and a\\nhalf months at the Cummins Farm and was then sent to Tucker and has been there since that time. He has\\nreceived five whippings with the strap since coming to Tucker. The first such whipping was in June of 1966, when\\nhe was charged by a long line rider with being the last in the field or working too slow and was taken to Captain\\nFletcher. Captain Fletcher administered ten licks. One week later he was reported leaving cucumbers in the field.\\nHe was taken to Captain Bruton, who told him to get his pants down and lie on the floor. Captain Fletcher gave\\nhim ten licks. Plaintiff testified that two months later he was caught putting rotten tomatoes in the box they were\\nusing to carry tomatoes from the field where they were being picked. Captain Bruton gave him nine licks for this\\noffense. In September of 1966 he was charged with not picking enough cotton. He testified that he had picked\\nninety pounds that day. He was taken to Captain Goodwin, the Assistant Superintendent at that time, who\\nsentenced him to six lashes which were administered by Captain Heston. On December 7, 1966, he and several\\nother inmates were charged with sitting down and smoking when they should have been picking cotton. He\\nreceived eight lashes for this offense and was put in an isolation cell for eight days. While plaintiff was in this cell,\\n\\nhe received regular meals, although he was denied his mail privileges and could not purchase anything from the\\ncommissary.\\nPlaintiff Mask also testified concerning an altercation between him and Captain Goodwin sometime in the last of\\nNovember 1966. Mask said that Captain Goodwin hit him on the chin and then had him brought into the office\\nwhere he was hit four or five times in the stomach and kicked once. Captain Goodwin testified that he had not hit\\nMask but merely grabbed him and shook him and pushed him in a corner. The testimony is not clear just why this\\naltercation arose; however, it appears it had something to do with Mask's attitude toward work and his work\\nperformance.\\nPlaintiff Mask also complained that his knee bothers him when he works for long periods of time. This causes him\\nnot to be able to do as much work as is required of him. His knee was injured in a tractor accident in 1960 to such\\nan extent that it required surgery to repair. There is some evidence that it might have been re-injured in 1964.\\nHowever, medical evidence was introduced to show that there were no significant residual effects of the earlier\\n[8]\\ninjury and also that there had been no recent re-injury.\\nThe court also heard testimony from twelve other inmates of the Arkansas State Penitentiary, most of which was\\ncumulative to that given by the three named plaintiffs as well as corroborating some of their testimony set out\\nabove. These prisoners related the facts surrounding whippings which the various prisoners had received for\\noffenses such as insufficient work, insubordination, and scuffling among prisoners. According to these witnesses,\\n812 some of *812 the whippings were administered without a formal hearing, also some hearings were conducted\\nwith only one warden present. The general pattern of these whippings as related by the prisoners is that a\\nprisoner is charged by a trusty or other inmate in the capacity of an overseer such as a long line rider or yardman\\nwith some infraction of the Penitentiary rules. He is taken to a warden. The warden then takes him before another\\nPenitentiary official and there charges him with a rule infraction. In most cases the prisoner is given a chance to\\nexplain his actions; then sentence is handed down. If the prisoner is found guilty and sentenced to a whipping, he\\nis required to lie face down on the floor and receive the lashes on his buttocks. The prisoners claim that the word\\nof the trusty or accusing warden is usually summarily accepted without further investigation or questioning.\\nThe prisoners also testified to certain beatings which inmates had received at the hands of trusties or other\\ninmates in positions of authority. These beatings seem to have no connection with the disciplining of the beaten\\nprisoners; however, testimony showed that yardmen, floorwalkers, and occasionally a night warden have seen\\nthese beatings and have not reported the inmates for fighting nor have they tried to interfere with the beatings.\\nMost of this type activity takes place at night in the barracks; however, there were a few instances in which one or\\ntwo blows were struck in the field.\\nInvestigator H. H. Atkinson of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Arkansas State Police testified as to the\\nfacts and circumstances of his investigation of the Tucker Prison Farm in August of 1966. Atkinson's investigation\\narose out of some alleged violations of the rules involving possession of liquor by some of the inmates. He\\ntestified that as his investigation progressed he and his men uncovered various acts of brutality and cruel\\ntreatment of the inmates by certain officials and trusties at Tucker Farm. Immediately upon report of his findings\\nto Superintendent Goodwin, all the wardens at Tucker Farm were discharged. Although new personnel was\\nappointed, Atkinson's investigation continued for some twenty-two days. He revealed that he had uncovered such\\ntorturous devices as a crank telephone device which was used to electrically shock prisoners, as well as use of\\nthe teeter board and strapping upon the bare buttocks. He testified that in the first part of his investigation he\\nwitnessed such a strapping of an inmate by Captain Mayes. He further testified that all persons responsible for\\nsuch treatment have been discharged.\\nHe was later placed in charge of Tucker Farm as Acting Assistant Superintendent during the administrative\\nchanges in December of 1966 and January of 1967. He said that he found it necessary to use the strap while he\\nwas in charge. He strapped four of twelve prisoners who had been sentenced by a three-man board of inquiry to\\nsix lashes because they had picked an insufficient amount of cotton. He was told later by the inmates that they\\nwere \\\"trying him to see if he would use the whip.\\\" He also said that he got better work from the prisoners after\\nthey found out he would use the strap.\\n\\nSuperintendent O. E. Bishop has been Superintendent for the Prison system since January 1, 1966. He testified\\nthat when the rules were promulgated he made every effort to make sure that each prisoner had a copy of the\\nrules and understood them. His efforts included reading the rules to the prisoners over a loud speaker system\\nand answering any questions they might have. He instructed all the personnel of the Prison that anyone who was\\nfound not following the rules would be fired immediately. He also told the trusties that they would be \\\"ranked\\\"\\n(lose their privileges as trusties) at the first violation of the rules. The evidence showed in fact that some trusties\\nhave been ranked and several wardens have been fired because of violations.\\n813 *813 He testified that he was not aware of the activities that had taken place at Tucker Farm prior to August of\\n1966 because his duties required him to spend the largest part of his time at Cummins Farm. He also said that\\nthe two farms were fifty miles apart and that he could not leave Cummins to go to Tucker without the wardens at\\nTucker knowing of his visit beforehand.\\nSuperintendent Bishop said that disciplinary methods other than the use of the strap are also used in the\\nPenitentiary system. These include loss of the few privileges which exist for the prisoners, administrative isolation\\nor solitary confinement, and removal from the plasma program, which is a means by which the prisoners earn\\nmoney. He said that often prisoners charged with violations of the rules were found not guilty and were not\\npunished. The evidence showed that substantial improvements have been made in the facilities and in the\\nadministrative procedure of the Penitentiary system since Mr. Bishop has taken over.\\nThe court heard the testimony of five of the wardens who were discharged or permitted to resign from the staff at\\nTucker Farm. Captain Clay Smith, Head Warden, and two other wardens at Cummins Farm also testified. These\\nwitnesses related the facts and circumstances surrounding each of the whippings complained of in this case.\\nThey said that in each case involving a whipping there had been a violation of the rules by the prisoners and\\nexcept in a few instances (which have been admitted by the defendant) the procedure for the administration of\\ncorporal punishment as set out in the rules was followed. They maintained that at all hearings at least two\\nwardens were present. They also said that they treated the whipping of prisoners as just another part of their jobs\\nand had no personal feelings against the prisoners while the whipping was being administered.\\nCaptain Clay Smith testified that he usually sits on the board of inquiry at Cummins Farm and that he always\\nasked the prisoner being charged if he knew of and understood the rules and regulations. He then would ask if\\nthe prisoner had anything to say before he decided the case or gave any punishment. Captain Smith said that he\\ncould not set a work quota for each inmate because of the many variables involved in the day-to-day work at the\\nPrison. He stated that all the Prison administration asked of the inmates was an honest day's work. Upon being\\nquestioned by the court, Captain Smith said that of the 1,600 inmates at Cummins, in 1966 approximately 200\\nwere whipped. He said the great majority of prisoners adjusted satisfactorily to Prison conditions and are never\\npunished. There are some whose conduct is such that discipline in some form becomes necessary. There is a\\nsmaller group who are rebellious and, because of their recalcitrance, require repeated disciplinary measures.\\nThe court reconvened some two and a half weeks after the close of the first two days of this hearing to hear the\\n[9]\\ntestimony of two expert penologists presented by counsel for the plaintiffs.\\nJames V. Bennett, who was Director of the Federal Prisons from 1937 to 1964, and whose qualifications as an\\neminent penologist are far too numerous to mention here, gave his views on the use of the whip for disciplinary\\npurposes in a penitentiary. He said that in all the many years in which he was connected with the federal prisons\\nhe never used strapping or corporal punishment for disciplinary purposes. He felt that it was brutal and medieval\\nand did no real good. He also testified that to his knowledge only one other state used the whip officially in its\\npenitentiary system. He said that it was possible, however, that other states used it unofficially. He said that he\\n814 had never visited *814 the Arkansas Penitentiary System and that he was familiar with it only through discussions\\nwith prisoners who had been incarcerated there.\\nHe had read and was familiar with the rules of the Penitentiary. Even if corporal punishment were permitted, it\\nwas his opinion that these rules were too indefinite and could be easily circumvented so as to make them\\nineffective. He said that an inmate should be entitled to a completely objective hearing by a qualified employee\\nwhose decision should be approved by a high ranking official in the system before corporal punishment is\\n\\nadministered to that prisoner. He also suggested that a cooling-off period should be allowed between the charge\\nand the decision or sentence. He advocated the use of incentives for good behavior rather than punishment.\\nMr. Fred Wilkinson, Director of Corrections for the State of Missouri, who is also an eminently qualified penologist\\nwith many years of experience in the federal prisons, also testified for plaintiffs. It is his opinion that all forms of\\ncorporal punishment should be abolished. He said that he also knew of only one other state that uses the whip\\nofficially in disciplining prison inmates. In his experience the most commonly used punishment was forfeiture of\\ngood time credits, deprivation of privileges, and administrative separation. He said that if the strap were used,\\nthere should be a commission or board to rule on the appropriate discipline rather than just one person. Both he\\nand Mr. Bennett testified at some length as to the type of facilities and the forms of punishment used in the\\nprisons with which they had been connected.\\nAccording to Mr. Wilkinson, in the Missouri Prison System there is one paid employee for each four or five\\nprisoners; nationally the average is one paid employee to about seven or eight prisoners. It appears that in\\nArkansas the ratio is one paid employee to approximately 58 prisoners.\\nWe now consider the applicable law.\\nThe Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides \\\"* * * excessive bail shall not be\\nrequired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\\\" (Emphasis supplied.)\\nAlthough the prohibitions of this Amendment originally applied only to the federal government, it is now well\\nsettled that they apply equally to the States through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \\nRobinson v. State of California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758; United States ex rel. Bryant v. Fay,\\n211 F.Supp. 812 (D.C. N.Y.1962).\\nThe courts have never arrived at a satisfactory definition of \\\"cruel and unusual punishment.\\\" As was said recently\\nby the Eighth Circuit, \\\"It is settled doctrine that except in extreme cases the courts may not interfere with the\\nconduct of a prison, with its regulations and their enforcement, or with its discipline. (Citation of authorities.)\\\"\\nHowever, in the same case the court went on to say, \\\"Unlawful administration can exist where there are aspects\\nof institutional treatment of such character or consequences as to shock general conscience or to be intolerable\\nin fundamental fairness. Such treatment is entitled to be held to be within the ban of the Eighth Amendment as\\nrepresenting cruel and unusual punishment and so constituting unlawful administration of prison sentence.\\\" Lee\\nv. Tahash, 352 F.2d 970, 971, 972 (1965). See also Carey v. Settle, 351 F.2d 483 (8 Cir. 1965).\\nThe court has weighed the evidence in these cases, along with the arguments and authorities set forth in the\\nexcellent briefs of both parties. We think it is fair to say, however, as this court said in Talley, \\\"* * * corporal\\npunishment has not been viewed historically as a constitutionally forbidden cruel and unusual punishment.\\\"\\nNeither are we willing to say that the use of the strap in and of itself is contrary to the Eighth Amendment's\\nprohibitions.\\n815 *815 \\\"Every punishment in a sense involves cruelty since it imposes by force conditions at odds with the concept\\nof the freedom of the person from all forms of trespass, and freedom of action. More than this is required to\\nviolate the Eighth Amendment.\\\" Wright v. McMann, 257 F.Supp. 739, 745 (D.C.N.Y. 1966).\\nThis, of course, does not extend to all types of corporal punishment or to unguarded use of the strap. A\\npunishment, like a law, may be constitutional in its bare form and yet be unconstitutionally administered. Certainly\\nproper safeguards against capricious administration are necessary to keep such punishment from violating\\nconstitutional standards.\\nThere can be no doubt that the brutal and sadistic atrocities which were uncovered by the investigation of the\\nState Police in August and September of 1966 cannot be tolerated. The court has reference to the use of a\\ntelephone shocking apparatus, the teeter board, strapping on the bare buttocks, and other torturous acts of this\\nnature. The defendant admits that these acts were committed but claims that they were carried on without the\\nknowledge or approval of the Superintendent, that they are contrary to the Prison rules as well as the State law,\\n\\nthat all personnel responsible for such acts have been discharged, that the offending objects of torture have been\\ndisposed of, and that administrative steps have been taken to assure that such acts will not recur.\\nThe court commends the actions of the Superintendent, under the supervision of the Prison Board, which have\\nproduced more efficient administration and improved standards of discipline, as well as other improvements;\\nhowever, we feel that the inmates' right to be free of such treatment as disclosed in the testimony cannot depend\\nupon the competence of the administrative personnel which changes from time to time; therefore, these and\\nother actions of this character will be permanently enjoined.\\nAs we have indicated, the court is aware that there has been much improvement in the disciplining of prisoners\\nsince the rules were promulgated in January 1966. However, the court finds that the \\\"Rules and Regulations\\\"\\nadopted by the Penitentiary Board January 10, 1966 do not provide the adequate safeguards required by this\\ncourt in Talley.\\nAs an example, they are unnecessarily ambiguous in prescribing the composition of the \\\"board of inquiry\\\"\\ndescribed in the rules. We agree with Dr. Bennett's observation that this portion of the rules is so indefinite as to\\nbe easily circumvented. It is obvious from the testimony that experience under these rules has proven this to be\\ntrue.\\nThe court refers particularly to the convening of hearings in connection with the administration of corporal\\npunishment without a proper \\\"board of inquiry.\\\"\\nThe court will enjoin the use of the strap as punishment at the penitentiary until proper and adequate safeguards\\nsurrounding its use are provided by those in charge of prison administration.\\nIt is neither this court's duty nor its inclination to tell the defendant or the Penitentiary Board what rules should be\\npromulgated in order to comply with the Constitution. However, the court will make these general observations.\\nFirst, more than one person's judgment should be required for a decision to administer corporal punishment. This\\nis implicit in the existing rules which require such a decision to be made by a board of inquiry. In this procedure,\\nthe accuser should not be counted among those who sit in judgment.\\nSecondly, that circumvention of the rules and regulations by an official in time of anger is intolerable. Certainly a\\nprisoner charged with a rule violation is entitled to and should be provided with an objectively reasoned,\\n816 dispassionate *816 decision as to whether or not he should be punished.\\nThird, that summary acceptance of one inmate's report on another without further investigation in determining\\nwhether punishment should be administered voids the effectiveness of any rules and regulations.\\nAnd, finally, it is suggested that the Superintendent or an Assistant Superintendent of the Prison participate in or\\nreview any decision to inflict corporal punishment.\\nThe court finds that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the contention of each plaintiff concerning his physical\\nimpairment. Each claims that he has been unconstitutionally punished because of failure to do work which he is\\nphysically unable to do.\\nThere can be no doubt that as we stated in the Talley decision:\\n\\\"* * * for prison officials knowingly to compel convicts to perform physical labor which is beyond\\ntheir strength, or which constitutes a danger to their lives or health, or which is unduly painful\\nconstitutes an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the 8th Amendment to the\\nConstitution of the United States as included in the 14th Amendment.\\\"\\nHowever, such a situation does not exist in this case. Upon request of plaintiffs' counsel the court appointed Dr.\\nDale Alford (an ophthalmologist) to examine plaintiff Jackson's eyes, and Dr. John Hundley and Dr. Charles\\nMcKenzie (orthopedic surgeons) to examine plaintiff Mask's knee. Relying upon these doctors' reports, as well as\\nthe prison medical records of each plaintiff and the testimony surrounding the incidents concerning the alleged\\nphysical impairments, the court can find no merit in these contentions.\\n\\nAn injunction will be issued permanently restraining the defendant and any personnel of the Prison System from:\\nThe use of any such devices as the crank telephone or teeter board; or The application of any\\nwhipping to the bare skin of prisoners.\\nSuch officials are further restrained from the \\\"use of the strap\\\" on any prisoner until additional rules and\\nregulations are promulgated with appropriate safeguards in accordance with this opinion and filed with the Clerk\\nof this court.\\nAn order will be issued in accordance with this opinion.\\nDECREE\\nIn accordance with the Memorandum Opinion of the court filed this date, the defendant, O. E. Bishop,\\nSuperintendent of the Arkansas State Penitentiary, and any personnel of the Prison System are permanently\\nrestrained from:\\nThe use of any such devices as the crank telephone or teeter board; or\\nThe application of any whipping to the bare skin of prisoners.\\nSuch officials are further restrained from the \\\"use of the strap\\\" on any prisoner until additional rules and\\nregulations are promulgated with appropriate safeguards in accordance with said opinion and filed with the Clerk\\nof this court.\\n[1]Talley v. Stephens, D.C., 247 F.Supp. 683. This is an earlier decision before this court in which inmates of the\\nArkansas State Penitentiary were complaining about treatment received and constitutional rights being denied.\\nSome of the issues and many of the principles involved are identical with the cases which are now before the\\ncourt. Therefore we will refer to the Talley decision several times throughout this opinion rather than repeat facts\\nand circumstances which are the same in these cases.\\n[2] For further information concerning the operation of the prison see Talley v.

All  conditions  precedent  to  the \\ninstitution of  this  lawsuit  have  been  fulfilled. \\nSTATEMENT  OF  CLAIM \\n7.  Since  at  least  January,  1998,  Defendant  Employer  has \\nengaged  in  and  is  continuing  to  engage  in  unlawful  employment \\npractices  at  its  Mobile,  Alabama,  facility,  Store  No.  866,  in \\nviolation  of  \\u00a7703  (a) (1)  of  Title  VII,  42  U.S.C.  \\u00a72000e  et.seq. \\nDefendant  Employer  through  its  agents  has  subjected  Charlene \\n3 \\n\\nf\\\", \\nDaugherty  and  other  similarly  situated  females  to  a  sexually \\nhostile and  intimidating iwork  environment. \\nS.  The  hostile'  work  environment  to  which  Charlene \\nDaugherty  and  other  similarly  situated  females  were  subjected \\nincluded  sexually explicit and  implicit  language  and  conduct  that \\nwas  so  severe  and  pervasive  as  to  adversely  affect  the  ter.ms  and \\nconditions  of  the  employment  of  female  workers. \\n9.  Charlene Daugherty and other similarly situated females \\nacted  reasonably  and  continuously  complained  to  Defendant  of  the \\nsexually  hostile  and  intimidating  work  environment.  However, \\nDefendant did not act reasonably to stop or prevent the harassment. \\n10.  Furthermore,  Defendant  maintained  a  sexually  hostile \\nand  intimidating  work  environment  that  was  so  unpleasant  or \\ndifficult  in  which  to  work  that  a  reasonable  person  in  Charlene \\nDaugherty's position would  feel  compelled to resign,  resulting in \\nthe  constructive  discharge  of  Charlene  Daugherty  because  of  her \\nsex  in violation of  \\u00a7703(a)  of  Title VII. \\n11.  Moreover,  Defendant  harassed  and  constructively \\ndischarged Charlene Daugherty in retaliation for complaining of the \\nharassment  in violation of  \\u00a7704(a)of Title VII. \\n12.  The  effect  of  the  practices  complained  of  above  has \\nbeen  to  deprive  Charlene  Daugherty  and  other  similarly  situated \\nfemales  of  equal  employment  opportunities  and  otherwise  adversely \\n4 \\n\\naffect  their  status  as  employees  on  the  basis  of  sex  and  on  the \\nbasis  of  retaliation. \\n13.  The unlawful  employment practices complained of above \\nwere  intentional. \\n14.

Plaintiff Dinah Charlene Daugherty (\\\"Ms. Daugherty\\\") brings this action \\npursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e, et seq. \\nas amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991. \\n2. Subject matter jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 US.C. \\nSec. 1331 and 1343, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e, et seq. \\n3. This action is brought within the State where the unlawful employment \\npractice was committed, making venue proper under 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-\\n5(1)(3). \\n\\nThe Parties \\n4. Plaintiff, Ms. Daugherty, is a female citizen of the United States and of the \\nState of Alabama. She is a resident of Mobile, Alabama, (Mobile County) which \\nmakes her a resident of this District and Division. ' \\n5. Plaintiff Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\\\"EEOC\\\") brought \\nsuit on July 19, 2001 on behalf of Ms. Daugherty and other similarly-situated \\nfemale Wal-Mart employees. \\n6. Defendant Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\\\"Wal-Mart\\\"), is an employer within the \\nmeaning of Title VII  of the  1964 Civil Rights Act and, the 1991 amendments \\nthereto. \\nStatement of Facts \\n6. Wal-Mart is located and doing business within this District and Division. \\n7. Ms. Daugherty was an employee ofWal-Mart within the meaning of Title \\nVII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1991 amendments thereto, up until her \\nconstructive discharge in April of 1998. \\n8. Prior to her constructive discharge from Wal-Mart, Ms. Daugherty was \\nemployed as a retail sales representative at Wal-Mart Store No. 866 in Mobile, \\nAlabama (Mobile County).  She began work for Wal-Mart on September 13, 1997. \\n9. From January 1998 through the date of her constructive discharge, Wal \\nMart engaged in unlawful employment practices against Ms. Daugherty at its \\nMobile, Alabama, store No. 866, in violation of Sec. 703(a)(1) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\nSec. 2000e et seq.  Wal-Mart through its agents subjected Ms. Daugherty to a \\n\\n.. \\nsexually hostile and intimidating work environment. \\n10. The hostile work environment to which Ms. Daugherty was subjected \\nincluded sexually explicit and implicit language and conduct that was so severe \\nand pervasive as to adversely affect the terms and conditions of the employment \\nof Ms. Daugherty. \\n11.

Gen. of Arkansas, Little Rock, Ark., were with him on the brief. \\\\nBefore VAN OOSTERHOUT, Chief Judge, BLACKMUN, Circuit Judge, and VAN PELT, District Judge.\\\\nBLACKMUN, Circuit Judge.\\\\n[1]\\\\nThe three plaintiffs-appellants, inmates of the Arkansas penitentiary,  in separate actions call upon us to direct\\\\nthe entry of an injunction barring the use of the strap as a disciplinary measure in Arkansas\\\\' penal institutions. \\\\nThe claim is that the district court\\\\nerred in refusing to hold that corporal punishment of prisoners is cruel and unusual punishment\\\\nwithin the meaning of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and in holding that\\\\nthe whipping of prisoners was not unconstitutional per se.\\\\nThe plaintiffs\\\\' cases are not dissimilar, in tone and complaint, to an earlier non-class action by another trio of\\\\nArkansas prisoners.  Talley v. Stephens, 247 F.Supp. 683 (E.D.Ark.1965).  Chief Judge Henley in Talley granted, in\\\\npart by consent, a substantial measure of relief, including restraint against forcing prisoners to work beyond their\\\\nphysical capabilities, against the withholding of reasonable medical attention, against the infliction of corporal\\\\npunishment until \\\"appropriate safeguards\\\" were established, and against reprisals for seeking access to the\\\\ncourts.  Neither side appealed. \\\\nThe present cases were filed in the Eastern District of Arkansas and were assigned respectively to Judge Young\\\\nand Judge Harris.  Upon agreement, the judges consolidated the three actions and, as a panel of two, jointly\\\\nheard and decided them.  After a full hearing, the court granted relief against \\\"[t]he use of any such devices as the\\\\ncrank telephone or teeter board\\\" and against \\\"[t]he application of any whipping to the bare skin of prisoners.\\\" It\\\\nalso restrained the use of the strap \\\"until additional rules and regulations are promulgated with appropriate\\\\nsafeguards * * *\\\" Jackson v. Bishop, 268 F. Supp. 804, 816 (E.D.Ark.1967). \\\\nThe use of the strap, therefore, as in the Talley case, was not totally renstrained.  Because it was not, the plaintiffs\\\\nappeal and seek here to remove that vestige.  The defendant Superintendent has taken no cross appeal.  Thus,\\\\nthe relief granted in the district court remains effective and is not in issue before us. \\\\n\\\\nWe conclude that the plaintiffs are correct in their position and that Arkansas\\\\' use of the strap, irrespective of\\\\nsafeguards, is to be enjoined. \\\\n573 These actions were instituted in 1966 by handwritten petitions employing varying titles. [2] Each plaintiff asked \\\\n*573 for the appointment of counsel and permission to proceed in forma pauperis.  Those requests were granted. \\\\nAppointed counsel then filed amended complaints which have been treated by all concerned as petitions for\\\\ninjunctive relief under the civil rights statutes, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1343(3) and (4).  We are satisfied\\\\nas to jurisdiction.  We are also satisfied, as were the district judges, that the cases are appropriately to be\\\\nregarded as class actions within the scope and reach of Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P. \\\\nWe initially commend Edward L. Wright of Little Rock and William S. Arnold of Crossett, court-appointed counsel\\\\nfor the plaintiffs, and Don Langston, who argued the cases for the defendant, for their candid, unemotional and\\\\nfair and able presentations.  The services rendered by Mr. Wright and Mr. Arnold, and the expenses they have\\\\nincurred, were without anticipation of reimbursement. \\\\nAlthough we are advised that a substantial percentage of the Arkansas prison population is black, the three\\\\nplaintiffs, the prison officials concerned, and the witnesses are all white.  No issue of race, as such, is present. \\\\n[3]\\\\nThe facts, at this stage of the litigation, are in no real dispute.   Anyone interested in all the details may refer to\\\\nthe facts recited by Chief Judge Henley in his opinion in Talley v. Stephens, supra, and to those set forth in the\\\\nopinion of the district judges in this case. We regard the following history and facts as particularly pertinent for our\\\\nreview:\\\\n1.  The Arkansas penal institutions are under the general supervision of a five-man \\\"honorary\\\" commission known\\\\nas the State Penitentiary Board.  Ark. Stat.Ann. \\u00a7\\u00a7 7-201(6) and 7-202 and \\u00a7 46-101.  Actual day-to-day\\\\nsupervision is delegated by the Board to a full-time compensated superintendent.  \\u00a7\\u00a7 46-104 and 46-104.1.  The\\\\nBoard also serves as a board of pardons and paroles and meets monthly.  \\u00a7 43-2801. \\\\n2.  The State\\\\'s penitentiary system contains two farm units. Cummins Farm, near Grady, Arkansas, has 15,500\\\\nacres and over 1,600 inmates.  Tucker Farm, near Tucker, Arkansas, has about 4,500 acres and approximately\\\\n250 inmates.  The Superintendent resides at Cummins.  An assistant superintendent is at Tucker.  The units are\\\\nabout 50 miles apart. \\\\n3.  The Board has the duty to publish and appropriately post all rules and regulations it promulgates with respect\\\\nto prisoner conduct.  \\u00a7 46-132.  The Superintendent has \\\"general supervision and control of\\\" and is \\\"solely\\\\nresponsible for, the discipline, management, and control\\\" of all inmates.  \\u00a7 46-133. \\\\n4.  The Superintendent, by statute, is authorized to use trusties as guards.  \\u00a7 46-122.  In fact, trusties are used at\\\\nCummins and Tucker in supervisory and overseeing capacities in the barracks and fields and as guards.  Trusties\\\\nare selected by the Superintendent or his assistant.  There are also supervisory wardens at both units.\\\\n5.  The primary activity of inmates is agricultural work with row crops and garden produce.  However, a dairy herd\\\\nand a beef herd are also maintained.  The system is virtually self-sustaining so far as food is concerned. \\\\n6.  The Board, by statute, \\u00a7 46-158, has the duty to prescribe the mode and extent of punishments for violation of\\\\nprison rules.  One who inflicts, or causes to be inflicted, punishment more severe than is prescribed by the Board\\\\nis guilty of a felony.  Section 46-158, however, does not itself specify the type of punishment which may be\\\\nimposed. \\\\n574 *574 7.  Corporal punishment in the Arkansas system was authorized formally only in 1962 but evidently it had\\\\nbeen employed for many years.  At that time the Board, by resolution, authorized such punishment whenever, in\\\\nthe Superintendent\\\\'s judgment, its infliction was necessary in order to maintain discipline.  The resolution did not\\\\nprescribe form or limit of punishment. \\\\n8.  In the Talley action, the three petitioning inmates sought injunctive relief with respect to certain prison practices\\\\nincluding the infliction of corporal punishment.  The respondent there, a predecessor superintendent, consented to\\\\n\\\\nthe granting of relief with respect to work requirements beyond a prisoner\\\\'s physical capability and with respect to\\\\nreasonable medical attention.  247 F. Supp. at 687.  Chief Judge Henley found that, at that time, there were no\\\\nwritten rules as to whipping; that such punishment was administered in the sole discretion of the one inflicting it,\\\\nsubject to an informal requirement that the blows not exceed ten for a single offense; and that two of those three\\\\npetitioners had been whipped and one beaten by a field-line supervisor-trusty.  The judge noted that the Supreme\\\\nCourt of Arkansas, over 80 years ago, deplored the whipping of convicts, Werner v. State, 44 Ark. 122 (1884),\\\\nand that the Arkansas statutes do not themselves specifically prescribe whipping even as a punishment for crime. \\\\n[4]\\\\n He observed, however, that corporal punishment had not been viewed historically as a constitutionally\\\\nforbidden cruel and unusual punishment.  The court concluded that it was not prepared to say that such\\\\npunishment was unconstitutional per se. Nevertheless, Judge Henley said, 247 F.Supp. at 689, this conclusion\\\\npresupposes that the infliction of such punishment is surrounded by appropriate safeguards, that is, it must not\\\\nbe excessive, it must be inflicted dispassionately and by responsible people, and it must be applied under\\\\nrecognizable standards so that the convict knows what conduct will cause him to be whipped and how much\\\\npunishment his conduct will produce.  The court found that those safeguards did not exist in the Arkansas system\\\\nand enjoined further corporal punishment of the petitioners until they were established. \\\\n9.  The Talley opinion was filed on November 15, 1965.  As a result, the Board issued written rules and regulations\\\\non January 10, 1966.  These were in effect until the district court decision in the present case was rendered June\\\\n3, 1967.  In addition to a number of other provisions, the rules state that certain \\\"major offenses will warrant\\\\ncorporal punishment.\\\" The ones listed are homosexuality, agitation, insubordination, making or concealing\\\\nweapons, refusal to work when medically certified able to work, and participating in or inciting a riot.  They further\\\\nstate:\\\\nNo inmate shall ever be authorized to inflict any corporal punishment under color of prison\\\\nauthority on another inmate. \\\\nPunishment shall not, in any case, exceed Ten lashes with the strap, the number of lashes to be\\\\nadministered shall be determined by a Board of inquiry, consisting of at least two officials of the\\\\nArkansas State Penitentiary, The Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent, and the head\\\\nWarden or an associate Warden.  The Board of Inquiry will request that the accused inmate appear\\\\nbefore the Board and speak in his own behalf.  No Punishment will be administered in the field. \\\\n10.  The straps used in Arkansas vary somewhat but all are similar.  Each is of leather and from 3\\u00bd to 5\\u00bd feet in\\\\nlength, about 4 inches wide, and \\u00bc inch thick.  Each has a wooden handle 8 to 12 inches long. \\\\n11.  Since Talley, whippings are administered by wardens.  The prisoner lies face down and the blows are to his\\\\n575 buttocks.  Supposedly, they are administered *575 while the prisoner is fully clothed.  Petitioners Ernst and Mask,\\\\nhowever, testified without contradiction that they were required to lower their trousers and that they received\\\\nlashes on the bare buttocks.  There is corroborating and other evidence to the same effect with respect to other\\\\ninmates and there was proof, some offered through the State Police, of deep bruises and bleeding. \\\\n12.  Whipping is the primary disciplinary measure used in the Arkansas system.  Prisioners there have few\\\\nprivileges which can be withheld from them as punishment.  Facilities for segregation and solitary confinement are\\\\nlimited. \\\\n13.  There is testimony that the strap hurts the inmate\\\\'s pride, that it has been needed in order to preserve\\\\ndiscipline, and that the work level improves after its administration.  Contrarily, there is testimony that the whipping\\\\ngenerates hate in the inmate who is whipped and that this hate flows toward the whipper, the institution and the\\\\nsystem. \\\\n14.  The circumstances relative to the punishment administered to the plaintiffs as well as to others and relative to\\\\nvarious disciplinary matters are set forth in detail in the district court\\\\'s opinion.  268 F.Supp. at 809-813.  The\\\\ntestimony of James V. Bennett, former Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and that of Fred T. Wilkinson,\\\\nDirector of the Department of Corrections of the State of Missouri (and former Deputy Director of the Federal\\\\nBureau of Prisons) are summarized in the district court\\\\'s opinion.  268 F.Supp. at 813-814.  This testimony is to the\\\\neffect that, among other things, corporal punishment has not been used for disciplinary purposes in federal\\\\n\\\\nprisons for years and that only Mississippi, in addition to Arkansas, uses it officially.  Testifying as a penologist, it\\\\nwas Mr. Bennett\\\\'s opinion that the whippings administered to the three plaintiffs were \\\"cruel, degrading and\\\\ncertainly they were unusual in this day and age.\\\" Mr. Wilkinson testified that use of the strap \\\"is cruel and unusual\\\\nand unnecessary.\\\" 15.  On July 20, 1966, six months after the issuance of the January 1966 regulations, plaintiff Ernst received two\\\\nwhippings of ten lashes each to the bare buttocks within a period of 45 minutes. \\\\n16.  In August 1966 the Superintendent became aware of irregularities.  An investigation disclosed violations of\\\\nserious import.  A number of wardens resigned or were discharged.  The plaintiffs\\\\' cases were filed while this\\\\ninvestigation was under way.  The present Superintendent candidly does not seek to defend everything which has\\\\ntaken place. \\\\n17.  The district judges concluded that the post-Talley rules and regulations of January 1966 still did not provide\\\\nadequate safeguards.  The use of the strap was therefore enjoined until further safeguards were provided.  The\\\\ncourt observed that more than one person\\\\'s judgment should be required for a decision to administer corporal\\\\n[5]\\\\npunishment. \\\\n576 *576 So much for the facts.  Certain legal principles, which have general application here, are well established\\\\nand admit of no real controversy:\\\\n1.  Lawful incarceration may properly operate to deprive the convict of certain rights which would otherwise be his\\\\nto enjoy.  Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948).  A classic example is\\\\nArkansas\\\\' denial to the felon of the right to vote.  Ark.Const.  art. 3, \\u00a7 1 (as amended by Amendment No. 8); Ark.\\\\nStat.Ann. \\u00a7 3-101 (Repl.1956); City of Newport v. Smith, 236 Ark. 626, 367 S.W.2d 742 (1963).  Other states do\\\\nthe same.  See, for instance, N.D.Const. art. V, \\u00a7 127, N.D.Cent.Code \\u00a7 16-01-04 (1960), and State ex rel. Olson\\\\nv. Langer, 65 N.D. 68, 256 N.W. 377 (1934); Mo. Const. art. VIII \\u00a7 2, VAMS \\u00a7 111.060 (1966), and State ex rel.\\\\nBarrett v. Sartorious, 351 Mo. 1237, 175 S.W.2d 787, 789-790, 149 A.L.R. 1067 (1943); Minn.Const.  art. 7, \\u00a7 2. \\\\n2.  The only federal restraint to state action of this kind lies in the Constitution and in the statutes in enforcement\\\\nthereof, specifically, the Fourteenth Amendment\\\\'s equal protection and due process clauses, and the Fifteenth\\\\nAmendment\\\\'s proscription of the denial to citizens of the United States of the right to vote \\\"on account of race,\\\\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.\\\" Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 647, 86 S.Ct. 1717, 16 L.Ed.2d\\\\n828 (1966); Harper v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 665, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966); \\\\nCarrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 775, 13 L. Ed.2d 675 (1965); State ex rel. Olson v. Langer, supra,\\\\n256 N.W. at 385-386.  But previous criminal record has been referred to as among the \\\"obvious examples\\\\nindicating factors which a State may take into consideration in determining the qualifications of voters.\\\" Lassiter v.\\\\nNorthampton County Bd. of Elections, 360 U.S. 45, 51, 79 S.Ct. 985, 990, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1959); Davis v.\\\\nBeason, 133 U.S. 333, 346-347, 10 S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637 (1890). \\\\n3.  On the other hand, a prisoner of the state does not lose all his civil rights during and because of his\\\\nincarceration.  In particular, he continues to be protected by the due process and equal protection clauses which\\\\nfollow him through the prison doors.  Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.

Despite earlier comments to the contrary, see, for example, In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 446, 10 S.Ct. 930,\\\\n34 L.Ed. 519 (1890); O\\\\'Neil v.

The federal courts, including this one, entertain a natural reluctance to interfere with a prison\\\\'s internal\\\\ndiscipline.  This is true with respect to federal institutions, Glenn v. Ciccone, 370 F.2d 361, 363 (8 Cir. 1966); \\\\nSutton v. Settle, 302 F.2d 286, 288 (8 Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 930, 83 S.Ct. 876, 9 L.Ed.2d 734; Garcia\\\\nv. Steele, 193 F.2d 276, 278 (8 Cir. 1951), see Holland v. Ciccone, 386 F.2d 825 (8 Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390\\\\nU.S. 1045, 88 S.Ct. 1646, 20 L.Ed.2d 307, as well as to state prisons, Douglas v. Sigler, 386 F.2d 684, 688 (8 Cir.\\\\n1967); Lee v. Tahash, 352 F. 2d 970, 971 (8 Cir. 1965); Wright v. McMann, supra, 387 F.2d at 522. \\\\n6.  However, the courts, including this one, have not hesitated to entertain petitions asserting violations of\\\\nfundamental rights and, where indicated, to grant relief.  In Glenn v. Ciccone, which we have just cited, this court\\\\nclearly indicated that \\\"a factual showing of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment\\\"\\\\nwould support interference by a federal court. 370 F. 2d at 363.  We have made a like statement in many other\\\\ncases. Carey v. Settle, 351 F.2d 483, 485 (8 Cir. 1965); Haynes v. Harris, 344 F.2d 463, 466 (8 Cir. 1965); Harris\\\\nv. Settle, 322 F.2d 908, 910 (8 Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 910, 84 S.Ct. 1171, 12 L.Ed.2d 179.  Although\\\\nthe Eighth Circuit cases just cited concern a federal institution, the principle, of course, has equal application to a\\\\nstate penitentiary.  Wright v. McMann, supra, 387 F.2d at 522; Howard v. Smyth, 365 F.2d 428 (4 Cir. 1966), cert.\\\\ndenied, 385 U.S. 988, 87 S.Ct. 599, 17 L.Ed.2d 449. \\\\nThis takes us then to a consideration of the meaning and scope of the Eighth Amendment\\\\'s proscription of the\\\\ninfliction of \\\"cruel and unusual punishments.\\\" The phrase appeared in the English Bill of Rights of December 16,\\\\n1689, 1 W. and M. s.2, c.2 but seems to have had still earlier antecedents in Magna Charta and elsewhere.  IV\\\\nBlackstone, Commentaries, 379. \\\\nThe Supreme Court long ago acknowledged, \\\"Difficulty would attend the effort to define with exactness the extent\\\\nof the constitutional provision which provides that cruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted * * *.\\\" Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130, 135-136, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1878).  This difficulty, and the absence of an exact or\\\\nexhaustive definition of the Amendment\\\\'s ban, has been repeatedly noted.  In re Kemmler, supra, 136 U.S. at 447,\\\\n10 S.Ct. 930; Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 368-371, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910); Trop v. Dulles,\\\\n356 U.S. 86, 87, 99, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). \\\\nThere are, however, indications, by specific holdings and other observations, which bear upon the extent and\\\\nreach of the Eighth Amendment\\\\'s proscription.  Thus in Wilkerson v. Utah, execution by public shooting, and in In\\\\nre Kemmler, execution by electrocution, were classified as outside the ban.  But in Wilkerson, 99 U.S. at 136, the\\\\nCourt observed \\\"it is safe to affirm that punishments of torture * * * and all others in the same line of unnecessary\\\\ncruelty, are forbidden * * *\\\" In Kemmler, 136 U.S. at 446-447, 10 S.Ct. at 933, the Court describes, as within the\\\\nconstitutional prohibition, punishments which are \\\"manifestly cruel and unusual, as burning at the stake,\\\\ncrucifixion, breaking on the wheel, or the like\\\" and, as cruel, those which \\\"involve torture or a lingering death.\\\" And it said that the word \\\"cruel,\\\" as used in the Eighth Amendment, \\\"implies there something inhuman and\\\\nbarbarous, 00 something more than the mere extinguishment of life.\\\" 136 U.S. at 447, 10 S.Ct. at 933.  In O\\\\'Neil v.\\\\n97\\\\nVermont, supra, 144 U.S. at 339-340, and 364, 12 S.Ct. 693, Mr. Justice Field, in dissent (joined by Justices\\\\nHarlan and Brewer, 144 U.S. at 370-371, 12 S.Ct. 693), advanced the thought that the Amendment\\\\'s \\\"inhibition is\\\\ndirected, not only against punishments of the character mentioned, but against all punishments which by their\\\\n578 excessive length or severity are greatly disproportioned to the offenses *578 charged.\\\" He went on to say that\\\\nalthough a state has the power to whip for petty offenses, \\\"repulsive as such mode of punishment is,\\\" the\\\\nincrease of such punishment by accumulation for multiple offenses could be both unusual and cruel.  144 U.S. at\\\\n340, 12 S.Ct. at 699. \\\\nIn Weems v. United States, supra, the Court observed, 217 U.S. at 373, 30 S. Ct. at 551, that \\\"a principle, to be\\\\nvital, must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth.  This is peculiarly true of\\\\nconstitutions.\\\" The majority condemned a Philippine statute on the ground that the disparity between the\\\\npunishment it imposed (cadena temporal for 15 years, that is, among other things, \\\"hard and painful labor,\\\" with a\\\\nchain at the ankle, hanging from the wrists, and with outside assistance denied) for a false entry in a public\\\\nrecord and that imposed for more serious crimes made it repugnant to the Philippine Bill of Rights forbidding\\\\ncruel and unusual punishment. \\\\nIn State of La. ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, supra, 329 U.S. at 463, 67 S.Ct. at 376, the Court spoke of the\\\\n\\\"traditional humanity of modern Anglo-American law\\\" and \\\"unnecessary pain\\\" and the \\\"wanton infliction of pain,\\\"\\\\n\\\\nand the dissent referred, at page 473, 67 S. Ct. at 381, to that which \\\"shocks the most fundamental instincts of\\\\ncivilized man.\\\" Mr. Justice Douglas, concurring, in Robinson v. California, supra, 370 U.S. at 676, 82 S.Ct. at\\\\n1425, said, \\\"The Eighth Amendment expresses the revulsion of civilized man against barbarous acts 00 the `cry of\\\\n97\\\\nhorror\\\\' against man\\\\'s inhumanity to his fellow man.\\\" In Rudolph v. Alabama, 375 U.S. 889, 84 S.Ct. 155, 11\\\\nL.Ed.2d 119 (1963), three dissenters to the denial of certiorari spoke of \\\"standards of decency more or less\\\\nuniversally accepted,\\\" of disproportion between offense and punishment, and of \\\"unnecessary cruelty.\\\" In Dyke v.\\\\nTaylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U.S. 216, 223, 88 S.Ct. 1472, 20 L.Ed.2d 538 (1968), Mr. Justice Douglas, in\\\\ndissent, referred to the historical fact (noted by Mr. Justice Harlan, in dissent, in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S.\\\\n145, 191-192, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491, 522 (1968)) that petty offenses once entailed whipping as\\\\npunishments, but said, \\\"I am loath to hold whippings * * * as `petty.\\\\'\\\" This court has added its word.  It has described the situation where a court will interfere with prison discipline as\\\\none \\\"of such character or consequence as to shock general conscience or to be intolerable in fundamental\\\\nfairness, and so to amount to illegal administration of prison sentence.\\\" Carey v. Settle, supra, 351 F.2d at 485. \\\\nJudge Johnsen there went on to say that it is possible for the form or extent of institutional treatment to offend the\\\\nEighth Amendment.  In a later case concerning a state prisoner, Judge Johnsen repeated these observations and\\\\nsaid,\\\\n\\\"Such treatment is entitled to be held to be within the ban of the Eighth Amendment as\\\\nrepresenting cruel and unusual punishment and so constituting unlawful administration of prison\\\\nsentence.  It may be observed in this connection that penal admeasurements made by general\\\\nconscience and sense of fundamental fairness doubtless will not be without some relationship to\\\\nthe humane concepts and reactions of present-day social climate.\\\" Lee v. Tahash, supra, 352 F.2d\\\\nat 972. \\\\nThe principal opinion in Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed. 2d 630 (1958), although it\\\\ncommanded the votes of only four justices a decade ago, is, in our view, practicularly pertinent.  The issue was\\\\nthe validity of a federal statute which would denationalize a native born citizen who deserts the military service in\\\\ntime of war and is convicted thereof by a court-martial and dismissed or dishonorably discharged.  The opinion\\\\nprovides guidelines and overtones which we feel safe in regarding as illustrative of the general thinking of a\\\\nmajority of the justices on the subject today.  The opinion casts aside the death penalty \\\"as an index of the\\\\n579 constitutional *579 limit on punishment,\\\" for it \\\"has been employed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is\\\\nstill widely accepted, it cannot be said to violate the constitutional concept of cruelty.\\\" 356 U.S. at 99, 78 S.Ct. at\\\\n597.  The Eighth Amendment\\\\'s basic concept \\\"is nothing less than the dignity of man\\\" and assures that a state\\\\'s\\\\npunishment power \\\"be exercised within the limits of civilized standards.\\\" Fines, imprisonment, and even\\\\nexecution may be imposed \\\"but any technique outside the bounds of these traditional penalties is constitutionally\\\\nsuspect.\\\" 356 U.S. at 100, 78 S.Ct. at 598.  The scope of the Amendment is not \\\"static.\\\" It \\\"must draw its meaning\\\\nfrom the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\\\" 356 U.S. at 102, 78 S.Ct.\\\\nat 598.  Virtually all the world\\\\'s civilized nations refuse to impose statelessness as punishment for crime.  356 U.S.\\\\nat 102, 78 S.Ct. at 598. \\\\nFrom that opinion we glean a recognition of, and a reliance in part upon, attitudes of contemporary society and\\\\ncomparative law. And the emphasis is on man\\\\'s basic dignity, on civilized precepts, and on flexibility and\\\\nimprovement in standards of decency as society progresses and matures.  Finally, it is \\\"any technique\\\" outside\\\\nthe traditional bounds which \\\"is constitutionally suspect.\\\" In summary, then, so far as the Supreme Court cases are concerned, we have a flat recognition that the limits of\\\\nthe Eighth Amendment\\\\'s proscription are not easily or exactly defined, and we also have clear indications that the\\\\napplicable standards are flexible, that disproportion, both among punishments and between punishment and\\\\ncrime, is a factor to be considered, and that broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity,\\\\nand decency are useful and usable.  We recognize that some of these utterances by the Court were made in\\\\nconcurrence or dissent or in the approach, evidently now superseded, through the Fourteenth Amendment\\\\'s due\\\\nprocess clause rather than jointly through the Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments.  All this, however, strikes us as\\\\nof no import because we read and ascertain in the totality of the language used the basic attitude of the entire\\\\nCourt to the Eighth Amendment. \\\\n\\\\nWith these principles and guidelines before us, we have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the use of the\\\\nstrap in the penitentiaries of Arkansas is punishment which, in this last third of the 20th century, runs afoul of the\\\\nEighth Amendment; that the strap\\\\'s use, irrespective of any precautionary conditions which may be imposed,\\\\noffends contemporary concepts of decency and human dignity and precepts of civilization which we profess to\\\\npossess; and that it also violates those standards of good conscience and fundamental fairness enunciated by\\\\nthis court in the Carey and Lee cases.\\\\nOur reasons for this conclusion include the following: (1) We are not convinced that any rule or regulation as to\\\\nthe use of the strap, however seriously or sincerely conceived and drawn, will successfully prevent abuse.  The\\\\npresent record discloses misinterpretation and obvious overnarrow interpretation even of the newly adopted\\\\nJanuary 1966 rules.  (2) Rules in this area seem often to go unobserved.  Despite the January 1966 requirement\\\\nthat no inmate was to inflict punishment on another, the record is replete with instances where this very thing took\\\\nplace.  (3) Regulations are easily circumvented.  Although it was a long-standing requirement that a whipping was\\\\nto be administered only when the prisoner was fully clothed, this record discloses instances of whippings upon\\\\nthe bare buttocks, and with consequent injury.  (4) Corporal punishment is easily subject to abuse in the hands of\\\\nthe sadistic and the unscrupulous.  (5) Where power to punish is granted to persons in lower levels of\\\\nadministrative authority, there is an inherent and natural difficulty in enforcing the limitations of that power.  (6)\\\\nThere can be no argument that excessive whipping or an inappropriate manner of whipping or too great\\\\n580 frequency of whipping or the *580 use of studded or overlong straps all constitute cruel and unusual punishment. \\\\nBut if whipping were to be authorized, how does one, or any court, ascertain the point which would distinguish the\\\\npermissible from that which is cruel and unusual?  (7) Corporal punishment generates hate toward the keepers\\\\nwho punish and toward the system which permits it.  It is degrading to the punisher and to the punished alike.  It\\\\nfrustrates correctional and rehabilitative goals.  This record cries out with testimony to this effect from the expert\\\\npenologists, from the inmates and from their keepers.  (8) Whipping creates other penological problems and\\\\nmakes adjustment to society more difficult.  (9) Public opinion is obviously adverse.  Counsel concede that only\\\\ntwo states still permit the use of the strap.  Thus almost uniformly has it been abolished.  It has been expressly\\\\noutlawed by statute in a number of states.  See for example, N.D.Cent.  Code \\u00a7 12-47-26 (1960); S.D.Code \\u00a7\\\\n13.4715 (1939).  And 48 states, including Arkansas, have constitutional provisions against cruel or unusual\\\\npunishment.  Ark.Const.  art. 2, \\u00a7 9. \\\\nWe are not convinced contrarily by any suggestion that the State needs this tool for disciplinary purposes and is\\\\ntoo poor to provide other accepted means of prisoner regulation.  Humane considerations and constitutional\\\\nrequirements are not, in this day, to be measured or limited by dollar considerations or by the thickness of the\\\\nprisoner\\\\'s clothing.', ' (7) Corporal punishment generates hate toward the keepers\\\\nwho punish and toward the system which permits it.

Certain of these cases rest on the\\\\npresence of specific statutory provision for corporal punishment for crime.  State v. Revis, 193 N.C. 192, 136 S.E.\\\\n346, 50 A.L.R. 98 (1927); Westbrook v.

Convicts \\u00a7 11 (1939) and 41 Am.Jur., Prisons and Prisoners, \\u00a7 37 (1942). \\\\n\\\\nWe choose to draw no significant distinction between the word \\\"cruel\\\" and the word \\\"unusual\\\" in the Eighth\\\\nAmendment.  See Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S. at 100 n. 32, 78 S.Ct. 590.  We would not wish to place\\\\nourselves in the position of condoning punishment which is shown to be only \\\"cruel\\\" but not \\\"unusual\\\" or vice\\\\nversa.  In any event, the testimony of the two expert penologists clearly demonstrates that the use of the strap in\\\\nthis day is unusual and we encounter no difficulty in holding that its use is cruel. \\\\nNeither do we wish to draw, in this context, any meaningful distinction between punishment by way of sentence\\\\n581 statutorily prescribed and punishment *581 imposed for prison disciplinary purposes.  It seems to us that the\\\\nEighth Amendment\\\\'s proscription has application to both. \\\\nThe district court\\\\'s decree is vacated and the case is remanded with directions to enter a new decree embracing\\\\nthe injunctive relief heretofore granted but, in addition, restraining the Superintendent of the Arkansas State\\\\nPenitentiary and all personnel of the penitentiary system from inflicting corporal punishment, including the use of\\\\nthe strap, as a disciplinary measure. \\\\n[1] Plaintiff Jackson is presently on parole. \\\\n[2] Jackson (\\\"Petition for a writ of habeas corpus\\\"); Ernst (\\\"Petition for writ of mandamus\\\"); Mask (\\\"Motion and\\\\npetition for physical examination * * * also a federal restraining order * * *\\\").

See, for example, 11 Delaware Code, \\u00a7\\u00a7 631, 811, 3905, 3906, 3907, and 3908. \\\\n[5] At oral argument we were advised that since the entry of the district court\\\\'s decree other new rules and\\\\nregulations have been adopted.  These list the major offenses which \\\"will warrant punishment.\\\" They recite that no\\\\ninmate shall ever be authorized to inflict corporal punishment on another.  Before punishment is imposed, a full\\\\nhearing before a Board of Inquiry is required.  The accusing warden may not sit on the Board of Inquiry or take\\\\npart in carrying out the punishment.  Punishment may include solitary confinement, reduction of rations, corporal\\\\npunishment, loss of mail, recreation and other privileges, loss of future good time, and recording the offense for\\\\nparole purposes.  Corporal punishment shall not exceed ten lashes with the strap and a period in solitary\\\\nconfinement.  In no case may the strap be applied to the bare buttocks.  An accuser or other inmate shall not\\\\nadminister the strap.  The strap shall not be used in the fields.  No inmate shall be whipped within 24 hours of any\\\\npreceding whipping.  Each inmate sentenced to corporal punishment has the right of appeal to the superintendent\\\\nor the assistant superintendent and this official or his designee may change the sentence.  It is stated that\\\\ncorporal punishment is not deemed necessary at Tucker because the inmates are youthful first offenders.  \\\\nWe were also advised that at a meeting of the Board held February 29, 1968, with all members in attendance, a\\\\nresolution was adopted that corporal punishment in any form \\\"be abolished as a means of discipline in the\\\\ninstitution.\\\" These changes, of course, do not render the present appeal moot.

YOUNG, District Judges. \\\\nThese are suits in equity brought under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 by three inmates of the Arkansas State Penitentiary\\\\nagainst O. E. Bishop, Superintendent of the Penitentiary.  The cases first became known to the court through\\\\nhandwritten petitions filed by each of the prisoners seeking various forms of relief.  The court allowed the petitions\\\\nto be filed in forma pauperis and treated each one as a complaint for equitable relief under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983. \\\\nCounsel was appointed for the prisoners, and after investigation an amended complaint was filed seeking an\\\\ninjunctive relief and making the cases class actions.  Although one of the cases was assigned to Judge Harris and\\\\nthe other two to Judge Young, they were consolidated for trial due to the similarity of the issues presented, and\\\\nboth judges sat as a panel of two for the trial.\\\\nThe plaintiffs make several alternative claims or contentions for themselves and other prison inmates:\\\\nFirst, they contend that the infliction of corporal punishment in any form constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\\\\ncontrary to the prohibitions of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as made applicable by the\\\\nFourteenth Amendment to the States. \\\\nSecondly and alternatively, they contend that the use of the strap or \\\"hide\\\" as a means of punishing inmates in\\\\nthe Penitentiary under any circumstances is cruel and unusual so as to be unconstitutional. \\\\nThirdly, they contend that the imposition of administrative rules or regulations concerning the use of the strap\\\\ndoes not make it a constitutionally permissible method of prison discipline. \\\\nPlaintiffs\\\\' fourth contention is actually twofold: (1) they claim that the rules concerning corporal punishment\\\\nadopted by the Arkansas State Penitentiary Board do not adequately protect the prisoners from unconstitutional\\\\n[1]\\\\ntreatment nor do they conform to the requirements that this court set out in the Talley  decision; and (2) the\\\\nrules which have been promulgated by the Prison Board have been violated in the administration of corporal\\\\npunishment upon the inmates. \\\\n\\\\nFinally, each of the plaintiffs contends that although he has some physical impairment which would prevent him\\\\nfrom doing the work of an average man, he nevertheless is classified as \\\"average\\\" for prison work purposes, is\\\\nrequired to perform difficult physical labor, and is whipped when he fails to perform.  Each claims that this is\\\\ncontrary to his constitutional right to due process and equal protection of the law and that it is also\\\\nunconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. \\\\nThe defendant denies that corporal punishment per se or use of the strap as carried out by prison officials is cruel\\\\nand unusual in the constitutional sense.  He relies primarily upon this court\\\\'s earlier decision in the Talley case\\\\nand upon the rules and regulations adopted by the Penitentiary Board pursuant to that decision.  He admits that\\\\ncertain rule violations and other unlawful acts occurred at the Penitentiary but claims that these matters have\\\\nbeen remedied by administrative action.  Defendant denies that any injunctive relief for these plaintiffs or anyone\\\\nin their class is necessary or justified. \\\\nThe court appointed Edward L. Wright of Little Rock and William S. Arnold of Crossett, both highly respected and\\\\n807 experienced members of the Arkansas Bar, to represent the plaintiffs without *807 charge.  They have done so\\\\nmost capably, and the court thanks them for their services. \\\\nThat the court has jurisdiction and that these are proper cases to be brought under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 is not\\\\nquestioned by either party.  These matters are fully discussed in the Talley decision supra at 686.  However, at the\\\\noutset we want to point out that the court is especially conscious of the limitations of its function in cases of this\\\\nkind. \\\\nIt is well settled that the administration of state prison discipline is the primary responsibility of state officials, and\\\\nfederal courts have an extremely limited area in which they may act pertaining to the treatment of prisoners\\\\nconfined to state penal institutions.  State officials must of necessity have wide discretion and control over\\\\ndisciplinary measures in order to properly maintain the prison system as well as to protect the public.  Wright v.\\\\nMcMann, 257 F.Supp. 739 (D.C.N.Y.1966).  United States ex rel. Atterbury v. Ragen, 237 F. 2d 953 (7 Cir. 1956).  \\\\nTalley v. Stephens, supra (and cases cited therein).  Therefore this court cannot and will not become appellate in\\\\nnature and review each prison administration decision to punish a prisoner. \\\\nHowever, it is equally well settled that there are exceptions to these rules when special circumstances exist and\\\\nconstitutional rights are involved.  See Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030; Childs v.\\\\nPegelow, 321 F. 2d 487 (4 Cir. 1963); Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034; Talley v.\\\\nStephens, supra.\\\\nAs was said in Talley, page 686 of 247 F.Supp., \\\"Although persons convicted of crimes lose many of the rights\\\\nand privileges of law abiding citizens, it is established by now that they do not lose all of their civil rights, and that\\\\nthe Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment follow them into the prison * * *\\\"\\\\nWe feel that the complaints in these cases raise several constitutional questions which merit the court\\\\'s attention. \\\\nIn order to understand the issues in their proper perspective, it is necessary to set out some of the facts about,\\\\nand the recent history of the Arkansas State Penitentiary. \\\\nThe Arkansas Penitentiary System is under the general supervision of a fiveman honorary commission known as\\\\nthe State Penitentiary Board but actual supervision is by them delegated to a Superintendent. \\\\nThe plant of the System consists of two farms.  One is known as Cummins Farm and contains approximately\\\\n15,500 acres, with 8,200 acres being under cultivation.  Cummins Farm is located near Grady, Arkansas, and\\\\nnormally houses approximately 1,600 inmates; Superintendent O. E. Bishop resides at Cummins Farm.  The other\\\\nfarm is known as Tucker Farm and contains approximately 4,500 acres, with approximately 3,000 acres being\\\\nunder cultivation.  Tucker Farm is situated at Tucker, Arkansas, and normally houses approximately 275 inmates. \\\\nCummins Farm and Tucker Farm are approximately fifty miles apart by highway. \\\\nPersonnel, other than inmates under sentence, at Cummins Farm consists of the Superintendent and 25 paid\\\\nemployees, with 20 being supervision wardens; and at Tucker Farm consists of an assistant superintendent and\\\\nfive paid employees, but only three supervision wardens.  Customarily both farms make use of inmates, called\\\\n\\\\ntrusties, in supervisory and overseeing capacities in the fields, in the barracks, and as security guards.  The\\\\nprimary activity of inmates at both farms is agricultural work with row crops and garden type produce being\\\\nplanted, cultivated and harvested principally by hand labor.  A dairy herd and a beef herd are also maintained for\\\\n[2]\\\\nfood. \\\\n808 *808 In the fall of 1965 certain irregularities at the Penitentiary were brought to the court\\\\'s attention by three\\\\ninmates who filed suits similar to the ones now before the court. This court, with Judge Henley presiding, heard\\\\nthose cases and rendered its decision in November 1965.  Talley v. Stephens, supra. The chief contention of the\\\\nplaintiffs in those cases was that the use of corporal punishment at the Arkansas State Penitentiary for\\\\ndisciplinary purposes was cruel and unusual and violative of the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs. \\\\nThe court found that it could not say that corporal punishment per se was unconstitutional.  It went on to say:\\\\n\\\"But, the Court\\\\'s unwillingness to say that the Constitution forbids the imposition of any and all\\\\ncorporal punishment on convicts presupposes that its infliction is surrounded by appropriate\\\\nsafeguards.  It must not be excessive; it must be inflicted as dispassionately as possible and by\\\\nresponsible people; and it must be applied in reference to recognizable standards whereby a\\\\nconvict may know what conduct on his part will cause him to be whipped and how much\\\\npunishment given conduct may produce.\\\" Shortly after this decision, the Superintendent of the Penitentiary resigned; and on January 1, 1966, Mr. O. E.\\\\nBishop, the present Superintendent, was appointed.  On January 10, 1966, the Penitentiary Board through Mr.\\\\nBishop promulgated a set of rules and regulations for the Penitentiary which include, inter alia, the following rules\\\\nsetting forth the offenses which merit corporal punishment as well as the procedures to be followed in\\\\nadministering such punishment. \\\\n\\\"OFFENSES AND PUNISHMENT:\\\\n\\\"A great part of your time here will be spent in the barracks you are assigned to.  Barracks rules\\\\nand procedure will be posted in the barracks.  Your conduct, personal cleanliness and attitude\\\\nwhile in the barracks is an important part of your prison record.  \\\"These major offenses will warrant\\\\ncorporal punishment:\\\"\\\\n(1) Homosexuality. \\\\n(2) Agitation (defined as one who creates turmoil and disturbances). \\\\n(3) Insubordination (resisting authority or refusing to obey orders). \\\\n(4) Making or concealing of weapons. \\\\n(5) Refusal to work when medically certified able to work. \\\\n(6) Participating in or inciting a riot. \\\\n\\\"(7) No inmate shall ever be authorized to inflict any corporal punishment under color of prison\\\\nauthority on another inmate. \\\\n\\\"Punishment shall not, in any case, exceed Ten lashes with the strap, the number of lashes to be\\\\nadministered shall be determined by a Board of inquiry, consisting of at least two officials of the\\\\nArkansas State Penitentiary, The Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent, and the head\\\\nWarden or an associate Warden.  The Board of Inquiry will request that the accused inmate appear\\\\nbefore the Board and speak in his own behalf.  No Punishment will be administered in the field.\\\" (Although these rules were adopted as a result of the Talley case, they were never approved by\\\\nthe court.)\\\\nEach inmate, as well as the employees of the Penitentiary, was given a copy of the rules and was instructed to\\\\nbecome familiar with and understand each of them.  New prisoners were similarly instructed. \\\\n\\\\nIn August of 1966 Superintendent Bishop became aware of irregularities at the Tucker Prison Farm and\\\\nrequested that the Criminal Investigation Division of the Arkansas State Police conduct an investigation.  The\\\\ninvestigation disclosed rank violations of the rules by certain of the Prison officials.  Shortly thereafter all of the\\\\nwardens at Tucker Farm were discharged or allowed to resign.  Since that time there have been three new\\\\n809 assistant superintendents in *809 charge of Tucker Farm in quick succession, as well as other personnel\\\\nchanges. \\\\nSubsequently the Arkansas Legislature through a special commission, as well as the Penitentiary Board,\\\\nconducted various investigations of the penal system.  As a result, many desirable changes have been brought\\\\nabout in the administration of the two farms. \\\\nThese cases were filed in the fall of 1966 and it was during their preparation for trial that the aforementioned\\\\ninvestigations were taking place.  Therefore, by the time of the trial many of the activities complained of had\\\\nceased and many of the individuals involved no longer were employed by the Penitentiary. \\\\nThe trial of these cases lasted some three days, in which the court heard testimony from fifteen prisoners, several\\\\nmembers and ex-members of the Prison personnel, one doctor, and two expert penologists.  Some of the\\\\ntestimony pertained to strappings and other whippings which took place prior to the Talley decision in 1965.  The\\\\ncourt ruled that this testimony would be admitted only for the purpose of showing the background or history and\\\\nwould not be relevant to the type of punishment used in the Prison system since the changes brought about by\\\\nthe Talley decision, or more particularly since the rules were promulgated in January of 1966. \\\\nThe strap which is referred to throughout this opinion is made of leather and is between four and five feet long\\\\nand four inches wide.  This leather is bradded to a wooden handle approximately six inches in length.  The strap is\\\\nabout one-fourth inch thick at the end attached to the wooden handle and is gradually tapered toward the end\\\\nwhich comes in contact with the person being whipped.  The evidence showed that there is more than one strap\\\\nused at the Penitentiary but all are of approximately the same construction.  Some of these straps are depicted in\\\\nplaintiffs\\\\' exhibit No. 4. \\\\nEvidence relating to the petitioners herein. \\\\nThe evidence showed that the plaintiff Jackson, age 28, entered the prison in 1963 to serve a five year sentence\\\\nfor burglary.  Jackson testified to having been subjected to physical beatings three times since he has been in\\\\n[3]\\\\nprison.  First, in 1965, James Pike, a trusty and long line rider,  (an escapee at the time of this trial) hit him\\\\nseveral times with his fist, as well as kicking him two or three times.  The testimony was unclear as to what the\\\\n[4]\\\\npurpose of this whipping was.  In November of 1965 Jackson was whipped with the strap by Captain  Harmon, a\\\\nfield warden at the Penitentiary, for not picking enough cotton.  He has been whipped only once since the rules\\\\nwere promulgated in January 1966. \\\\nOn July 29, 1966, Jackson and seven other inmates received eight lashes with the strap for leaving okra in the\\\\nfield.  Jackson testified that he was charged by the long line rider with overlooking okra and was taken by Captain\\\\nHarmon to the office of Clay Smith, Head Warden at Cummins Farm.  In the process of conducting a hearing on\\\\nthe matter, Captain Smith informed the inmates of the charges against them and asked if each was familiar with\\\\nthe rules of the Penitentiary.  He then asked if anyone would like to make a statement, and Jackson told Captain\\\\nSmith that he had picked all the okra he could see and that he was having eye problems and needed glasses. \\\\nCaptain Smith called for Jackson\\\\'s medical record to determine the condition of Jackson\\\\'s eyes.  After checking\\\\nthese records and finding that Jackson had been certified as physically able for normal work, he then sentenced\\\\neach prisoner to receive eight lashes with the strap.  These lashes were administered by Captain Dean, another\\\\n810 warden at the *810 Prison.  Prisoners were required to lie face down on a concrete floor while Captain Dean\\\\nadministered the licks to the buttocks.  Jackson testified that the whipping caused much pain and left his buttocks\\\\nbruised and sore for a number of days.  The prisoners were returned to the field, where they continued to pick\\\\nokra for the rest of the day without incident. \\\\n\\\\nFurther evidence shows that at the time of the whipping Jackson had, and still has, a visual defect of the left eye. \\\\nThere is also a slight variance from normal vision in the right eye but this is within the normal vision for reading. \\\\nShortly after the whipping he was taken to the nearby city of Pine Bluff for an eye examination and the examining\\\\n[5]\\\\ndoctor did not recommend glasses for him. \\\\nPlaintiff Ernst is 24 years old and has been in the penitentiary (Tucker Farm) since January 19, 1963.  He has\\\\nreceived seven whippings during his entire stay.  The first three of these were administered before the rules were\\\\npromulgated.  They involve charges of scuffling in the barracks, not working hard enough in the fields, and cursing\\\\na trusty guard. \\\\nIn January of 1966, shortly after the rules were promulgated, Ernst received ten lashes upon a charge of talking\\\\n[6]\\\\nback to an overseer known as a yardman.   He was called to Assistant Superintendent Bruton\\\\'s office on the\\\\nmorning following the alleged offense and was told that he was charged with talking back to the yardman, was\\\\nrequired to lie face down on the floor, and receive ten licks with the strap.  No other wardens or other prison\\\\nofficials were present during the charge or the whipping. \\\\nSometime later in 1966 he received ten licks from Captain Mayes for throwing his hat across the Prison yard.  The\\\\nprisoners are told that they must wear their hats in the field and also that they must care for and not misuse the\\\\nclothing issued to them.  Ernst testified that on this evening as he returned to the barracks from the field he took\\\\noff his hat and threw it across the Prison yard onto the ground.  Upon seeing this, Captain Mayes called him over,\\\\ntook him into the barracks, made him lie down and gave him ten lashes with the strap.  There were no other\\\\nwardens or other prison personnel present at this whipping. \\\\nOn July 20, 1966, plaintiff Ernst was picking cucumbers in the field and was charged by the long line rider with\\\\nnot working and leaving cucumbers on the vines.  Ernst responded by saying that he was working the best he\\\\ncould on the food that was fed him and that he was feeling ill. The rider reported Ernst to Captain Mayes, who\\\\ntook him from the fields to the barracks and gave him ten lashes with the strap.  This time Ernst was required to\\\\nlower his pants and was whipped on the bare buttocks, which he testified cut and bruised him and caused a great\\\\ndeal of pain.  There was no hearing or formal charge and there were no other wardens present.  Ernst was then\\\\nreturned to the field to continue his work.  Some forty-five minutes or an hour later, the long line rider approached\\\\nErnst and started picking cucumbers back down the row upon which Ernst had just been working.  He picked\\\\napproximately a half bushel of cucumbers from the area in which Ernst had been working since returning from the\\\\nfirst whipping.  The rider again reported Ernst to Captain Mayes.  Ernst was returned to the barracks and taken to\\\\nCaptain Bruton, who was shown the cucumbers and told what had happened.  Captain Bruton instructed Captain\\\\nMayes to give Ernst ten lashes.  He was again required to lower his pants and lie face down on the concrete floor\\\\n811 to receive the licks.  Ernst testified that this whipping left large bruises and caused *811 him to bleed.  Captain\\\\n[7]\\\\nBruton was present during this whipping and when it was over he ordered Ernst to stand on the \\\"teeter board\\\"\\\\ninside the barracks until he was told to get off.  Ernst testified that he was required to remain on the teeter board\\\\nfor the rest of the day or about three or four hours.  According to Ernst this treatment caused his legs and ankles\\\\nto swell and ache.  He has not been whipped since that day.\\\\nPlaintiff Mask is twenty years old and has been in prison since November 12, 1965.  He spent his first four and a\\\\nhalf months at the Cummins Farm and was then sent to Tucker and has been there since that time.  He has\\\\nreceived five whippings with the strap since coming to Tucker.  The first such whipping was in June of 1966, when\\\\nhe was charged by a long line rider with being the last in the field or working too slow and was taken to Captain\\\\nFletcher.  Captain Fletcher administered ten licks.  One week later he was reported leaving cucumbers in the field. \\\\nHe was taken to Captain Bruton, who told him to get his pants down and lie on the floor.  Captain Fletcher gave\\\\nhim ten licks.  Plaintiff testified that two months later he was caught putting rotten tomatoes in the box they were\\\\nusing to carry tomatoes from the field where they were being picked.  Captain Bruton gave him nine licks for this\\\\noffense.  In September of 1966 he was charged with not picking enough cotton.  He testified that he had picked\\\\nninety pounds that day. He was taken to Captain Goodwin, the Assistant Superintendent at that time, who\\\\nsentenced him to six lashes which were administered by Captain Heston.  On December 7, 1966, he and several\\\\nother inmates were charged with sitting down and smoking when they should have been picking cotton.  He\\\\nreceived eight lashes for this offense and was put in an isolation cell for eight days.  While plaintiff was in this cell,\\\\n\\\\nhe received regular meals, although he was denied his mail privileges and could not purchase anything from the\\\\ncommissary. \\\\nPlaintiff Mask also testified concerning an altercation between him and Captain Goodwin sometime in the last of\\\\nNovember 1966.  Mask said that Captain Goodwin hit him on the chin and then had him brought into the office\\\\nwhere he was hit four or five times in the stomach and kicked once.  Captain Goodwin testified that he had not hit\\\\nMask but merely grabbed him and shook him and pushed him in a corner.  The testimony is not clear just why this\\\\naltercation arose; however, it appears it had something to do with Mask\\\\'s attitude toward work and his work\\\\nperformance. \\\\nPlaintiff Mask also complained that his knee bothers him when he works for long periods of time.  This causes him\\\\nnot to be able to do as much work as is required of him.  His knee was injured in a tractor accident in 1960 to such\\\\nan extent that it required surgery to repair.  There is some evidence that it might have been re-injured in 1964. \\\\nHowever, medical evidence was introduced to show that there were no significant residual effects of the earlier\\\\n[8]\\\\ninjury and also that there had been no recent re-injury. \\\\nThe court also heard testimony from twelve other inmates of the Arkansas State Penitentiary, most of which was\\\\ncumulative to that given by the three named plaintiffs as well as corroborating some of their testimony set out\\\\nabove.  These prisoners related the facts surrounding whippings which the various prisoners had received for\\\\noffenses such as insufficient work, insubordination, and scuffling among prisoners.  According to these witnesses,\\\\n812 some of *812 the whippings were administered without a formal hearing, also some hearings were conducted\\\\nwith only one warden present.  The general pattern of these whippings as related by the prisoners is that a\\\\nprisoner is charged by a trusty or other inmate in the capacity of an overseer such as a long line rider or yardman\\\\nwith some infraction of the Penitentiary rules.  He is taken to a warden.  The warden then takes him before another\\\\nPenitentiary official and there charges him with a rule infraction.  In most cases the prisoner is given a chance to\\\\nexplain his actions; then sentence is handed down.  If the prisoner is found guilty and sentenced to a whipping, he\\\\nis required to lie face down on the floor and receive the lashes on his buttocks.  The prisoners claim that the word\\\\nof the trusty or accusing warden is usually summarily accepted without further investigation or questioning. \\\\nThe prisoners also testified to certain beatings which inmates had received at the hands of trusties or other\\\\ninmates in positions of authority.  These beatings seem to have no connection with the disciplining of the beaten\\\\nprisoners; however, testimony showed that yardmen, floorwalkers, and occasionally a night warden have seen\\\\nthese beatings and have not reported the inmates for fighting nor have they tried to interfere with the beatings. \\\\nMost of this type activity takes place at night in the barracks; however, there were a few instances in which one or\\\\ntwo blows were struck in the field. \\\\nInvestigator H. H. Atkinson of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Arkansas State Police testified as to the\\\\nfacts and circumstances of his investigation of the Tucker Prison Farm in August of 1966.  Atkinson\\\\'s investigation\\\\narose out of some alleged violations of the rules involving possession of liquor by some of the inmates.  He\\\\ntestified that as his investigation progressed he and his men uncovered various acts of brutality and cruel\\\\ntreatment of the inmates by certain officials and trusties at Tucker Farm.  Immediately upon report of his findings\\\\nto Superintendent Goodwin, all the wardens at Tucker Farm were discharged.  Although new personnel was\\\\nappointed, Atkinson\\\\'s investigation continued for some twenty-two days.  He revealed that he had uncovered such\\\\ntorturous devices as a crank telephone device which was used to electrically shock prisoners, as well as use of\\\\nthe teeter board and strapping upon the bare buttocks.  He testified that in the first part of his investigation he\\\\nwitnessed such a strapping of an inmate by Captain Mayes.  He further testified that all persons responsible for\\\\nsuch treatment have been discharged. \\\\nHe was later placed in charge of Tucker Farm as Acting Assistant Superintendent during the administrative\\\\nchanges in December of 1966 and January of 1967.  He said that he found it necessary to use the strap while he\\\\nwas in charge.  He strapped four of twelve prisoners who had been sentenced by a three-man board of inquiry to\\\\nsix lashes because they had picked an insufficient amount of cotton.  He was told later by the inmates that they\\\\nwere \\\"trying him to see if he would use the whip.\\\" He also said that he got better work from the prisoners after\\\\nthey found out he would use the strap. \\\\n\\\\nSuperintendent O. E. Bishop has been Superintendent for the Prison system since January 1, 1966.  He testified\\\\nthat when the rules were promulgated he made every effort to make sure that each prisoner had a copy of the\\\\nrules and understood them.  His efforts included reading the rules to the prisoners over a loud speaker system\\\\nand answering any questions they might have.  He instructed all the personnel of the Prison that anyone who was\\\\nfound not following the rules would be fired immediately.  He also told the trusties that they would be \\\"ranked\\\"\\\\n(lose their privileges as trusties) at the first violation of the rules.  The evidence showed in fact that some trusties\\\\nhave been ranked and several wardens have been fired because of violations. \\\\n813 *813 He testified that he was not aware of the activities that had taken place at Tucker Farm prior to August of\\\\n1966 because his duties required him to spend the largest part of his time at Cummins Farm.  He also said that\\\\nthe two farms were fifty miles apart and that he could not leave Cummins to go to Tucker without the wardens at\\\\nTucker knowing of his visit beforehand. \\\\nSuperintendent Bishop said that disciplinary methods other than the use of the strap are also used in the\\\\nPenitentiary system.  These include loss of the few privileges which exist for the prisoners, administrative isolation\\\\nor solitary confinement, and removal from the plasma program, which is a means by which the prisoners earn\\\\nmoney.  He said that often prisoners charged with violations of the rules were found not guilty and were not\\\\npunished.  The evidence showed that substantial improvements have been made in the facilities and in the\\\\nadministrative procedure of the Penitentiary system since Mr. Bishop has taken over. \\\\nThe court heard the testimony of five of the wardens who were discharged or permitted to resign from the staff at\\\\nTucker Farm.  Captain Clay Smith, Head Warden, and two other wardens at Cummins Farm also testified.  These\\\\nwitnesses related the facts and circumstances surrounding each of the whippings complained of in this case.\\\\nThey said that in each case involving a whipping there had been a violation of the rules by the prisoners and\\\\nexcept in a few instances (which have been admitted by the defendant) the procedure for the administration of\\\\ncorporal punishment as set out in the rules was followed.  They maintained that at all hearings at least two\\\\nwardens were present.  They also said that they treated the whipping of prisoners as just another part of their jobs\\\\nand had no personal feelings against the prisoners while the whipping was being administered. \\\\nCaptain Clay Smith testified that he usually sits on the board of inquiry at Cummins Farm and that he always\\\\nasked the prisoner being charged if he knew of and understood the rules and regulations.  He then would ask if\\\\nthe prisoner had anything to say before he decided the case or gave any punishment.', ' He instructed all the personnel of the Prison that anyone who was\\\\nfound not following the rules would be fired immediately.  He also told the trusties that they would be \\\"ranked\\\"\\\\n(lose their privileges as trusties) at the first violation of the rules.

He then would ask if\\\\nthe prisoner had anything to say before he decided the case or gave any punishment.  Captain Smith said that he\\\\ncould not set a work quota for each inmate because of the many variables involved in the day-to-day work at the\\\\nPrison.  He stated that all the Prison administration asked of the inmates was an honest day\\\\'s work.  Upon being\\\\nquestioned by the court, Captain Smith said that of the 1,600 inmates at Cummins, in 1966 approximately 200\\\\nwere whipped.  He said the great majority of prisoners adjusted satisfactorily to Prison conditions and are never\\\\npunished.  There are some whose conduct is such that discipline in some form becomes necessary.  There is a\\\\nsmaller group who are rebellious and, because of their recalcitrance, require repeated disciplinary measures. \\\\nThe court reconvened some two and a half weeks after the close of the first two days of this hearing to hear the\\\\n[9]\\\\ntestimony of two expert penologists presented by counsel for the plaintiffs. \\\\nJames V. Bennett, who was Director of the Federal Prisons from 1937 to 1964, and whose qualifications as an\\\\neminent penologist are far too numerous to mention here, gave his views on the use of the whip for disciplinary\\\\npurposes in a penitentiary.  He said that in all the many years in which he was connected with the federal prisons\\\\nhe never used strapping or corporal punishment for disciplinary purposes.  He felt that it was brutal and medieval\\\\nand did no real good.  He also testified that to his knowledge only one other state used the whip officially in its\\\\npenitentiary system.  He said that it was possible, however, that other states used it unofficially.  He said that he\\\\n814 had never visited *814 the Arkansas Penitentiary System and that he was familiar with it only through discussions\\\\nwith prisoners who had been incarcerated there. \\\\nHe had read and was familiar with the rules of the Penitentiary.  Even if corporal punishment were permitted, it\\\\nwas his opinion that these rules were too indefinite and could be easily circumvented so as to make them\\\\nineffective.  He said that an inmate should be entitled to a completely objective hearing by a qualified employee\\\\nwhose decision should be approved by a high ranking official in the system before corporal punishment is\\\\n\\\\nadministered to that prisoner.  He also suggested that a cooling-off period should be allowed between the charge\\\\nand the decision or sentence.  He advocated the use of incentives for good behavior rather than punishment. \\\\nMr. Fred Wilkinson, Director of Corrections for the State of Missouri, who is also an eminently qualified penologist\\\\nwith many years of experience in the federal prisons, also testified for plaintiffs.  It is his opinion that all forms of\\\\ncorporal punishment should be abolished.  He said that he also knew of only one other state that uses the whip\\\\nofficially in disciplining prison inmates.  In his experience the most commonly used punishment was forfeiture of\\\\ngood time credits, deprivation of privileges, and administrative separation.  He said that if the strap were used,\\\\nthere should be a commission or board to rule on the appropriate discipline rather than just one person.  Both he\\\\nand Mr. Bennett testified at some length as to the type of facilities and the forms of punishment used in the\\\\nprisons with which they had been connected. \\\\nAccording to Mr. Wilkinson, in the Missouri Prison System there is one paid employee for each four or five\\\\nprisoners; nationally the average is one paid employee to about seven or eight prisoners.  It appears that in\\\\nArkansas the ratio is one paid employee to approximately 58 prisoners. \\\\nWe now consider the applicable law.\\\\nThe Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides \\\"* * * excessive bail shall not be\\\\nrequired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\\\" (Emphasis supplied.) Although the prohibitions of this Amendment originally applied only to the federal government, it is now well\\\\nsettled that they apply equally to the States through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \\\\nRobinson v. State of California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758; United States ex rel. Bryant v. Fay,\\\\n211 F.Supp. 812 (D.C. N.Y.1962). \\\\nThe courts have never arrived at a satisfactory definition of \\\"cruel and unusual punishment.\\\" As was said recently\\\\nby the Eighth Circuit, \\\"It is settled doctrine that except in extreme cases the courts may not interfere with the\\\\nconduct of a prison, with its regulations and their enforcement, or with its discipline.  (Citation of authorities.)\\\" However, in the same case the court went on to say, \\\"Unlawful administration can exist where there are aspects\\\\nof institutional treatment of such character or consequences as to shock general conscience or to be intolerable\\\\nin fundamental fairness.  Such treatment is entitled to be held to be within the ban of the Eighth Amendment as\\\\nrepresenting cruel and unusual punishment and so constituting unlawful administration of prison sentence.\\\" Lee\\\\nv. Tahash, 352 F.2d 970, 971, 972 (1965).  See also Carey v. Settle, 351 F.2d 483 (8 Cir. 1965). \\\\nThe court has weighed the evidence in these cases, along with the arguments and authorities set forth in the\\\\nexcellent briefs of both parties.  We think it is fair to say, however, as this court said in Talley, \\\"* * * corporal\\\\npunishment has not been viewed historically as a constitutionally forbidden cruel and unusual punishment.\\\" Neither are we willing to say that the use of the strap in and of itself is contrary to the Eighth Amendment\\\\'s\\\\nprohibitions. \\\\n815 *815 \\\"Every punishment in a sense involves cruelty since it imposes by force conditions at odds with the concept\\\\nof the freedom of the person from all forms of trespass, and freedom of action.  More than this is required to\\\\nviolate the Eighth Amendment.\\\" Wright v. McMann, 257 F.Supp. 739, 745 (D.C.N.Y. 1966). \\\\nThis, of course, does not extend to all types of corporal punishment or to unguarded use of the strap.  A\\\\npunishment, like a law, may be constitutional in its bare form and yet be unconstitutionally administered.  Certainly\\\\nproper safeguards against capricious administration are necessary to keep such punishment from violating\\\\nconstitutional standards. \\\\nThere can be no doubt that the brutal and sadistic atrocities which were uncovered by the investigation of the\\\\nState Police in August and September of 1966 cannot be tolerated.  The court has reference to the use of a\\\\ntelephone shocking apparatus, the teeter board, strapping on the bare buttocks, and other torturous acts of this\\\\nnature.  The defendant admits that these acts were committed but claims that they were carried on without the\\\\nknowledge or approval of the Superintendent, that they are contrary to the Prison rules as well as the State law,\\\\n\\\\nthat all personnel responsible for such acts have been discharged, that the offending objects of torture have been\\\\ndisposed of, and that administrative steps have been taken to assure that such acts will not recur.\\\\nThe court commends the actions of the Superintendent, under the supervision of the Prison Board, which have\\\\nproduced more efficient administration and improved standards of discipline, as well as other improvements;\\\\nhowever, we feel that the inmates\\\\' right to be free of such treatment as disclosed in the testimony cannot depend\\\\nupon the competence of the administrative personnel which changes from time to time; therefore, these and\\\\nother actions of this character will be permanently enjoined. \\\\nAs we have indicated, the court is aware that there has been much improvement in the disciplining of prisoners\\\\nsince the rules were promulgated in January 1966.  However, the court finds that the \\\"Rules and Regulations\\\"\\\\nadopted by the Penitentiary Board January 10, 1966 do not provide the adequate safeguards required by this\\\\ncourt in Talley. \\\\nAs an example, they are unnecessarily ambiguous in prescribing the composition of the \\\"board of inquiry\\\"\\\\ndescribed in the rules.  We agree with Dr. Bennett\\\\'s observation that this portion of the rules is so indefinite as to\\\\nbe easily circumvented.  It is obvious from the testimony that experience under these rules has proven this to be\\\\ntrue. \\\\nThe court refers particularly to the convening of hearings in connection with the administration of corporal\\\\npunishment without a proper \\\"board of inquiry.\\\" The court will enjoin the use of the strap as punishment at the penitentiary until proper and adequate safeguards\\\\nsurrounding its use are provided by those in charge of prison administration. \\\\nIt is neither this court\\\\'s duty nor its inclination to tell the defendant or the Penitentiary Board what rules should be\\\\npromulgated in order to comply with the Constitution.  However, the court will make these general observations. \\\\nFirst, more than one person\\\\'s judgment should be required for a decision to administer corporal punishment.  This\\\\nis implicit in the existing rules which require such a decision to be made by a board of inquiry.  In this procedure,\\\\nthe accuser should not be counted among those who sit in judgment. \\\\nSecondly, that circumvention of the rules and regulations by an official in time of anger is intolerable.  Certainly a\\\\nprisoner charged with a rule violation is entitled to and should be provided with an objectively reasoned,\\\\n816 dispassionate *816 decision as to whether or not he should be punished. \\\\nThird, that summary acceptance of one inmate\\\\'s report on another without further investigation in determining\\\\nwhether punishment should be administered voids the effectiveness of any rules and regulations. \\\\nAnd, finally, it is suggested that the Superintendent or an Assistant Superintendent of the Prison participate in or\\\\nreview any decision to inflict corporal punishment. \\\\nThe court finds that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the contention of each plaintiff concerning his physical\\\\nimpairment.  Each claims that he has been unconstitutionally punished because of failure to do work which he is\\\\nphysically unable to do. \\\\nThere can be no doubt that as we stated in the Talley decision:\\\\n\\\"* * * for prison officials knowingly to compel convicts to perform physical labor which is beyond\\\\ntheir strength, or which constitutes a danger to their lives or health, or which is unduly painful\\\\nconstitutes an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the 8th Amendment to the\\\\nConstitution of the United States as included in the 14th Amendment.\\\" However, such a situation does not exist in this case. Upon request of plaintiffs\\\\' counsel the court appointed Dr.\\\\nDale Alford (an ophthalmologist) to examine plaintiff Jackson\\\\'s eyes, and Dr. John Hundley and Dr. Charles\\\\nMcKenzie (orthopedic surgeons) to examine plaintiff Mask\\\\'s knee. Relying upon these doctors\\\\' reports, as well as\\\\nthe prison medical records of each plaintiff and the testimony surrounding the incidents concerning the alleged\\\\nphysical impairments, the court can find no merit in these contentions. \\\\n\\\\nAn injunction will be issued permanently restraining the defendant and any personnel of the Prison System from:\\\\nThe use of any such devices as the crank telephone or teeter board; or The application of any\\\\nwhipping to the bare skin of prisoners. \\\\nSuch officials are further restrained from the \\\"use of the strap\\\" on any prisoner until additional rules and\\\\nregulations are promulgated with appropriate safeguards in accordance with this opinion and filed with the Clerk\\\\nof this court.\\\\nAn order will be issued in accordance with this opinion. \\\\nDECREE\\\\nIn accordance with the Memorandum Opinion of the court filed this date, the defendant, O. E. Bishop,\\\\nSuperintendent of the Arkansas State Penitentiary, and any personnel of the Prison System are permanently\\\\nrestrained from:\\\\nThe use of any such devices as the crank telephone or teeter board; or\\\\nThe application of any whipping to the bare skin of prisoners. \\\\nSuch officials are further restrained from the \\\"use of the strap\\\" on any prisoner until additional rules and\\\\nregulations are promulgated with appropriate safeguards in accordance with said opinion and filed with the Clerk\\\\nof this court.\\\\n[1]Talley v. Stephens, D.C., 247 F.Supp. 683.  This is an earlier decision before this court in which inmates of the\\\\nArkansas State Penitentiary were complaining about treatment received and constitutional rights being denied. \\\\nSome of the issues and many of the principles involved are identical with the cases which are now before the\\\\ncourt. Therefore we will refer to the Talley decision several times throughout this opinion rather than repeat facts\\\\nand circumstances which are the same in these cases.\\\\n[2] For further information concerning the operation of the prison see Talley v.

Sec. 2000e, et seq. \\\\n3.  This action is brought within the State where the unlawful employment \\\\npractice was committed, making venue proper under 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-\\\\n5(1)(3).  \\\\n\\\\nThe Parties \\\\n4.  Plaintiff, Ms. Daugherty, is a female citizen of the United States and of the \\\\nState of Alabama.  She is a resident of Mobile, Alabama, (Mobile County) which \\\\nmakes her a resident of this District and Division. \\\\'\\\\n5.  Plaintiff Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\\\"EEOC\\\") brought \\\\nsuit on July 19, 2001 on behalf of Ms. Daugherty and other similarly-situated \\\\nfemale Wal-Mart employees.  \\\\n6.  Defendant Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\\\"Wal-Mart\\\"), is an employer within the \\\\nmeaning of Title VII  of the  1964 Civil Rights Act and, the 1991 amendments \\\\nthereto.  \\\\nStatement of Facts \\\\n6.  Wal-Mart is located and doing business within this District and Division.  \\\\n7.  Ms. Daugherty was an employee ofWal-Mart within the meaning of Title \\\\nVII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1991 amendments thereto, up until her \\\\nconstructive discharge in April of 1998.  \\\\n8.  Prior to her constructive discharge from Wal-Mart, Ms. Daugherty was \\\\nemployed as a retail sales representative at Wal-Mart Store No. 866 in Mobile, \\\\nAlabama (Mobile County).   She began work for Wal-Mart on September 13, 1997.  \\\\n9.  From January 1998 through the date of her constructive discharge, Wal \\\\nMart engaged in unlawful employment practices against Ms. Daugherty at its \\\\nMobile, Alabama, store No. 866, in violation of Sec. 703(a)(1) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\\\nSec. 2000e et seq.  Wal-Mart through its agents subjected Ms. Daugherty to a \\\\n\\\\n.. \\\\nsexually hostile and intimidating work environment.  \\\\n10.  The hostile work environment to which Ms. Daugherty was subjected \\\\nincluded sexually explicit and implicit language and conduct that was so severe \\\\nand pervasive as to adversely affect the terms and conditions of the employment \\\\nof Ms. Daugherty.  \\\\n11.  Ms. Daugherty acted reasonably and she continuously complained to \\\\nWal-Mart of the sexually hostile and intimidating work environment.   However, \\\\nWal-Mart did not act reasonably to stop and/or prevent the harassment.  \\\\n12.  Furthermore, Wal-Mart maintained a sexually hostile and intimidating \\\\nwork environment that was so unpleasant or difficult in which to work that a \\\\nreasonable person in Ms.  Daugherty\\\\'s position would feel compelled to resign, \\\\nresulting in the constructive discharge of Ms. Daughterty because of her gender \\\\nin violation of Sec. 703(a) of Title VII.  \\\\n13.  The effect of the practices complained of above has been to deprive Ms. \\\\nDaugherty of equal employment opportunities and otherwise adversely her status \\\\nas an employee on the basis of her gender and on the basis of retaliation.  \\\\n14.  The unlawful practices complained of were intentional.  \\\\n15.  The unlawful practices complained of were done with malice and/or \\\\nreckless indifference to the federally protected rights of Ms. Daugherty.  \\\\n\\\\nCLAIM I \\\\nTitle VIISexual Harassment \\\\n16.   Ms.  Daugherty realleges  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  all \\\\nparagraphs above.  \\\\n17.  Ms. Daugherty was subjected to sexual harassment in violation of Title \\\\nVII.  \\\\n18.  Ms. Daugherty was subjected to offensive sexual language and touching \\\\nby a co-employee, Carl Beard, from January to approximately May, 1998.  \\\\n19.  Wal-Mart knew or should have known that Mr. Beard had a history of \\\\nsexually harassing behavior.  \\\\n20.  Ms. Daugherty told Mr. Beard to stop, and reported the harassment to \\\\nWal-Mart  supervisory  employees  on  more  than  one  occasion,  which  said \\\\nsupervisory employees  did  nothing to  attempt stop the harassment,  and/ or \\\\nunreasonably delayed in attempting to stop the harassment.  \\\\n21.  In taking the above-described actions, Wal-Mart intentionally retaliated \\\\nagainst Ms. Daugherty because she reported the sexual harassment.  The actions \\\\nof Wal-Mart were  taken with malice or reckless indifference to  the federally \\\\nprotected rights of Ms. Daugherty.  \\\\n21.  As a proximate consequence ofWal-Mart\\\\'s  actions and the violation of \\\\nTitle VII, Ms. Daugherty has lost income and benefits, suffered mental anguish \\\\nand emotional distress, and suffered other injuries and damages.  \\\\n22.

Talley v. Stephens, 247 F.Supp. 683 (E.D.Ark.1965). Chief Judge Henley in Talley granted, in\\npart by consent, a substantial measure of relief, including restraint against forcing prisoners to work beyond their\\nphysical capabilities, against the withholding of reasonable medical attention, against the infliction of corporal\\npunishment until \\\"appropriate safeguards\\\" were established, and against reprisals for seeking access to the\\ncourts. Neither side appealed.\\nThe present cases were filed in the Eastern District of Arkansas and were assigned respectively to Judge Young\\nand Judge Harris. Upon agreement, the judges consolidated the three actions and, as a panel of two, jointly\\nheard and decided them. After a full hearing, the court granted relief against \\\"[t]he use of any such devices as the\\ncrank telephone or teeter board\\\" and against \\\"[t]he application of any whipping to the bare skin of prisoners.\\\" It\\nalso restrained the use of the strap \\\"until additional rules and regulations are promulgated with appropriate\\nsafeguards * * *\\\" Jackson v. Bishop, 268 F. Supp. 804, 816 (E.D.Ark.1967).\\nThe use of the strap, therefore, as in the Talley case, was not totally renstrained. Because it was not, the plaintiffs\\nappeal and seek here to remove that vestige. The defendant Superintendent has taken no cross appeal. Thus,\\nthe relief granted in the district court remains effective and is not in issue before us.\\n\\nWe conclude that the plaintiffs are correct in their position and that Arkansas' use of the strap, irrespective of\\nsafeguards, is to be enjoined.\\n573 These actions were instituted in 1966 by handwritten petitions employing varying titles.[2] Each plaintiff asked \\n*573 for the appointment of counsel and permission to proceed in forma pauperis. Those requests were granted.\\nAppointed counsel then filed amended complaints which have been treated by all concerned as petitions for\\ninjunctive relief under the civil rights statutes, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1343(3) and (4). We are satisfied\\nas to jurisdiction. We are also satisfied, as were the district judges, that the cases are appropriately to be\\nregarded as class actions within the scope and reach of Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P.\\nWe initially commend Edward L. Wright of Little Rock and William S. Arnold of Crossett, court-appointed counsel\\nfor the plaintiffs, and Don Langston, who argued the cases for the defendant, for their candid, unemotional and\\nfair and able presentations. The services rendered by Mr. Wright and Mr. Arnold, and the expenses they have\\nincurred, were without anticipation of reimbursement.\\nAlthough we are advised that a substantial percentage of the Arkansas prison population is black, the three\\nplaintiffs, the prison officials concerned, and the witnesses are all white. No issue of race, as such, is present.\\n[3]\\nThe facts, at this stage of the litigation, are in no real dispute.  Anyone interested in all the details may refer to\\nthe facts recited by Chief Judge Henley in his opinion in Talley v. Stephens, supra, and to those set forth in the\\nopinion of the district judges in this case. We regard the following history and facts as particularly pertinent for our\\nreview:\\n1. The Arkansas penal institutions are under the general supervision of a five-man \\\"honorary\\\" commission known\\nas the State Penitentiary Board. Ark. Stat.Ann. \\u00a7\\u00a7 7-201(6) and 7-202 and \\u00a7 46-101. Actual day-to-day\\nsupervision is delegated by the Board to a full-time compensated superintendent. \\u00a7\\u00a7 46-104 and 46-104.1. The\\nBoard also serves as a board of pardons and paroles and meets monthly. \\u00a7 43-2801.\\n2. The State's penitentiary system contains two farm units. Cummins Farm, near Grady, Arkansas, has 15,500\\nacres and over 1,600 inmates. Tucker Farm, near Tucker, Arkansas, has about 4,500 acres and approximately\\n250 inmates. The Superintendent resides at Cummins. An assistant superintendent is at Tucker. The units are\\nabout 50 miles apart.\\n3. The Board has the duty to publish and appropriately post all rules and regulations it promulgates with respect\\nto prisoner conduct. \\u00a7 46-132. The Superintendent has \\\"general supervision and control of\\\" and is \\\"solely\\nresponsible for, the discipline, management, and control\\\" of all inmates. \\u00a7 46-133.\\n4. The Superintendent, by statute, is authorized to use trusties as guards. \\u00a7 46-122. In fact, trusties are used at\\nCummins and Tucker in supervisory and overseeing capacities in the barracks and fields and as guards. Trusties\\nare selected by the Superintendent or his assistant. There are also supervisory wardens at both units.\\n5. The primary activity of inmates is agricultural work with row crops and garden produce. However, a dairy herd\\nand a beef herd are also maintained. The system is virtually self-sustaining so far as food is concerned.\\n6. The Board, by statute, \\u00a7 46-158, has the duty to prescribe the mode and extent of punishments for violation of\\nprison rules. One who inflicts, or causes to be inflicted, punishment more severe than is prescribed by the Board\\nis guilty of a felony. Section 46-158, however, does not itself specify the type of punishment which may be\\nimposed.\\n574 *574 7. Corporal punishment in the Arkansas system was authorized formally only in 1962 but evidently it had\\nbeen employed for many years. At that time the Board, by resolution, authorized such punishment whenever, in\\nthe Superintendent's judgment, its infliction was necessary in order to maintain discipline. The resolution did not\\nprescribe form or limit of punishment.\\n8. In the Talley action, the three petitioning inmates sought injunctive relief with respect to certain prison practices\\nincluding the infliction of corporal punishment. The respondent there, a predecessor superintendent, consented to\\n\\nthe granting of relief with respect to work requirements beyond a prisoner's physical capability and with respect to\\nreasonable medical attention. 247 F. Supp. at 687. Chief Judge Henley found that, at that time, there were no\\nwritten rules as to whipping; that such punishment was administered in the sole discretion of the one inflicting it,\\nsubject to an informal requirement that the blows not exceed ten for a single offense; and that two of those three\\npetitioners had been whipped and one beaten by a field-line supervisor-trusty. The judge noted that the Supreme\\nCourt of Arkansas, over 80 years ago, deplored the whipping of convicts, Werner v. State, 44 Ark. 122 (1884),\\nand that the Arkansas statutes do not themselves specifically prescribe whipping even as a punishment for crime.\\n[4]\\n He observed, however, that corporal punishment had not been viewed historically as a constitutionally\\nforbidden cruel and unusual punishment. The court concluded that it was not prepared to say that such\\npunishment was unconstitutional per se. Nevertheless, Judge Henley said, 247 F.Supp. at 689, this conclusion\\npresupposes that the infliction of such punishment is surrounded by appropriate safeguards, that is, it must not\\nbe excessive, it must be inflicted dispassionately and by responsible people, and it must be applied under\\nrecognizable standards so that the convict knows what conduct will cause him to be whipped and how much\\npunishment his conduct will produce. The court found that those safeguards did not exist in the Arkansas system\\nand enjoined further corporal punishment of the petitioners until they were established.\\n9. The Talley opinion was filed on November 15, 1965. As a result, the Board issued written rules and regulations\\non January 10, 1966. These were in effect until the district court decision in the present case was rendered June\\n3, 1967. In addition to a number of other provisions, the rules state that certain \\\"major offenses will warrant\\ncorporal punishment.\\\" The ones listed are homosexuality, agitation, insubordination, making or concealing\\nweapons, refusal to work when medically certified able to work, and participating in or inciting a riot. They further\\nstate:\\nNo inmate shall ever be authorized to inflict any corporal punishment under color of prison\\nauthority on another inmate.\\nPunishment shall not, in any case, exceed Ten lashes with the strap, the number of lashes to be\\nadministered shall be determined by a Board of inquiry, consisting of at least two officials of the\\nArkansas State Penitentiary, The Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent, and the head\\nWarden or an associate Warden. The Board of Inquiry will request that the accused inmate appear\\nbefore the Board and speak in his own behalf. No Punishment will be administered in the field.\\n10. The straps used in Arkansas vary somewhat but all are similar. Each is of leather and from 3\\u00bd to 5\\u00bd feet in\\nlength, about 4 inches wide, and \\u00bc inch thick. Each has a wooden handle 8 to 12 inches long.\\n11. Since Talley, whippings are administered by wardens. The prisoner lies face down and the blows are to his\\n575 buttocks. Supposedly, they are administered *575 while the prisoner is fully clothed. Petitioners Ernst and Mask,\\nhowever, testified without contradiction that they were required to lower their trousers and that they received\\nlashes on the bare buttocks. There is corroborating and other evidence to the same effect with respect to other\\ninmates and there was proof, some offered through the State Police, of deep bruises and bleeding.\\n12. Whipping is the primary disciplinary measure used in the Arkansas system. Prisioners there have few\\nprivileges which can be withheld from them as punishment. Facilities for segregation and solitary confinement are\\nlimited.\\n13. There is testimony that the strap hurts the inmate's pride, that it has been needed in order to preserve\\ndiscipline, and that the work level improves after its administration. Contrarily, there is testimony that the whipping\\ngenerates hate in the inmate who is whipped and that this hate flows toward the whipper, the institution and the\\nsystem.\\n14. The circumstances relative to the punishment administered to the plaintiffs as well as to others and relative to\\nvarious disciplinary matters are set forth in detail in the district court's opinion. 268 F.Supp. at 809-813. The\\ntestimony of James V. Bennett, former Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and that of Fred T. Wilkinson,\\nDirector of the Department of Corrections of the State of Missouri (and former Deputy Director of the Federal\\nBureau of Prisons) are summarized in the district court's opinion. 268 F.Supp. at 813-814. This testimony is to the\\neffect that, among other things, corporal punishment has not been used for disciplinary purposes in federal\\n\\nprisons for years and that only Mississippi, in addition to Arkansas, uses it officially. Testifying as a penologist, it\\nwas Mr. Bennett's opinion that the whippings administered to the three plaintiffs were \\\"cruel, degrading and\\ncertainly they were unusual in this day and age.\\\" Mr. Wilkinson testified that use of the strap \\\"is cruel and unusual\\nand unnecessary.\\\"\\n15. On July 20, 1966, six months after the issuance of the January 1966 regulations, plaintiff Ernst received two\\nwhippings of ten lashes each to the bare buttocks within a period of 45 minutes.\\n16. In August 1966 the Superintendent became aware of irregularities. An investigation disclosed violations of\\nserious import. A number of wardens resigned or were discharged. The plaintiffs' cases were filed while this\\ninvestigation was under way. The present Superintendent candidly does not seek to defend everything which has\\ntaken place.\\n17. The district judges concluded that the post-Talley rules and regulations of January 1966 still did not provide\\nadequate safeguards. The use of the strap was therefore enjoined until further safeguards were provided. The\\ncourt observed that more than one person's judgment should be required for a decision to administer corporal\\n[5]\\npunishment.\\n576 *576 So much for the facts. Certain legal principles, which have general application here, are well established\\nand admit of no real controversy:\\n1. Lawful incarceration may properly operate to deprive the convict of certain rights which would otherwise be his\\nto enjoy. Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948). A classic example is\\nArkansas' denial to the felon of the right to vote. Ark.Const. art. 3, \\u00a7 1 (as amended by Amendment No. 8); Ark.\\nStat.Ann. \\u00a7 3-101 (Repl.1956); City of Newport v. Smith, 236 Ark. 626, 367 S.W.2d 742 (1963). Other states do\\nthe same. See, for instance, N.D.Const. art. V, \\u00a7 127, N.D.Cent.Code \\u00a7 16-01-04 (1960), and State ex rel. Olson\\nv. Langer, 65 N.D. 68, 256 N.W. 377 (1934); Mo. Const. art. VIII \\u00a7 2, VAMS \\u00a7 111.060 (1966), and State ex rel.\\nBarrett v. Sartorious, 351 Mo. 1237, 175 S.W.2d 787, 789-790, 149 A.L.R. 1067 (1943); Minn.Const. art. 7, \\u00a7 2.\\n2. The only federal restraint to state action of this kind lies in the Constitution and in the statutes in enforcement\\nthereof, specifically, the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection and due process clauses, and the Fifteenth\\nAmendment's proscription of the denial to citizens of the United States of the right to vote \\\"on account of race,\\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.\\\" Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 647, 86 S.Ct. 1717, 16 L.Ed.2d\\n828 (1966); Harper v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 665, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966); \\nCarrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 775, 13 L. Ed.2d 675 (1965); State ex rel. Olson v. Langer, supra,\\n256 N.W. at 385-386. But previous criminal record has been referred to as among the \\\"obvious examples\\nindicating factors which a State may take into consideration in determining the qualifications of voters.\\\" Lassiter v.\\nNorthampton County Bd. of Elections, 360 U.S. 45, 51, 79 S.Ct. 985, 990, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1959); Davis v.\\nBeason, 133 U.S. 333, 346-347, 10 S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637 (1890).\\n3. On the other hand, a prisoner of the state does not lose all his civil rights during and because of his\\nincarceration. In particular, he continues to be protected by the due process and equal protection clauses which\\nfollow him through the prison doors. Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L. Ed.2d 1030 (1964); Ex\\nparte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034 (1941).\\n4. Despite earlier comments to the contrary, see, for example, In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 446, 10 S.Ct. 930,\\n34 L.Ed. 519 (1890); O'Neil v. Vermont, 144 U.S. 323, 332, 12 S.Ct. 693, 36 L.Ed. 450 (1892); and Collins v.\\nJohnston, 237 U.S. 502, 510-511, 35 S.Ct. 649, 59 L.Ed. 1071 (1915), the Eighth Amendment's guarantee\\nagainst the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments seems now to have come to be regarded as directly\\napplicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Robinson v. California,\\n370 U.S. 660, 666, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962), and Mr. Justice Douglas in concurrence at 675, 82 S.Ct.\\n1417; Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 522 (2 Cir. 1967). See State of La. ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S.\\n459, 463, 67 S.Ct. 374, 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947) and Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 531-532, 88 S.Ct. 2145, 20\\nL.Ed.2d 1254 (1968).\\n577\\n\\n*577 5. The federal courts, including this one, entertain a natural reluctance to interfere with a prison's internal\\ndiscipline. This is true with respect to federal institutions, Glenn v. Ciccone, 370 F.2d 361, 363 (8 Cir. 1966); \\nSutton v. Settle, 302 F.2d 286, 288 (8 Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 930, 83 S.Ct. 876, 9 L.Ed.2d 734; Garcia\\nv. Steele, 193 F.2d 276, 278 (8 Cir. 1951), see Holland v. Ciccone, 386 F.2d 825 (8 Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390\\nU.S. 1045, 88 S.Ct. 1646, 20 L.Ed.2d 307, as well as to state prisons, Douglas v. Sigler, 386 F.2d 684, 688 (8 Cir.\\n1967); Lee v. Tahash, 352 F. 2d 970, 971 (8 Cir. 1965); Wright v. McMann, supra, 387 F.2d at 522.\\n6. However, the courts, including this one, have not hesitated to entertain petitions asserting violations of\\nfundamental rights and, where indicated, to grant relief. In Glenn v. Ciccone, which we have just cited, this court\\nclearly indicated that \\\"a factual showing of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment\\\"\\nwould support interference by a federal court. 370 F. 2d at 363. We have made a like statement in many other\\ncases. Carey v. Settle, 351 F.2d 483, 485 (8 Cir. 1965); Haynes v. Harris, 344 F.2d 463, 466 (8 Cir. 1965); Harris\\nv. Settle, 322 F.2d 908, 910 (8 Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 910, 84 S.Ct. 1171, 12 L.Ed.2d 179. Although\\nthe Eighth Circuit cases just cited concern a federal institution, the principle, of course, has equal application to a\\nstate penitentiary. Wright v. McMann, supra, 387 F.2d at 522; Howard v. Smyth, 365 F.2d 428 (4 Cir. 1966), cert.\\ndenied, 385 U.S. 988, 87 S.Ct. 599, 17 L.Ed.2d 449.\\nThis takes us then to a consideration of the meaning and scope of the Eighth Amendment's proscription of the\\ninfliction of \\\"cruel and unusual punishments.\\\" The phrase appeared in the English Bill of Rights of December 16,\\n1689, 1 W. and M. s.2, c.2 but seems to have had still earlier antecedents in Magna Charta and elsewhere. IV\\nBlackstone, Commentaries, 379.\\nThe Supreme Court long ago acknowledged, \\\"Difficulty would attend the effort to define with exactness the extent\\nof the constitutional provision which provides that cruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted * * *.\\\" \\nWilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130, 135-136, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1878). This difficulty, and the absence of an exact or\\nexhaustive definition of the Amendment's ban, has been repeatedly noted. In re Kemmler, supra, 136 U.S. at 447,\\n10 S.Ct. 930; Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 368-371, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910); Trop v. Dulles,\\n356 U.S. 86, 87, 99, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958).\\nThere are, however, indications, by specific holdings and other observations, which bear upon the extent and\\nreach of the Eighth Amendment's proscription. Thus in Wilkerson v. Utah, execution by public shooting, and in In\\nre Kemmler, execution by electrocution, were classified as outside the ban. But in Wilkerson, 99 U.S. at 136, the\\nCourt observed \\\"it is safe to affirm that punishments of torture * * * and all others in the same line of unnecessary\\ncruelty, are forbidden * * *\\\" In Kemmler, 136 U.S. at 446-447, 10 S.Ct. at 933, the Court describes, as within the\\nconstitutional prohibition, punishments which are \\\"manifestly cruel and unusual, as burning at the stake,\\ncrucifixion, breaking on the wheel, or the like\\\" and, as cruel, those which \\\"involve torture or a lingering death.\\\"\\nAnd it said that the word \\\"cruel,\\\" as used in the Eighth Amendment, \\\"implies there something inhuman and\\nbarbarous, 00 something more than the mere extinguishment of life.\\\" 136 U.S. at 447, 10 S.Ct. at 933. In O'Neil v.\\n97\\nVermont, supra, 144 U.S. at 339-340, and 364, 12 S.Ct. 693, Mr. Justice Field, in dissent (joined by Justices\\nHarlan and Brewer, 144 U.S. at 370-371, 12 S.Ct. 693), advanced the thought that the Amendment's \\\"inhibition is\\ndirected, not only against punishments of the character mentioned, but against all punishments which by their\\n578 excessive length or severity are greatly disproportioned to the offenses *578 charged.\\\" He went on to say that\\nalthough a state has the power to whip for petty offenses, \\\"repulsive as such mode of punishment is,\\\" the\\nincrease of such punishment by accumulation for multiple offenses could be both unusual and cruel. 144 U.S. at\\n340, 12 S.Ct. at 699.\\nIn Weems v. United States, supra, the Court observed, 217 U.S. at 373, 30 S. Ct. at 551, that \\\"a principle, to be\\nvital, must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth. This is peculiarly true of\\nconstitutions.\\\" The majority condemned a Philippine statute on the ground that the disparity between the\\npunishment it imposed (cadena temporal for 15 years, that is, among other things, \\\"hard and painful labor,\\\" with a\\nchain at the ankle, hanging from the wrists, and with outside assistance denied) for a false entry in a public\\nrecord and that imposed for more serious crimes made it repugnant to the Philippine Bill of Rights forbidding\\ncruel and unusual punishment.\\nIn State of La. ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, supra, 329 U.S. at 463, 67 S.Ct. at 376, the Court spoke of the\\n\\\"traditional humanity of modern Anglo-American law\\\" and \\\"unnecessary pain\\\" and the \\\"wanton infliction of pain,\\\"\\n\\nand the dissent referred, at page 473, 67 S. Ct. at 381, to that which \\\"shocks the most fundamental instincts of\\ncivilized man.\\\" Mr. Justice Douglas, concurring, in Robinson v. California, supra, 370 U.S. at 676, 82 S.Ct. at\\n1425, said, \\\"The Eighth Amendment expresses the revulsion of civilized man against barbarous acts 00 the `cry of\\n97\\nhorror' against man's inhumanity to his fellow man.\\\" In Rudolph v. Alabama, 375 U.S. 889, 84 S.Ct. 155, 11\\nL.Ed.2d 119 (1963), three dissenters to the denial of certiorari spoke of \\\"standards of decency more or less\\nuniversally accepted,\\\" of disproportion between offense and punishment, and of \\\"unnecessary cruelty.\\\" In Dyke v.\\nTaylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U.S. 216, 223, 88 S.Ct. 1472, 20 L.Ed.2d 538 (1968), Mr. Justice Douglas, in\\ndissent, referred to the historical fact (noted by Mr. Justice Harlan, in dissent, in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S.\\n145, 191-192, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491, 522 (1968)) that petty offenses once entailed whipping as\\npunishments, but said, \\\"I am loath to hold whippings * * * as `petty.'\\\"\\nThis court has added its word. It has described the situation where a court will interfere with prison discipline as\\none \\\"of such character or consequence as to shock general conscience or to be intolerable in fundamental\\nfairness, and so to amount to illegal administration of prison sentence.\\\" Carey v. Settle, supra, 351 F.2d at 485.\\nJudge Johnsen there went on to say that it is possible for the form or extent of institutional treatment to offend the\\nEighth Amendment. In a later case concerning a state prisoner, Judge Johnsen repeated these observations and\\nsaid,\\n\\\"Such treatment is entitled to be held to be within the ban of the Eighth Amendment as\\nrepresenting cruel and unusual punishment and so constituting unlawful administration of prison\\nsentence. It may be observed in this connection that penal admeasurements made by general\\nconscience and sense of fundamental fairness doubtless will not be without some relationship to\\nthe humane concepts and reactions of present-day social climate.\\\" Lee v. Tahash, supra, 352 F.2d\\nat 972.\\nThe principal opinion in Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed. 2d 630 (1958), although it\\ncommanded the votes of only four justices a decade ago, is, in our view, practicularly pertinent. The issue was\\nthe validity of a federal statute which would denationalize a native born citizen who deserts the military service in\\ntime of war and is convicted thereof by a court-martial and dismissed or dishonorably discharged. The opinion\\nprovides guidelines and overtones which we feel safe in regarding as illustrative of the general thinking of a\\nmajority of the justices on the subject today. The opinion casts aside the death penalty \\\"as an index of the\\n579 constitutional *579 limit on punishment,\\\" for it \\\"has been employed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is\\nstill widely accepted, it cannot be said to violate the constitutional concept of cruelty.\\\" 356 U.S. at 99, 78 S.Ct. at\\n597. The Eighth Amendment's basic concept \\\"is nothing less than the dignity of man\\\" and assures that a state's\\npunishment power \\\"be exercised within the limits of civilized standards.\\\" Fines, imprisonment, and even\\nexecution may be imposed \\\"but any technique outside the bounds of these traditional penalties is constitutionally\\nsuspect.\\\" 356 U.S. at 100, 78 S.Ct. at 598. The scope of the Amendment is not \\\"static.\\\" It \\\"must draw its meaning\\nfrom the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\\\" 356 U.S. at 102, 78 S.Ct.\\nat 598. Virtually all the world's civilized nations refuse to impose statelessness as punishment for crime. 356 U.S.\\nat 102, 78 S.Ct. at 598.\\nFrom that opinion we glean a recognition of, and a reliance in part upon, attitudes of contemporary society and\\ncomparative law. And the emphasis is on man's basic dignity, on civilized precepts, and on flexibility and\\nimprovement in standards of decency as society progresses and matures. Finally, it is \\\"any technique\\\" outside\\nthe traditional bounds which \\\"is constitutionally suspect.\\\"\\nIn summary, then, so far as the Supreme Court cases are concerned, we have a flat recognition that the limits of\\nthe Eighth Amendment's proscription are not easily or exactly defined, and we also have clear indications that the\\napplicable standards are flexible, that disproportion, both among punishments and between punishment and\\ncrime, is a factor to be considered, and that broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity,\\nand decency are useful and usable. We recognize that some of these utterances by the Court were made in\\nconcurrence or dissent or in the approach, evidently now superseded, through the Fourteenth Amendment's due\\nprocess clause rather than jointly through the Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments. All this, however, strikes us as\\nof no import because we read and ascertain in the totality of the language used the basic attitude of the entire\\nCourt to the Eighth Amendment.\\n\\nWith these principles and guidelines before us, we have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the use of the\\nstrap in the penitentiaries of Arkansas is punishment which, in this last third of the 20th century, runs afoul of the\\nEighth Amendment; that the strap's use, irrespective of any precautionary conditions which may be imposed,\\noffends contemporary concepts of decency and human dignity and precepts of civilization which we profess to\\npossess; and that it also violates those standards of good conscience and fundamental fairness enunciated by\\nthis court in the Carey and Lee cases.\\nOur reasons for this conclusion include the following: (1) We are not convinced that any rule or regulation as to\\nthe use of the strap, however seriously or sincerely conceived and drawn, will successfully prevent abuse. The\\npresent record discloses misinterpretation and obvious overnarrow interpretation even of the newly adopted\\nJanuary 1966 rules. (2) Rules in this area seem often to go unobserved. Despite the January 1966 requirement\\nthat no inmate was to inflict punishment on another, the record is replete with instances where this very thing took\\nplace. (3) Regulations are easily circumvented. Although it was a long-standing requirement that a whipping was\\nto be administered only when the prisoner was fully clothed, this record discloses instances of whippings upon\\nthe bare buttocks, and with consequent injury. (4) Corporal punishment is easily subject to abuse in the hands of\\nthe sadistic and the unscrupulous. (5) Where power to punish is granted to persons in lower levels of\\nadministrative authority, there is an inherent and natural difficulty in enforcing the limitations of that power. (6)\\nThere can be no argument that excessive whipping or an inappropriate manner of whipping or too great\\n580 frequency of whipping or the *580 use of studded or overlong straps all constitute cruel and unusual punishment.\\nBut if whipping were to be authorized, how does one, or any court, ascertain the point which would distinguish the\\npermissible from that which is cruel and unusual? (7) Corporal punishment generates hate toward the keepers\\nwho punish and toward the system which permits it. It is degrading to the punisher and to the punished alike. It\\nfrustrates correctional and rehabilitative goals. This record cries out with testimony to this effect from the expert\\npenologists, from the inmates and from their keepers. (8) Whipping creates other penological problems and\\nmakes adjustment to society more difficult. (9) Public opinion is obviously adverse. Counsel concede that only\\ntwo states still permit the use of the strap. Thus almost uniformly has it been abolished. It has been expressly\\noutlawed by statute in a number of states. See for example, N.D.Cent. Code \\u00a7 12-47-26 (1960); S.D.Code \\u00a7\\n13.4715 (1939). And 48 states, including Arkansas, have constitutional provisions against cruel or unusual\\npunishment. Ark.Const. art. 2, \\u00a7 9.\\nWe are not convinced contrarily by any suggestion that the State needs this tool for disciplinary purposes and is\\ntoo poor to provide other accepted means of prisoner regulation. Humane considerations and constitutional\\nrequirements are not, in this day, to be measured or limited by dollar considerations or by the thickness of the\\nprisoner's clothing.\\nAlthough their fact situations are somewhat different, we regard the following cases as helpfully significant in this\\narea: Jordan v. Fitzharris, 257 F. Supp. 674 (N.D.Cal.1966); Landman v. Peyton, 370 F.2d 135, 139-141 (4 Cir.\\n1966), cert. denied, 388 U.S. 920, 87 S. Ct. 2142, 18 L.Ed.2d 1367; Fulwood v.

Tinsley, 337 F.2d 845, 846 (10 Cir. 1964), cert.\\ndenied, 380 U.S. 985, 85 S.Ct. 1354, 14 L.Ed.2d 277.\\nThere is authority, some of it recent, with seemingly contrary indications. Certain of these cases rest on the\\npresence of specific statutory provision for corporal punishment for crime. State v. Revis, 193 N.C. 192, 136 S.E.\\n346, 50 A.L.R. 98 (1927); Westbrook v.

Convicts \\u00a7 11 (1939) and 41 Am.Jur., Prisons and Prisoners, \\u00a7 37 (1942).\\n\\nWe choose to draw no significant distinction between the word \\\"cruel\\\" and the word \\\"unusual\\\" in the Eighth\\nAmendment. See Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S. at 100 n. 32, 78 S.Ct. 590. We would not wish to place\\nourselves in the position of condoning punishment which is shown to be only \\\"cruel\\\" but not \\\"unusual\\\" or vice\\nversa. In any event, the testimony of the two expert penologists clearly demonstrates that the use of the strap in\\nthis day is unusual and we encounter no difficulty in holding that its use is cruel.\\nNeither do we wish to draw, in this context, any meaningful distinction between punishment by way of sentence\\n581 statutorily prescribed and punishment *581 imposed for prison disciplinary purposes. It seems to us that the\\nEighth Amendment's proscription has application to both.\\nThe district court's decree is vacated and the case is remanded with directions to enter a new decree embracing\\nthe injunctive relief heretofore granted but, in addition, restraining the Superintendent of the Arkansas State\\nPenitentiary and all personnel of the penitentiary system from inflicting corporal punishment, including the use of\\nthe strap, as a disciplinary measure.\\n[1] Plaintiff Jackson is presently on parole.\\n[2] Jackson (\\\"Petition for a writ of habeas corpus\\\"); Ernst (\\\"Petition for writ of mandamus\\\"); Mask (\\\"Motion and\\npetition for physical examination * * * also a federal restraining order * * *\\\"). None of the plaintiffs questions the\\nlegality of his confinement or claims that he is entitled to release.\\n[3] The parties have stipulated that \\\"the facts * * * as found and stated relative to physical facts, methods of\\ncorporal punishment and organization of Cummins Farm and Tucker Farm, as they existed prior to and at the\\ntime of trial in the case of and as reflected by the printed opinion in the case of Talley v. Stephens, 247 F.Supp.\\n683, are true and correct and may be considered by the Court in these proceedings.\\\"\\n[4] Some state statutes do. See, for example, 11 Delaware Code, \\u00a7\\u00a7 631, 811, 3905, 3906, 3907, and 3908.\\n[5] At oral argument we were advised that since the entry of the district court's decree other new rules and\\nregulations have been adopted. These list the major offenses which \\\"will warrant punishment.\\\" They recite that no\\ninmate shall ever be authorized to inflict corporal punishment on another. Before punishment is imposed, a full\\nhearing before a Board of Inquiry is required. The accusing warden may not sit on the Board of Inquiry or take\\npart in carrying out the punishment. Punishment may include solitary confinement, reduction of rations, corporal\\npunishment, loss of mail, recreation and other privileges, loss of future good time, and recording the offense for\\nparole purposes. Corporal punishment shall not exceed ten lashes with the strap and a period in solitary\\nconfinement. In no case may the strap be applied to the bare buttocks. An accuser or other inmate shall not\\nadminister the strap. The strap shall not be used in the fields. No inmate shall be whipped within 24 hours of any\\npreceding whipping. Each inmate sentenced to corporal punishment has the right of appeal to the superintendent\\nor the assistant superintendent and this official or his designee may change the sentence. It is stated that\\ncorporal punishment is not deemed necessary at Tucker because the inmates are youthful first offenders. \\nWe were also advised that at a meeting of the Board held February 29, 1968, with all members in attendance, a\\nresolution was adopted that corporal punishment in any form \\\"be abolished as a means of discipline in the\\ninstitution.\\\"\\nThese changes, of course, do not render the present appeal moot.

YOUNG, District Judges.\\nThese are suits in equity brought under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 by three inmates of the Arkansas State Penitentiary\\nagainst O. E. Bishop, Superintendent of the Penitentiary. The cases first became known to the court through\\nhandwritten petitions filed by each of the prisoners seeking various forms of relief. The court allowed the petitions\\nto be filed in forma pauperis and treated each one as a complaint for equitable relief under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983.\\nCounsel was appointed for the prisoners, and after investigation an amended complaint was filed seeking an\\ninjunctive relief and making the cases class actions. Although one of the cases was assigned to Judge Harris and\\nthe other two to Judge Young, they were consolidated for trial due to the similarity of the issues presented, and\\nboth judges sat as a panel of two for the trial.\\nThe plaintiffs make several alternative claims or contentions for themselves and other prison inmates:\\nFirst, they contend that the infliction of corporal punishment in any form constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\\ncontrary to the prohibitions of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as made applicable by the\\nFourteenth Amendment to the States.\\nSecondly and alternatively, they contend that the use of the strap or \\\"hide\\\" as a means of punishing inmates in\\nthe Penitentiary under any circumstances is cruel and unusual so as to be unconstitutional.\\nThirdly, they contend that the imposition of administrative rules or regulations concerning the use of the strap\\ndoes not make it a constitutionally permissible method of prison discipline.\\nPlaintiffs' fourth contention is actually twofold: (1) they claim that the rules concerning corporal punishment\\nadopted by the Arkansas State Penitentiary Board do not adequately protect the prisoners from unconstitutional\\n[1]\\ntreatment nor do they conform to the requirements that this court set out in the Talley  decision; and (2) the\\nrules which have been promulgated by the Prison Board have been violated in the administration of corporal\\npunishment upon the inmates.\\n\\nFinally, each of the plaintiffs contends that although he has some physical impairment which would prevent him\\nfrom doing the work of an average man, he nevertheless is classified as \\\"average\\\" for prison work purposes, is\\nrequired to perform difficult physical labor, and is whipped when he fails to perform. Each claims that this is\\ncontrary to his constitutional right to due process and equal protection of the law and that it is also\\nunconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment.\\nThe defendant denies that corporal punishment per se or use of the strap as carried out by prison officials is cruel\\nand unusual in the constitutional sense. He relies primarily upon this court's earlier decision in the Talley case\\nand upon the rules and regulations adopted by the Penitentiary Board pursuant to that decision. He admits that\\ncertain rule violations and other unlawful acts occurred at the Penitentiary but claims that these matters have\\nbeen remedied by administrative action. Defendant denies that any injunctive relief for these plaintiffs or anyone\\nin their class is necessary or justified.\\nThe court appointed Edward L. Wright of Little Rock and William S. Arnold of Crossett, both highly respected and\\n807 experienced members of the Arkansas Bar, to represent the plaintiffs without *807 charge. They have done so\\nmost capably, and the court thanks them for their services.\\nThat the court has jurisdiction and that these are proper cases to be brought under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 is not\\nquestioned by either party. These matters are fully discussed in the Talley decision supra at 686. However, at the\\noutset we want to point out that the court is especially conscious of the limitations of its function in cases of this\\nkind.\\nIt is well settled that the administration of state prison discipline is the primary responsibility of state officials, and\\nfederal courts have an extremely limited area in which they may act pertaining to the treatment of prisoners\\nconfined to state penal institutions. State officials must of necessity have wide discretion and control over\\ndisciplinary measures in order to properly maintain the prison system as well as to protect the public. Wright v.\\nMcMann, 257 F.Supp. 739 (D.C.N.Y.1966). United States ex rel. Atterbury v. Ragen, 237 F. 2d 953 (7 Cir. 1956). \\nTalley v. Stephens, supra (and cases cited therein). Therefore this court cannot and will not become appellate in\\nnature and review each prison administration decision to punish a prisoner.\\nHowever, it is equally well settled that there are exceptions to these rules when special circumstances exist and\\nconstitutional rights are involved. See Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030; Childs v.\\nPegelow, 321 F. 2d 487 (4 Cir. 1963); Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034; Talley v.\\nStephens, supra.\\nAs was said in Talley, page 686 of 247 F.Supp., \\\"Although persons convicted of crimes lose many of the rights\\nand privileges of law abiding citizens, it is established by now that they do not lose all of their civil rights, and that\\nthe Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment follow them into the prison * * *\\\"\\nWe feel that the complaints in these cases raise several constitutional questions which merit the court's attention.\\nIn order to understand the issues in their proper perspective, it is necessary to set out some of the facts about,\\nand the recent history of the Arkansas State Penitentiary.\\nThe Arkansas Penitentiary System is under the general supervision of a fiveman honorary commission known as\\nthe State Penitentiary Board but actual supervision is by them delegated to a Superintendent.\\nThe plant of the System consists of two farms. One is known as Cummins Farm and contains approximately\\n15,500 acres, with 8,200 acres being under cultivation. Cummins Farm is located near Grady, Arkansas, and\\nnormally houses approximately 1,600 inmates; Superintendent O. E. Bishop resides at Cummins Farm. The other\\nfarm is known as Tucker Farm and contains approximately 4,500 acres, with approximately 3,000 acres being\\nunder cultivation. Tucker Farm is situated at Tucker, Arkansas, and normally houses approximately 275 inmates.\\nCummins Farm and Tucker Farm are approximately fifty miles apart by highway.\\nPersonnel, other than inmates under sentence, at Cummins Farm consists of the Superintendent and 25 paid\\nemployees, with 20 being supervision wardens; and at Tucker Farm consists of an assistant superintendent and\\nfive paid employees, but only three supervision wardens. Customarily both farms make use of inmates, called\\n\\ntrusties, in supervisory and overseeing capacities in the fields, in the barracks, and as security guards. The\\nprimary activity of inmates at both farms is agricultural work with row crops and garden type produce being\\nplanted, cultivated and harvested principally by hand labor. A dairy herd and a beef herd are also maintained for\\n[2]\\nfood.\\n808 *808 In the fall of 1965 certain irregularities at the Penitentiary were brought to the court's attention by three\\ninmates who filed suits similar to the ones now before the court. This court, with Judge Henley presiding, heard\\nthose cases and rendered its decision in November 1965. Talley v. Stephens, supra. The chief contention of the\\nplaintiffs in those cases was that the use of corporal punishment at the Arkansas State Penitentiary for\\ndisciplinary purposes was cruel and unusual and violative of the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs.\\nThe court found that it could not say that corporal punishment per se was unconstitutional. It went on to say:\\n\\\"But, the Court's unwillingness to say that the Constitution forbids the imposition of any and all\\ncorporal punishment on convicts presupposes that its infliction is surrounded by appropriate\\nsafeguards. It must not be excessive; it must be inflicted as dispassionately as possible and by\\nresponsible people; and it must be applied in reference to recognizable standards whereby a\\nconvict may know what conduct on his part will cause him to be whipped and how much\\npunishment given conduct may produce.\\\"\\nShortly after this decision, the Superintendent of the Penitentiary resigned; and on January 1, 1966, Mr. O. E.\\nBishop, the present Superintendent, was appointed. On January 10, 1966, the Penitentiary Board through Mr.\\nBishop promulgated a set of rules and regulations for the Penitentiary which include, inter alia, the following rules\\nsetting forth the offenses which merit corporal punishment as well as the procedures to be followed in\\nadministering such punishment.\\n\\\"OFFENSES AND PUNISHMENT:\\n\\\"A great part of your time here will be spent in the barracks you are assigned to. Barracks rules\\nand procedure will be posted in the barracks. Your conduct, personal cleanliness and attitude\\nwhile in the barracks is an important part of your prison record. \\\"These major offenses will warrant\\ncorporal punishment:\\\"\\n(1) Homosexuality.\\n(2) Agitation (defined as one who creates turmoil and disturbances).\\n(3) Insubordination (resisting authority or refusing to obey orders).\\n(4) Making or concealing of weapons.\\n(5) Refusal to work when medically certified able to work.\\n(6) Participating in or inciting a riot.\\n\\\"(7) No inmate shall ever be authorized to inflict any corporal punishment under color of prison\\nauthority on another inmate.\\n\\\"Punishment shall not, in any case, exceed Ten lashes with the strap, the number of lashes to be\\nadministered shall be determined by a Board of inquiry, consisting of at least two officials of the\\nArkansas State Penitentiary, The Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent, and the head\\nWarden or an associate Warden. The Board of Inquiry will request that the accused inmate appear\\nbefore the Board and speak in his own behalf. No Punishment will be administered in the field.\\\"\\n(Although these rules were adopted as a result of the Talley case, they were never approved by\\nthe court.)\\nEach inmate, as well as the employees of the Penitentiary, was given a copy of the rules and was instructed to\\nbecome familiar with and understand each of them. New prisoners were similarly instructed.\\n\\nIn August of 1966 Superintendent Bishop became aware of irregularities at the Tucker Prison Farm and\\nrequested that the Criminal Investigation Division of the Arkansas State Police conduct an investigation. The\\ninvestigation disclosed rank violations of the rules by certain of the Prison officials. Shortly thereafter all of the\\nwardens at Tucker Farm were discharged or allowed to resign. Since that time there have been three new\\n809 assistant superintendents in *809 charge of Tucker Farm in quick succession, as well as other personnel\\nchanges.\\nSubsequently the Arkansas Legislature through a special commission, as well as the Penitentiary Board,\\nconducted various investigations of the penal system. As a result, many desirable changes have been brought\\nabout in the administration of the two farms.\\nThese cases were filed in the fall of 1966 and it was during their preparation for trial that the aforementioned\\ninvestigations were taking place. Therefore, by the time of the trial many of the activities complained of had\\nceased and many of the individuals involved no longer were employed by the Penitentiary.\\nThe trial of these cases lasted some three days, in which the court heard testimony from fifteen prisoners, several\\nmembers and ex-members of the Prison personnel, one doctor, and two expert penologists. Some of the\\ntestimony pertained to strappings and other whippings which took place prior to the Talley decision in 1965. The\\ncourt ruled that this testimony would be admitted only for the purpose of showing the background or history and\\nwould not be relevant to the type of punishment used in the Prison system since the changes brought about by\\nthe Talley decision, or more particularly since the rules were promulgated in January of 1966.\\nThe strap which is referred to throughout this opinion is made of leather and is between four and five feet long\\nand four inches wide. This leather is bradded to a wooden handle approximately six inches in length. The strap is\\nabout one-fourth inch thick at the end attached to the wooden handle and is gradually tapered toward the end\\nwhich comes in contact with the person being whipped. The evidence showed that there is more than one strap\\nused at the Penitentiary but all are of approximately the same construction. Some of these straps are depicted in\\nplaintiffs' exhibit No. 4.\\nEvidence relating to the petitioners herein.\\nThe evidence showed that the plaintiff Jackson, age 28, entered the prison in 1963 to serve a five year sentence\\nfor burglary. Jackson testified to having been subjected to physical beatings three times since he has been in\\n[3]\\nprison. First, in 1965, James Pike, a trusty and long line rider,  (an escapee at the time of this trial) hit him\\nseveral times with his fist, as well as kicking him two or three times. The testimony was unclear as to what the\\n[4]\\npurpose of this whipping was. In November of 1965 Jackson was whipped with the strap by Captain  Harmon, a\\nfield warden at the Penitentiary, for not picking enough cotton. He has been whipped only once since the rules\\nwere promulgated in January 1966.\\nOn July 29, 1966, Jackson and seven other inmates received eight lashes with the strap for leaving okra in the\\nfield. Jackson testified that he was charged by the long line rider with overlooking okra and was taken by Captain\\nHarmon to the office of Clay Smith, Head Warden at Cummins Farm. In the process of conducting a hearing on\\nthe matter, Captain Smith informed the inmates of the charges against them and asked if each was familiar with\\nthe rules of the Penitentiary. He then asked if anyone would like to make a statement, and Jackson told Captain\\nSmith that he had picked all the okra he could see and that he was having eye problems and needed glasses.\\nCaptain Smith called for Jackson's medical record to determine the condition of Jackson's eyes. After checking\\nthese records and finding that Jackson had been certified as physically able for normal work, he then sentenced\\neach prisoner to receive eight lashes with the strap. These lashes were administered by Captain Dean, another\\n810 warden at the *810 Prison. Prisoners were required to lie face down on a concrete floor while Captain Dean\\nadministered the licks to the buttocks. Jackson testified that the whipping caused much pain and left his buttocks\\nbruised and sore for a number of days. The prisoners were returned to the field, where they continued to pick\\nokra for the rest of the day without incident.\\n\\nFurther evidence shows that at the time of the whipping Jackson had, and still has, a visual defect of the left eye.\\nThere is also a slight variance from normal vision in the right eye but this is within the normal vision for reading.\\nShortly after the whipping he was taken to the nearby city of Pine Bluff for an eye examination and the examining\\n[5]\\ndoctor did not recommend glasses for him.\\nPlaintiff Ernst is 24 years old and has been in the penitentiary (Tucker Farm) since January 19, 1963. He has\\nreceived seven whippings during his entire stay. The first three of these were administered before the rules were\\npromulgated. They involve charges of scuffling in the barracks, not working hard enough in the fields, and cursing\\na trusty guard.\\nIn January of 1966, shortly after the rules were promulgated, Ernst received ten lashes upon a charge of talking\\n[6]\\nback to an overseer known as a yardman.  He was called to Assistant Superintendent Bruton's office on the\\nmorning following the alleged offense and was told that he was charged with talking back to the yardman, was\\nrequired to lie face down on the floor, and receive ten licks with the strap. No other wardens or other prison\\nofficials were present during the charge or the whipping.\\nSometime later in 1966 he received ten licks from Captain Mayes for throwing his hat across the Prison yard. The\\nprisoners are told that they must wear their hats in the field and also that they must care for and not misuse the\\nclothing issued to them. Ernst testified that on this evening as he returned to the barracks from the field he took\\noff his hat and threw it across the Prison yard onto the ground. Upon seeing this, Captain Mayes called him over,\\ntook him into the barracks, made him lie down and gave him ten lashes with the strap. There were no other\\nwardens or other prison personnel present at this whipping.\\nOn July 20, 1966, plaintiff Ernst was picking cucumbers in the field and was charged by the long line rider with\\nnot working and leaving cucumbers on the vines. Ernst responded by saying that he was working the best he\\ncould on the food that was fed him and that he was feeling ill. The rider reported Ernst to Captain Mayes, who\\ntook him from the fields to the barracks and gave him ten lashes with the strap. This time Ernst was required to\\nlower his pants and was whipped on the bare buttocks, which he testified cut and bruised him and caused a great\\ndeal of pain. There was no hearing or formal charge and there were no other wardens present. Ernst was then\\nreturned to the field to continue his work. Some forty-five minutes or an hour later, the long line rider approached\\nErnst and started picking cucumbers back down the row upon which Ernst had just been working. He picked\\napproximately a half bushel of cucumbers from the area in which Ernst had been working since returning from the\\nfirst whipping. The rider again reported Ernst to Captain Mayes. Ernst was returned to the barracks and taken to\\nCaptain Bruton, who was shown the cucumbers and told what had happened. Captain Bruton instructed Captain\\nMayes to give Ernst ten lashes. He was again required to lower his pants and lie face down on the concrete floor\\n811 to receive the licks. Ernst testified that this whipping left large bruises and caused *811 him to bleed. Captain\\n[7]\\nBruton was present during this whipping and when it was over he ordered Ernst to stand on the \\\"teeter board\\\"\\ninside the barracks until he was told to get off. Ernst testified that he was required to remain on the teeter board\\nfor the rest of the day or about three or four hours. According to Ernst this treatment caused his legs and ankles\\nto swell and ache. He has not been whipped since that day.\\nPlaintiff Mask is twenty years old and has been in prison since November 12, 1965. He spent his first four and a\\nhalf months at the Cummins Farm and was then sent to Tucker and has been there since that time. He has\\nreceived five whippings with the strap since coming to Tucker. The first such whipping was in June of 1966, when\\nhe was charged by a long line rider with being the last in the field or working too slow and was taken to Captain\\nFletcher. Captain Fletcher administered ten licks. One week later he was reported leaving cucumbers in the field.\\nHe was taken to Captain Bruton, who told him to get his pants down and lie on the floor. Captain Fletcher gave\\nhim ten licks. Plaintiff testified that two months later he was caught putting rotten tomatoes in the box they were\\nusing to carry tomatoes from the field where they were being picked. Captain Bruton gave him nine licks for this\\noffense. In September of 1966 he was charged with not picking enough cotton. He testified that he had picked\\nninety pounds that day. He was taken to Captain Goodwin, the Assistant Superintendent at that time, who\\nsentenced him to six lashes which were administered by Captain Heston. On December 7, 1966, he and several\\nother inmates were charged with sitting down and smoking when they should have been picking cotton. He\\nreceived eight lashes for this offense and was put in an isolation cell for eight days. While plaintiff was in this cell,\\n\\nhe received regular meals, although he was denied his mail privileges and could not purchase anything from the\\ncommissary.\\nPlaintiff Mask also testified concerning an altercation between him and Captain Goodwin sometime in the last of\\nNovember 1966. Mask said that Captain Goodwin hit him on the chin and then had him brought into the office\\nwhere he was hit four or five times in the stomach and kicked once. Captain Goodwin testified that he had not hit\\nMask but merely grabbed him and shook him and pushed him in a corner. The testimony is not clear just why this\\naltercation arose; however, it appears it had something to do with Mask's attitude toward work and his work\\nperformance.\\nPlaintiff Mask also complained that his knee bothers him when he works for long periods of time. This causes him\\nnot to be able to do as much work as is required of him. His knee was injured in a tractor accident in 1960 to such\\nan extent that it required surgery to repair. There is some evidence that it might have been re-injured in 1964.\\nHowever, medical evidence was introduced to show that there were no significant residual effects of the earlier\\n[8]\\ninjury and also that there had been no recent re-injury.\\nThe court also heard testimony from twelve other inmates of the Arkansas State Penitentiary, most of which was\\ncumulative to that given by the three named plaintiffs as well as corroborating some of their testimony set out\\nabove. These prisoners related the facts surrounding whippings which the various prisoners had received for\\noffenses such as insufficient work, insubordination, and scuffling among prisoners. According to these witnesses,\\n812 some of *812 the whippings were administered without a formal hearing, also some hearings were conducted\\nwith only one warden present. The general pattern of these whippings as related by the prisoners is that a\\nprisoner is charged by a trusty or other inmate in the capacity of an overseer such as a long line rider or yardman\\nwith some infraction of the Penitentiary rules. He is taken to a warden. The warden then takes him before another\\nPenitentiary official and there charges him with a rule infraction. In most cases the prisoner is given a chance to\\nexplain his actions; then sentence is handed down. If the prisoner is found guilty and sentenced to a whipping, he\\nis required to lie face down on the floor and receive the lashes on his buttocks. The prisoners claim that the word\\nof the trusty or accusing warden is usually summarily accepted without further investigation or questioning.\\nThe prisoners also testified to certain beatings which inmates had received at the hands of trusties or other\\ninmates in positions of authority. These beatings seem to have no connection with the disciplining of the beaten\\nprisoners; however, testimony showed that yardmen, floorwalkers, and occasionally a night warden have seen\\nthese beatings and have not reported the inmates for fighting nor have they tried to interfere with the beatings.\\nMost of this type activity takes place at night in the barracks; however, there were a few instances in which one or\\ntwo blows were struck in the field.\\nInvestigator H. H. Atkinson of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Arkansas State Police testified as to the\\nfacts and circumstances of his investigation of the Tucker Prison Farm in August of 1966. Atkinson's investigation\\narose out of some alleged violations of the rules involving possession of liquor by some of the inmates. He\\ntestified that as his investigation progressed he and his men uncovered various acts of brutality and cruel\\ntreatment of the inmates by certain officials and trusties at Tucker Farm. Immediately upon report of his findings\\nto Superintendent Goodwin, all the wardens at Tucker Farm were discharged. Although new personnel was\\nappointed, Atkinson's investigation continued for some twenty-two days. He revealed that he had uncovered such\\ntorturous devices as a crank telephone device which was used to electrically shock prisoners, as well as use of\\nthe teeter board and strapping upon the bare buttocks. He testified that in the first part of his investigation he\\nwitnessed such a strapping of an inmate by Captain Mayes. He further testified that all persons responsible for\\nsuch treatment have been discharged.\\nHe was later placed in charge of Tucker Farm as Acting Assistant Superintendent during the administrative\\nchanges in December of 1966 and January of 1967. He said that he found it necessary to use the strap while he\\nwas in charge. He strapped four of twelve prisoners who had been sentenced by a three-man board of inquiry to\\nsix lashes because they had picked an insufficient amount of cotton. He was told later by the inmates that they\\nwere \\\"trying him to see if he would use the whip.\\\" He also said that he got better work from the prisoners after\\nthey found out he would use the strap.\\n\\nSuperintendent O. E. Bishop has been Superintendent for the Prison system since January 1, 1966. He testified\\nthat when the rules were promulgated he made every effort to make sure that each prisoner had a copy of the\\nrules and understood them. His efforts included reading the rules to the prisoners over a loud speaker system\\nand answering any questions they might have. He instructed all the personnel of the Prison that anyone who was\\nfound not following the rules would be fired immediately. He also told the trusties that they would be \\\"ranked\\\"\\n(lose their privileges as trusties) at the first violation of the rules. The evidence showed in fact that some trusties\\nhave been ranked and several wardens have been fired because of violations.\\n813 *813 He testified that he was not aware of the activities that had taken place at Tucker Farm prior to August of\\n1966 because his duties required him to spend the largest part of his time at Cummins Farm. He also said that\\nthe two farms were fifty miles apart and that he could not leave Cummins to go to Tucker without the wardens at\\nTucker knowing of his visit beforehand.\\nSuperintendent Bishop said that disciplinary methods other than the use of the strap are also used in the\\nPenitentiary system. These include loss of the few privileges which exist for the prisoners, administrative isolation\\nor solitary confinement, and removal from the plasma program, which is a means by which the prisoners earn\\nmoney. He said that often prisoners charged with violations of the rules were found not guilty and were not\\npunished. The evidence showed that substantial improvements have been made in the facilities and in the\\nadministrative procedure of the Penitentiary system since Mr. Bishop has taken over.\\nThe court heard the testimony of five of the wardens who were discharged or permitted to resign from the staff at\\nTucker Farm. Captain Clay Smith, Head Warden, and two other wardens at Cummins Farm also testified. These\\nwitnesses related the facts and circumstances surrounding each of the whippings complained of in this case.\\nThey said that in each case involving a whipping there had been a violation of the rules by the prisoners and\\nexcept in a few instances (which have been admitted by the defendant) the procedure for the administration of\\ncorporal punishment as set out in the rules was followed. They maintained that at all hearings at least two\\nwardens were present. They also said that they treated the whipping of prisoners as just another part of their jobs\\nand had no personal feelings against the prisoners while the whipping was being administered.\\nCaptain Clay Smith testified that he usually sits on the board of inquiry at Cummins Farm and that he always\\nasked the prisoner being charged if he knew of and understood the rules and regulations. He then would ask if\\nthe prisoner had anything to say before he decided the case or gave any punishment. Captain Smith said that he\\ncould not set a work quota for each inmate because of the many variables involved in the day-to-day work at the\\nPrison. He stated that all the Prison administration asked of the inmates was an honest day's work. Upon being\\nquestioned by the court, Captain Smith said that of the 1,600 inmates at Cummins, in 1966 approximately 200\\nwere whipped. He said the great majority of prisoners adjusted satisfactorily to Prison conditions and are never\\npunished. There are some whose conduct is such that discipline in some form becomes necessary. There is a\\nsmaller group who are rebellious and, because of their recalcitrance, require repeated disciplinary measures.\\nThe court reconvened some two and a half weeks after the close of the first two days of this hearing to hear the\\n[9]\\ntestimony of two expert penologists presented by counsel for the plaintiffs.\\nJames V. Bennett, who was Director of the Federal Prisons from 1937 to 1964, and whose qualifications as an\\neminent penologist are far too numerous to mention here, gave his views on the use of the whip for disciplinary\\npurposes in a penitentiary. He said that in all the many years in which he was connected with the federal prisons\\nhe never used strapping or corporal punishment for disciplinary purposes. He felt that it was brutal and medieval\\nand did no real good. He also testified that to his knowledge only one other state used the whip officially in its\\npenitentiary system. He said that it was possible, however, that other states used it unofficially. He said that he\\n814 had never visited *814 the Arkansas Penitentiary System and that he was familiar with it only through discussions\\nwith prisoners who had been incarcerated there.\\nHe had read and was familiar with the rules of the Penitentiary. Even if corporal punishment were permitted, it\\nwas his opinion that these rules were too indefinite and could be easily circumvented so as to make them\\nineffective. He said that an inmate should be entitled to a completely objective hearing by a qualified employee\\nwhose decision should be approved by a high ranking official in the system before corporal punishment is\\n\\nadministered to that prisoner. He also suggested that a cooling-off period should be allowed between the charge\\nand the decision or sentence. He advocated the use of incentives for good behavior rather than punishment.\\nMr. Fred Wilkinson, Director of Corrections for the State of Missouri, who is also an eminently qualified penologist\\nwith many years of experience in the federal prisons, also testified for plaintiffs. It is his opinion that all forms of\\ncorporal punishment should be abolished. He said that he also knew of only one other state that uses the whip\\nofficially in disciplining prison inmates. In his experience the most commonly used punishment was forfeiture of\\ngood time credits, deprivation of privileges, and administrative separation. He said that if the strap were used,\\nthere should be a commission or board to rule on the appropriate discipline rather than just one person. Both he\\nand Mr. Bennett testified at some length as to the type of facilities and the forms of punishment used in the\\nprisons with which they had been connected.\\nAccording to Mr. Wilkinson, in the Missouri Prison System there is one paid employee for each four or five\\nprisoners; nationally the average is one paid employee to about seven or eight prisoners. It appears that in\\nArkansas the ratio is one paid employee to approximately 58 prisoners.\\nWe now consider the applicable law.\\nThe Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides \\\"* * * excessive bail shall not be\\nrequired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\\\" (Emphasis supplied.)\\nAlthough the prohibitions of this Amendment originally applied only to the federal government, it is now well\\nsettled that they apply equally to the States through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \\nRobinson v. State of California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758; United States ex rel. Bryant v. Fay,\\n211 F.Supp. 812 (D.C. N.Y.1962).\\nThe courts have never arrived at a satisfactory definition of \\\"cruel and unusual punishment.\\\" As was said recently\\nby the Eighth Circuit, \\\"It is settled doctrine that except in extreme cases the courts may not interfere with the\\nconduct of a prison, with its regulations and their enforcement, or with its discipline. (Citation of authorities.)\\\"\\nHowever, in the same case the court went on to say, \\\"Unlawful administration can exist where there are aspects\\nof institutional treatment of such character or consequences as to shock general conscience or to be intolerable\\nin fundamental fairness. Such treatment is entitled to be held to be within the ban of the Eighth Amendment as\\nrepresenting cruel and unusual punishment and so constituting unlawful administration of prison sentence.\\\" Lee\\nv. Tahash, 352 F.2d 970, 971, 972 (1965). See also Carey v. Settle, 351 F.2d 483 (8 Cir. 1965).\\nThe court has weighed the evidence in these cases, along with the arguments and authorities set forth in the\\nexcellent briefs of both parties. We think it is fair to say, however, as this court said in Talley, \\\"* * * corporal\\npunishment has not been viewed historically as a constitutionally forbidden cruel and unusual punishment.\\\"\\nNeither are we willing to say that the use of the strap in and of itself is contrary to the Eighth Amendment's\\nprohibitions.\\n815 *815 \\\"Every punishment in a sense involves cruelty since it imposes by force conditions at odds with the concept\\nof the freedom of the person from all forms of trespass, and freedom of action. More than this is required to\\nviolate the Eighth Amendment.\\\" Wright v. McMann, 257 F.Supp. 739, 745 (D.C.N.Y. 1966).\\nThis, of course, does not extend to all types of corporal punishment or to unguarded use of the strap. A\\npunishment, like a law, may be constitutional in its bare form and yet be unconstitutionally administered. Certainly\\nproper safeguards against capricious administration are necessary to keep such punishment from violating\\nconstitutional standards.\\nThere can be no doubt that the brutal and sadistic atrocities which were uncovered by the investigation of the\\nState Police in August and September of 1966 cannot be tolerated. The court has reference to the use of a\\ntelephone shocking apparatus, the teeter board, strapping on the bare buttocks, and other torturous acts of this\\nnature. The defendant admits that these acts were committed but claims that they were carried on without the\\nknowledge or approval of the Superintendent, that they are contrary to the Prison rules as well as the State law,\\n\\nthat all personnel responsible for such acts have been discharged, that the offending objects of torture have been\\ndisposed of, and that administrative steps have been taken to assure that such acts will not recur.\\nThe court commends the actions of the Superintendent, under the supervision of the Prison Board, which have\\nproduced more efficient administration and improved standards of discipline, as well as other improvements;\\nhowever, we feel that the inmates' right to be free of such treatment as disclosed in the testimony cannot depend\\nupon the competence of the administrative personnel which changes from time to time; therefore, these and\\nother actions of this character will be permanently enjoined.\\nAs we have indicated, the court is aware that there has been much improvement in the disciplining of prisoners\\nsince the rules were promulgated in January 1966. However, the court finds that the \\\"Rules and Regulations\\\"\\nadopted by the Penitentiary Board January 10, 1966 do not provide the adequate safeguards required by this\\ncourt in Talley.\\nAs an example, they are unnecessarily ambiguous in prescribing the composition of the \\\"board of inquiry\\\"\\ndescribed in the rules. We agree with Dr. Bennett's observation that this portion of the rules is so indefinite as to\\nbe easily circumvented. It is obvious from the testimony that experience under these rules has proven this to be\\ntrue.\\nThe court refers particularly to the convening of hearings in connection with the administration of corporal\\npunishment without a proper \\\"board of inquiry.\\\"\\nThe court will enjoin the use of the strap as punishment at the penitentiary until proper and adequate safeguards\\nsurrounding its use are provided by those in charge of prison administration.\\nIt is neither this court's duty nor its inclination to tell the defendant or the Penitentiary Board what rules should be\\npromulgated in order to comply with the Constitution. However, the court will make these general observations.\\nFirst, more than one person's judgment should be required for a decision to administer corporal punishment. This\\nis implicit in the existing rules which require such a decision to be made by a board of inquiry. In this procedure,\\nthe accuser should not be counted among those who sit in judgment.\\nSecondly, that circumvention of the rules and regulations by an official in time of anger is intolerable. Certainly a\\nprisoner charged with a rule violation is entitled to and should be provided with an objectively reasoned,\\n816 dispassionate *816 decision as to whether or not he should be punished.\\nThird, that summary acceptance of one inmate's report on another without further investigation in determining\\nwhether punishment should be administered voids the effectiveness of any rules and regulations.\\nAnd, finally, it is suggested that the Superintendent or an Assistant Superintendent of the Prison participate in or\\nreview any decision to inflict corporal punishment.\\nThe court finds that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the contention of each plaintiff concerning his physical\\nimpairment. Each claims that he has been unconstitutionally punished because of failure to do work which he is\\nphysically unable to do.\\nThere can be no doubt that as we stated in the Talley decision:\\n\\\"* * * for prison officials knowingly to compel convicts to perform physical labor which is beyond\\ntheir strength, or which constitutes a danger to their lives or health, or which is unduly painful\\nconstitutes an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the 8th Amendment to the\\nConstitution of the United States as included in the 14th Amendment.\\\"\\nHowever, such a situation does not exist in this case. Upon request of plaintiffs' counsel the court appointed Dr.\\nDale Alford (an ophthalmologist) to examine plaintiff Jackson's eyes, and Dr. John Hundley and Dr. Charles\\nMcKenzie (orthopedic surgeons) to examine plaintiff Mask's knee. Relying upon these doctors' reports, as well as\\nthe prison medical records of each plaintiff and the testimony surrounding the incidents concerning the alleged\\nphysical impairments, the court can find no merit in these contentions.\\n\\nAn injunction will be issued permanently restraining the defendant and any personnel of the Prison System from:\\nThe use of any such devices as the crank telephone or teeter board; or The application of any\\nwhipping to the bare skin of prisoners.\\nSuch officials are further restrained from the \\\"use of the strap\\\" on any prisoner until additional rules and\\nregulations are promulgated with appropriate safeguards in accordance with this opinion and filed with the Clerk\\nof this court.\\nAn order will be issued in accordance with this opinion.\\nDECREE\\nIn accordance with the Memorandum Opinion of the court filed this date, the defendant, O. E. Bishop,\\nSuperintendent of the Arkansas State Penitentiary, and any personnel of the Prison System are permanently\\nrestrained from:\\nThe use of any such devices as the crank telephone or teeter board; or\\nThe application of any whipping to the bare skin of prisoners.\\nSuch officials are further restrained from the \\\"use of the strap\\\" on any prisoner until additional rules and\\nregulations are promulgated with appropriate safeguards in accordance with said opinion and filed with the Clerk\\nof this court.\\n[1]Talley v. Stephens, D.C., 247 F.Supp. 683. This is an earlier decision before this court in which inmates of the\\nArkansas State Penitentiary were complaining about treatment received and constitutional rights being denied.\\nSome of the issues and many of the principles involved are identical with the cases which are now before the\\ncourt. Therefore we will refer to the Talley decision several times throughout this opinion rather than repeat facts\\nand circumstances which are the same in these cases.\\n[2] For further information concerning the operation of the prison see Talley v.

At  all relevant  times,  Defendant  (the  \\\"Employer\\\")  has \\ncontinuously  been  a  corporation  doing  business  in  the  State  of \\n\\nAlabama  and  the  City of  Mobile,  and  has  continuously had  at least \\nfifteen  (15)  employees. \\n5.

Prior  to  the  institution  of  this  lawsuit,  the \\nCommission's  representatives  attempted  to  eliminate  the  unlawful \\nemployment  practices  hereinafter  alleged  and  to  effect  voluntary \\ncompliance with Title VII  through the informal methods of concilia \\ntion,  conference  and persuasion within  the meaning  of  \\u00a7706(b)  of \\nTitle  VII,  42  U.S.C.  \\u00a72000e-5.  All  conditions  precedent  to  the \\ninstitution of  this  lawsuit  have  been  fulfilled. \\nSTATEMENT  OF  CLAIM \\n7.  Since  at  least  January,  1998,  Defendant  Employer  has \\nengaged  in  and  is  continuing  to  engage  in  unlawful  employment \\npractices  at  its  Mobile,  Alabama,  facility,  Store  No.  866,  in \\nviolation  of  \\u00a7703  (a) (1)  of  Title  VII,  42  U.S.C.  \\u00a72000e  et.seq. \\nDefendant  Employer  through  its  agents  has  subjected  Charlene \\n3 \\n\\nf\\\", \\nDaugherty  and  other  similarly  situated  females  to  a  sexually \\nhostile and  intimidating iwork  environment. \\nS.  The  hostile'  work  environment  to  which  Charlene \\nDaugherty  and  other  similarly  situated  females  were  subjected \\nincluded  sexually explicit and  implicit  language  and  conduct  that \\nwas  so  severe  and  pervasive  as  to  adversely  affect  the  ter.ms  and \\nconditions  of  the  employment  of  female  workers. \\n9.  Charlene Daugherty and other similarly situated females \\nacted  reasonably  and  continuously  complained  to  Defendant  of  the \\nsexually  hostile  and  intimidating  work  environment.  However, \\nDefendant did not act reasonably to stop or prevent the harassment. \\n10.  Furthermore,  Defendant  maintained  a  sexually  hostile \\nand  intimidating  work  environment  that  was  so  unpleasant  or \\ndifficult  in  which  to  work  that  a  reasonable  person  in  Charlene \\nDaugherty's position would  feel  compelled to resign,  resulting in \\nthe  constructive  discharge  of  Charlene  Daugherty  because  of  her \\nsex  in violation of  \\u00a7703(a)  of  Title VII. \\n11.  Moreover,  Defendant  harassed  and  constructively \\ndischarged Charlene Daugherty in retaliation for complaining of the \\nharassment  in violation of  \\u00a7704(a)of Title VII. \\n12.  The  effect  of  the  practices  complained  of  above  has \\nbeen  to  deprive  Charlene  Daugherty  and  other  similarly  situated \\nfemales  of  equal  employment  opportunities  and  otherwise  adversely \\n4 \\n\\naffect  their  status  as  employees  on  the  basis  of  sex  and  on  the \\nbasis  of  retaliation. \\n13.  The unlawful  employment practices complained of above \\nwere  intentional. \\n14.  The  unlawful  employment  practices  complained of  above \\nwere done with malice and/or reckless indifference to the federally \\nprotected rights of Charlene Daugherty and other similarly situated \\nfemales. \\nPRAYER  FOR  RELIEF \\nWHEREFORE,  the  Commission  respectfully requests  that  this \\nCourt: \\nA.  Grant  a  permanent  injunction  enjoining  Defendant \\nEmployer,  its  officers,  successors,  assigns  and  all  persons  in \\nactive  concert  or  participation  with  it,  from  engaging  in  any \\nemployment  practices  which  discriminate  on  the  basis  of  sex  or \\nretaliation. \\nB.  Order  Defendant  Employer  to  institute  and  carry  out \\npolicies,  practices  and  programs  which  provide  equal  employment \\nopportunities  for  women,  and  which  eradicate  the  effects  of  its \\nI \\npast  and  present unlawfut  employment  practices. \\n5 \\n\\nC.  Grant  a  judgment  requiring  Defendant  Employer  to  pay \\nappropriate back wages  in an amount  to be determined at trial,  and \\nprejudgment  interest  to  Charlene  Daugherty,  who  was  adversely \\naffected by  the  unlawful  employment  practices  described  above. \\nD.

Talley v. Stephens, 247 F.Supp. 683 (E.D.Ark.1965).  Chief Judge Henley in Talley granted, in\\\\npart by consent, a substantial measure of relief, including restraint against forcing prisoners to work beyond their\\\\nphysical capabilities, against the withholding of reasonable medical attention, against the infliction of corporal\\\\npunishment until \\\"appropriate safeguards\\\" were established, and against reprisals for seeking access to the\\\\ncourts.  Neither side appealed. \\\\nThe present cases were filed in the Eastern District of Arkansas and were assigned respectively to Judge Young\\\\nand Judge Harris.  Upon agreement, the judges consolidated the three actions and, as a panel of two, jointly\\\\nheard and decided them.  After a full hearing, the court granted relief against \\\"[t]he use of any such devices as the\\\\ncrank telephone or teeter board\\\" and against \\\"[t]he application of any whipping to the bare skin of prisoners.\\\" It\\\\nalso restrained the use of the strap \\\"until additional rules and regulations are promulgated with appropriate\\\\nsafeguards * * *\\\" Jackson v. Bishop, 268 F. Supp. 804, 816 (E.D.Ark.1967). \\\\nThe use of the strap, therefore, as in the Talley case, was not totally renstrained.  Because it was not, the plaintiffs\\\\nappeal and seek here to remove that vestige.  The defendant Superintendent has taken no cross appeal.  Thus,\\\\nthe relief granted in the district court remains effective and is not in issue before us. \\\\n\\\\nWe conclude that the plaintiffs are correct in their position and that Arkansas\\\\' use of the strap, irrespective of\\\\nsafeguards, is to be enjoined. \\\\n573 These actions were instituted in 1966 by handwritten petitions employing varying titles. [2] Each plaintiff asked \\\\n*573 for the appointment of counsel and permission to proceed in forma pauperis.  Those requests were granted. \\\\nAppointed counsel then filed amended complaints which have been treated by all concerned as petitions for\\\\ninjunctive relief under the civil rights statutes, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1343(3) and (4).  We are satisfied\\\\nas to jurisdiction.  We are also satisfied, as were the district judges, that the cases are appropriately to be\\\\nregarded as class actions within the scope and reach of Rule 23, Fed.R.Civ.P. \\\\nWe initially commend Edward L. Wright of Little Rock and William S. Arnold of Crossett, court-appointed counsel\\\\nfor the plaintiffs, and Don Langston, who argued the cases for the defendant, for their candid, unemotional and\\\\nfair and able presentations.  The services rendered by Mr. Wright and Mr. Arnold, and the expenses they have\\\\nincurred, were without anticipation of reimbursement. \\\\nAlthough we are advised that a substantial percentage of the Arkansas prison population is black, the three\\\\nplaintiffs, the prison officials concerned, and the witnesses are all white.  No issue of race, as such, is present. \\\\n[3]\\\\nThe facts, at this stage of the litigation, are in no real dispute.   Anyone interested in all the details may refer to\\\\nthe facts recited by Chief Judge Henley in his opinion in Talley v. Stephens, supra, and to those set forth in the\\\\nopinion of the district judges in this case. We regard the following history and facts as particularly pertinent for our\\\\nreview:\\\\n1.  The Arkansas penal institutions are under the general supervision of a five-man \\\"honorary\\\" commission known\\\\nas the State Penitentiary Board.  Ark. Stat.Ann. \\u00a7\\u00a7 7-201(6) and 7-202 and \\u00a7 46-101.  Actual day-to-day\\\\nsupervision is delegated by the Board to a full-time compensated superintendent.  \\u00a7\\u00a7 46-104 and 46-104.1.  The\\\\nBoard also serves as a board of pardons and paroles and meets monthly.  \\u00a7 43-2801. \\\\n2.  The State\\\\'s penitentiary system contains two farm units. Cummins Farm, near Grady, Arkansas, has 15,500\\\\nacres and over 1,600 inmates.  Tucker Farm, near Tucker, Arkansas, has about 4,500 acres and approximately\\\\n250 inmates.  The Superintendent resides at Cummins.  An assistant superintendent is at Tucker.  The units are\\\\nabout 50 miles apart. \\\\n3.  The Board has the duty to publish and appropriately post all rules and regulations it promulgates with respect\\\\nto prisoner conduct.  \\u00a7 46-132.  The Superintendent has \\\"general supervision and control of\\\" and is \\\"solely\\\\nresponsible for, the discipline, management, and control\\\" of all inmates.  \\u00a7 46-133. \\\\n4.  The Superintendent, by statute, is authorized to use trusties as guards.  \\u00a7 46-122.  In fact, trusties are used at\\\\nCummins and Tucker in supervisory and overseeing capacities in the barracks and fields and as guards.  Trusties\\\\nare selected by the Superintendent or his assistant.  There are also supervisory wardens at both units.\\\\n5.  The primary activity of inmates is agricultural work with row crops and garden produce.  However, a dairy herd\\\\nand a beef herd are also maintained.  The system is virtually self-sustaining so far as food is concerned. \\\\n6.  The Board, by statute, \\u00a7 46-158, has the duty to prescribe the mode and extent of punishments for violation of\\\\nprison rules.  One who inflicts, or causes to be inflicted, punishment more severe than is prescribed by the Board\\\\nis guilty of a felony.  Section 46-158, however, does not itself specify the type of punishment which may be\\\\nimposed. \\\\n574 *574 7.  Corporal punishment in the Arkansas system was authorized formally only in 1962 but evidently it had\\\\nbeen employed for many years.  At that time the Board, by resolution, authorized such punishment whenever, in\\\\nthe Superintendent\\\\'s judgment, its infliction was necessary in order to maintain discipline.  The resolution did not\\\\nprescribe form or limit of punishment. \\\\n8.  In the Talley action, the three petitioning inmates sought injunctive relief with respect to certain prison practices\\\\nincluding the infliction of corporal punishment.  The respondent there, a predecessor superintendent, consented to\\\\n\\\\nthe granting of relief with respect to work requirements beyond a prisoner\\\\'s physical capability and with respect to\\\\nreasonable medical attention.  247 F. Supp. at 687.  Chief Judge Henley found that, at that time, there were no\\\\nwritten rules as to whipping; that such punishment was administered in the sole discretion of the one inflicting it,\\\\nsubject to an informal requirement that the blows not exceed ten for a single offense; and that two of those three\\\\npetitioners had been whipped and one beaten by a field-line supervisor-trusty.  The judge noted that the Supreme\\\\nCourt of Arkansas, over 80 years ago, deplored the whipping of convicts, Werner v. State, 44 Ark. 122 (1884),\\\\nand that the Arkansas statutes do not themselves specifically prescribe whipping even as a punishment for crime. \\\\n[4]\\\\n He observed, however, that corporal punishment had not been viewed historically as a constitutionally\\\\nforbidden cruel and unusual punishment.  The court concluded that it was not prepared to say that such\\\\npunishment was unconstitutional per se. Nevertheless, Judge Henley said, 247 F.Supp. at 689, this conclusion\\\\npresupposes that the infliction of such punishment is surrounded by appropriate safeguards, that is, it must not\\\\nbe excessive, it must be inflicted dispassionately and by responsible people, and it must be applied under\\\\nrecognizable standards so that the convict knows what conduct will cause him to be whipped and how much\\\\npunishment his conduct will produce.  The court found that those safeguards did not exist in the Arkansas system\\\\nand enjoined further corporal punishment of the petitioners until they were established. \\\\n9.  The Talley opinion was filed on November 15, 1965.  As a result, the Board issued written rules and regulations\\\\non January 10, 1966.  These were in effect until the district court decision in the present case was rendered June\\\\n3, 1967.  In addition to a number of other provisions, the rules state that certain \\\"major offenses will warrant\\\\ncorporal punishment.\\\" The ones listed are homosexuality, agitation, insubordination, making or concealing\\\\nweapons, refusal to work when medically certified able to work, and participating in or inciting a riot.  They further\\\\nstate:\\\\nNo inmate shall ever be authorized to inflict any corporal punishment under color of prison\\\\nauthority on another inmate. \\\\nPunishment shall not, in any case, exceed Ten lashes with the strap, the number of lashes to be\\\\nadministered shall be determined by a Board of inquiry, consisting of at least two officials of the\\\\nArkansas State Penitentiary, The Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent, and the head\\\\nWarden or an associate Warden.  The Board of Inquiry will request that the accused inmate appear\\\\nbefore the Board and speak in his own behalf.  No Punishment will be administered in the field. \\\\n10.  The straps used in Arkansas vary somewhat but all are similar.  Each is of leather and from 3\\u00bd to 5\\u00bd feet in\\\\nlength, about 4 inches wide, and \\u00bc inch thick.  Each has a wooden handle 8 to 12 inches long. \\\\n11.  Since Talley, whippings are administered by wardens.  The prisoner lies face down and the blows are to his\\\\n575 buttocks.  Supposedly, they are administered *575 while the prisoner is fully clothed.  Petitioners Ernst and Mask,\\\\nhowever, testified without contradiction that they were required to lower their trousers and that they received\\\\nlashes on the bare buttocks.  There is corroborating and other evidence to the same effect with respect to other\\\\ninmates and there was proof, some offered through the State Police, of deep bruises and bleeding. \\\\n12.  Whipping is the primary disciplinary measure used in the Arkansas system.  Prisioners there have few\\\\nprivileges which can be withheld from them as punishment.  Facilities for segregation and solitary confinement are\\\\nlimited. \\\\n13.  There is testimony that the strap hurts the inmate\\\\'s pride, that it has been needed in order to preserve\\\\ndiscipline, and that the work level improves after its administration.  Contrarily, there is testimony that the whipping\\\\ngenerates hate in the inmate who is whipped and that this hate flows toward the whipper, the institution and the\\\\nsystem. \\\\n14.  The circumstances relative to the punishment administered to the plaintiffs as well as to others and relative to\\\\nvarious disciplinary matters are set forth in detail in the district court\\\\'s opinion.  268 F.Supp. at 809-813.  The\\\\ntestimony of James V. Bennett, former Director of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and that of Fred T. Wilkinson,\\\\nDirector of the Department of Corrections of the State of Missouri (and former Deputy Director of the Federal\\\\nBureau of Prisons) are summarized in the district court\\\\'s opinion.  268 F.Supp. at 813-814.  This testimony is to the\\\\neffect that, among other things, corporal punishment has not been used for disciplinary purposes in federal\\\\n\\\\nprisons for years and that only Mississippi, in addition to Arkansas, uses it officially.  Testifying as a penologist, it\\\\nwas Mr. Bennett\\\\'s opinion that the whippings administered to the three plaintiffs were \\\"cruel, degrading and\\\\ncertainly they were unusual in this day and age.\\\" Mr. Wilkinson testified that use of the strap \\\"is cruel and unusual\\\\nand unnecessary.\\\" 15.  On July 20, 1966, six months after the issuance of the January 1966 regulations, plaintiff Ernst received two\\\\nwhippings of ten lashes each to the bare buttocks within a period of 45 minutes. \\\\n16.  In August 1966 the Superintendent became aware of irregularities.  An investigation disclosed violations of\\\\nserious import.  A number of wardens resigned or were discharged.  The plaintiffs\\\\' cases were filed while this\\\\ninvestigation was under way.  The present Superintendent candidly does not seek to defend everything which has\\\\ntaken place. \\\\n17.  The district judges concluded that the post-Talley rules and regulations of January 1966 still did not provide\\\\nadequate safeguards.  The use of the strap was therefore enjoined until further safeguards were provided.  The\\\\ncourt observed that more than one person\\\\'s judgment should be required for a decision to administer corporal\\\\n[5]\\\\npunishment. \\\\n576 *576 So much for the facts.  Certain legal principles, which have general application here, are well established\\\\nand admit of no real controversy:\\\\n1.  Lawful incarceration may properly operate to deprive the convict of certain rights which would otherwise be his\\\\nto enjoy.  Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 285, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 92 L.Ed. 1356 (1948).  A classic example is\\\\nArkansas\\\\' denial to the felon of the right to vote.  Ark.Const.  art. 3, \\u00a7 1 (as amended by Amendment No. 8); Ark.\\\\nStat.Ann. \\u00a7 3-101 (Repl.1956); City of Newport v. Smith, 236 Ark. 626, 367 S.W.2d 742 (1963).  Other states do\\\\nthe same.  See, for instance, N.D.Const. art. V, \\u00a7 127, N.D.Cent.Code \\u00a7 16-01-04 (1960), and State ex rel. Olson\\\\nv. Langer, 65 N.D. 68, 256 N.W. 377 (1934); Mo. Const. art. VIII \\u00a7 2, VAMS \\u00a7 111.060 (1966), and State ex rel.\\\\nBarrett v. Sartorious, 351 Mo. 1237, 175 S.W.2d 787, 789-790, 149 A.L.R. 1067 (1943); Minn.Const.  art. 7, \\u00a7 2. \\\\n2.  The only federal restraint to state action of this kind lies in the Constitution and in the statutes in enforcement\\\\nthereof, specifically, the Fourteenth Amendment\\\\'s equal protection and due process clauses, and the Fifteenth\\\\nAmendment\\\\'s proscription of the denial to citizens of the United States of the right to vote \\\"on account of race,\\\\ncolor, or previous condition of servitude.\\\" Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U.S. 641, 647, 86 S.Ct. 1717, 16 L.Ed.2d\\\\n828 (1966); Harper v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 665, 86 S.Ct. 1079, 16 L.Ed.2d 169 (1966); \\\\nCarrington v. Rash, 380 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 775, 13 L. Ed.2d 675 (1965); State ex rel. Olson v. Langer, supra,\\\\n256 N.W. at 385-386.  But previous criminal record has been referred to as among the \\\"obvious examples\\\\nindicating factors which a State may take into consideration in determining the qualifications of voters.\\\" Lassiter v.\\\\nNorthampton County Bd. of Elections, 360 U.S. 45, 51, 79 S.Ct. 985, 990, 3 L.Ed.2d 1072 (1959); Davis v.\\\\nBeason, 133 U.S. 333, 346-347, 10 S.Ct. 299, 33 L.Ed. 637 (1890). \\\\n3.  On the other hand, a prisoner of the state does not lose all his civil rights during and because of his\\\\nincarceration.  In particular, he continues to be protected by the due process and equal protection clauses which\\\\nfollow him through the prison doors.  Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L. Ed.2d 1030 (1964); Ex\\\\nparte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034 (1941). \\\\n4.  Despite earlier comments to the contrary, see, for example, In re Kemmler, 136 U.S. 436, 446, 10 S.Ct. 930,\\\\n34 L.Ed. 519 (1890); O\\\\'Neil v. Vermont, 144 U.S. 323, 332, 12 S.Ct. 693, 36 L.Ed. 450 (1892); and Collins v.\\\\nJohnston, 237 U.S. 502, 510-511, 35 S.Ct. 649, 59 L.Ed. 1071 (1915), the Eighth Amendment\\\\'s guarantee\\\\nagainst the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments seems now to have come to be regarded as directly\\\\napplicable to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Robinson v. California,\\\\n370 U.S. 660, 666, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758 (1962), and Mr. Justice Douglas in concurrence at 675, 82 S.Ct.\\\\n1417; Wright v. McMann, 387 F.2d 519, 522 (2 Cir. 1967).  See State of La. ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.S.\\\\n459, 463, 67 S.Ct. 374, 91 L.Ed. 422 (1947) and Powell v. Texas, 392 U.S. 514, 531-532, 88 S.Ct. 2145, 20\\\\nL.Ed.2d 1254 (1968). \\\\n577\\\\n\\\\n*577 5.  The federal courts, including this one, entertain a natural reluctance to interfere with a prison\\\\'s internal\\\\ndiscipline.  This is true with respect to federal institutions, Glenn v. Ciccone, 370 F.2d 361, 363 (8 Cir. 1966); \\\\nSutton v. Settle, 302 F.2d 286, 288 (8 Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 372 U.S. 930, 83 S.Ct. 876, 9 L.Ed.2d 734; Garcia\\\\nv. Steele, 193 F.2d 276, 278 (8 Cir. 1951), see Holland v. Ciccone, 386 F.2d 825 (8 Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 390\\\\nU.S. 1045, 88 S.Ct. 1646, 20 L.Ed.2d 307, as well as to state prisons, Douglas v. Sigler, 386 F.2d 684, 688 (8 Cir.\\\\n1967); Lee v. Tahash, 352 F. 2d 970, 971 (8 Cir. 1965); Wright v. McMann, supra, 387 F.2d at 522. \\\\n6.  However, the courts, including this one, have not hesitated to entertain petitions asserting violations of\\\\nfundamental rights and, where indicated, to grant relief.  In Glenn v. Ciccone, which we have just cited, this court\\\\nclearly indicated that \\\"a factual showing of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment\\\"\\\\nwould support interference by a federal court. 370 F. 2d at 363.  We have made a like statement in many other\\\\ncases. Carey v. Settle, 351 F.2d 483, 485 (8 Cir. 1965); Haynes v. Harris, 344 F.2d 463, 466 (8 Cir. 1965); Harris\\\\nv. Settle, 322 F.2d 908, 910 (8 Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 377 U.S. 910, 84 S.Ct. 1171, 12 L.Ed.2d 179.  Although\\\\nthe Eighth Circuit cases just cited concern a federal institution, the principle, of course, has equal application to a\\\\nstate penitentiary.  Wright v. McMann, supra, 387 F.2d at 522; Howard v. Smyth, 365 F.2d 428 (4 Cir. 1966), cert.\\\\ndenied, 385 U.S. 988, 87 S.Ct. 599, 17 L.Ed.2d 449. \\\\nThis takes us then to a consideration of the meaning and scope of the Eighth Amendment\\\\'s proscription of the\\\\ninfliction of \\\"cruel and unusual punishments.\\\" The phrase appeared in the English Bill of Rights of December 16,\\\\n1689, 1 W. and M. s.2, c.2 but seems to have had still earlier antecedents in Magna Charta and elsewhere.  IV\\\\nBlackstone, Commentaries, 379. \\\\nThe Supreme Court long ago acknowledged, \\\"Difficulty would attend the effort to define with exactness the extent\\\\nof the constitutional provision which provides that cruel and unusual punishment shall not be inflicted * * *.\\\" Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. 130, 135-136, 25 L.Ed. 345 (1878).  This difficulty, and the absence of an exact or\\\\nexhaustive definition of the Amendment\\\\'s ban, has been repeatedly noted.  In re Kemmler, supra, 136 U.S. at 447,\\\\n10 S.Ct. 930; Weems v. United States, 217 U.S. 349, 368-371, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910); Trop v. Dulles,\\\\n356 U.S. 86, 87, 99, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958). \\\\nThere are, however, indications, by specific holdings and other observations, which bear upon the extent and\\\\nreach of the Eighth Amendment\\\\'s proscription.  Thus in Wilkerson v. Utah, execution by public shooting, and in In\\\\nre Kemmler, execution by electrocution, were classified as outside the ban.  But in Wilkerson, 99 U.S. at 136, the\\\\nCourt observed \\\"it is safe to affirm that punishments of torture * * * and all others in the same line of unnecessary\\\\ncruelty, are forbidden * * *\\\" In Kemmler, 136 U.S. at 446-447, 10 S.Ct. at 933, the Court describes, as within the\\\\nconstitutional prohibition, punishments which are \\\"manifestly cruel and unusual, as burning at the stake,\\\\ncrucifixion, breaking on the wheel, or the like\\\" and, as cruel, those which \\\"involve torture or a lingering death.\\\" And it said that the word \\\"cruel,\\\" as used in the Eighth Amendment, \\\"implies there something inhuman and\\\\nbarbarous, 00 something more than the mere extinguishment of life.\\\" 136 U.S. at 447, 10 S.Ct. at 933.  In O\\\\'Neil v.\\\\n97\\\\nVermont, supra, 144 U.S. at 339-340, and 364, 12 S.Ct. 693, Mr. Justice Field, in dissent (joined by Justices\\\\nHarlan and Brewer, 144 U.S. at 370-371, 12 S.Ct. 693), advanced the thought that the Amendment\\\\'s \\\"inhibition is\\\\ndirected, not only against punishments of the character mentioned, but against all punishments which by their\\\\n578 excessive length or severity are greatly disproportioned to the offenses *578 charged.\\\" He went on to say that\\\\nalthough a state has the power to whip for petty offenses, \\\"repulsive as such mode of punishment is,\\\" the\\\\nincrease of such punishment by accumulation for multiple offenses could be both unusual and cruel.  144 U.S. at\\\\n340, 12 S.Ct. at 699. \\\\nIn Weems v. United States, supra, the Court observed, 217 U.S. at 373, 30 S. Ct. at 551, that \\\"a principle, to be\\\\nvital, must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth.  This is peculiarly true of\\\\nconstitutions.\\\" The majority condemned a Philippine statute on the ground that the disparity between the\\\\npunishment it imposed (cadena temporal for 15 years, that is, among other things, \\\"hard and painful labor,\\\" with a\\\\nchain at the ankle, hanging from the wrists, and with outside assistance denied) for a false entry in a public\\\\nrecord and that imposed for more serious crimes made it repugnant to the Philippine Bill of Rights forbidding\\\\ncruel and unusual punishment. \\\\nIn State of La. ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, supra, 329 U.S. at 463, 67 S.Ct. at 376, the Court spoke of the\\\\n\\\"traditional humanity of modern Anglo-American law\\\" and \\\"unnecessary pain\\\" and the \\\"wanton infliction of pain,\\\"\\\\n\\\\nand the dissent referred, at page 473, 67 S. Ct. at 381, to that which \\\"shocks the most fundamental instincts of\\\\ncivilized man.\\\" Mr. Justice Douglas, concurring, in Robinson v. California, supra, 370 U.S. at 676, 82 S.Ct. at\\\\n1425, said, \\\"The Eighth Amendment expresses the revulsion of civilized man against barbarous acts 00 the `cry of\\\\n97\\\\nhorror\\\\' against man\\\\'s inhumanity to his fellow man.\\\" In Rudolph v. Alabama, 375 U.S. 889, 84 S.Ct. 155, 11\\\\nL.Ed.2d 119 (1963), three dissenters to the denial of certiorari spoke of \\\"standards of decency more or less\\\\nuniversally accepted,\\\" of disproportion between offense and punishment, and of \\\"unnecessary cruelty.\\\" In Dyke v.\\\\nTaylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U.S. 216, 223, 88 S.Ct. 1472, 20 L.Ed.2d 538 (1968), Mr. Justice Douglas, in\\\\ndissent, referred to the historical fact (noted by Mr. Justice Harlan, in dissent, in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S.\\\\n145, 191-192, 88 S.Ct. 1444, 20 L.Ed.2d 491, 522 (1968)) that petty offenses once entailed whipping as\\\\npunishments, but said, \\\"I am loath to hold whippings * * * as `petty.\\\\'\\\" This court has added its word.  It has described the situation where a court will interfere with prison discipline as\\\\none \\\"of such character or consequence as to shock general conscience or to be intolerable in fundamental\\\\nfairness, and so to amount to illegal administration of prison sentence.\\\" Carey v. Settle, supra, 351 F.2d at 485. \\\\nJudge Johnsen there went on to say that it is possible for the form or extent of institutional treatment to offend the\\\\nEighth Amendment.  In a later case concerning a state prisoner, Judge Johnsen repeated these observations and\\\\nsaid,\\\\n\\\"Such treatment is entitled to be held to be within the ban of the Eighth Amendment as\\\\nrepresenting cruel and unusual punishment and so constituting unlawful administration of prison\\\\nsentence.  It may be observed in this connection that penal admeasurements made by general\\\\nconscience and sense of fundamental fairness doubtless will not be without some relationship to\\\\nthe humane concepts and reactions of present-day social climate.\\\" Lee v. Tahash, supra, 352 F.2d\\\\nat 972. \\\\nThe principal opinion in Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S. 86, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed. 2d 630 (1958), although it\\\\ncommanded the votes of only four justices a decade ago, is, in our view, practicularly pertinent.  The issue was\\\\nthe validity of a federal statute which would denationalize a native born citizen who deserts the military service in\\\\ntime of war and is convicted thereof by a court-martial and dismissed or dishonorably discharged.  The opinion\\\\nprovides guidelines and overtones which we feel safe in regarding as illustrative of the general thinking of a\\\\nmajority of the justices on the subject today.  The opinion casts aside the death penalty \\\"as an index of the\\\\n579 constitutional *579 limit on punishment,\\\" for it \\\"has been employed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is\\\\nstill widely accepted, it cannot be said to violate the constitutional concept of cruelty.\\\" 356 U.S. at 99, 78 S.Ct. at\\\\n597.  The Eighth Amendment\\\\'s basic concept \\\"is nothing less than the dignity of man\\\" and assures that a state\\\\'s\\\\npunishment power \\\"be exercised within the limits of civilized standards.\\\" Fines, imprisonment, and even\\\\nexecution may be imposed \\\"but any technique outside the bounds of these traditional penalties is constitutionally\\\\nsuspect.\\\" 356 U.S. at 100, 78 S.Ct. at 598.  The scope of the Amendment is not \\\"static.\\\" It \\\"must draw its meaning\\\\nfrom the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\\\" 356 U.S. at 102, 78 S.Ct.\\\\nat 598.  Virtually all the world\\\\'s civilized nations refuse to impose statelessness as punishment for crime.  356 U.S.\\\\nat 102, 78 S.Ct. at 598. \\\\nFrom that opinion we glean a recognition of, and a reliance in part upon, attitudes of contemporary society and\\\\ncomparative law. And the emphasis is on man\\\\'s basic dignity, on civilized precepts, and on flexibility and\\\\nimprovement in standards of decency as society progresses and matures.  Finally, it is \\\"any technique\\\" outside\\\\nthe traditional bounds which \\\"is constitutionally suspect.\\\" In summary, then, so far as the Supreme Court cases are concerned, we have a flat recognition that the limits of\\\\nthe Eighth Amendment\\\\'s proscription are not easily or exactly defined, and we also have clear indications that the\\\\napplicable standards are flexible, that disproportion, both among punishments and between punishment and\\\\ncrime, is a factor to be considered, and that broad and idealistic concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity,\\\\nand decency are useful and usable.  We recognize that some of these utterances by the Court were made in\\\\nconcurrence or dissent or in the approach, evidently now superseded, through the Fourteenth Amendment\\\\'s due\\\\nprocess clause rather than jointly through the Fourteenth and Eighth Amendments.  All this, however, strikes us as\\\\nof no import because we read and ascertain in the totality of the language used the basic attitude of the entire\\\\nCourt to the Eighth Amendment. \\\\n\\\\nWith these principles and guidelines before us, we have no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the use of the\\\\nstrap in the penitentiaries of Arkansas is punishment which, in this last third of the 20th century, runs afoul of the\\\\nEighth Amendment; that the strap\\\\'s use, irrespective of any precautionary conditions which may be imposed,\\\\noffends contemporary concepts of decency and human dignity and precepts of civilization which we profess to\\\\npossess; and that it also violates those standards of good conscience and fundamental fairness enunciated by\\\\nthis court in the Carey and Lee cases.\\\\nOur reasons for this conclusion include the following: (1) We are not convinced that any rule or regulation as to\\\\nthe use of the strap, however seriously or sincerely conceived and drawn, will successfully prevent abuse.  The\\\\npresent record discloses misinterpretation and obvious overnarrow interpretation even of the newly adopted\\\\nJanuary 1966 rules.  (2) Rules in this area seem often to go unobserved.  Despite the January 1966 requirement\\\\nthat no inmate was to inflict punishment on another, the record is replete with instances where this very thing took\\\\nplace.  (3) Regulations are easily circumvented.  Although it was a long-standing requirement that a whipping was\\\\nto be administered only when the prisoner was fully clothed, this record discloses instances of whippings upon\\\\nthe bare buttocks, and with consequent injury.  (4) Corporal punishment is easily subject to abuse in the hands of\\\\nthe sadistic and the unscrupulous.  (5) Where power to punish is granted to persons in lower levels of\\\\nadministrative authority, there is an inherent and natural difficulty in enforcing the limitations of that power.  (6)\\\\nThere can be no argument that excessive whipping or an inappropriate manner of whipping or too great\\\\n580 frequency of whipping or the *580 use of studded or overlong straps all constitute cruel and unusual punishment. \\\\nBut if whipping were to be authorized, how does one, or any court, ascertain the point which would distinguish the\\\\npermissible from that which is cruel and unusual?  (7) Corporal punishment generates hate toward the keepers\\\\nwho punish and toward the system which permits it.  It is degrading to the punisher and to the punished alike.  It\\\\nfrustrates correctional and rehabilitative goals.  This record cries out with testimony to this effect from the expert\\\\npenologists, from the inmates and from their keepers.  (8) Whipping creates other penological problems and\\\\nmakes adjustment to society more difficult.  (9) Public opinion is obviously adverse.  Counsel concede that only\\\\ntwo states still permit the use of the strap.  Thus almost uniformly has it been abolished.  It has been expressly\\\\noutlawed by statute in a number of states.  See for example, N.D.Cent.  Code \\u00a7 12-47-26 (1960); S.D.Code \\u00a7\\\\n13.4715 (1939).  And 48 states, including Arkansas, have constitutional provisions against cruel or unusual\\\\npunishment.  Ark.Const.  art. 2, \\u00a7 9. \\\\nWe are not convinced contrarily by any suggestion that the State needs this tool for disciplinary purposes and is\\\\ntoo poor to provide other accepted means of prisoner regulation.  Humane considerations and constitutional\\\\nrequirements are not, in this day, to be measured or limited by dollar considerations or by the thickness of the\\\\nprisoner\\\\'s clothing.', ' (7) Corporal punishment generates hate toward the keepers\\\\nwho punish and toward the system which permits it.

Certain of these cases rest on the\\\\npresence of specific statutory provision for corporal punishment for crime.  State v. Revis, 193 N.C. 192, 136 S.E.\\\\n346, 50 A.L.R. 98 (1927); Westbrook v.

Convicts \\u00a7 11 (1939) and 41 Am.Jur., Prisons and Prisoners, \\u00a7 37 (1942). \\\\n\\\\nWe choose to draw no significant distinction between the word \\\"cruel\\\" and the word \\\"unusual\\\" in the Eighth\\\\nAmendment.  See Trop v. Dulles, supra, 356 U.S. at 100 n. 32, 78 S.Ct. 590.  We would not wish to place\\\\nourselves in the position of condoning punishment which is shown to be only \\\"cruel\\\" but not \\\"unusual\\\" or vice\\\\nversa.  In any event, the testimony of the two expert penologists clearly demonstrates that the use of the strap in\\\\nthis day is unusual and we encounter no difficulty in holding that its use is cruel. \\\\nNeither do we wish to draw, in this context, any meaningful distinction between punishment by way of sentence\\\\n581 statutorily prescribed and punishment *581 imposed for prison disciplinary purposes.  It seems to us that the\\\\nEighth Amendment\\\\'s proscription has application to both. \\\\nThe district court\\\\'s decree is vacated and the case is remanded with directions to enter a new decree embracing\\\\nthe injunctive relief heretofore granted but, in addition, restraining the Superintendent of the Arkansas State\\\\nPenitentiary and all personnel of the penitentiary system from inflicting corporal punishment, including the use of\\\\nthe strap, as a disciplinary measure. \\\\n[1] Plaintiff Jackson is presently on parole. \\\\n[2] Jackson (\\\"Petition for a writ of habeas corpus\\\"); Ernst (\\\"Petition for writ of mandamus\\\"); Mask (\\\"Motion and\\\\npetition for physical examination * * * also a federal restraining order * * *\\\").  None of the plaintiffs questions the\\\\nlegality of his confinement or claims that he is entitled to release. \\\\n[3] The parties have stipulated that \\\"the facts * * * as found and stated relative to physical facts, methods of\\\\ncorporal punishment and organization of Cummins Farm and Tucker Farm, as they existed prior to and at the\\\\ntime of trial in the case of and as reflected by the printed opinion in the case of Talley v. Stephens, 247 F.Supp.\\\\n683, are true and correct and may be considered by the Court in these proceedings.\\\" [4] Some state statutes do.  See, for example, 11 Delaware Code, \\u00a7\\u00a7 631, 811, 3905, 3906, 3907, and 3908. \\\\n[5] At oral argument we were advised that since the entry of the district court\\\\'s decree other new rules and\\\\nregulations have been adopted.  These list the major offenses which \\\"will warrant punishment.\\\" They recite that no\\\\ninmate shall ever be authorized to inflict corporal punishment on another.  Before punishment is imposed, a full\\\\nhearing before a Board of Inquiry is required.  The accusing warden may not sit on the Board of Inquiry or take\\\\npart in carrying out the punishment.  Punishment may include solitary confinement, reduction of rations, corporal\\\\npunishment, loss of mail, recreation and other privileges, loss of future good time, and recording the offense for\\\\nparole purposes.  Corporal punishment shall not exceed ten lashes with the strap and a period in solitary\\\\nconfinement.  In no case may the strap be applied to the bare buttocks.  An accuser or other inmate shall not\\\\nadminister the strap.  The strap shall not be used in the fields.  No inmate shall be whipped within 24 hours of any\\\\npreceding whipping.  Each inmate sentenced to corporal punishment has the right of appeal to the superintendent\\\\nor the assistant superintendent and this official or his designee may change the sentence.  It is stated that\\\\ncorporal punishment is not deemed necessary at Tucker because the inmates are youthful first offenders.  \\\\nWe were also advised that at a meeting of the Board held February 29, 1968, with all members in attendance, a\\\\nresolution was adopted that corporal punishment in any form \\\"be abolished as a means of discipline in the\\\\ninstitution.\\\" These changes, of course, do not render the present appeal moot.

YOUNG, District Judges. \\\\nThese are suits in equity brought under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 by three inmates of the Arkansas State Penitentiary\\\\nagainst O. E. Bishop, Superintendent of the Penitentiary.  The cases first became known to the court through\\\\nhandwritten petitions filed by each of the prisoners seeking various forms of relief.  The court allowed the petitions\\\\nto be filed in forma pauperis and treated each one as a complaint for equitable relief under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983. \\\\nCounsel was appointed for the prisoners, and after investigation an amended complaint was filed seeking an\\\\ninjunctive relief and making the cases class actions.  Although one of the cases was assigned to Judge Harris and\\\\nthe other two to Judge Young, they were consolidated for trial due to the similarity of the issues presented, and\\\\nboth judges sat as a panel of two for the trial.\\\\nThe plaintiffs make several alternative claims or contentions for themselves and other prison inmates:\\\\nFirst, they contend that the infliction of corporal punishment in any form constitutes cruel and unusual punishment\\\\ncontrary to the prohibitions of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution as made applicable by the\\\\nFourteenth Amendment to the States. \\\\nSecondly and alternatively, they contend that the use of the strap or \\\"hide\\\" as a means of punishing inmates in\\\\nthe Penitentiary under any circumstances is cruel and unusual so as to be unconstitutional. \\\\nThirdly, they contend that the imposition of administrative rules or regulations concerning the use of the strap\\\\ndoes not make it a constitutionally permissible method of prison discipline. \\\\nPlaintiffs\\\\' fourth contention is actually twofold: (1) they claim that the rules concerning corporal punishment\\\\nadopted by the Arkansas State Penitentiary Board do not adequately protect the prisoners from unconstitutional\\\\n[1]\\\\ntreatment nor do they conform to the requirements that this court set out in the Talley  decision; and (2) the\\\\nrules which have been promulgated by the Prison Board have been violated in the administration of corporal\\\\npunishment upon the inmates. \\\\n\\\\nFinally, each of the plaintiffs contends that although he has some physical impairment which would prevent him\\\\nfrom doing the work of an average man, he nevertheless is classified as \\\"average\\\" for prison work purposes, is\\\\nrequired to perform difficult physical labor, and is whipped when he fails to perform.  Each claims that this is\\\\ncontrary to his constitutional right to due process and equal protection of the law and that it is also\\\\nunconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment. \\\\nThe defendant denies that corporal punishment per se or use of the strap as carried out by prison officials is cruel\\\\nand unusual in the constitutional sense.  He relies primarily upon this court\\\\'s earlier decision in the Talley case\\\\nand upon the rules and regulations adopted by the Penitentiary Board pursuant to that decision.  He admits that\\\\ncertain rule violations and other unlawful acts occurred at the Penitentiary but claims that these matters have\\\\nbeen remedied by administrative action.  Defendant denies that any injunctive relief for these plaintiffs or anyone\\\\nin their class is necessary or justified. \\\\nThe court appointed Edward L. Wright of Little Rock and William S. Arnold of Crossett, both highly respected and\\\\n807 experienced members of the Arkansas Bar, to represent the plaintiffs without *807 charge.  They have done so\\\\nmost capably, and the court thanks them for their services. \\\\nThat the court has jurisdiction and that these are proper cases to be brought under 42 U.S.C.A. \\u00a7 1983 is not\\\\nquestioned by either party.  These matters are fully discussed in the Talley decision supra at 686.  However, at the\\\\noutset we want to point out that the court is especially conscious of the limitations of its function in cases of this\\\\nkind. \\\\nIt is well settled that the administration of state prison discipline is the primary responsibility of state officials, and\\\\nfederal courts have an extremely limited area in which they may act pertaining to the treatment of prisoners\\\\nconfined to state penal institutions.  State officials must of necessity have wide discretion and control over\\\\ndisciplinary measures in order to properly maintain the prison system as well as to protect the public.  Wright v.\\\\nMcMann, 257 F.Supp. 739 (D.C.N.Y.1966).  United States ex rel. Atterbury v. Ragen, 237 F. 2d 953 (7 Cir. 1956).  \\\\nTalley v. Stephens, supra (and cases cited therein).  Therefore this court cannot and will not become appellate in\\\\nnature and review each prison administration decision to punish a prisoner. \\\\nHowever, it is equally well settled that there are exceptions to these rules when special circumstances exist and\\\\nconstitutional rights are involved.  See Cooper v. Pate, 378 U.S. 546, 84 S.Ct. 1733, 12 L.Ed.2d 1030; Childs v.\\\\nPegelow, 321 F. 2d 487 (4 Cir. 1963); Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546, 61 S.Ct. 640, 85 L.Ed. 1034; Talley v.\\\\nStephens, supra.\\\\nAs was said in Talley, page 686 of 247 F.Supp., \\\"Although persons convicted of crimes lose many of the rights\\\\nand privileges of law abiding citizens, it is established by now that they do not lose all of their civil rights, and that\\\\nthe Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the 14th Amendment follow them into the prison * * *\\\"\\\\nWe feel that the complaints in these cases raise several constitutional questions which merit the court\\\\'s attention. \\\\nIn order to understand the issues in their proper perspective, it is necessary to set out some of the facts about,\\\\nand the recent history of the Arkansas State Penitentiary. \\\\nThe Arkansas Penitentiary System is under the general supervision of a fiveman honorary commission known as\\\\nthe State Penitentiary Board but actual supervision is by them delegated to a Superintendent. \\\\nThe plant of the System consists of two farms.  One is known as Cummins Farm and contains approximately\\\\n15,500 acres, with 8,200 acres being under cultivation.  Cummins Farm is located near Grady, Arkansas, and\\\\nnormally houses approximately 1,600 inmates; Superintendent O. E. Bishop resides at Cummins Farm.  The other\\\\nfarm is known as Tucker Farm and contains approximately 4,500 acres, with approximately 3,000 acres being\\\\nunder cultivation.  Tucker Farm is situated at Tucker, Arkansas, and normally houses approximately 275 inmates. \\\\nCummins Farm and Tucker Farm are approximately fifty miles apart by highway. \\\\nPersonnel, other than inmates under sentence, at Cummins Farm consists of the Superintendent and 25 paid\\\\nemployees, with 20 being supervision wardens; and at Tucker Farm consists of an assistant superintendent and\\\\nfive paid employees, but only three supervision wardens.  Customarily both farms make use of inmates, called\\\\n\\\\ntrusties, in supervisory and overseeing capacities in the fields, in the barracks, and as security guards.  The\\\\nprimary activity of inmates at both farms is agricultural work with row crops and garden type produce being\\\\nplanted, cultivated and harvested principally by hand labor.  A dairy herd and a beef herd are also maintained for\\\\n[2]\\\\nfood. \\\\n808 *808 In the fall of 1965 certain irregularities at the Penitentiary were brought to the court\\\\'s attention by three\\\\ninmates who filed suits similar to the ones now before the court. This court, with Judge Henley presiding, heard\\\\nthose cases and rendered its decision in November 1965.  Talley v. Stephens, supra. The chief contention of the\\\\nplaintiffs in those cases was that the use of corporal punishment at the Arkansas State Penitentiary for\\\\ndisciplinary purposes was cruel and unusual and violative of the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs. \\\\nThe court found that it could not say that corporal punishment per se was unconstitutional.  It went on to say:\\\\n\\\"But, the Court\\\\'s unwillingness to say that the Constitution forbids the imposition of any and all\\\\ncorporal punishment on convicts presupposes that its infliction is surrounded by appropriate\\\\nsafeguards.  It must not be excessive; it must be inflicted as dispassionately as possible and by\\\\nresponsible people; and it must be applied in reference to recognizable standards whereby a\\\\nconvict may know what conduct on his part will cause him to be whipped and how much\\\\npunishment given conduct may produce.\\\" Shortly after this decision, the Superintendent of the Penitentiary resigned; and on January 1, 1966, Mr. O. E.\\\\nBishop, the present Superintendent, was appointed.  On January 10, 1966, the Penitentiary Board through Mr.\\\\nBishop promulgated a set of rules and regulations for the Penitentiary which include, inter alia, the following rules\\\\nsetting forth the offenses which merit corporal punishment as well as the procedures to be followed in\\\\nadministering such punishment. \\\\n\\\"OFFENSES AND PUNISHMENT:\\\\n\\\"A great part of your time here will be spent in the barracks you are assigned to.  Barracks rules\\\\nand procedure will be posted in the barracks.  Your conduct, personal cleanliness and attitude\\\\nwhile in the barracks is an important part of your prison record.  \\\"These major offenses will warrant\\\\ncorporal punishment:\\\"\\\\n(1) Homosexuality. \\\\n(2) Agitation (defined as one who creates turmoil and disturbances). \\\\n(3) Insubordination (resisting authority or refusing to obey orders). \\\\n(4) Making or concealing of weapons. \\\\n(5) Refusal to work when medically certified able to work. \\\\n(6) Participating in or inciting a riot. \\\\n\\\"(7) No inmate shall ever be authorized to inflict any corporal punishment under color of prison\\\\nauthority on another inmate. \\\\n\\\"Punishment shall not, in any case, exceed Ten lashes with the strap, the number of lashes to be\\\\nadministered shall be determined by a Board of inquiry, consisting of at least two officials of the\\\\nArkansas State Penitentiary, The Superintendent or Assistant Superintendent, and the head\\\\nWarden or an associate Warden.  The Board of Inquiry will request that the accused inmate appear\\\\nbefore the Board and speak in his own behalf.  No Punishment will be administered in the field.\\\" (Although these rules were adopted as a result of the Talley case, they were never approved by\\\\nthe court.)\\\\nEach inmate, as well as the employees of the Penitentiary, was given a copy of the rules and was instructed to\\\\nbecome familiar with and understand each of them.  New prisoners were similarly instructed. \\\\n\\\\nIn August of 1966 Superintendent Bishop became aware of irregularities at the Tucker Prison Farm and\\\\nrequested that the Criminal Investigation Division of the Arkansas State Police conduct an investigation.  The\\\\ninvestigation disclosed rank violations of the rules by certain of the Prison officials.  Shortly thereafter all of the\\\\nwardens at Tucker Farm were discharged or allowed to resign.  Since that time there have been three new\\\\n809 assistant superintendents in *809 charge of Tucker Farm in quick succession, as well as other personnel\\\\nchanges. \\\\nSubsequently the Arkansas Legislature through a special commission, as well as the Penitentiary Board,\\\\nconducted various investigations of the penal system.  As a result, many desirable changes have been brought\\\\nabout in the administration of the two farms. \\\\nThese cases were filed in the fall of 1966 and it was during their preparation for trial that the aforementioned\\\\ninvestigations were taking place.  Therefore, by the time of the trial many of the activities complained of had\\\\nceased and many of the individuals involved no longer were employed by the Penitentiary. \\\\nThe trial of these cases lasted some three days, in which the court heard testimony from fifteen prisoners, several\\\\nmembers and ex-members of the Prison personnel, one doctor, and two expert penologists.  Some of the\\\\ntestimony pertained to strappings and other whippings which took place prior to the Talley decision in 1965.  The\\\\ncourt ruled that this testimony would be admitted only for the purpose of showing the background or history and\\\\nwould not be relevant to the type of punishment used in the Prison system since the changes brought about by\\\\nthe Talley decision, or more particularly since the rules were promulgated in January of 1966. \\\\nThe strap which is referred to throughout this opinion is made of leather and is between four and five feet long\\\\nand four inches wide.  This leather is bradded to a wooden handle approximately six inches in length.  The strap is\\\\nabout one-fourth inch thick at the end attached to the wooden handle and is gradually tapered toward the end\\\\nwhich comes in contact with the person being whipped.  The evidence showed that there is more than one strap\\\\nused at the Penitentiary but all are of approximately the same construction.  Some of these straps are depicted in\\\\nplaintiffs\\\\' exhibit No. 4. \\\\nEvidence relating to the petitioners herein. \\\\nThe evidence showed that the plaintiff Jackson, age 28, entered the prison in 1963 to serve a five year sentence\\\\nfor burglary.  Jackson testified to having been subjected to physical beatings three times since he has been in\\\\n[3]\\\\nprison.  First, in 1965, James Pike, a trusty and long line rider,  (an escapee at the time of this trial) hit him\\\\nseveral times with his fist, as well as kicking him two or three times.  The testimony was unclear as to what the\\\\n[4]\\\\npurpose of this whipping was.  In November of 1965 Jackson was whipped with the strap by Captain  Harmon, a\\\\nfield warden at the Penitentiary, for not picking enough cotton.  He has been whipped only once since the rules\\\\nwere promulgated in January 1966. \\\\nOn July 29, 1966, Jackson and seven other inmates received eight lashes with the strap for leaving okra in the\\\\nfield.  Jackson testified that he was charged by the long line rider with overlooking okra and was taken by Captain\\\\nHarmon to the office of Clay Smith, Head Warden at Cummins Farm.  In the process of conducting a hearing on\\\\nthe matter, Captain Smith informed the inmates of the charges against them and asked if each was familiar with\\\\nthe rules of the Penitentiary.  He then asked if anyone would like to make a statement, and Jackson told Captain\\\\nSmith that he had picked all the okra he could see and that he was having eye problems and needed glasses. \\\\nCaptain Smith called for Jackson\\\\'s medical record to determine the condition of Jackson\\\\'s eyes.  After checking\\\\nthese records and finding that Jackson had been certified as physically able for normal work, he then sentenced\\\\neach prisoner to receive eight lashes with the strap.  These lashes were administered by Captain Dean, another\\\\n810 warden at the *810 Prison.  Prisoners were required to lie face down on a concrete floor while Captain Dean\\\\nadministered the licks to the buttocks.  Jackson testified that the whipping caused much pain and left his buttocks\\\\nbruised and sore for a number of days.  The prisoners were returned to the field, where they continued to pick\\\\nokra for the rest of the day without incident. \\\\n\\\\nFurther evidence shows that at the time of the whipping Jackson had, and still has, a visual defect of the left eye. \\\\nThere is also a slight variance from normal vision in the right eye but this is within the normal vision for reading. \\\\nShortly after the whipping he was taken to the nearby city of Pine Bluff for an eye examination and the examining\\\\n[5]\\\\ndoctor did not recommend glasses for him. \\\\nPlaintiff Ernst is 24 years old and has been in the penitentiary (Tucker Farm) since January 19, 1963.  He has\\\\nreceived seven whippings during his entire stay.  The first three of these were administered before the rules were\\\\npromulgated.  They involve charges of scuffling in the barracks, not working hard enough in the fields, and cursing\\\\na trusty guard. \\\\nIn January of 1966, shortly after the rules were promulgated, Ernst received ten lashes upon a charge of talking\\\\n[6]\\\\nback to an overseer known as a yardman.   He was called to Assistant Superintendent Bruton\\\\'s office on the\\\\nmorning following the alleged offense and was told that he was charged with talking back to the yardman, was\\\\nrequired to lie face down on the floor, and receive ten licks with the strap.  No other wardens or other prison\\\\nofficials were present during the charge or the whipping. \\\\nSometime later in 1966 he received ten licks from Captain Mayes for throwing his hat across the Prison yard.  The\\\\nprisoners are told that they must wear their hats in the field and also that they must care for and not misuse the\\\\nclothing issued to them.  Ernst testified that on this evening as he returned to the barracks from the field he took\\\\noff his hat and threw it across the Prison yard onto the ground.  Upon seeing this, Captain Mayes called him over,\\\\ntook him into the barracks, made him lie down and gave him ten lashes with the strap.  There were no other\\\\nwardens or other prison personnel present at this whipping. \\\\nOn July 20, 1966, plaintiff Ernst was picking cucumbers in the field and was charged by the long line rider with\\\\nnot working and leaving cucumbers on the vines.  Ernst responded by saying that he was working the best he\\\\ncould on the food that was fed him and that he was feeling ill. The rider reported Ernst to Captain Mayes, who\\\\ntook him from the fields to the barracks and gave him ten lashes with the strap.  This time Ernst was required to\\\\nlower his pants and was whipped on the bare buttocks, which he testified cut and bruised him and caused a great\\\\ndeal of pain.  There was no hearing or formal charge and there were no other wardens present.  Ernst was then\\\\nreturned to the field to continue his work.  Some forty-five minutes or an hour later, the long line rider approached\\\\nErnst and started picking cucumbers back down the row upon which Ernst had just been working.  He picked\\\\napproximately a half bushel of cucumbers from the area in which Ernst had been working since returning from the\\\\nfirst whipping.  The rider again reported Ernst to Captain Mayes.  Ernst was returned to the barracks and taken to\\\\nCaptain Bruton, who was shown the cucumbers and told what had happened.  Captain Bruton instructed Captain\\\\nMayes to give Ernst ten lashes.  He was again required to lower his pants and lie face down on the concrete floor\\\\n811 to receive the licks.  Ernst testified that this whipping left large bruises and caused *811 him to bleed.  Captain\\\\n[7]\\\\nBruton was present during this whipping and when it was over he ordered Ernst to stand on the \\\"teeter board\\\"\\\\ninside the barracks until he was told to get off.  Ernst testified that he was required to remain on the teeter board\\\\nfor the rest of the day or about three or four hours.  According to Ernst this treatment caused his legs and ankles\\\\nto swell and ache.  He has not been whipped since that day.\\\\nPlaintiff Mask is twenty years old and has been in prison since November 12, 1965.  He spent his first four and a\\\\nhalf months at the Cummins Farm and was then sent to Tucker and has been there since that time.  He has\\\\nreceived five whippings with the strap since coming to Tucker.  The first such whipping was in June of 1966, when\\\\nhe was charged by a long line rider with being the last in the field or working too slow and was taken to Captain\\\\nFletcher.  Captain Fletcher administered ten licks.  One week later he was reported leaving cucumbers in the field. \\\\nHe was taken to Captain Bruton, who told him to get his pants down and lie on the floor.  Captain Fletcher gave\\\\nhim ten licks.  Plaintiff testified that two months later he was caught putting rotten tomatoes in the box they were\\\\nusing to carry tomatoes from the field where they were being picked.  Captain Bruton gave him nine licks for this\\\\noffense.  In September of 1966 he was charged with not picking enough cotton.  He testified that he had picked\\\\nninety pounds that day. He was taken to Captain Goodwin, the Assistant Superintendent at that time, who\\\\nsentenced him to six lashes which were administered by Captain Heston.  On December 7, 1966, he and several\\\\nother inmates were charged with sitting down and smoking when they should have been picking cotton.  He\\\\nreceived eight lashes for this offense and was put in an isolation cell for eight days.  While plaintiff was in this cell,\\\\n\\\\nhe received regular meals, although he was denied his mail privileges and could not purchase anything from the\\\\ncommissary. \\\\nPlaintiff Mask also testified concerning an altercation between him and Captain Goodwin sometime in the last of\\\\nNovember 1966.  Mask said that Captain Goodwin hit him on the chin and then had him brought into the office\\\\nwhere he was hit four or five times in the stomach and kicked once.  Captain Goodwin testified that he had not hit\\\\nMask but merely grabbed him and shook him and pushed him in a corner.  The testimony is not clear just why this\\\\naltercation arose; however, it appears it had something to do with Mask\\\\'s attitude toward work and his work\\\\nperformance. \\\\nPlaintiff Mask also complained that his knee bothers him when he works for long periods of time.  This causes him\\\\nnot to be able to do as much work as is required of him.  His knee was injured in a tractor accident in 1960 to such\\\\nan extent that it required surgery to repair.  There is some evidence that it might have been re-injured in 1964. \\\\nHowever, medical evidence was introduced to show that there were no significant residual effects of the earlier\\\\n[8]\\\\ninjury and also that there had been no recent re-injury. \\\\nThe court also heard testimony from twelve other inmates of the Arkansas State Penitentiary, most of which was\\\\ncumulative to that given by the three named plaintiffs as well as corroborating some of their testimony set out\\\\nabove.  These prisoners related the facts surrounding whippings which the various prisoners had received for\\\\noffenses such as insufficient work, insubordination, and scuffling among prisoners.  According to these witnesses,\\\\n812 some of *812 the whippings were administered without a formal hearing, also some hearings were conducted\\\\nwith only one warden present.  The general pattern of these whippings as related by the prisoners is that a\\\\nprisoner is charged by a trusty or other inmate in the capacity of an overseer such as a long line rider or yardman\\\\nwith some infraction of the Penitentiary rules.  He is taken to a warden.  The warden then takes him before another\\\\nPenitentiary official and there charges him with a rule infraction.  In most cases the prisoner is given a chance to\\\\nexplain his actions; then sentence is handed down.  If the prisoner is found guilty and sentenced to a whipping, he\\\\nis required to lie face down on the floor and receive the lashes on his buttocks.  The prisoners claim that the word\\\\nof the trusty or accusing warden is usually summarily accepted without further investigation or questioning. \\\\nThe prisoners also testified to certain beatings which inmates had received at the hands of trusties or other\\\\ninmates in positions of authority.  These beatings seem to have no connection with the disciplining of the beaten\\\\nprisoners; however, testimony showed that yardmen, floorwalkers, and occasionally a night warden have seen\\\\nthese beatings and have not reported the inmates for fighting nor have they tried to interfere with the beatings. \\\\nMost of this type activity takes place at night in the barracks; however, there were a few instances in which one or\\\\ntwo blows were struck in the field. \\\\nInvestigator H. H. Atkinson of the Criminal Investigation Division of the Arkansas State Police testified as to the\\\\nfacts and circumstances of his investigation of the Tucker Prison Farm in August of 1966.  Atkinson\\\\'s investigation\\\\narose out of some alleged violations of the rules involving possession of liquor by some of the inmates.  He\\\\ntestified that as his investigation progressed he and his men uncovered various acts of brutality and cruel\\\\ntreatment of the inmates by certain officials and trusties at Tucker Farm.  Immediately upon report of his findings\\\\nto Superintendent Goodwin, all the wardens at Tucker Farm were discharged.  Although new personnel was\\\\nappointed, Atkinson\\\\'s investigation continued for some twenty-two days.  He revealed that he had uncovered such\\\\ntorturous devices as a crank telephone device which was used to electrically shock prisoners, as well as use of\\\\nthe teeter board and strapping upon the bare buttocks.  He testified that in the first part of his investigation he\\\\nwitnessed such a strapping of an inmate by Captain Mayes.  He further testified that all persons responsible for\\\\nsuch treatment have been discharged. \\\\nHe was later placed in charge of Tucker Farm as Acting Assistant Superintendent during the administrative\\\\nchanges in December of 1966 and January of 1967.  He said that he found it necessary to use the strap while he\\\\nwas in charge.  He strapped four of twelve prisoners who had been sentenced by a three-man board of inquiry to\\\\nsix lashes because they had picked an insufficient amount of cotton.  He was told later by the inmates that they\\\\nwere \\\"trying him to see if he would use the whip.\\\" He also said that he got better work from the prisoners after\\\\nthey found out he would use the strap. \\\\n\\\\nSuperintendent O. E. Bishop has been Superintendent for the Prison system since January 1, 1966.  He testified\\\\nthat when the rules were promulgated he made every effort to make sure that each prisoner had a copy of the\\\\nrules and understood them.  His efforts included reading the rules to the prisoners over a loud speaker system\\\\nand answering any questions they might have.  He instructed all the personnel of the Prison that anyone who was\\\\nfound not following the rules would be fired immediately.  He also told the trusties that they would be \\\"ranked\\\"\\\\n(lose their privileges as trusties) at the first violation of the rules.  The evidence showed in fact that some trusties\\\\nhave been ranked and several wardens have been fired because of violations. \\\\n813 *813 He testified that he was not aware of the activities that had taken place at Tucker Farm prior to August of\\\\n1966 because his duties required him to spend the largest part of his time at Cummins Farm.  He also said that\\\\nthe two farms were fifty miles apart and that he could not leave Cummins to go to Tucker without the wardens at\\\\nTucker knowing of his visit beforehand. \\\\nSuperintendent Bishop said that disciplinary methods other than the use of the strap are also used in the\\\\nPenitentiary system.  These include loss of the few privileges which exist for the prisoners, administrative isolation\\\\nor solitary confinement, and removal from the plasma program, which is a means by which the prisoners earn\\\\nmoney.  He said that often prisoners charged with violations of the rules were found not guilty and were not\\\\npunished.  The evidence showed that substantial improvements have been made in the facilities and in the\\\\nadministrative procedure of the Penitentiary system since Mr. Bishop has taken over. \\\\nThe court heard the testimony of five of the wardens who were discharged or permitted to resign from the staff at\\\\nTucker Farm.  Captain Clay Smith, Head Warden, and two other wardens at Cummins Farm also testified.  These\\\\nwitnesses related the facts and circumstances surrounding each of the whippings complained of in this case.\\\\nThey said that in each case involving a whipping there had been a violation of the rules by the prisoners and\\\\nexcept in a few instances (which have been admitted by the defendant) the procedure for the administration of\\\\ncorporal punishment as set out in the rules was followed.  They maintained that at all hearings at least two\\\\nwardens were present.  They also said that they treated the whipping of prisoners as just another part of their jobs\\\\nand had no personal feelings against the prisoners while the whipping was being administered. \\\\nCaptain Clay Smith testified that he usually sits on the board of inquiry at Cummins Farm and that he always\\\\nasked the prisoner being charged if he knew of and understood the rules and regulations.  He then would ask if\\\\nthe prisoner had anything to say before he decided the case or gave any punishment.', ' He instructed all the personnel of the Prison that anyone who was\\\\nfound not following the rules would be fired immediately.

Captain Smith said that he\\\\ncould not set a work quota for each inmate because of the many variables involved in the day-to-day work at the\\\\nPrison.  He stated that all the Prison administration asked of the inmates was an honest day\\\\'s work.  Upon being\\\\nquestioned by the court, Captain Smith said that of the 1,600 inmates at Cummins, in 1966 approximately 200\\\\nwere whipped.  He said the great majority of prisoners adjusted satisfactorily to Prison conditions and are never\\\\npunished.  There are some whose conduct is such that discipline in some form becomes necessary.  There is a\\\\nsmaller group who are rebellious and, because of their recalcitrance, require repeated disciplinary measures. \\\\nThe court reconvened some two and a half weeks after the close of the first two days of this hearing to hear the\\\\n[9]\\\\ntestimony of two expert penologists presented by counsel for the plaintiffs. \\\\nJames V. Bennett, who was Director of the Federal Prisons from 1937 to 1964, and whose qualifications as an\\\\neminent penologist are far too numerous to mention here, gave his views on the use of the whip for disciplinary\\\\npurposes in a penitentiary.  He said that in all the many years in which he was connected with the federal prisons\\\\nhe never used strapping or corporal punishment for disciplinary purposes.  He felt that it was brutal and medieval\\\\nand did no real good.  He also testified that to his knowledge only one other state used the whip officially in its\\\\npenitentiary system.  He said that it was possible, however, that other states used it unofficially.  He said that he\\\\n814 had never visited *814 the Arkansas Penitentiary System and that he was familiar with it only through discussions\\\\nwith prisoners who had been incarcerated there. \\\\nHe had read and was familiar with the rules of the Penitentiary.  Even if corporal punishment were permitted, it\\\\nwas his opinion that these rules were too indefinite and could be easily circumvented so as to make them\\\\nineffective.  He said that an inmate should be entitled to a completely objective hearing by a qualified employee\\\\nwhose decision should be approved by a high ranking official in the system before corporal punishment is\\\\n\\\\nadministered to that prisoner.  He also suggested that a cooling-off period should be allowed between the charge\\\\nand the decision or sentence.  He advocated the use of incentives for good behavior rather than punishment. \\\\nMr. Fred Wilkinson, Director of Corrections for the State of Missouri, who is also an eminently qualified penologist\\\\nwith many years of experience in the federal prisons, also testified for plaintiffs.  It is his opinion that all forms of\\\\ncorporal punishment should be abolished.  He said that he also knew of only one other state that uses the whip\\\\nofficially in disciplining prison inmates.  In his experience the most commonly used punishment was forfeiture of\\\\ngood time credits, deprivation of privileges, and administrative separation.  He said that if the strap were used,\\\\nthere should be a commission or board to rule on the appropriate discipline rather than just one person.  Both he\\\\nand Mr. Bennett testified at some length as to the type of facilities and the forms of punishment used in the\\\\nprisons with which they had been connected. \\\\nAccording to Mr. Wilkinson, in the Missouri Prison System there is one paid employee for each four or five\\\\nprisoners; nationally the average is one paid employee to about seven or eight prisoners.  It appears that in\\\\nArkansas the ratio is one paid employee to approximately 58 prisoners. \\\\nWe now consider the applicable law.\\\\nThe Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides \\\"* * * excessive bail shall not be\\\\nrequired, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\\\" (Emphasis supplied.) Although the prohibitions of this Amendment originally applied only to the federal government, it is now well\\\\nsettled that they apply equally to the States through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  \\\\nRobinson v. State of California, 370 U.S. 660, 82 S.Ct. 1417, 8 L.Ed.2d 758; United States ex rel. Bryant v. Fay,\\\\n211 F.Supp. 812 (D.C. N.Y.1962). \\\\nThe courts have never arrived at a satisfactory definition of \\\"cruel and unusual punishment.\\\" As was said recently\\\\nby the Eighth Circuit, \\\"It is settled doctrine that except in extreme cases the courts may not interfere with the\\\\nconduct of a prison, with its regulations and their enforcement, or with its discipline.  (Citation of authorities.)\\\" However, in the same case the court went on to say, \\\"Unlawful administration can exist where there are aspects\\\\nof institutional treatment of such character or consequences as to shock general conscience or to be intolerable\\\\nin fundamental fairness.  Such treatment is entitled to be held to be within the ban of the Eighth Amendment as\\\\nrepresenting cruel and unusual punishment and so constituting unlawful administration of prison sentence.\\\" Lee\\\\nv. Tahash, 352 F.2d 970, 971, 972 (1965).  See also Carey v. Settle, 351 F.2d 483 (8 Cir. 1965). \\\\nThe court has weighed the evidence in these cases, along with the arguments and authorities set forth in the\\\\nexcellent briefs of both parties.  We think it is fair to say, however, as this court said in Talley, \\\"* * * corporal\\\\npunishment has not been viewed historically as a constitutionally forbidden cruel and unusual punishment.\\\" Neither are we willing to say that the use of the strap in and of itself is contrary to the Eighth Amendment\\\\'s\\\\nprohibitions. \\\\n815 *815 \\\"Every punishment in a sense involves cruelty since it imposes by force conditions at odds with the concept\\\\nof the freedom of the person from all forms of trespass, and freedom of action.  More than this is required to\\\\nviolate the Eighth Amendment.\\\" Wright v. McMann, 257 F.Supp. 739, 745 (D.C.N.Y. 1966). \\\\nThis, of course, does not extend to all types of corporal punishment or to unguarded use of the strap.  A\\\\npunishment, like a law, may be constitutional in its bare form and yet be unconstitutionally administered.  Certainly\\\\nproper safeguards against capricious administration are necessary to keep such punishment from violating\\\\nconstitutional standards. \\\\nThere can be no doubt that the brutal and sadistic atrocities which were uncovered by the investigation of the\\\\nState Police in August and September of 1966 cannot be tolerated.  The court has reference to the use of a\\\\ntelephone shocking apparatus, the teeter board, strapping on the bare buttocks, and other torturous acts of this\\\\nnature.  The defendant admits that these acts were committed but claims that they were carried on without the\\\\nknowledge or approval of the Superintendent, that they are contrary to the Prison rules as well as the State law,\\\\n\\\\nthat all personnel responsible for such acts have been discharged, that the offending objects of torture have been\\\\ndisposed of, and that administrative steps have been taken to assure that such acts will not recur.\\\\nThe court commends the actions of the Superintendent, under the supervision of the Prison Board, which have\\\\nproduced more efficient administration and improved standards of discipline, as well as other improvements;\\\\nhowever, we feel that the inmates\\\\' right to be free of such treatment as disclosed in the testimony cannot depend\\\\nupon the competence of the administrative personnel which changes from time to time; therefore, these and\\\\nother actions of this character will be permanently enjoined. \\\\nAs we have indicated, the court is aware that there has been much improvement in the disciplining of prisoners\\\\nsince the rules were promulgated in January 1966.  However, the court finds that the \\\"Rules and Regulations\\\"\\\\nadopted by the Penitentiary Board January 10, 1966 do not provide the adequate safeguards required by this\\\\ncourt in Talley. \\\\nAs an example, they are unnecessarily ambiguous in prescribing the composition of the \\\"board of inquiry\\\"\\\\ndescribed in the rules.  We agree with Dr. Bennett\\\\'s observation that this portion of the rules is so indefinite as to\\\\nbe easily circumvented.  It is obvious from the testimony that experience under these rules has proven this to be\\\\ntrue. \\\\nThe court refers particularly to the convening of hearings in connection with the administration of corporal\\\\npunishment without a proper \\\"board of inquiry.\\\" The court will enjoin the use of the strap as punishment at the penitentiary until proper and adequate safeguards\\\\nsurrounding its use are provided by those in charge of prison administration. \\\\nIt is neither this court\\\\'s duty nor its inclination to tell the defendant or the Penitentiary Board what rules should be\\\\npromulgated in order to comply with the Constitution.  However, the court will make these general observations. \\\\nFirst, more than one person\\\\'s judgment should be required for a decision to administer corporal punishment.  This\\\\nis implicit in the existing rules which require such a decision to be made by a board of inquiry.  In this procedure,\\\\nthe accuser should not be counted among those who sit in judgment. \\\\nSecondly, that circumvention of the rules and regulations by an official in time of anger is intolerable.  Certainly a\\\\nprisoner charged with a rule violation is entitled to and should be provided with an objectively reasoned,\\\\n816 dispassionate *816 decision as to whether or not he should be punished. \\\\nThird, that summary acceptance of one inmate\\\\'s report on another without further investigation in determining\\\\nwhether punishment should be administered voids the effectiveness of any rules and regulations. \\\\nAnd, finally, it is suggested that the Superintendent or an Assistant Superintendent of the Prison participate in or\\\\nreview any decision to inflict corporal punishment. \\\\nThe court finds that the evidence is insufficient to sustain the contention of each plaintiff concerning his physical\\\\nimpairment.  Each claims that he has been unconstitutionally punished because of failure to do work which he is\\\\nphysically unable to do. \\\\nThere can be no doubt that as we stated in the Talley decision:\\\\n\\\"* * * for prison officials knowingly to compel convicts to perform physical labor which is beyond\\\\ntheir strength, or which constitutes a danger to their lives or health, or which is unduly painful\\\\nconstitutes an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the 8th Amendment to the\\\\nConstitution of the United States as included in the 14th Amendment.\\\" However, such a situation does not exist in this case. Upon request of plaintiffs\\\\' counsel the court appointed Dr.\\\\nDale Alford (an ophthalmologist) to examine plaintiff Jackson\\\\'s eyes, and Dr. John Hundley and Dr. Charles\\\\nMcKenzie (orthopedic surgeons) to examine plaintiff Mask\\\\'s knee. Relying upon these doctors\\\\' reports, as well as\\\\nthe prison medical records of each plaintiff and the testimony surrounding the incidents concerning the alleged\\\\nphysical impairments, the court can find no merit in these contentions. \\\\n\\\\nAn injunction will be issued permanently restraining the defendant and any personnel of the Prison System from:\\\\nThe use of any such devices as the crank telephone or teeter board; or The application of any\\\\nwhipping to the bare skin of prisoners. \\\\nSuch officials are further restrained from the \\\"use of the strap\\\" on any prisoner until additional rules and\\\\nregulations are promulgated with appropriate safeguards in accordance with this opinion and filed with the Clerk\\\\nof this court.\\\\nAn order will be issued in accordance with this opinion. \\\\nDECREE\\\\nIn accordance with the Memorandum Opinion of the court filed this date, the defendant, O. E. Bishop,\\\\nSuperintendent of the Arkansas State Penitentiary, and any personnel of the Prison System are permanently\\\\nrestrained from:\\\\nThe use of any such devices as the crank telephone or teeter board; or\\\\nThe application of any whipping to the bare skin of prisoners. \\\\nSuch officials are further restrained from the \\\"use of the strap\\\" on any prisoner until additional rules and\\\\nregulations are promulgated with appropriate safeguards in accordance with said opinion and filed with the Clerk\\\\nof this court.\\\\n[1]Talley v. Stephens, D.C., 247 F.Supp. 683.  This is an earlier decision before this court in which inmates of the\\\\nArkansas State Penitentiary were complaining about treatment received and constitutional rights being denied. \\\\nSome of the issues and many of the principles involved are identical with the cases which are now before the\\\\ncourt. Therefore we will refer to the Talley decision several times throughout this opinion rather than repeat facts\\\\nand circumstances which are the same in these cases.\\\\n[2] For further information concerning the operation of the prison see Talley v.

The  hostile\\\\'  work  environment  to  which  Charlene \\\\nDaugherty  and  other  similarly  situated  females  were  subjected \\\\nincluded  sexually explicit and  implicit  language  and  conduct  that \\\\nwas  so  severe  and  pervasive  as  to  adversely  affect  the  ter.ms  and \\\\nconditions  of  the  employment  of  female  workers.  \\\\n9.   Charlene Daugherty and other similarly situated females \\\\nacted  reasonably  and  continuously  complained  to  Defendant  of  the \\\\nsexually  hostile  and  intimidating  work  environment.   However, \\\\nDefendant did not act reasonably to stop or prevent the harassment.  \\\\n10.   Furthermore,  Defendant  maintained  a  sexually  hostile \\\\nand  intimidating  work  environment  that  was  so  unpleasant  or \\\\ndifficult  in  which  to  work  that  a  reasonable  person  in  Charlene \\\\nDaugherty\\\\'s position would  feel  compelled to resign,  resulting in \\\\nthe  constructive  discharge  of  Charlene  Daugherty  because  of  her \\\\nsex  in violation of  \\u00a7703(a)  of  Title VII.  \\\\n11.

Plaintiff Dinah Charlene Daugherty (\\\"Ms. Daugherty\\\") brings this action \\\\npursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e, et seq. \\\\nas amended by the Civil Rights Act of 1991.  \\\\n2.  Subject matter jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 US.C.  \\\\nSec. 1331 and 1343, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e, et seq. \\\\n3.  This action is brought within the State where the unlawful employment \\\\npractice was committed, making venue proper under 42 U.S.C. Section 2000e-\\\\n5(1)(3).  \\\\n\\\\nThe Parties \\\\n4.  Plaintiff, Ms. Daugherty, is a female citizen of the United States and of the \\\\nState of Alabama.  She is a resident of Mobile, Alabama, (Mobile County) which \\\\nmakes her a resident of this District and Division. \\\\'\\\\n5.  Plaintiff Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\\\"EEOC\\\") brought \\\\nsuit on July 19, 2001 on behalf of Ms. Daugherty and other similarly-situated \\\\nfemale Wal-Mart employees.  \\\\n6.  Defendant Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\\\"Wal-Mart\\\"), is an employer within the \\\\nmeaning of Title VII  of the  1964 Civil Rights Act and, the 1991 amendments \\\\nthereto.  \\\\nStatement of Facts \\\\n6.  Wal-Mart is located and doing business within this District and Division.  \\\\n7.  Ms. Daugherty was an employee ofWal-Mart within the meaning of Title \\\\nVII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1991 amendments thereto, up until her \\\\nconstructive discharge in April of 1998.  \\\\n8.  Prior to her constructive discharge from Wal-Mart, Ms. Daugherty was \\\\nemployed as a retail sales representative at Wal-Mart Store No. 866 in Mobile, \\\\nAlabama (Mobile County).   She began work for Wal-Mart on September 13, 1997.  \\\\n9.  From January 1998 through the date of her constructive discharge, Wal \\\\nMart engaged in unlawful employment practices against Ms. Daugherty at its \\\\nMobile, Alabama, store No. 866, in violation of Sec. 703(a)(1) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\\\nSec. 2000e et seq.  Wal-Mart through its agents subjected Ms. Daugherty to a \\\\n\\\\n.. \\\\nsexually hostile and intimidating work environment.  \\\\n10.  The hostile work environment to which Ms. Daugherty was subjected \\\\nincluded sexually explicit and implicit language and conduct that was so severe \\\\nand pervasive as to adversely affect the terms and conditions of the employment \\\\nof Ms. Daugherty.  \\\\n11.  Ms. Daugherty acted reasonably and she continuously complained to \\\\nWal-Mart of the sexually hostile and intimidating work environment.   However, \\\\nWal-Mart did not act reasonably to stop and/or prevent the harassment.  \\\\n12.  Furthermore, Wal-Mart maintained a sexually hostile and intimidating \\\\nwork environment that was so unpleasant or difficult in which to work that a \\\\nreasonable person in Ms.  Daugherty\\\\'s position would feel compelled to resign, \\\\nresulting in the constructive discharge of Ms. Daughterty because of her gender \\\\nin violation of Sec. 703(a) of Title VII.  \\\\n13.  The effect of the practices complained of above has been to deprive Ms. \\\\nDaugherty of equal employment opportunities and otherwise adversely her status \\\\nas an employee on the basis of her gender and on the basis of retaliation.  \\\\n14.  The unlawful practices complained of were intentional.  \\\\n15.  The unlawful practices complained of were done with malice and/or \\\\nreckless indifference to the federally protected rights of Ms. Daugherty.  \\\\n\\\\nCLAIM I \\\\nTitle VIISexual Harassment \\\\n16.   Ms.  Daugherty realleges  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  all \\\\nparagraphs above.  \\\\n17.  Ms. Daugherty was subjected to sexual harassment in violation of Title \\\\nVII.  \\\\n18.
