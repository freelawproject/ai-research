 It is precisely because Sinclair stands as a significant departure from our otherwise consistent emphasis upon the congressional policy to promote the peaceful settlement of labor disputes through arbitration [6] and our efforts to accommodate and harmonize this policy with those underlying the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act [7] that we believe Sinclair should be reconsidered.  Furthermore, in light of developments subsequent to Sinclair, in particular our decision in Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge 735, 390 U. S. 557 (1968), it has become clear that the Sinclair decision does not further but rather frustrates realization of an important goal of our national labor policy.  Nor can we agree that conclusive weight should be accorded to the failure of Congress to respond to Sinclair on the theory that congressional silence should be interpreted as acceptance of the decision.  The Court has cautioned that "[i]t is at best treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law." Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61 , 69 *242 (1946).  Therefore, in the absence of any persuasive circumstances evidencing a clear design that congressional inaction be taken as acceptance of Sinclair, the mere silence of Congress is not a sufficient reason for refusing to reconsider the decision.  Helvering v. Hallock, supra, at 119-120 .  III From the time Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, <citedDecision>353 U. S. 448</citedDecision> (1957), was decided, we have frequently found it necessary to consider various substantive and procedural aspects of federal labor contract law and questions concerning its application in both state and federal courts.  <citedDecision>Lincoln Mills</citedDecision> held generally that "the substantive law to apply in suits under § 301 (a) is federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws," <citedDecision>353 U. S., at 456</citedDecision> , and more specifically that a union can obtain specific performance of an employer's promise to arbitrate grievances.  We rejected the contention that the anti-injunction proscriptions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act prohibited this type of relief, nothing that a refusal to arbitrate was not "part and parcel of the abuses against which the Act was aimed," <citedDecision>id., at 458</citedDecision> , and that the Act itself manifests a policy determination that arbitration should be encouraged.  See 29 U. S. C. § 108 .  [8] Subsequently in the Steelworkers *243 Trilogy [9] we emphasized the importance of arbitration as an instrument of federal policy for resolving disputes between labor and management and cautioned the lower courts against usurping the functions of the arbitrator.  Serious questions remained, however, concerning the role that state courts were to play in suits involving collective-bargaining agreements.  Confronted with some of these problems in Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, 368 U. S. 502 (1962), we held that Congress clearly intended not to disturb the pre-existing jurisdiction of the state courts over suits for violations of collective-bar-gaining agreements.  We noted that the "clear implication of the entire record of the congressional debates in both 1946 and 1947 is that the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon the federal district courts was not to displace, but to supplement, the thoroughly considered jurisdiction of the courts of the various States over contracts made by labor organizations." Id., at 511 .

id., at 104, we did not consider the applicability of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to state court proceedings because the employer's prayer for relief sought only *244 damages and not specific performance of a no-strike obligation.  Subsequent to the decision in Sinclair, we held in Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge 735, supra , that § 301 (a) suits initially brought in state courts may be removed to the designated federal forum under the federal question removal jurisdiction delineated in 28 U. S. C. § 1441 .  In so holding, however, the Court expressly left open the questions whether state courts are bound by the anti-injunction proscriptions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and whether federal courts, after removal of a § 301 (a) action, are required to dissolve any injunctive relief previously granted by the state courts.  See generally General Electric Co. v. Local Union 191, 413 F. 2d 964 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1969) (dissolution of state injunction required).  Three Justices who concurred expressed the view that Sinclair should be reconsidered "upon an appropriate future occasion." 390 U. S., at 562 (STEWART, J., concurring).  [10] The decision in Avco, viewed in the context of <citedDecision>Lincoln Mills</citedDecision> and its progeny, has produced an anomalous situation which, in our view, makes urgent the reconsideration of Sinclair.  The principal practical effect of Avco and Sinclair taken together is nothing less than to oust state courts of jurisdiction in § 301 (a) suits where injunctive *245 relief is sought for breach of a no-strike obligation.  Union defendants can, as a matter of course, obtain removal to a federal court, [11] and there is obviously a compelling incentive for them to do so in order to gain the advantage of the strictures upon injunctive relief which Sinclair imposes on federal courts.  The sanctioning of this practice, however, is wholly inconsistent with our conclusion in Dowd Box that the congressional purpose embodied in § 301 (a) was to supplement, and not to encroach upon, the pre-existing jurisdiction of the state courts.  [12] It is ironic indeed that the very provision that Congress clearly intended to provide additional remedies for breach of collective-bargaining agreements has been employed to displace previously existing state remedies.  We are not at liberty thus to depart from the clearly expressed congressional policy to the contrary.  On the other hand, to the extent that widely disparate remedies theoretically remain available in state, as opposed to federal, courts, the federal policy of labor law *246 uniformity elaborated in Lucas Flour Co., is seriously offended.

 While some commentators have suggested that the solution to the present unsatisfactory situation does lie in the extension of the Sinclair prohibition to state court proceedings, [14] we agree with Chief Justice Traynor of the California Supreme Court that "whether or not Congress could deprive state courts of the power to give such [injunctive] remedies when enforcing collective bargaining agreements, it has not attempted to do so either in the Norris-LaGuardia Act or section 301." McCarroll v. Los Angeles County Dist. Council of Carpenters, 49 Cal. 2d 45, 63 , 315 P. 2d 322, 332 (1957), cert. denied, 355 U. S. 932 (1958).  See, e. g., American Dredging Co. v. Marine Local 25, 338 F. 2d 837 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 380 U. S. 935 (1965); Shaw Electric Co. v. I.  B. E. W., 418 Pa. 1 , 208 A. 2d 769 (1965).  An additional reason for not resolving the existing dilemma by extending Sinclair to the States is the devastating implications for the enforceability of arbitration agreements and their accompanying no-strike obligations if equitable remedies were not available.  [15] As we have *248 previously indicated, a no-strike obligation, express or implied, is the quid pro quo for an undertaking by the employer to submit grievance disputes to the process of arbitration.  See <citedDecision>Textile Workers Union</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Lincoln Mills, supra, at 455</citedDecision> .  [16] Any incentive for employers to enter into such an arrangement is necessarily dissipated if the principal and most expeditious method by which the no-strike obligation can be enforced is eliminated.  While it is of course true, as respondent contends, that other avenues of redress, such as an action for damages, would remain open to an aggrieved employer, an award of damages after a dispute has been settled is no substitute for an immediate halt to an illegal strike.  Furthermore, an action for damages prosecuted during or after a labor dispute would only tend to aggravate industrial strife and delay an early resolution of the difficulties between employer and union.  [17] *249 Even if management is not encouraged by the unavailability of the injunction remedy to resist arbitration agreements, the fact remains that the effectiveness of such agreements would be greatly reduced if injunctive relief were withheld.  Indeed, the very purpose of arbitration procedures is to provide a mechanism for the expeditious settlement of industrial disputes without resort to strikes, lockouts, or other self-help measures.  This basic purpose is obviously largely undercut if there is no immediate, effective remedy for those very tactics that arbitration is designed to obviate.

 This shift in emphasis was accomplished, however, without extensive revision of many of the older enactments, including the anti-injunction section of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  Thus it became the task of the courts to accommodate, to reconcile the older statutes with the more recent ones.  A leading example of this accommodation process is Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River & Ind. R. Co., 353 U. S. 30 (1957).  There we were confronted with a peaceful strike which violated the statutory duty to arbitrate imposed by the Railway Labor Act.  The Court concluded that a strike in violation of a statutory arbitration duty was not the type of situation *252 to which the Norris-LaGuardia Act was responsive, that an important federal policy was involved in the peaceful settlement of disputes through the statutorily mandated arbitration procedure, that this important policy was imperiled if equitable remedies were not available to implement it, and hence that Norris-LaGuardia's policy of nonintervention by the federal courts should yield to the overriding interest in the successful implementation of the arbitration process.  The principles elaborated in Chicago River are equally applicable to the present case. To be sure, Chicago River involved arbitration procedures established by statute.  However, we have frequently noted, in such cases as <citedDecision>Lincoln Mills</citedDecision> , the Steelworkers Trilogy, and Lucas Flour, the importance that Congress has attached generally to the voluntary settlement of labor disputes without resort to self-help and more particularly to arbitration as a means to this end.  Indeed, it has been stated that <citedDecision>Lincoln Mills</citedDecision> , in its exposition of § 301 (a), "went a long way towards making arbitration the central institution in the administration of collective bargaining contracts." [21] The Sinclair decision, however, seriously undermined the effectiveness of the arbitration technique as a method peacefully to resolve industrial disputes without resort to strikes, lockouts, and similar devices.  Clearly employers will be wary of assuming obligations to arbitrate specifically enforceable against them when no similarly efficacious remedy is available to enforce the concomitant undertaking of the union to refrain from striking.  On the other hand, the central purpose of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to foster the growth and viability of labor organizations is hardly retardedif anything, this goal is advancedby a remedial device that merely enforces the obligation that the union freely undertook under *253 a specifically enforceable agreement to submit disputes to arbitration.  [22] We conclude, therefore, that the unavailability of equitable relief in the arbitration context presents a serious impediment to the congressional policy favoring the voluntary establishment of a mechanism for the peaceful resolution of labor disputes, that the core purpose of the Norris-LaGuardia Act is not sacrificed by the limited use of equitable remedies to further this important policy, and consequently that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not bar the granting of injunctive relief in the circumstances of the instant case. V Our holding in the present case is a narrow one.  We do not undermine the vitality of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  We deal only with the situation in which a collective-bargaining contract contains a mandatory grievance adjustment or arbitration procedure.

[10]  Shortly after Sinclair was decided, an erosive process began to weaken its underpinnings.  Various authorities suggested methods of mitigating the absolute rigor of the Sinclair rule.  For example, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that Sinclair does not prevent a federal district court from enforcing an arbitrator's order directing a union to terminate work stoppages in violation of a no-strike clause.  New Orleans Steamship Assn. v. General Longshore Workers, 389 F. 2d 369 , cert. denied, 393 U. S. 828 (1968); see Pacific Maritime Assn. v. International Longshoremen, 304 F. Supp. 1315 (D. C. N. D. Cal. 1969).  See generally Keene, The Supreme Court, Section 301 and No-Strike Clauses: From <citedDecision>Lincoln Mills</citedDecision> to Avco and Beyond, 15 Vill. L. Rev. 32 (1969).  [11]  Section 301 (a) suits require neither the existence of diversity of citizenship nor a minimum jurisdictional amount in controversy.  All § 301 (a) suits may be removed pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1441 .  [12]  The view that state court jurisdiction would not be disturbed by § 301 (a) was perhaps most clearly articulated by Senator Ferguson, a spokesman for that provision, in a Senate debate in 1946: "Mr. FERGUSON.  Mr. President, there is nothing whatever in the now-being-considered amendment which takes away from the State courts all the present rights of the State courts to adjudicate the rights between parties in relation to labor agreements.  The amendment merely says that the Federal courts shall have jurisdiction.  It does not attempt to take away the jurisdiction of the State courts, and the mere fact that the Senator and I disagree does not change the effect of the amendment.
