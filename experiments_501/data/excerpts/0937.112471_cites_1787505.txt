Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court. The question presented in this case is whether the application of a Texas statute, which was passed after respondent’s crime and which allowed the reformation of an improper jury verdict in respondent’s case, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. I, § 10.  We hold that it does not.  Respondent Carroll Youngblood was convicted in a Texas court of aggravated sexual abuse.  The jury imposed punishment of life imprisonment and a fine of $10,000.  After his conviction and sentence were affirmed by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, Youngblood applied for a writ of habeas corpus in the State District Court. He argued that the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure did not authorize a fine in addition to a term of imprisonment for his offense, and, thus, under the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeals in Bogany v. State, <citedDecision>661 S. W. 2d 957</citedDecision> (1983), the judgment and sentence were void, and he was entitled to a new trial. 1 In April 1985, the District Court, feeling bound by <citedDecision>Bogany</citedDecision> , recommended that the writ be granted.  Before the habeas application was considered by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, which has the exclusive power under Texas law to grant writs of habeas corpus, see Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 11.07 (Vernon 1977 and Supp. 1990), a new Texas statute designed to modify the <citedDecision>Bogany</citedDecision> *40 decision became effective.  Article 37.10(b), as of June 11, 1985, allows an appellate court to reform an improper verdict that assesses a punishment not authorized by law. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.10(b) (Vernon Supp. 1990); see Ex parte Johnson, 697 S. W. 2d 605 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985).  Relying on that statute, the Court of Criminal Appeals reformed the verdict in Youngblood’s case by ordering deletion of the $10,000 fine and denied his request for a new trial. Youngblood then sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, arguing that the retroactive application of Art. 37.10(b) violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. I, § 10, of the Federal Constitution.  The District Court concluded that since Youngblood’s “punishment .  .  .  was not increased (but actually decreased), and the elements of the offense or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt were not changed,” there was no ex post facto violation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C-6.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Youngblood v. Lynaugh, 882 F. 2d 956 (CA5 1989).  It relied on the statement in this Court’s decision in Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898), that retroactive procedural statutes violate the Ex Post Facto Clause unless they ‘“leave untouched all the substantial-protections with which existing law surrounds the person accused of crime,’” Lynaugh, supra, at 959 (quoting 170 U. S., at 352 ).  It held that Youngblood’s right to a new trial under the <citedDecision>Bogany</citedDecision> decision was such a “substantial protection,” and therefore ordered that a writ of habeas corpus be issued.  We granted certiorari.  493 U. S. 1001 (1989).  Because respondent is before us on collateral review, we are faced with a threshold question whether the relief sought by Youngblood would constitute a “new rule,” which would not apply retroactively under our decisions in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), and Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407 (1990).  Generally speaking, “[rjetroactivity is *41 properly treated as a threshold question, for, once a new rule is applied to the defendant in the case announcing the rule, evenhanded justice requires that it be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated.” Teague, supra, at 300 .  The State of Texas, however, did not address retroactivity in its petition for certiorari or its briefs on the merits, and when asked about the issue at oral argument, counsel answered that the State had chosen not to rely on Teague .  Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5.

 The Court held that since Utah was a Territory when Thompson’s crime was committed, and therefore obligated to provide a 12-person jury by the Sixth Amendment, the Ex Post Facto Clause prevented the State from taking away that substantial right from him when it became a State and was no longer bound by the Sixth Amendment as then interpreted.  The right to jury trial provided by the Sixth Amendment is obviously a “substantial” one, but it is not a right that has anything to do with the definition of crimes, defenses, or punishments, which is the concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  To the extent that Thompson v. Utah *52 rested on the Ex Post Facto Clause and not the Sixth Amendment, we overrule it.  4 The Texas statute allowing reformation of improper verdicts does not punish as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; nor make more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission; nor deprive one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed.  Its application to respondent therefore is not prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. I, § 10.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.  In <citedDecision>Bogany</citedDecision> , the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a jury verdict which included a punishment unauthorized by law was void at its inception and had to be set aside.  It concluded that Texas law at that time did not give appellate courts authority to reform such verdicts.  Although there has been some debate within the Court about the accuracy of the historical discussion in Calder v. Bull , see Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380, 381 (1829) (note by Johnson, J.), the Court has consistently adhered to the view expressed by Justices Chase, Paterson, and Iredell in Calder that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies only to penal statutes.  The Beazell definition omits the reference by Justice Chase in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798), to alterations in the “legal rules of evidence.” See also Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 590 (1884) (approving procedural changes “leaving untouched the nature of the crime and the amount or degree of proof essential to conviction”).  As cases subsequent to Calder make clear, this language was not intended to prohibit the application of new evidentiary rules in trials for crimes committed before the changes.  Thompson v. Missouri, 171 U. S. 380, 386-387 (1898) (rejecting e.r post facto challenge to retroactive application of statute making admissible handwritten documents as handwriting exemplars): Hopt, supra, at 588-590 (upholding retroactive application of statute making felons competent to testify).  The Court’s holding in Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898), that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury panel of 12 persons is also obsolete.

 The “Ex Post Facto” Clause of the Constitution 1 has been construed to embrace any law that deprives a person accused of crime of a “substantial protection” that the law afforded at the time of the alleged offense.  Thus, the Clause prohibits not only the retroactive creation of new criminal offenses and more harsh penalties, but also substantial changes in procedure that are designed to protect the defendant from a wrongful conviction.  The question in this case is whether a law that changed a postconviction remedy for an erroneous sentence — by conforming it to the law in effect at the time of the offense instead of affording the defendant a new trial on all issues — effected a “substantial” deprivation within the meaning of our cases. I agree with the Court’s conclu *53 sion that the new law did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, but I believe that conclusion is entirely consistent with our precedents.  I Respondent committed a crime that was punishable by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and was convicted on March 17, 1982.  Under Texas law, it was the jury’s task to impose sentence as well as to determine guilt or innocence.  By consequence of a faulty instruction, respondent was improperly sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of $10,000.  The following year, in Bogany v. State, <citedDecision>661 S. W. 2d 957</citedDecision> (1983), the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held in a somewhat similar case that the fine was not authorized by law, and that no reviewing court had authority to correct such an erroneous sentence.  Instead, the entire judgment was deemed “void” and the defendant was entitled to a new trial. 2 Understandably, the Texas Legislature recognized that corrective legislation was in order, for it is difficult to understand why an error in sentencing should necessitate a second trial on the issue of guilt or innocence.  *54 Theoretically, the legislature might have remedied the situation in either of two ways.  It might have authorized a punishment of both life imprisonment and a $10,000 fine for respondent’s offense or, alternatively, it might have authorized a court to correct the sentence by eliminating the fine.  The former option would plainly have violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because it would have increased respondent’s punishment beyond the penalty authorized at the time of his offense.  The second option, which the Texas Legislature adopted, is not subject to that defect; nor does it criminalize previously innocent conduct or make any change in the procedures used to convict or to sentence respondent.  It created a new remedy designed to conform respondent’s sentence to that authorized by law at the time of his offense.

 It does, however, become insubstantial by failing to do so. Whatever else may be said of the factors that determine whether a procedural protection affects substantial rights, it is difficult to imagine how a retroactive law could, when viewed from the standpoint of the date the offense was committed, implicate substantial rights of any defendant if the law does no more than expand the flexibility of postconviction processes available to the State with respect to a defendant *61 who is subject to a valid conviction and sentence.  Indeed, respondent has barely even attempted to articulate any justification for the Texas procedure that the legislature abolished.  The mere possibility of a capricious and unlikely windfall is not the sort of procedural protection that could reasonably be judged substantial from the perspective of the defendant at the time the offense was committed.  Accordingly, I concur in the Court’s judgment, but not in its opinion.  Art. I, § 10, of the Constitution provides in part: “No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.” At the time of respondent’s offense, it apparently was well established under Texas law that, as a general proposition, when a criminal jury rendered a verdict not authorized by law the verdict was void at its inception.  See, e. g., Ex parte McIver, 586 S. W. 2d 851, 854 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979); Ocker v. State, 477 S. W. 2d 288, 290 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972).  However, until the Court of Criminal Appeals decided <citedDecision>Bogany</citedDecision> , there was some doubt both as to whether that general rule would apply to the error in this case and as to whether the sentence imposed by the jury in this case was in fact unlawful.  See, e. g., Adams v. State, 642 S. W. 2d 211, 213-214 (Tex. App. 1982) (reforming jury’s sentence); Bogany v. State, 646 S. W. 2d 663, 664-665 (Tex. App.) (stating that jury’s sentence could be reformed), rev’d, <citedDecision>661 S. W. 2d 957</citedDecision> (Tex. Crim. App. 1983); <citedDecision>id., at 960</citedDecision> (McCormick, J., dissenting) (contending that supplementary fine was authorized by law).  For purposes of this opinion, I assume that both the substantive limitation upon respondent’s sentence and the procedural limitation on the remedial powers of reviewing courts were law at the time that respondent’s offense was committed.  The Missouri Supreme Court relied upon the reasoning of the St. Louis Court of Appeals.  See State v. Kring, 74 Mo. 612, 631 (1881).  The relevant passage from the Court of Appeals opinion was quoted (and then disavowed) by this Court in Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221, 223-224 (1883): ‘“Formerly it was held in Missouri (State v. Ross, 29 Mo. 32 ) that, when a conviction is had of murder in the second degree on an indictment charging murder in the first degree, if this be set aside, the defendant cannot again be tried for murder in the first degree.  A change introduced by sect. 23 of art. 2 of the Constitution of 1875 has abrogated this rule.  On the oral argument something was said by counsel for the defendant to the effect that under the old rule defendant could not be put on his trial for murder in the first degree, and that he could not be affected by the change of the constitutional provision, the crime having been committed whilst the old constitution was in force.
