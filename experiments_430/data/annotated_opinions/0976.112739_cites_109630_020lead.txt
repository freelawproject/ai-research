 5 Bellas Hess was decided in 1967, in the middle of this latest rally between formalism and pragmatism.  Contrary to the suggestion of the North Dakota Supreme Court, this timing does not mean that Complete Auto rendered Bellas Hess “obsolete.” Complete Auto rejected Freeman and Spector’s formal distinction between “direct” and “indirect” taxes on interstate commerce because that formalism allowed the validity of statutes to hinge on “legal terminology,” “draftsmanship and phraseology.” 430 U. S., at 281 .  Bellas Hess *311 did not rely on any such labeling of taxes and therefore did not automatically fall with Freeman and its progeny.  While contemporary Commerce Clause jurisprudence might not dictate the same result were the issue to arise for the first time today, Bellas Hess is not inconsistent with Complete Auto and our recent cases. Under Complete Auto’s four-part test, we will sustain a tax against a Commerce Clause challenge so long as the “tax [1] is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, [2] is fairly apportioned, [3] does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and [4] is fairly related to the services provided by the State.” 430 U. S., at 279 .  Bellas Hess concerns the first of these tests and stands for the proposition that a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail or common carrier lacks the “substantial nexus” required by the Commerce Clause.  Thus, three weeks after Complete Auto was handed down, we cited Bellas Hess for this proposition and discussed the case at some length.  In National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 551, 559</citedDecision> (1977), we affirmed the continuing vitality of Bellas Hess’ “sharp distinction .  .  .  between mail-order sellers with [a physical presence in the taxing] State and those ... who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business.” We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval ever since.  For example, in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 263 (1989), we expressed “doubt that termination of an interstate telephone call, by itself, provides a substantial enough nexus for a State to tax a call. See National Bellas Hess .  .  .  (receipt of mail provides insufficient nexus).” See also D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988); Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S., at 437 ; National Geographic Society, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 559</citedDecision> .  For these reasons, we disagree with the State Supreme Court’s conclu *312 sion that our decision in Complete Auto undercut the Bellas Hess rule.  The State of North Dakota relies less on Complete Auto and more on the evolution of our due process jurisprudence.  The State contends that the nexus requirements imposed by the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are equivalent and that if, as we concluded above, a mail-order house that lacks a physical presence in the taxing State nonetheless satisfies the due process “minimum contacts” test, then that corporation also meets the Commerce Clause “substantial nexus” test.  We disagree.  Despite the similarity in phrasing, the nexus requirements of the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are not identical.  The two standards are animated by different constitutional concerns and policies.

 Complete Auto, it is true, renounced Freeman and its progeny as “formalistic.” But not all formalism is alike.  Spector’s formal distinction between taxes on the “privilege of doing business” and all other taxes served no purpose within our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, but stood “only as a trap for the unwary draftsman.” Complete Auto, 430 U. S., at 279 .  In contrast, the bright-line rule of Bellas Hess furthers the ends of the dormant Commerce Clause.  Undue *315 burdens on interstate commerce may be avoided not only by a case-by-case evaluation of the actual burdens imposed by particular regulations or taxes, but also, in some situations, by the demarcation of a discrete realm of commercial activity that is free from interstate taxation.  Bellas Hess followed the latter approach and created a safe harbor for vendors “whose only connection with customers in the [taxing] State is by common carrier or the United States mail.” Under Bellas Hess, such vendors are free from state-imposed duties to collect sales and use taxes.  8 Like other bright-line tests, the Bellas Hess rule appears artificial at its edges: Whether or not a State may compel a vendor to collect a sales or use tax may turn on the presence in the taxing State of a small sales force, plant, or office.  Cf. National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1977); Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S. 207 (1960).  This artificiality, however, is more than offset by the benefits of a clear rule.  Such a rule firmly establishes the boundaries of legitimate state authority to impose a duty to collect sales and use taxes and reduces litigation concerning those taxes.  This benefit is important, for as we have so frequently noted, our law in this area is something of a “quagmire” and the “application of constitutional principles to specific state statutes leaves much room for controversy and confusion and little in the way of precise guides to the States in the exercise of their indispensable power of *316 taxation.” Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 457-458 (1959).  Moreover, a bright-line rule in the area of sales and use taxes also encourages settled expectations and, in doing so, fosters investment by businesses and individuals.  9 Indeed, it is not unlikely that the mail-order industry’s dramatic growth over the last quarter century is due in part to the bright-line exemption from state taxation created in Bellas Hess.  Notwithstanding the benefits of bright-line tests, we have, in some situations, decided to replace such tests with more contextual balancing inquiries.
