 The real problem is whether a principle shall prevail over its later misapplications.  Surely we are not bound by reason or by the considerations that underlie stare decisis to persevere in distinctions taken in the application of a statute which, on further examination, appear consonant neither with the purposes of the statute nor with this Court’s own conception of it.  We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine — untenable because they drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept and to which we adhere.  In Nos. 110, 111, 112 and 183, the judgments are Reversed.  In No. 399, the judgment is Affirmed., c. 27, 44 Stat. 9 , as amended by § 803 of the Revenue Act of 1932, c. 209, 47 Stat. 169 , 279: “The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated— “(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, or of which he has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, under which he has retained 'for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death (1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, the property, or (2) the right, either alone or in conjunction with any person, to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom; except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth.  Any transfer- of a material part of his property in' the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to his death without such consideration, shall, unless shown to the con--' trary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title.” Petitioner’s Brief, Klein v. United States, pp. 11-13 Some indication of the influence of Klein v. United States upon the lower courts may be found in Sargent v. White, 50 F. 2d 410 and Union Trust Co. v. United States, 54 F. 2d 152 , cert. denied, 286 U. S. 547 .  Cf. Commissioner v. Schwarz, <citedDecision>74 F. 2d 712</citedDecision> .  See, for example, the attempts by the Board of Tax Appeals to deal with the peculiarities of New York law in the field of vested and contingent remainders.  Elizabeth B. Wallace, 27 B. T. A. 902; Louis C. Raegner, Jr., 29 B. T. A. 1243.  In both of these cases limitations which would probably have been “contingent” at “common law” were held to be “vested” under the New York statutory rule.  Cf. Commissioner v. Schwarz, <citedDecision>74 F. 2d 712</citedDecision> ; Flora M. Bonney, 29 B. T. A. 45.  Cf. Lyeth v. Hoey, 305 U. S. 188, 194 .  See Paul, The Effect on Federal Taxation of Local Rules of Property in Selected Studies in Federal Taxation (2nd Series), pp. 23-28; Developments in the Law—Taxation, 47 Harv. L. Rev. 1209 , 1238-41; Note, 49 Harv. L. Rev. 462 .  See, for example, Fearne, Contingent Remainders, (4th Am. Ed.), pp. 3-241; Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities (2nd Ed.), pp. 99-118; VII Holdsworth, History of English Law, 81 et seq.; 1 Simes, Future Interests, §§ 64-96.  The confusion apt to be engendered by judicial forays into this field is well illustrated by the use of the term “possibility of reverter” by the majority in Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co. “A possibility of reverter” is traditionally defined as the interest remaining in a grantor who has conveyed a' determinable fee.  The definition has not been thought to have any relation to the reversionary* interest of a grantor who has transferred either a vested or contingent remainder in fee.  See Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities (2nd Ed.), §§ 13-51.
