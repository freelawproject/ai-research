**Combined Opinion**
Such judgment as yet is largely a prophecy based on meager and uninterpreted experience. How empiric the process is of adjusting remedy to policy, is shown by the history of anti-trust laws in Texas and elsewhere. The Sherman Law originally employed the injunction at the suit of the government, private action for triple damages, criminal prosecution and forfeiture. Later the injunction was made available to private suitors. [5] In the case of combinations of common carriers the Sherman Law is qualified by the Interstate Commerce Act, Keogh v. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co., <targetCase>260 U.S. 156</targetCase> , and, in the case of shipping combinations, by the Merchant Marine Act, U.S. Navigation Co. v. Cunard S.S. Co., 284 U.S. 474 . In its own groping efforts to deal with the problem of monopoly, the Texas legislature has in the course of nearly half a century invoked a dozen remedies. [6] When Iowa superimposed upon its general anti-trust law an additional penalty in the case of fire insurance combinations, this Court sustained *149 the validity of the statute. Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance Co., 199 U.S. 401 . Legislation concerning economic combinations presents peculiar difficulties in the fashioning of remedies. The sensitiveness of the economic mechanism, the risks of introducing new evils in trying to stamp out old, familiar ones, the difficulties of proof within the conventional modes of procedure, the effect of shifting tides of public opinion Â— these and many other subtle factors must influence legislative choice. Moreover, the whole problem of deterrence is related to still wider considerations affecting the temper of the community in which law operates.
