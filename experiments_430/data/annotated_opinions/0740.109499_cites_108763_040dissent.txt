 See, e. g., Mulford v. Smith, supra, at 51 (Butler, J., dissenting); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, at 76 (McReynolds, J., dissenting) .  9 *869 That no precedent justifies today's result is particularly clear from the awkward extension of the doctrine of state immunity from federal taxation — an immunity conclusively distinguished by Mr. Justice Stone in California , and an immunity that is “narrowly limited” because “the people of all the states have created the national government and are represented in Congress,” Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 416 (1938) (Stone, J.) 10 — to fashion a judicially enforceable restraint on *870 Congress’ exercise of the commerce power that the Court has time and again rejected as having no place in our constitutional jurisprudence.  11 “[W]here [Congress] *871 keeps within its sphere and violates no express constitutional limitation it has been the rule of this Court, going back almost to the founding days of the Republic, not to interfere.” Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S., at 305 .  To argue, as do my Brethren, that the 1974 amendments are directed at the “States qua States,” and “dis-plací] state policies regarding the manner in which they will structure delivery of those governmental services which their citizens require,” ante, at 847, and therefore “directly penaliz[e] the States for choosing to hire governmental employees on terms different from those which Congress has sought to impose,” ante, at 849, is only to advance precisely the unsuccessful arguments made by the State of Washington in Case v. Bowles and the State of California in United States v. California .  The 1974 amendments are, however, an entirely legitimate exercise of the commerce power, not in the slightest restrained by any doctrine of state sovereignty cognizable in this Court, as Case v. Bowles, United States v. California, Maryland v. Wirtz , and our other pertinent precedents squarely and definitively establish.  Moreover, since Maryland v. Wirtz is overruled, the Fair Labor Standards Act is invalidated in its application to all state employees “in [any areas] that the States have regarded as integral parts of their governmental activities.” Ante, at 854 n. 18.  This standard is a meaningless limitation on the Court’s state-sovereignty doctrine, and thus today’s holding goes beyond even what the States of Washington and California urged in Case v. Bowles and United States v. California , and by its logic would overrule those cases and with them Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and certain reasoning in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., <citedDecision>411 U. S. 279, 284-285</citedDecision> (1973).  I cannot recall another instance in the Court’s history when the reasoning of so many decisions covering so long a span of time has been *872 discarded in such a roughshod manner.  That this is done without any justification not already often advanced and consistently rejected, clearly renders today’s decision an ipse dixit reflecting nothing but displeasure with a congressional judgment.  My Brethren’s treatment of Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), further illustrates the paucity of legal reasoning or principle j ustifying today’s result.  Although the Economic Stabilization Act “displace[d] the States’ freedom,” ante, at 852 — the reason given for invalidating the 1974 amendments — the result in Fry is not disturbed since the interference was temporary and only a national program enforced by the Federal Government could have alleviated the country’s economic crisis.  Thus, although my Brethren by fiat strike down the 1974 amendments without analysis of countervailing national considerations, Fry by contrary logic remains undisturbed because, on balance, countervailing national considerations override the interference with the State’s freedom.  Moreover, it is sophistry to say the Economic Stabilization Act “displaced no state choices,” ante, at 853, but that the 1974 amendments do, ante, at 848.

 Our historic decisions rejecting all suggestions that the States stand in a different position from affected private parties when challenging congressional exercise of the commerce power reflect that very concern.  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936).  Fry only last Term emphasized “that States are not immune from all federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status.” 421 U. S., at 548 (emphasis added).  For “[b]y empowering Congress to regulate commerce .  .  .  the States necessarily surrendered any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regulation.” Farden v. Terminal R. Co., supra, at 192; see <citedDecision>Employees</citedDecision> v. Missouri Public Health Dept., supra, at 286.  Employment relations of States that subject themselves to congressional regulation by participating in regulable commerce are subject to congressional regulation.  California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553, 568 (1957).  Plainly it has gotten no earlier since we declared it “too late in the day to question the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause to regulate .  .  .  activities and instrumentalities [in interstate commerce] .

 Office of Management and Budget, Special Analyses: Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1977, p. 255.  Appellants complain of the impact of the amended FLSA on police and fire departments, but the 1977 budget contemplates outlays for law enforcement assistance of $716 million.  Id., at 258.  Concern is also expressed about the diminished ability to hire students in the summer if States must pay them a minimum wage, but the Federal Government’s “summer youth program” provides $400 million for 670,000 jobs.  Ibid. Given this demonstrated ability to obtain funds from the Federal Government for needed state services, there is little doubt that the States’ influence in the political process is adequate to safeguard their sovereignty.  14 *879 My Brethren’s disregard for precedents recognizing these long-settled constitutional principles is painfully obvious in their cavalier treatment of Maryland v. Wirtz .  Without even a passing reference to the doctrine of stare decisis, Wirtz — regarded as controlling only last Term, Fry v. United States, 421 U. S., at 548 , and as good law in <citedDecision>Employees</citedDecision> v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S., at 283—is by exercise of raw judicial power overruled.  No effort is made to distinguish the FLSA amendments sustained in Wirtz from the 1974 amendments.  We are told at the outset that “the 'far-reaching implications’ of Wirtz should be overruled,” ante, at 840; later it is said that the “reasoning in Wirtz” is no longer “authoritative,” ante, at 854.  My Brethren then merely restate their essential-function test and say that Wirtz must “therefore” be overruled.  Ante, at 855-856.  There is no analysis whether Wirtz reached the correct result, apart from any flaws in reasoning, even though we are told that “there are obvious differences” between this case and Wirtz.  Ante, at 855.

 The best I can make of it is that the 1966 FLSA amendments are struck down and Wirtz is overruled on the basis of the conceptually unworkable essential-function test; and that the test is unworkable is demonstrated by my Brethren’s inability to articulate any meaningful distinctions among state-operated railroads, see ante, at 854-855, n. 18, state-operated schools and hospitals, and state-operated police and fire departments.  We are left then with a catastrophic judicial body blow at Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.  Even if Congress may nevertheless accomplish its objectives— for example, by conditioning grants of federal funds upon compliance with federal minimum wage and overtime standards, cf. Oklahoma v. CSC, 330 U. S. 127, 144 (1947)—there is an ominous portent of disruption of our constitutional structure implicit in today’s mischievous decision.  I dissent.  “A government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care, and to the complete execution of the trusts for which it is responsible; free from every other control, but a regard to the public good and to the sense of the people.” The Federalist No. 31, p. 195 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  Some decisions reflect the Court’s reluctance to interpret legislation to alter the federal-state balance of power.  See, e. g., Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., <citedDecision>411 U. S. 279, 285-287</citedDecision> (1973); United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971).  Rather than state any limit on congressional power, however, these decisions merely rely on our traditional canon of construction in the face of statutory ambiguity that recognizes a presumption that Congress normally considers effects on federalism before taking action displacing state authority.  Stern, The Commerce Clause and the National Economy, 1933-1946, Part Two, 59 Harv. L. Rev. 883 , 946 (1946).  There is no claim that the 1974 amendments are not clearly intended to apply to the States, nor is there any suggestion that Congress was unaware of the federalism issue.  As support for the creation of a state sovereignty limitation on the commerce power, my Brethren quote this statement in Wirtz out of context.  Ante, at 842.  This statement is at the end of a paragraph in Wirtz recognizing that Congress’ commerce power is limited because it reaches only “ ‘commerce with foreign nations and among the several States.’ ” 392 U. S., at 196 , quoting Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S., at 466 .

 Although the Eleventh Amendment can be overcome by exercise of the power to regulate commerce, my Brethren never explain why the protections of state sovereignty they erroneously find embodied in the Tenth Amendment cannot similarly be overcome.  Instead, they merely tell us which delegated powers are limited by state sovereignty, ante, at 843-844, n. 14, and which are not, ante, at 854-855, n. 18, see also Kleppe v. New Mexico, ante, p. 529, but neither reason nor precedent distinguishing among these powers is provided.  My Brethren’s reluctance to rely on the cost of compliance to invalidate this legislation is advisable.  “Such matters raise not constitutional issues but questions of policy.  They relate to the wisdom, need, and effectiveness of a particular project.  They are therefore questions for the Congress, not the courts.” Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Atkinson Co., 313 U. S., at 527 .  See Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., <citedDecision>411 U. S. 279 284</citedDecision> (1973).  Although my Brethren accept for present purposes the well-pleaded allegations of appellants’ complaint, I note that the Secretary vigorously argues in this Court that appellants’ cost allegations are greatly exaggerated and based on misinterpretations of the 1974 amendments.  For example, the executive vice president of the National League of Cities stated in a deposition that the federal minimum wage would have little impact on city budgets since “most cities were already in compliance.” App. 124.  My Brethren’s concern about the use of volunteers is also unfounded.  No provision proscribes the use of volunteers or regulates their compensation in any way.  Indeed, the Department of Labor’s regulations read the FLSA as providing that payments to individuals below a certain level are presumptive evidence of volunteer status; above that level volunteer status depends on particular circumstances.  29 CFR § 553.11 (1975).
