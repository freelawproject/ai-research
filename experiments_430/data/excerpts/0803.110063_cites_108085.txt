 But rather let us say it is constituted of the welfare of all of the States and that of each State is made the greater by a division of its resources, natural and created, with every other State, and those of every other State with it.  This was the purpose, as it is the result, of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.  If there is to be a turning backward it must be done by the authority of another instrumentality than a court.” 221 U. S., at 255-256 .  The Court distinguished discriminatory or prohibatory regulations offensive to the Commerce Clause, such as the Oklahoma statute, from a valid "exercise of the police power to regulate the taking of natural gas” that was "universal in its application and justified by the nature of the gas and which allowed its transportation to other states.” Id., at 257 ; see id., at 252-254 (distinguishing Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana, 177 U. S. 190 (1900)).  In subsequent Commerce Clause challenges to state regulation of exports of natural resources, the West analysis emerged as the dominant approach.  See, e. g., Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 598-600 (1923); 9 H. P. Hood & Sons, *331 Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525 (1949).  Today’s principle is that stated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., <citedDecision>397 U. S. 137, 142</citedDecision> (1970): “Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.  ... If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree.  And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.” (Citations omitted.) This formulation was employed only last Term to strike down New Jersey’s attempt to “conserve” the natural resource of landfill areas within the State for the disposal of waste generated within the State.  Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978).  The Geer analysis has also been eroded to the point of virtual extinction in cases involving regulation of wild animals.  The first challenge to Geer’s, theory of a State’s power over wild animals came in Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920).

 15 C The case before us is the first in modern times to present facts essentially on all fours with Geer .  16 We now conclude that challenges under the Commerce Clause to state regulations of wild animals should be considered according to the same general rule applied to state regulations of other natural resources, and therefore expressly overrule Geer .  We thus bring our analytical framework into conformity with practical realities.  Overruling Geer also eliminates the anomaly, created by the decisions distinguishing Geer , that statutes imposing the most extreme burdens on interstate commerce (essentially total embargoes) were the most immune from challenge.  At the same time, the general rule we adopt in this case makes ample allowance for preserving, in ways not *336 inconsistent with the Commerce Clause, the legitimate state concerns for conservation and protection of wild animals underlying the 19th-century legal fiction of state ownership.  II We turn then to the question whether the burden imposed on interstate commerce in wild game by § 4-115 (B) is permissible under the general rule articulated in our precedents governing other types of commerce.  See, e. g., Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., <citedDecision>397 U. S., at 142</citedDecision> , quoted, supra, at 331.  Under that general rule, we must inquire (1) whether the challenged statute regulates evenhandedly with only “incidental” effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce either on its face or in practical effect; (2) whether the statute serves a legitimate local purpose; and, if so, (3) whether alternative means could promote this local purpose as well without discriminating against interstate commerce.  The burden to show discrimination rests on the party challenging the validity of the statute, but “[w]hen discrimination against commerce ... is demonstrated, the burden falls on the State to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve, the local interests at stake.” Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333, 353 (1977).  Furthermore, when considering the purpose of a challenged statute, this Court is not bound by “[t]he name, description or characterization given it by the legislature or the courts of the State,” but will determine for itself the practical impact of the law. Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545, 550 (1924); see Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S., at 10 ; <citedDecision>Pike</citedDecision> v. Bruce Church, Inc., supra. Section 4-115 (B.) on its face discriminates against interstate commerce.  It forbids the transportation of natural min *337 nows out of the State for purposes of sale, and thus “overtly blocks the flow of interstate commerce at [the] State’s borders.” Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 624 .  Such facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect, regardless of the State’s purpose, because “the evil of protectionism can reside in legislative means as well as legislative ends.” Id., at 626 .  17 At a minimum such facial discrimination invokes the strictest scrutiny of any purported legitimate local purpose and of the absence of nondiscriminatory alternatives.  Oklahoma argues that § A-115 (B) serves a legitimate local purpose in that it is “readily apparent as a conservation measure.” Brief for Appellee 8.  The State’s interest in maintaining the ecological balance in state waters by avoiding the removal of inordinate numbers of minnows may well qualify as a legitimate local purpose.  We consider the States’ interests in conservation and protection of wild animals as legitimate local purposes similar to the States’ interests in protecting the health and safety of their citizens.

 Section 4r-115 (B) is part of the Oklahoma Wildlife Conservation Code. Another provision of that Code requires that persons have a minnow dealer’s license before they can lawfully seine or trap minnows within the State — except for their own use as bait — §4^11(5 (Supp. 1978), but no limit is imposed on the number of minnows a licensed dealer may take from state waters.  Nor is there any regulation except § 4r-115 (B) concerning the disposition of lawfully acquired minnows; they may be sold within Oklahoma to any person and for any purpose, and may be taken out of the State for any purpose except sale.  “The Commerce Clause is one of the most prolific sources of national power and an equally prolific source of conflict with legislation of the state.  While the Constitution vests in Congress the power to regulate commerce among the states, it does not say what the states may or may not do in the absence of congressional action, nor how to draw the line between what is and what is not commerce among the states.  Perhaps even more than by interpretation of its written word, this Court has advanced the solidarity and prosperity of this Nation by the meaning it has given to these great silences of the Constitution.” H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S., at 534-535 .  Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 621-623 (1978), made clear that there is no “two-tiered definition of commerce.” The definition of “commerce” is the same when relied on to strike down or restrict state legislation as when relied on to support some exertion of federal control or regulation.  See, e. g., Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 209 (1824); Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245 (1829); Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1852); Port Richmond & Bergen Point Perry Co. v. Board of Chosen Freeholders, 234 U. S. 317 (1914); Di Santo v. Pennsylvania, 273 U. S. 34 (1927); Parker v.

S. 137</citedDecision> (1970).  See generally, F. Frankfurter, The Commerce Clause Under Marshall, Taney and Waite (1937); Dowling, Interstate Commerce and State Power, 27 Va. L. Rev. 1 (1940); Dowling, Interstate Commerce and State Power — Revised Version, 47 Colum. L. Rev. 547 (1947).  “[T] he sole issue which the case presents is, was it lawful under the Constitution of the United States (section 8, Article I) for the State of Connecticut to allow the killing of birds within the State during a designated open season, to allow such birds, when so killed, to be used, to be sold and to be bought for use within the State, and yet to forbid their transportation beyond the State?  Or, to state it otherwise, had the State of Connecticut the power to regulate the killing of game within her borders so as to confine its use to the limits of the State and forbid its transmission outside of the State?” 161 U. S., at 522 .  Id., at 522-529 .  The Court has recognized that Geer’s analysis of the authorities on this issue is open to question.  Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385 , 402 n. 37 (1948).
**Dissenting Opinion**
 This is not a case where a State’s regulation permits residents to export naturally seined minnows but prohibits nonresidents from so doing.  No person is allowed to export natural minnows for sale outside of Oklahoma; the statute is evenhanded in its application.  See Okla. Stat., Tit. 29, § 4r-115 (B) (Supp. 1978).  The State has not used its power to protect its own citizens from outside competition.  See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333 (1977); H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525 (1949).  Nor is this a *345 case where a State requires a nonresident business, as a condition to exporting minnows, to move a significant portion of its operations to the State or to use certain state resources in pursuit of its business for the benefit of the local economy.  See Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385 (1948); Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928); Johnson v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 16 (1928); cf. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., <citedDecision>397 U. S. 137, 145</citedDecision> (1970).  And, notwithstanding the Court’s protestations to the contrary, Oklahoma has not blocked the flow of interstate commerce in minnows at the State’s borders.  See ante, at 336-337.  Appellant, or anyone else, may freely export as many minnows as he wishes, so long as the minnows so transported are hatchery minnows and not naturally seined minnows.  On this record, I simply fail to see how interstate commerce in minnows, the commodity at issue here, is impeded in the least by Oklahoma’s regulatory scheme.  9 Oklahoma does regulate the manner in which both residents and nonresidents procure minnows to be sold outside the State.  But there is no showing in this record that requiring appellant to purchase his minnows from hatcheries instead of from persons licensed to seine minnows from the State’s waters in any way increases appellant’s costs of doing business.

 Indeed, the source of the police power as to game birds (like those covered by the statute here called into question) flows from the duty of the State to preserve for its people a valuable food supply.” Id., at 534.  See also New York ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg, 211 U. S. 31, 41-42 (1908); *341 Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 563 , 601 (1923) (Holmes, J., dissenting).  Certain of the statements in the Court’s opinion provide a basis for some hope that these principles may yet survive the overruling of Geer .  See ante, at 337: “We consider the States’ interests in conservation and protection of wild animals as legitimate local purposes”; ante, at 338: “The overruling of Geer does not leave the States powerless to protect and conserve wild animal life within their borders.” The Geer Court itself did not use the term “ownership” in any proprietary sense.  See 161 U. S., at 529 : “ 'We take it to be the correct doctrine in this country, that the ownership of wild animals, so far as they are capable of ownership, is in the State, not as a proprietor but in its sovereign capacity as the representative and for the benefit of all its people in common.’ ” Geer recognized limits to the exercise of the State’s power to preserve wildlife within its boundaries.  See id., at 528 (this power, which the Colonies possessed, remains in the States “at the present day, in so far as its exercise may be not incompatible with, or restrained by, the rights conveyed to the Federal government by the Constitution”).  This view is fully consistent with the balancing approach to Commerce Clause decisionmaking enunciated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., <citedDecision>397 U. S. 137</citedDecision> (1970), relied on so heavily by the Court. Ante, at 336.  In <citedDecision>Pike</citedDecision> , the Court stated: “Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.  ... If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree.  And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.” <citedDecision>397 U. S., at 142</citedDecision> .  Given the primacy of the local interest here, in the absence of conflicting federal regulation I would require one challenging a state conservation law on Commerce Clause grounds to establish a far greater burden on interstate commerce than is shown in this case. See infra, at 344-345.  See also Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333, 350 (1977): “[O]ur opinions have long recognized that, 'in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, there is a residuum of power in the state to make laws governing matteis of local concern which nevertheless in some measure affect interstate commerce or even, to some extent, regulate it’ H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 567 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting): “Behind the distinction between 'substantial’ and ‘incidental’ burdens upon interstate commerce is a recognition that, in the absence of federal regulation, it is sometimes — of course not always — of greater importance that local interests be protected than that interstate commerce be not touched.” The Court seems to doubt the conservation purpose of the Oklahoma law because the State places no limit on the number of minnows a licensed dealer may take from state waters and imposes no regulation governing the disposition of minnows within the State.  Ante, at 337-338, and n. 20.  But the State could rationally have concluded that it could adequately preserve its natural minnow population without such additional measures.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 18, 20, 21-23.  Since, in my view, the prohibition on export of naturally seined minnows imposes little, if any, burden on the interstate commerce in minnows, the State has not violated the Commerce Clause by choosing an export ban on natural minnows as the means to effectuate its special interest in conserving wildlife located within its territorial limits.
