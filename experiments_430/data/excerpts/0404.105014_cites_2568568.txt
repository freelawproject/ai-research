**Lead Opinion**
 On February 16, 1951, the Regents, after viewing “The Miracle,” determined that it was “sacrilegious” and for that reason ordered the Commissioner of Education to rescind appellant’s license to exhibit the picture.  The Commissioner did so. Appellant brought the present action in the New York courts to review the determination of the Regents.  6 Among the claims advanced by appellant were (1) that the statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment as a prior restraint upon freedom of speech and of the press; (2) that it is invalid under the same Amendment as a violation of the guaranty of separate church and state and as a prohibition of the free exercise of religion; and, (3) that the term “sacrilegious” is so vague and indefinite as to offend due process.  The Appellate Division rejected all of appellant’s contentions and upheld the Regents’ determination.  278 App. Div. 253 , 104 N. Y. S. 2d 740.  On appeal the New York Court of Appeals, two judges dissenting, affirmed the order of the Appellate Division.  <citedDecision>303 N. Y. 242</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>101 N. E. 2d 665</citedDecision> .  The case is here on appeal.  28 U. S. C. § 1257 (2).  As we view the case, we need consider only appellant’s contention that the New York statute is an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech and a free press.  In Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm’n, 236 U. S. 230 (1915), a distributor of motion pictures sought to enjoin the enforcement of an Ohio statute which required the prior approval of a board of censors before any motion *500 picture could be publicly exhibited in the state, and which directed the board to approve only such films as it adjudged to be “of a moral, educational or amusing and harmless character.” The statute was assailed in part as an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court rejected this contention, stating that the first eight Amendments were not a restriction on state action.  215 F. 138, 141 (D. C. N. D. Ohio 1914).
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Reed, concurring in the judgment of the Court. Assuming that a state may establish a system for the licensing of motion pictures, an issue not foreclosed by the Court’s opinion, our duty requires us to examine the facts of the refusal of a license in each case to determine *507 whether the principles of the First Amendment have been honored.- This film does not seem to me to be of a character that the First Amendment permits a state to exclude from public view.

**Combined Opinion**
On review the Appellate Division upheld the Board of Regents, holding that the banning of any motion picture "that may fairly be deemed sacrilegious to the adherents of any religious group .  .  .  is directly related to public peace and order" and is not a denial of religious freedom, and that there was "substantial evidence upon which the Regents could act." 278 App. Div. 253, 257, 258, 260 , 104 N. Y. S. 2d 740, 743, 744-745, 747.  The New York Court of Appeals, with one judge concurring in a separate opinion and two others dissenting, *517 affirmed the order of the Appellate Division.  <citedDecision>303 N. Y. 242</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>101 N. E. 2d 665</citedDecision> .  After concluding that the Board of Regents acted within its authority and that its determination was not "one that no reasonable mind could reach," <citedDecision>id., at 250-255, 256-257</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>101 N. E. 2d 665, 667-671</citedDecision> , the majority held, first, that "sacrilegious" was an adequately definite standard, quoting a definition from Funk & Wagnalls' Dictionary and referring to opinions in this Court that in passing used the term "profane," which the New York court said was a synonym of "sacrilegious"; second, that the State's assurance "that no religion.  .  .  shall be treated with contempt, mockery, scorn and ridicule .  .  .  by those engaged in selling entertainment by way of motion pictures" does not violate the religious guarantee of the First Amendment; and third, that motion pictures are not entitled to the immunities from regulation enjoyed by the press, in view of the decision in Mutual Film Corp. v. Ohio Industrial Comm'n, 236 U. S. 230 .  Id., at 255-256, 258-260, 260-262 , 101 N. E. 2d 670 -674.  The two dissenting judges, after dealing with a matter of local law not reviewable here, found that the standard "sacrilegious" is unconstitutionally vague, and, finally, that the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech applied equally to motion pictures and prevented this censorship.  <citedDecision>303 N. Y. 242, 264</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>101 N. E. 2d 665, 675</citedDecision> .  Both State courts, as did this Court, viewed "The Miracle." Arguments by the parties and in briefs amici invite us to pursue to their farthest reach the problems in which this case is involved.  Positions are advanced so absolute and abstract that in any event they could not properly determine this controversy.  See Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority, 297 U. S. 288, 341, 346-348 .  We are asked to decide this case by choosing between two mutually exclusive alternatives: that motion pictures may be subjected to unrestricted censorship, or that they *518 must be allowed to be shown under any circumstances.  But only the tyranny of absolutes would rely on such alternatives to meet the problems generated by the need to accommodate the diverse interests affected by the motion pictures in compact modern communities.
