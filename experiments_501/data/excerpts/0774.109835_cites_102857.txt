Mr. Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court. For the second time in this century, the State of Washington would apply its business and occupation tax to stevedoring.  The State’s first application of the tax to stevedoring was unsuccessful, for it was held to be unconstitutional as violative of the Commerce Clause 1 of the United States Constitution.  Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n, <citedDecision>302 U. S. 90</citedDecision> (1937).  The Court now faces the question whether Washington’s second attempt violates either the Commerce Clause or the Import-Export Clause.  2 *737 I Stevedoring is the business of loading and unloading cargo from ships.  3 Private stevedoring companies constitute respondent Association of Washington Stevedoring Companies; respondent Washington Public Ports Association is a nonprofit corporation consisting of port authorities that engage in stevedoring activities.  App. 3.  In 1974 petitioner Department of Revenue of the State of Washington adopted Revised Rule 193, pt. D, Wash. Admin. Code 458-20-193-D, to implement the State’s 1% business and occupation tax on *738 services, set forth in Wash. Rev. Code §§82.04.220 and 82.04.290 (1976) 4 The Rule applies the tax to stevedoring and reads in pertinent part as set forth in the margin.  5 Revised Rule 193D restores the original scope of the Washington business and occupation tax. After initial imposition *739 of the tax in 1935, 6 the then State Tax Commission 7 adopted Rule 198 of the Rules and Regulations Relating to the Revenue Act of 1935.

 Hence, we find it unnecessary to discuss the aforementioned cases beyond the fact that nowhere in them do we find language criticizing, expressly contradicting, or overruling (even impliedly) the stevedoring cases. “Fully mindful of our prior criticism of the principles and reasoning of the stevedore cases (see Washington-Oregon Shippers Cooperative Ass’n v. Schumacher, 59 Wn. 2d 159 , 167, 367 P. 2d 112 , 115-116 (1961)), we must nevertheless hold the instant tax on stevedoring invalid.” 88 Wash. 2d, at 318-320 , 559 P. 2d, at 998-999 .  The two dissenting justices would have upheld the tax against the Commerce Clause attack on the ground that recent cases had eroded the direct-indirect taxation analysis employed in the Stevedoring Cases. They found no violation of the Import-Export Clause because the State had taxed only the activity of stevedoring, not the imports or exports themselves.  Even if stevedoring were considered part of interstate or foreign commerce, the Washington tax was valid because it did not discriminate against importing or exporting, did not impair transportation, did not impose multiple burdens, and did not *743 regulate commerce.  88 Wash. 2d, at 320-322 , 559 P. 2d, at 999-1000 .  Because of the possible impact on the issues made by our intervening decision in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), filed after the Washington Supreme Court’s ruling, we granted certiorari.  434 U. S. 815 (1977).  II The Commerce Clause A In Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. <citedDecision>State Tax Comm’n</citedDecision> , the Court invalidated the Washington business and occupation tax on stevedoring only because it applied directly to interstate commerce.  Stevedoring was interstate commerce, according to the Court, because: “Transportation of a cargo by water is impossible or futile unless the thing to be transported is put Aboard the ship and taken off at destination.  A stevedore who in person or by servants does work so indispensable is as much an agency of commerce as shipowner or master.” <citedDecision>302 U. S., at 92</citedDecision> .  Without further analysis, the Court concluded: “The business of loading and unloading being interstate or foreign commerce, the State of Washington is not at liberty to tax the privilege of doing it by exacting in return therefor a percentage of the gross receipts.  Decisions to that effect are many and controlling.” <citedDecision>Id., at 94</citedDecision> .  The petitioners (officers of New York City) in Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., urged the Court to overrule Puget Sound.  They argued that intervening cases 14 had per *744 mitted local taxation of gross proceeds derived from interstate commerce.  They concluded, therefore, that the Commerce Clause did not preclude the application to stevedoring of the New York City business tax on the gross receipts of a stevedoring corporation.  The Court disagreed on the theory that the intervening cases permitted taxation only of local activity separate and distinct from interstate commerce.  330 U. S., at 430-433 .  This separation theory was necessary, said the Court, because it served to diminish the threat of multiple taxation on commerce; if the tax actually fell on intrastate activity, there was less likelihood that other taxing jurisdictions could duplicate the levy.

 The situation was the same in Complete Auto, and that case, thus, is not distinguishable from the present one.  Third, respondents suggest that what they regard as such an important change in Commerce Clause jurisprudence should come from Congress and not from this Court. To begin with, our rejection of the Stevedoring Cases does not effect a significant present change in the law. The primary alteration occurred in Complete Auto. Even if this case did effect an important change, it would not offend the sepa.ration-of-powers principle because it does not restrict the ability of Congress to regulate commerce.  The Commerce Clause does not state a prohibition; it merely grants specific power to Congress.  The prohibitive effect of the Clause on state legislation results from the Supremacy Clause and the decisions of this Court. See, e. g., Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1852); Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824).  If Congress prefers less disruption of interstate commerce, it will act.  18 Consistent with Complete Auto, then, we hold that the Washington business and occupation tax does not violate the *750 Commerce Clause by taxing the interstate commerce activity of stevedoring.  To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. <citedDecision>State Tax Comm’n</citedDecision> and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. stand to the contrary, each is overruled.  C With the distinction between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce thus discarded, the constitutionality under the Commerce Clause of the application of the Washington business and occupation tax to stevedoring depends upon the practical effect of the exaction.  As was recognized in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938), interstate commerce must bear its fair share of the state tax burden.  The Court repeatedly has sustained taxes that are applied to activity with a substantial nexus with the State, that are fairly apportioned, that do not discriminate against interstate commerce, and that are fairly related to the services provided by the State.  E. g., General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436 (1964); Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959); Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, 335 U. S. 80 (1948); Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435 (1940); see Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., at 279 , and n. 8.  Respondents proved no facts in the Superior Court that, under the above test, would justify invalidation of the Washington tax. The record contains nothing that minimizes the obvious nexus between Washington and respondents; indeed, respondents conduct their entire stevedoring operations within the State.  Nor have respondents successfully attacked the apportionment of the Washington system.

 That the holding in Spector parallels that in Puget Sound is demonstrated by the authorities relied upon or provided by both cases in the past.  Spector relied on Carter & Weekes, which reaffirmed Puget Sound, and upon Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249 (1946).  340 U. S.„ at 609.  Freeman, in turn, relied upon Puget Sound, 329 U. S., at 257, and Carter & Weekes relied upon Freeman, 330 17.  S., at 433.  Both Freeman and Puget Sound relied upon Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, 210 U. S. 217 (1908).  329 U. S., at 257; <citedDecision>302 U. S., at 94</citedDecision> .  Respondents, also, have observed the parallel between Spector and the Stevedoring Cases. In their reply brief to the Superior Court, they argued that Spector, which had not then been overruled by Complete Auto, was dispositive on the question of the continued vitality of Puget Sound and Carter & Weekes.  See n. 11, supra. Subsequent to Carter & Weekes, the Court explained more precisely its concern about multiple burdens on interstate commerce: “While the economic wisdom of state net income taxes is one of state policy not for our decision, one of the 'realities’ raised by the parties is the possibility of a multiple burden resulting from the exactions in question.  The answer is that none is shown to exist here.  .  .  .
