**Combined Opinion**
Second. There is a suggestion though not elaborated in briefs that these state laws conflict with Art. I, § 10, of the United States Constitution, insofar as they impair the obligation of contracts made prior to their enactment. That this contention is without merit is now too clearly established to require discussion. See Home Bldg. & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell, <targetCase>290 U.S. 398</targetCase> , 436-439, and cases *532 there cited. And also Veix v. Sixth Ward Bldg. & Loan Assn., 310 U.S. 32 , 38; East New York Savings Bank v. Hahn, 326 U.S. 230 , 232. Third. It is contended that the North Carolina and Nebraska laws deny unions and their members equal protection of the laws and thus offend the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the outlawed contracts are a useful incentive to the growth of union membership, it is said that these laws weaken the bargaining power of unions and correspondingly strengthen the power of employers. This may be true.
