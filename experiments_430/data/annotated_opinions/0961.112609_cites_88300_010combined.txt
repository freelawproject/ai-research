 App. to Pet. for Cert. A2, judgt.  order reported at 904 F. 2d 33 (1990).  We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Circuits as to the scope of the Minturn decision 4 and to *608 consider whether Minturn should be overruled.  498 U. S. 1045 (1991).  Today we are constrained to overrule Minturn and hold that there is no per se exception of agency contracts from admiralty jurisdiction.  II Section 1333(1) of Title 28 U. S. C. grants federal district courts jurisdiction over “[a]ny civil case of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction.” In determining the boundaries of admiralty jurisdiction, we look to the purpose of the grant.  See Insurance Co. v. Dunham, <citedDecision>11 Wall. 1, 24</citedDecision> (1871).  As we recently reiterated, the “fundamental interest giving rise to maritime jurisdiction is ‘the protection of maritime commerce.’” Sisson v. Ruby, 497 U. S. 358, 367 (1990), quoting Foremost Ins. Co. v. Richardson, 457 U. S. 668, 674 (1982).  This case requires us to determine whether the limits set upon admiralty jurisdiction in Minturn are consistent with that interest.  The decision in Minturn has confounded many, and we think the character of that three-paragraph opinion is best appreciated when viewed in its entirety: “The respondents were sued in admiralty, by process in personam.  The libel charges that they are owners of the steamboat Gold Hunter; that they had appointed the libellant their general agent or broker; and exhibits a bill, showing a balance of accounts due libellant for money paid, laid out, and expended for the use of re *609 spondents, in paying for supplies, repairs, and advertising of the steamboat, and numerous other charges, together with commissions on the disbursements, &c. “The court below very properly dismissed the libel, for want of jurisdiction.  There is nothing in the nature of a maritime contract in the case. The libel shows nothing but a demand for a balance of accounts between agent and principal, for which an action of assumpsit, in a common law court, is the proper remedy.  That the money advanced and paid for respondents was, in whole or in part, to pay bills due by a steamboat for repairs or supplies, will not make the transaction maritime, or give the libellant a remedy in admiralty.

 The second rationale appears to be premised on the then-accepted rule that a contract would not be deemed maritime absent a “hypothecation” or a pledge by the vessel’s owner of the vessel as security for debts created pursuant to the contract.  In other words, to sue in admiralty on a contract, the claimant had to have some form of a lien interest in the vessel, even if the action was one in personam.  See e. g., Gardner v. The New Jersey, 9 F. Cas. 1192 , 1195 (No. 5233) (D. Pa. 1806); see generally, Note, 17 Conn. L. Rev. 595 , 597-598 (1985).  Both of these rationales have since been discredited.  In Archawski, supra, the Court held that an action cognizable as assumpsit would no longer be automatically excluded from admiralty.  Rather, “admiralty has jurisdiction, even where the libel reads like indebitatus assumpsit at common law, provided that the unjust enrichment arose as a result of the breach of a maritime contract.” 350 U. S., at 536 .  Only 16 years after Minturn was decided, the Court also cast considerable doubt on the “hypothecation requirement.” In Insurance Co. v. Dunham, <citedDecision>11 Wall. 1</citedDecision> (1871), the Court explained that, in determining whether a contract falls within admiralty, “the true criterion is the nature and subject-matter of the contract, as whether it was a maritime contract, having reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.” <citedDecision>
   Id.,
  
  at 26</citedDecision> .  Several subsequent cases followed this edict of <citedDecision>Dunham</citedDecision> and rejected the relevance of the hypothecation requirement to establishing admiralty jurisdiction.  See North Pacific S. S. Co. v. Hall Bros. Marine Railway & Shipbuild *611 ing Co., 249 U. S. 119, 126 (1919); Detroit Trust Co. v. The Thomas Barlum, 293 U. S. 21, 47-48 (1934).  6 Thus, to the extent that Mintum’s theoretical underpinnings can be discerned, those foundations are no longer the law of this Court. Minturifs approach to determining admiralty jurisdiction, moreover, is inconsistent with the principle that the “nature and subject-matter” of the contract at issue should be the crucial consideration in assessing admiralty jurisdiction.  Insurance Co. v. <citedDecision>
   Dunham, supra,
  
  at 26</citedDecision> .  While the Mint-urn Court viewed it as irrelevant “[t]hat the money advanced and paid for respondents was, in whole or in part, to pay bills due by a steamboat for repairs or supplies,” the trend in modern admiralty case law, by contrast, is to focus the jurisdictional inquiry upon whether the nature of the transaction was maritime.  See e. g., Kossick v. United Fruit Co., 365 U. S. 731, 735-738 (1961).  See also Krauss Bros. Lumber Co. v. Dimon S. S. Corp., 290 U. S. 117, 124 (1933) (“Admiralty is not concerned with the form of the action, but with its substance”).  Finally, the proposition for which Minturn stands —a per se bar of agency contracts from admiralty— ill serves the purpose of the grant of admiralty jurisdiction.  As noted, the admiralty jurisdiction is designed to protect maritime commerce.  See supra, at 608.

 Inc., 498 F. 2d 411, 411-412 (CA9 1974) (per curiam) (looking to the character of the work *608 performed by a “husbanding agent’’ and concluding that the contract was maritime because the services performed were “necessary for the continuing voyage”); and id., at 412 (arguably limiting Minturn to general agency as opposed to special agency contracts); and Hadjipateras v. Pacifica, S. A., 290 F. 2d 697, 703-704 , and n. 15 (CA5 1961) (holding an agency contract for management and operation of a vessel within admiralty jurisdiction and limiting Minturn to actions for “an accounting as such”).  See also Ameejee Valleejee & Sons v. M/V Victoria U., 661 F. 2d 310, 312 (CA4 1981) (espousing a “general proposition of law” that a general agent may not invoke admiralty jurisdiction while a special agent can).  5 As early as 1870, however, this Court narrowed the reach of Minturn and cast doubt on its validity.  See The Kalorama, 10 Wall. 204, 217 (1870) (distinguishing Minturn and allowing agents who had advanced funds for repairs and supplies for a vessel to sue in admiralty where it was “expressly agreed that the advances should be furnished on the credit of the steamer”).  6 These decisions were part of a larger trend started in the 19th century of eschewing the restrictive prohibitions on admiralty jurisdiction that prevailed in England.  See e. g.. Waring v. Clarke.  5 How. 441, 464-459 (1847) (holding that the constitutional grant of admiralty jurisdiction did not adopt the statutory and judicial rules limiting admiralty jurisdiction in England); The Propeller Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443, 456-457 (1852) (rejecting the English tide-water doctrine that “measureplj the jurisdiction of the admiralty by the tide"); Insurance Co. v. Dunham, <citedDecision>11 Wall., at 26</citedDecision> (rejecting the English locality rule on maritime contracts “which concedes [admiralty] jurisdiction, with a few exceptions, only to contracts made upon the sea and to be executed thereon").  7 As noted, the District Court regarded the services performed by Exxon in the Jeddah transaction as “preliminary” and characterized the rule excluding agency contracts from admiralty as “a subset” of the preliminary contract doctrine.  See supra, at 607, and n. 3.  This Court has never ruled on .the validity of the preliminary contract doctrine, nor do we reach that question here.  However, we emphasize that Mintu rn has been overruled and that courts should focus on the nature of the services performed by the agent in determining whether an agency contract is a maritime contract.
