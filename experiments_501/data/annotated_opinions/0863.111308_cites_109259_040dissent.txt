**Dissenting Opinion**
 This Court has been increasingly generous in its interpretation of the commerce power of Congress, primarily to assure that the National Government would be able to deal with national economic problems.  Most significantly, the Court in NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1 (1937), and United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941), rejected its previous interpretations of the commerce power which had stymied New Deal legislation.  Jones & Laughlin and Darby embraced the notion that Congress can regulate intrastate activities that affect *584 interstate commerce as surely as it can regulate interstate commerce directly.  Subsequent decisions indicate that Congress, in order to regulate an activity, needs only a rational basis for a finding that the activity affects interstate commerce.  See Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 258 (1964).  Even if a particular individual's activity has no perceptible interstate effect, it can be reached by Congress through regulation of that class of activity in general as long as that class, considered as a whole, affects interstate commerce.  Fry v. United States, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 542</citedDecision> (1975); Perez v. United States, 402 U. S. 146 (1971).  Incidental to this expansion of the commerce power, Congress has been given an ability it lacked prior to the emergence of an integrated national economy.  Because virtually every state activity, like virtually every activity of a private individual, arguably “affects” interstate commerce, Congress can now supplant the States from the significant sphere of activities envisioned for them by the Framers.  It is in this context that recent changes in the workings of Congress, such as the direct election of Senators and the expanded influence of national interest groups, see ante, at 544, n. 9 (Powell, J., dissenting), become relevant.  These changes may well have lessened the weight Congress gives to the legitimate interests of States as States.  As a result, there is now a real risk that Congress will gradually erase the diffusion of power between State and Nation on which the Framers based their faith in the efficiency and vitality of our Republic.  It would be erroneous, however, to conclude that the Supreme Court was blind to the threat to federalism when it expanded the commerce power.

 .  .” United States v. Wrightwood Dairy Co. was heavily relied upon by Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 124 (1942), and the reasoning of these cases underlies every recent decision concerning the reach of Congress to activities affecting interstate commerce.  See, e. g., Fry v. United States, supra, at 547; Perez v. United States, supra, at 151-152; Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, supra, at 258-259.  It is worth recalling the cited passage in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819), that lies at the source of the recent expansion of the commerce power.  “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution,” Chief Justice Marshall said, “and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional” (emphasis added).  The spirit of the Tenth Amendment, of course, is that the States will retain their integrity in a system in which the laws of the United States are nevertheless supreme.  <citedDecision>Fry</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 547, n. 7.  It is not enough that the “end be legitimate”; the means to that end chosen by Congress must not contravene the spirit of the Constitution.  Thus many of this Court’s decisions acknowledge that the means by which national power is exercised must take into account concerns for state autonomy.  See, e. g., Fry v. United States, supra, at 547, n. 7; New *586 York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 586-587 (1946) (Stone, C. J., concurring); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, at 37 (“Undoubtedly, the scope of this [commerce] power must be considered in the light of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them, in view of our complex society, would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government”); Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S. 453, 466-467 (1938).  See also Sandalow, Constitutional Interpretation, 79 Mich. L. Rev. 1033 , 1055 (1981) (“The question, always, is whether the exercise of power is consistent with the entire Constitution, a question that can be answered only by taking into account, so far as they are relevant, all of the values to which the Constitution — as interpreted over time — gives expression”).  For example, Congress might rationally conclude that the location a State chooses for its capital may affect interstate commerce, but the Court has suggested that Congress would nevertheless be barred from dictating that location because such an exercise of a delegated power would undermine the state sovereignty inherent in the Tenth Amendment.  Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559, 565 (1911).
