**Concurrence Opinion**
 Here considerations of stare decisis cut in both directions.  On the one hand, we have a series of rulings that municipalities and counties are not “persons” for purposes of § 1983.  On the other hand, many decisions of this Court have been premised on the amenability of school boards and similar entities to § 1983 suits.  In Monroe and its progeny, we have answered a question that was never actually briefed or argued in this Court— whether a municipality is liable in damages for injuries that are the direct result of its official policies.  “The theory of the complaint [in Monroe was] that under the circumstances [t]here alleged the City [was] liable for the acts of its police officers, by virtue of respondeat superior.” Brief for Petition *709 ers, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 21.  5 Respondents answered that adoption of petitioners’ position would expose “Chicago and every other municipality in the United States ... to Civil Rights Act liability through no action of its own and based on action contrary to its own ordinances and the laws of the state it is a part of.” Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 26.  Thus the ground of decision in Monroe was not advanced by either party and was broader than necessary to resolve the contentions made in that case. 6 *710 Similarly, in Moor v. County of Alameda, <citedDecision>411 U. S. 693</citedDecision> (1973), petitioners asserted that “the County was vicariously liable for the acts of its deputies and sheriff,” <citedDecision>id., at 696</citedDecision> , under 42 U. S. C. § 1988 .  In rejecting this vicarious-liability claim, <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 710</citedDecision> , and n. 27, we reaffirmed Monroe’s reading of the statute, but there was no challenge in that case to “the holding in Monroe concerning the status under § 1983 of public entities such as the County,” <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 700</citedDecision> ; Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1972, No. 72-10, p. 9.  Only in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 607 (1973), did the Court confront a § 1983 claim based on conduct that was both authorized under state law and the direct cause of the claimed constitutional injury.  In Kenosha, however, we raised the issue of the city’s amenability to suit under § 1983 on our own initiative.  7 This line of cases — from Monroe to Kenosha — is difficult to reconcile on a principled basis with a parallel series of cases *711 in which the Court has assumed sub silentio that some local government entities could be sued under § 1983.  If now, after full consideration of the question, we continued to adhere to Monroe , grave doubt would be cast upon the Court’s exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction over school boards.  See ante, at 663 n. 5.  Since “the principle of blanket immunity established in Monroe cannot be cabined short of school boards,” ante, at 696, the conflict is squarely presented.
