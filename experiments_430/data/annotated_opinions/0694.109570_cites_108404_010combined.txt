 Similarly, just as the Massachusetts law in Eisenstadt "prohibit[ed], *197 not use, but distribution," 405 U. S., at 446, and consequently the least awkward challenger was one in Baird's position who was subject to that proscription, the law challenged here explicitly regulates the sale rather than use of 3.2% beer, thus leaving a vendor as the obvious claimant.  We therefore hold that Whitener has standing to raise relevant equal protection challenges to Oklahoma's gender-based law. We now consider those arguments.  II A Before 1972, Oklahoma defined the commencement of civil majority at age 18 for females and age 21 for males.  Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, § 13 (1972 and Supp. 1976).  In contrast, females were held criminally responsible as adults at age 18 and males at age 16.  Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, § 1101 (a) (Supp. 1976).  After the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held in 1972, on the authority of Reed v. Reed, <citedDecision>404 U. S. 71</citedDecision> (1971), that the age distinction was unconstitutional for purposes of establishing criminal responsibility as adults, Lamb v. Brown, 456 F. 2d 18 , the Oklahoma Legislature fixed age 18 as applicable to both males and females.  Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, § 1101 (a) (Supp. 1976).  In 1972, 18 also was established as the age of majority for males and females in civil matters, Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, § 13 (1972 and Supp. 1976), except that §§ 241 and 245 of the 3.2% beer statute were simultaneously codified to create an exception to the gender-free rule.  Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> emphasized that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are "subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause." <citedDecision>404 U. S., at 75</citedDecision> .  To withstand constitutional challenge, previous cases establish that classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.  Thus, in <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> , the objectives *198 of "reducing the workload on probate courts," <citedDecision>id., at 76</citedDecision> , and "avoiding intrafamily controversy," <citedDecision>id., at 77</citedDecision> , were deemed of insufficient importance to sustain use of an overt gender criterion in the appointment of administrators of intestate decedents' estates.  Decisions following <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> similarly have rejected administrative ease and convenience as sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-based classifications.  See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 656 (1972); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 690 (1973); cf. Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498, 506-507 (1975).  And only two Terms ago, Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7 (1975), expressly stating that <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> was "controlling," 421 U. S., at 13 , held that <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> required invalidation of a Utah differential age-of-majority statute, notwithstanding the statute's coincidence with and furtherance of the State's purpose of fostering "old notions" of role typing and preparing boys for their expected performance in the economic and political worlds.  421 U. S., at 14-15 .  [6] Reed v. <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> has also provided the underpinning for decisions that have invalidated statutes employing gender as an inaccurate proxy for other, more germane bases of classification.  Hence, "archaic and overbroad" generalizations, Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra, at 508 , concerning the financial position of servicewomen, Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 689 n. 23, and working women, Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 643 (1975), could not justify use of a gender line in determining eligibility for certain governmental entitlements.  Similarly, increasingly outdated *199 misconceptions concerning the role of females in the home rather than in the "marketplace and world of ideas" were rejected as loose-fitting characterizations incapable of supporting state statutory schemes that were premised upon their accuracy.  Stanton v. Stanton, supra ; Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 , 535 n. 17 (1975).  In light of the weak congruence between gender and the characteristic or trait that gender purported to represent, it was necessary that the legislatures choose either to realign their substantive laws in a gender-neutral fashion, or to adopt procedures for identifying those instances where the sex-centered generalization actually comported with fact.  See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, supra., at 658 ; cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U. S. 632, 650 (1974).  In this case, too, " <citedDecision>Reed,</citedDecision> we feel, is controlling .  .  .," Stanton v. Stanton, supra, at 13 .  We turn then to the question whether, under <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> , the difference between males and females with respect to the purchase of 3.2% beer warrants the differential in age drawn by the Oklahoma statute.  We conclude that it does not.  B The District Court recognized that <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> was controlling.  In applying the teachings of that case, the court found the requisite important governmental objective in the traffic-safety goal proffered by the Oklahoma Attorney General.  It then concluded that the statistics introduced by the appellees established that the gender-based distinction was substantially related to achievement of that goal.  C We accept for purposes of discussion the District Court's identification of the objective underlying §§ 241 and 245 as the enhancement of traffic safety.  [7] Clearly, the protection *200 of public health and safety represents an important function of state and local governments.  However, appellees' statistics in our view cannot support the conclusion that the gender-based distinction closely serves to achieve that objective and therefore the distinction cannot under <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> withstand equal protection challenge.  The appellees introduced a variety of statistical surveys.  First, an analysis of arrest statistics for 1973 demonstrated that 18-20-year-old male arrests for "driving under the influence" and "drunkenness" substantially exceeded female arrests for that same age period.  [8] Similarly, youths aged 17-21 were found to be overrepresented among those killed *201 or injured in traffic accidents, with males again numerically exceeding females in this regard.  [9] Third, a random roadside survey in Oklahoma City revealed that young males were more inclined to drive and drink beer than were their female counterparts.  [10] Fourth, Federal Bureau of Investigation nationwide statistics exhibited a notable increase in arrests for "driving under the influence." [11] Finally, statistical evidence gathered in other jurisdictions, particularly Minnesota and Michigan, was offered to corroborate Oklahoma's experience by indicating the pervasiveness of youthful participation in motor vehicle accidents following the imbibing of alcohol.
**Combined Opinion**
 [15] Indeed, the only survey that explicitly centered its attention upon young drivers and their use of beeralbeit apparently not of the diluted 3.2% varietyreached results that hardly can be viewed as impressive in justifying either a gender or age classification.  [16] *204 There is no reason to belabor this line of analysis.  It is unrealistic to expect either members of the judiciary or state officials to be well versed in the rigors of experimental or statistical technique.  But this merely illustrates that proving broad sociological propositions by statistics is a dubious business, and one that inevitably is in tension with the normative philosophy that underlies the Equal Protection Clause.  [17] Suffice to say that the showing offered by the appellees does not satisfy us that sex represents a legitimate, accurate proxy for the regulation of drinking and driving.  In fact, when it is further recognized that Oklahoma's statute prohibits only the selling of 3.2% beer to young males and not their drinking the beverage once acquired (even after purchase by their 18-20-year-old female companions), the relationship between gender and traffic safety becomes far too tenuous to satisfy Reed' s requirement that the gender-based difference be substantially related to achievement of the statutory objective.  We hold, therefore, that under <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> , Oklahoma's 3.2% beer statute invidiously discriminates against males 18-20 years of age.  D Appellees argue, however, that §§ 241 and 245 enforce state policies concerning the sale and distribution of alcohol and by force of the Twenty-first Amendment should therefore be held to withstand the equal protection challenge.  The District Court's response to this contention is unclear.  The court assumed that the Twenty-first Amendment "strengthened" the State's police powers with respect to alcohol regulation, 399 F. Supp., at 1307 , but then said that "the standards of review that [the Equal Protection Clause] mandates are not relaxed." Id., at 1308 .  Our view is, and we hold, that the Twenty-first Amendment does not save the *205 invidious gender-based discrimination from invalidation as a denial of equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The history of state regulation of alcoholic beverages dates from long before adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment.
**Combined Opinion**
 [22] In sum, the principles embodied in the Equal *209 Protection Clause are not to be rendered inapplicable by statistically measured but loose-fitting generalities concerning the drinking tendencies of aggregate groups.  We thus hold that the operation of the Twenty-first Amendment does not alter the application of equal protection standards that otherwise govern this case. *210 We conclude that the gender-based differential contained in Okla. Stat., Tit. 37, § 245 (1976 Supp.) constitutes a denial of the equal protection of the laws to males aged 18-20 [23] and reverse the judgment of the District Court. [24] It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.  I join the opinion of the Court as I am in general agreement with it.  I do have reservations as to some of the discussion concerning the appropriate standard for equal protection analysis and the relevance of the statistical evidence.  Accordingly, I add this concurring statement.  With respect to the equal protection standard, I agree that Reed v. Reed, <citedDecision>404 U. S. 71</citedDecision> (1971), is the most relevant precedent.  But I find it unnecessary, in deciding this case, to read that decision as broadly as some of the Court's language may imply.  <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> and subsequent cases involving gender-based classifications make clear that the Court subjects such classifications to a more critical examination than is normally applied when "fundamental" constitutional rights and "suspect classes" are not present.  [*] *211 I view this as a relatively easy case. No one questions the legitimacy or importance of the asserted governmental objective: the promotion of highway safety.  The decision of the case turns on whether the state legislature, by the classification it has chosen, has adopted a means that bears a "`fair and substantial relation'" to this objective.  <citedDecision>Id., at 76</citedDecision> , quoting Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415 (1920).  It seems to me that the statistics offered by appellees and relied upon by the District Court do tend generally to support the view that young men drive more, possibly are inclined to drink more, andfor various reasonsare involved in more accidents than young women.  Even so, I am not persuaded that these facts and the inferences fairly drawn from them justify this classification based on a three-year age differential between the sexes, and especially one that is so easily circumvented as to be virtually meaningless.  Putting it differently, this gender-based classification does not bear a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation.  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.  There is only one Equal Protection Clause.  It requires every State to govern impartially.

 .  ." California v. LaRue, supra, at 120 n. (concurring opinion).  The disparity created by these Oklahoma statutes amounts to total irrationality.  For the statistics upon which the State now relies, whatever their other shortcomings, wholly fail to prove or even suggest that 3.2% beer is somehow more deleterious when it comes into the hands of a male aged 18-20 than of a female of like age.  The disparate statutory treatment of the sexes here, without even a colorably valid justification or explanation, thus amounts to invidious discrimination.  See Reed v. Reed, <citedDecision>404 U. S. 71</citedDecision> .  MR. CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, dissenting.  I am in general agreement with MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST'S dissent, but even at the risk of compounding the obvious confusion created by those voting to reverse the District Court, I will add a few words.  At the outset I cannot agree that appellant Whitener has standing arising from her status as a saloonkeeper to assert the constitutional rights of her customers.  In this Court "a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities." United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 22 (1960).  There are a few, but strictly limited exceptions to that rule; despite the most creative efforts, this case fits within none of them.
**Combined Opinion**
 Most obviously unavailable to support any kind of special scrutiny in this case, is a history or pattern of past discrimination, such as was relied on by the plurality in Frontiero to support its invocation of strict scrutiny.  There is no suggestion in the Court's opinion that males in this age group are in any way peculiarly disadvantaged, subject to systematic discriminatory treatment, or otherwise in need of special solicitude from the courts.  The Court does not discuss the nature of the right involved, and there is no reason to believe that it sees the purchase of 3.2% beer as implicating any important interest, let alone one that is "fundamental" in the constitutional sense of invoking strict scrutiny.  Indeed, the Court's accurate observation that the statute affects the selling but not the drinking of 3.2% beer, ante, at 204, further emphasizes the limited effect that it has on even those persons in the age group involved.  There is, in sum, nothing about the statutory classification involved here to suggest that it affects an interest, or works against a group, which can claim under the Equal Protection Clause that it is entitled to special judicial protection.  It is true that a number of our opinions contain broadly phrased dicta implying that the same test should be applied to all classifications based on sex, whether affecting females or males.  E. g., Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 688; Reed v. Reed, <citedDecision>404 U. S. 71, 76</citedDecision> (1971).  However, before today, no decision of this Court has applied an elevated level of scrutiny to invalidate a statutory discrimination harmful to males, except where the statute impaired an important personal interest protected by the Constitution.  [1] There being no such interest *220 here, and there being no plausible argument that this is a discrimination against females, [2] the Court's reliance on our previous sex-discrimination cases is ill-founded.  It treats gender classification as a talisman whichwithout regard to the rights involved or the persons affectedcalls into effect a heavier burden of judicial review.  The Court's conclusion that a law which treats males less favorably than females "must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives" apparently comes out of thin air.  The Equal Protection Clause contains no such language, and none of our previous cases adopt that standard.  I would think we have had enough difficulty with the two standards of review which our cases have recognizedthe *221 norm of "rational basis," and the "compelling state interest" required where a "suspect classification" is involvedso as to counsel weightily against the insertion of still another "standard" between those two.

 [9]  This survey drew no correlation between the accident figures for any age group and levels of intoxication found in those killed or injured.  [10]  For an analysis of the results of this exhibit, see n. 16, infra.  [11]  The FBI made no attempt to relate these arrest figures either to beer drinking or to an 18-21 age differential, but rather found that male arrests for all ages exceeded 90% of the total.  [12]  Obviously, arrest statistics do not embrace all individuals who drink and drive.  But for purposes of analysis, this "underinclusiveness" must be discounted somewhat by the shortcomings inherent in this statistical sample, see n. 14, infra.  In any event, we decide this case in light of the evidence offered by Oklahoma and know of no way of extrapolating these arrest statistics to take into account the driving and drinking population at large, including those who avoided arrest.  [13]  For example, we can conjecture that in <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> , Idaho's apparent premise that women lacked experience in formal business matters (particularly compared to men) would have proved to be accurate in substantially more than 2% of all cases. And in both Frontiero and Wiesenfeld , we expressly found appellees' empirical defense of mandatory dependency tests for men but not women to be unsatisfactory, even though we recognized that husbands are still far less likely to be dependent on their wives than vice versa.  See, e. g., 411 U. S., at 688-690.  [14]  The very social stereotypes that find reflection in age-differential laws, see Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S., 7, 14-15 (1975), are likely substantially to distort the accuracy of these comparative statistics.  Hence "reckless" young men who drink and drive are transformed into arrest statistics, whereas their female counterparts are chivalrously escorted home.  See, e. g., W. Reckless & B. Kay, The Female Offender 4, 7, 13, 16-17 (Report to Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, 1967).  Moreover, the Oklahoma surveys, gathered under a regime where the age-differential law in question has been in effect, are lacking in controls necessary for appraisal of the actual effectiveness of the male 3.2% beer prohibition.  In this regard, the disproportionately high arrest statistics for young malesand, indeed, the growing alcohol-related arrest figures for all ages and sexessimply may be taken to document the relative futility of controlling driving behavior by the 3.2% beer statute and like legislation, although we obviously have no means of estimating how many individuals, if any, actually were prevented from drinking by these laws.
**Combined Opinion**
 Undoubtedly reflecting the view that Goesaert's equal protection analysis no longer obtains, the District Court made no reference to that decision in upholding Oklahoma's statute.  Similarly, the opinions of the federal and state courts cited earlier in the text invalidating gender lines with respect to alcohol regulation uniformly disparaged the contemporary vitality of Goesaert .  [24]  As noted in Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S., at 17-18 , the Oklahoma Legislature is free to redefine any cutoff age for the purchase and sale of 3.2% beer that it may choose, provided that the redefinition operates in a gender-neutral fashion.  [*]  As is evident from our opinions, the Court has had difficulty in agreeing upon a standard of equal protection analysis that can be applied consistently to the wide variety of legislative classifications.  There are valid reasons for dissatisfaction with the "two-tier" approach that has been prominent in the Court's decisions in the past decade.  Although viewed by many as a result-oriented substitute for more critical analysis, that approachwith its narrowly limited "upper-tier"now has substantial precedential support.  As has been true of <citedDecision>Reed</citedDecision> and its progeny, our decision today will be viewed by some as a "middle-tier" approach.  While I would not endorse that characterization and would not welcome a further subdividing of equal protection analysis, candor compels the recognition that the relatively deferential "rational basis" standard of review normally applied takes on a sharper focus when we address a gender-based classification.  So much is clear from our recent cases. For thoughtful discussions of equal protection analysis, see, e. g., Gunther, The Supreme Court, 1971 TermForeword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for A Newer Equal Protection, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 1 (1972); Wilkinson, The Supreme Court, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Three Faces of Constitutional Equality, 61 Va. L. Rev. 945 (1975).  [1]  Men as a general class have not been the victims of the kind of historic, pervasive discrimination that has disadvantaged other groups.  [2]  "[S]ince sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth, the imposition of special disabilities upon the members of a particular sex because of their sex would seem to violate `the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility .  .  .,' Weber v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 406 U. S. 164, 175 ."
