 The definition has not been thought to have any relation to the reversionary* interest of a grantor who has transferred either a vested or contingent remainder in fee.  See Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities (2nd Ed.), §§ 13-51.  We are not unmindful of amendments to the estate tax law to which other decisions of this Court gave rise.  Thus by § 805 of the Revenue Act of 1936, c. 690, 49 Stat. 1648 , Congress undid the construction which this Court gave the estate tax law in another connection by a decision rendered on the same day as were the St. Louis Trust cases. Cf. White v. Poor, 296 U. S. 98 .  This case arose under § 302 (d) and not § 302 (c).  But, in any event, the fact of Congressional action in dealing with one problem while silent on the different problems created by the St. Louis Trust cases, does not imply controlling acceptance by Congress of those cases. By the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, c. 454, 46 Stat. 1516 , Congress displaced the construction which this Court put upon § 302 (c) in those cases wherein it was held that the reservation by a decedent of a life estate in property conveyed inter vivos, did not constitute a sufficient postponement of the remainder to bring it into the grantor’s gross estate.  May v. Heiner, <citedDecision>281 U. S. 238</citedDecision> ; Burnet v. Northern Trust Co., 283 U. S. 782 ; Morsman v. Burnet, 283 U. S. 783 ; McCormick v. Burnet, 283 U. S. 784 .  The speculative arguments that may be drawn from ad hoc legislation affecting one set of decisions and the want of such legislation to modify another set of decisions dealing with a somewhat different though cognate problem are well illustrated by this remedial amendment.  For it may be urged with considerable plausibility that in 1931 Congress had in principle already rejected the general attitude underlying the St. Louis Trust cases, as illustrated by the fact that in those cases the majority, in part at least, relied upon the Congressionally discarded <citedDecision>May</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Heiner</citedDecision> doctrine.  Whatever may be the scope of the doctrine that re-énactment of a statute impliedly enacts a settled judicial construction placed upon the re-enacted statute, that doctrine has no relevance to the present *121 problem.  Since the decisions in the St. Louis Trust cases, Congress has not re-enacted § 302 (c).  The amendments that Congress made to other provisions of § 302 in connection with other situations than those now before the Court, were made without re-enacting § 302 (c).  Nor has Congress, under any rational canons of legislative significance, by its compilation of internal revenue laws to form the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 53 Stat. 1 , impliedly enacted into law a particular decision which, in the light of later experience, is seen to create confusion and conflict in the application of a settled principle of internal revenue legislation.  Here, unlike the situation in such cases as National Lead Co. v. United States, 252 U. S. 140 , 146—47, and Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, 287 U. S. 299, 302-3 , we have no conjunction of long, uniform administrative construction and subsequent re-enactments of an ambiguous statute to give ground for implying legislative adoption of such construction.  See Preface, Internal Revenue Code, 53 Stat. III; compare Smiley v. Holm, 285 U. S. 355, 373 , and Warner v. Goltra, 293 U. S. 155, 161 .

 The fact that something may happen in respect of the beneficial enjoyment of the propérty conditioned upon the decedent’s death is irrelevant so long as that something is not the shifting of possession or beneficial enjoyment from the decedent.  This is made clear by Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., 278 U. S. 339, 347 .  If A makes a present irrevocable transfer in trust, conditioned that he shall receive the income for life and, at his death, the principal shall go to B, B is at once legally *126 invested with the principal.  A’s life .estate ceases at his death.  Nothing then passes.  There is no tax imposed by the statute because there is no transfer any more than there would be in the case of a similar life estate given A by his grandmother.  (This is May v. Heiner, <citedDecision>281 U. S. 238</citedDecision> .) If, on the other hand, A creates an estate for years or for life in B, retaining the remaining beneficial interest .in the property for himself, and, whether by the terms of the grant, or by the terms of A’s will, or under the intestate law, that remainder passes to someone else at his death, such passage renders the transfer taxable.  (This is Klein v. United States, supra.) If what A does is to transfer his property irrevocably, with provision that it shall be.  enjoyed successively by various persons for life and then go absolutely to a named person, but that if he, A, shall outlive that person, the property shall come back to him, and A dies in the lifetime of the person in question, A has merely" lost the chance that the beneficial ownership of the property may revert to him.  That chance cannot pass under his will or under the intestate laws.  As there is no transfer which can become effective at his death by the shifting of any interest from him, no tax is imposed, (This is McCormick v. Burnet, supra, and Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Company, supra.) 2.  These governing principles were indicated as early as 1927 4 and were thereafter developed, in application to specific cases, in a consistent line of authorities.  In <citedDecision>May</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Heiner, supra,</citedDecision> it was held that a transfer in trust under which the income was payable to.  the trans-feror’s husband for his life and, after his death, to the transferor during her life, with remainder to her children, was not subject to tax as a'transfer intended to; take effect *127 in possession or enjoyment at or after death.  .  This court said (p. 243): “.  .  .  At the death of Mrs. May no interest in the property held under the trust deed, passed from her to the living; title thereto had been definitely fixed by the trust deed.  The interest therein which she possessed .immediately prior to her death was obliterated by that event.” [Italics supplied.] It will be noted that this is the equivalent of the Treasury’s statement, supra, that such an interest lapses at death'.  That decision is indistinguishable in principle from the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases and the instant cases; and what was there said serves to distinguish the Klein case. McCormick v. Burnet followed <citedDecision>May</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Heiner</citedDecision> .  The court there held that neither a reservation by the grantor of a life estate with remainders over, nor a provision for a reverter in case all the beneficiaries should die in the lifetime of the grantor, made the gifts transfers intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the grantor’s death.  In the Circuit Court of Appeals the Commissioner urged that the provision for payment of the trust estate to the settlor in case she survived all the beneficiaries rendered the transfer taxable.  That court dealt at length with the point and sustained his view.  ( 43 F. 2d 277, 279 .) The Commissioner made the same contention in this court, but it was overruled upon the authority of <citedDecision>May</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Heiner</citedDecision> .  Then came the two St. Louis Union Trust Company cases, decided upon the authority of <citedDecision>May</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Heiner</citedDecision> and McCormick v. Burnet .  Finally, the McCormick case wad followed in Bingham v. United States, 296 U. S. 211 .  Since the opinion of the- court appears to treat the St. Louis cases as the origin of the principle there announced, *128 it is important to emphasize the fact that the rule had been settled by this court as early as 1930; and to note, other decisions rendered prior to the St. Louis cases. In seven, intervening between <citedDecision>May</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Heiner</citedDecision> and the St. Louis cases, the Board 'of Tax Appeals reached the same conclusion as that announced in the St. Louis cases. 5 The Board’s action was affirmed in four of them.  6 Four other decisions by Circuit Courts of Appeals were to the same effect.  7 In practically all, reliance was placed upon Shukert v. Allen, Reinecke v. Northern Trust Company, May v. <citedDecision>Heiner</citedDecision> , and McCormick v. Burnet , or some of them.  Thus, when the question came before this court again in the St. Louis cases, there was a substantial body of authority following and applying the <citedDecision>Heiner</citedDecision> and McCormick cases. Since the St. Louis cases were decided, the principle on which they went has been repeatedly applied by the Board of Tax Appeals and the courts.  The Board has followed the cases in no less than seventeen instances.  8 *129 The record is the same in the courts.  The St. Louis cases have been followed in fourteen cases. 9 In some of these the Government has sought review in this court but in none, except those now presented, has it asked the court to overrule those decisions.  If there ever was an instance in which the doctrine of stare decisis should govern, this is it.  Aside from the obvious hardship involved in treating the taxpayers in the present cases differently from many others whose cases have been decided or closed in accordance with the settled rule, there are the weightier considerations that the judgments now rendered disappoint the just expectations of those who have acted in reliance upon the uniform construction of the statute by this and all other federal tribunals; and that, to upset these precedents now, must necessarily shake the confidence of the bar and the public in the stability of the rulings of the courts and make it impossible for inferior tribunals to adjudicate controversies in reliance on the decisions of this court. To nullify more than fifty decisions, five of them by.  this *130 court, some of which have stood for a decade, in order to change a mere rule of statutory construction, seems to me an altogether unwise and unjustified exertion of power.

 These subsections sweep such interests into the grpss estate in order to forestall tax avoidance.  Section 302 (c) was the successor of analogous sections in earlier acts and the predecessor of similar sections in later acts.  10 The subsection has been amended in successive Revenue Acts.  As a result of the Treasury’s experience in the enforcement of the law, Congress has from time to ktime thought it necessary to extend the scope of the subsection in the interest of more efficient administration.  Within constitutional limits spch extension is a matter of legislative policy for Congress alone.  11 It is familiar practice for Congress to amend a statute to obviate a construction given it by the courts.  The legislative history of § 302 (c) demonstrates that Congress has elected not to make such 'an amendment to *131 meet the construction placed upon it by this court in the St. Louis cases. <citedDecision>May</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Heiner</citedDecision> was decided in 1930.  The Treasury' was dissatisfied with the decision and in three later cases attacked the ruling, amongst- them McCormick v. Burnet .  The court announced its judgments in these cases on March 2, 1931, reaffirming <citedDecision>May</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Heiner</citedDecision> .  On the following day Congress adopted a joint resolution amending § 302 (c) to tax a transfer with reservation of a life estate to the grantor, but, in so doing, it omitted to deal, with a contingent interest reserved to the grantor or the possibility of reverter remaining in him, involved in both <citedDecision>Heiner</citedDecision> and McCormick .  See Hassett v. Welch, 303 U. S. 303, 308-9 .  The omission is significant.  It may be argued that in the haste of preparing and passing the amendment the point was overlooked.  But the joint resolution was reenacted by § 803 of the Revenue Act of 1932, 12 without any alteration to cover- the point.  The Revenue Act of 1934 13 amended § 302 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1926 but did not change § 302 (c) as it then stood.  The day the St. Louis cases were decided, this court announced its opinion in White v. Poor, 296 U. S. 98 , construing § 302 (d) of the Act of 1926.
