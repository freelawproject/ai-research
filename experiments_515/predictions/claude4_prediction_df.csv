92291,88699,Osborne v. Mobile,Overruled,"In view of the course of decisions which have been made since that time, it is very certain that such an ordinance would now be regarded as repugnant to the power conferred upon Congress to regulate commerce among the several States.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Osborne v. Mobile decision would now be considered unconstitutional given subsequent legal developments, effectively overruling its precedential value."
92291,89664,Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co.,Mentioned,"In the case of The Pensacola Telegraph Company v. The Western Union Telegraph Company, 96 U. S. 1, we held that it was not only the right, but the duty of Congress to take care that intercourse among the States and the transmission of intelligence between them be not obstructed or unnecessarily incumbered by state legislation","The Acting Decision cites this case favorably to support its reasoning about Congress's power over interstate telegraph communications, without any negative treatment."
92291,90600,Telegraph Co. v. Texas,Mentioned,"In Western Union Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U. S. 460, we decided that a State cannot lay a tax on the interstate business of a telegraph company, as it is interstate commerce","The Acting Decision references this case positively to support its holding that states cannot tax interstate telegraph business, using it as precedential authority."
92291,91869,Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District,Mentioned,"It comes plainly within the principle of the decisions lately made by this court in Robbins v. The Taxing District of Shelby County, 120 U. S. 489","The Acting Decision cites this case as supporting precedent for the principle that occupation taxes on interstate commerce are unconstitutional, applying its reasoning favorably."
92291,91985,Philadelphia & Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania,Mentioned,"It comes plainly within the principle of the decisions lately made by this court in Robbins v. The Taxing District of Shelby County, 120 U. S. 489, and Philadelphia and Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S. 326",The Acting Decision cites this case alongside Robbins as supporting precedent for the principle that states cannot impose taxes that burden interstate commerce.
93904,93354,Roberts v. Lewis (1892),Mentioned,"This certificate distinctly presents for decision the question (argued, but not decided, when this case was before this court at a former term, reported in 144 U. S. 653 ) of the construction of the will of Jacob Dawson","The court merely references the prior proceeding of the same case to provide context for the current decision, without any substantive treatment of the earlier ruling."
93904,87423,Suydam v. Williamson,Mentioned,"The opinion of the Supreme Court of the State appears to have been formed upon full consideration of the difficulties of. the case; and is entitled to great weight, especially upon the construction of the statute of the State. Suydam v. Williamson, 24 How. 427","The court cites Suydam v. Williamson as support for the general principle that state court opinions on state statute construction are entitled to great weight, without any critical analysis."
93904,84798,Lambert's Lessee v. Payne,Mentioned,"He begins by giving her "" all my estate, real and personal,"" which of itself would carry a fee, unless restricted by other words. Lambert v. Paine, 3 Cranch, 97","The court cites Lambert v. Paine as authority for the established principle that a gift of 'all my estate' carries a fee simple unless restricted, without any substantive discussion or criticism."
93904,89382,Brant v. Virginia Coal & Iron Co.,Distinguished,"In Brant v. Virginia Coal Co., the bequest which was held to give a life estate, and no power to convey a fee, was only of the testator's estate, real and personal, to his wife, ""to have and to hold during her life, and to do with as she sees proper, before her death."" 93 U. S. 327","The court distinguishes Brant by explaining that the language in that case was different from the current will, specifically noting the limiting phrase 'during her life' which is absent in the present case."
93904,90983,Howard v. Carusi,Mentioned,"If the clause containing them is repugnant and void, the view of the Supreme Court of Nebraska that the widow took an estate in fee isfortified. See Howard v. Carusi, 109 U. S. 725 ; Potter v. Couch, 141 U. S. 296, 315, 316","The court cites Howard v. Carusi along with Potter v. Couch as supporting authority for the principle regarding repugnant clauses in wills, without detailed analysis."
93904,93152,Potter v. Couch,Mentioned,"If the clause containing them is repugnant and void, the view of the Supreme Court of Nebraska that the widow took an estate in fee isfortified. See Howard v. Carusi, 109 U. S. 725 ; Potter v. Couch, 141 U. S. 296, 315, 316","The court cites Potter v. Couch along with Howard v. Carusi as supporting authority for the principle regarding repugnant clauses in wills, without detailed analysis."
93904,90455,Giles v. Little,Overruled,"And this court, on reconsideration of the whole matter, with the aid of the various judicial opinions upon the subject, and of the learned briefs of counsel, is of opinion that the sound construction of this will, as to the extent of the power conferred on the widow, is in accordance with the conclusion of the state court, and not with the former decision of this court, which must, therefore, be considered as overruled.","The court explicitly states that its former decision in Giles v. Little 'must, therefore, be considered as overruled' after reconsidering the construction of the will and finding the state court's interpretation to be correct."
93311,92988,Merrill v. Monticello,Mentioned,"In Merrill v. Monticello, 138 U. S. 673, 687, 691, it was held that the implied power of a municipal corporation to borrow money to enable it to execute the powers expressly conferred upon it by law, if existing at all, did not authorize it to create and issue negotiable securities to be sold in the market and to be taken by the purchaser freed from the equities that might be set up by the maker","The Acting Decision cites Merrill v. Monticello approvingly as part of a line of cases establishing the principle that municipal corporations cannot issue negotiable bonds without express authority, providing additional analysis without questioning its precedential value."
93311,87743,Rogers v. Burlington,Overruled,"We, therefore, must regard the cases of Rogers v. Burlington and Mitchell v. Burlington, as overruled in the particular referred to, by later cases in this court.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Rogers v. Burlington has been overruled by later cases, thus nullifying its precedential value on the question of municipal authority to issue negotiable bonds under a general borrowing power."
93311,91125,Claiborne County v. Brooks,Mentioned,"In Claiborne County v. Brooks, 111 U. S. 400, it was held that the power to issue commercial paper was foreign to the objects of the creation of the political divisions of counties and townships, and was not to be conceded to such organizations unless by virtue of express legislation or by very strong implication from such legislation","The Acting Decision cites Claiborne County v. Brooks approvingly as part of the established line of precedent supporting the principle that municipal corporations lack implied authority to issue negotiable securities, without questioning its validity."

Burlington, as overruled in the particular referred to, by later cases in this court.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Mitchell v. Burlington has been overruled by later cases, thus nullifying its precedential value on the question of municipal authority to issue negotiable bonds under a general borrowing power."
93311,88640,Police Jury v. Britton,Mentioned,"But in Police Jury v. Britton, 15 Wall. 566, it was held that the trustees or representative officers of a parish, county or other local jurisdiction, invested with the usual powers of administration in specific matters, and the power of levying taxes to defray the necessary expenditures of the jurisdiction, have no implied authority to issue negotiable securities","The Acting Decision cites Police Jury v. Britton approvingly as establishing the principle that municipal bodies lack implied authority to issue negotiable securities, treating it as good law without any criticism or doubt about its precedential value."
98124,96356,Rogers v. Peck,Mentioned,"Due process of law, this court has held, does not require the State to adopt any particular form of procedure, so long as it appears that the accused has had sufficient notice of the accusation and an adequate opportunity to defend himself in the prosecution. Rogers v. Peck, 199 U. S. 425, 435 , and previous cases in this court there cited.","The Acting Decision cites Rogers v. Peck as supportive authority for the principle that due process does not require specific procedural forms, using it to establish the legal standard without any criticism or limitation."
98124,94455,Crain v. United States,Overruled,"Holding this view> notwithstanding our reluctance to overrule former decisions of this court, we now are constrained to hold that the technical enforcement of formal rights in criminal procedure sustained in the Crain Case is no longer required in the prosecution of offenses under present systems of law, and so far as that case is not in accord with the views herein expressed it is necessarily overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that it is overruling the Crain case, finding that its technical enforcement of formal rights in criminal procedure is no longer required under present systems of law."
91306,88061,Texas v. White,Limited,"The position there taken that the legislature of Texas, while the State was owner of the bonds, could limit their negotiability by an act of legislation, of which all subsequent purchasers were charged with notice, although the bonds on their face were payable to bearer, must be regarded as overruled. And the further position that negotiable government securities, redeemable at the pleasure of the government after a specified day, but in which no date is fixed for final payment, cease to be negotiable as overdue after the day named when they first become redeemable, must be regarded as limited to cases where the title of the purchaser is acquired with notice of the defect of title, or under circumstances which discredit the instrument","The Acting Decision explicitly states that certain positions from Texas v. White must be regarded as overruled and limited, thereby narrowing the scope and applicability of that decision."
91306,88994,Vermilye & Co. v. Adams Express Co.,Distinguished,"But the notes in the case before us have no such feature. They are absolutely payable at a certain time, and we think the case is authority for holding that such an obligation, overdue, ceases to be negotiable in the sense which frees the transaction from all inquiry into the rights of antecedent holders. This ground is sufficient of itself to justify the decree in favor of the Express Company.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Vermilye by noting that the treasury notes in that case were 'absolutely payable at a certain time' unlike the bonds in the present case, showing different factual circumstances requiring different legal treatment."
91306,87633,Murray v. Lardner,Mentioned,"The rules established in Murray v. Lardner, 2 Wall. 110, 118 — 'that the purchaser of coupon bonds, before due, without notice and in good faith, is unaffected by want of title in the seller, and that the burden of proof in respect-to notice and want of good faith is on,the claimant of the bonds as against the purchaser' — were repeated and reaifirmed","The Acting Decision simply references the established rules from Murray v. Lardner without any criticism or limitation, merely noting that these rules were reaffirmed in Texas v. White."
91306,88240,Texas v. Hardenberg,Mentioned,"The case came before the court again in another aspect, and is reported as Texas v. Hardenberg, 10 Wall. 68, in which the grounds of the former decision were reconsidered and declared to be satisfactory.","The Acting Decision merely references Texas v. Hardenberg as a case that reconsidered and affirmed the grounds of Texas v. White, without any independent analysis or treatment of Hardenberg itself."
91306,88693,Huntington v. Texas,Mentioned,"The same questions, as to part of the same issue of bonds, came again before the court in Huntington v. Texas, 16 Wall. 402, in which the two prior decisions were relied on, on behalf of the State of Texas, as conclusive.","The Acting Decision simply references Huntington v. Texas as another case involving the same bonds where prior decisions were relied upon, without providing any independent treatment or analysis of the Huntington decision."
91306,88924,National Bank of Washington v. Texas,Mentioned,"Some of the same issue of bonds were in litigation before this court in National Bank of Washington v. Texas, 20 Wall. 72. In that case the title of the appellant was acquired after the 31st day of December, 1864, when they became redeemable, and they were not indorsed by the governor.","The Acting Decision references National Bank of Washington v. Texas as part of the series of cases involving the same bonds, providing factual background without any critical analysis or treatment of the decision's precedential value."
91306,89668,Cromwell v. County of Sac,Mentioned,"'To hold otherwise,' said this court in Cromwell v. County of Sac, 96 U. S. 51, 58, 'would throw discredit upon a large class of securities issued by municipal and private corporations, having years to run, with interest payable annually or semi-annually.'","The Acting Decision cites Cromwell v. County of Sac supportively to reinforce a principle about securities and interest payments, without any criticism or limitation of the cited decision."
91306,90400,Railroad Co. v. Sprague,Mentioned,"And the doctrine was reaffirmed in Railway Co. v. Sprague, 103 U. S. 756.","The Acting Decision simply notes that Railway Co. v. Sprague reaffirmed the doctrine from Cromwell v. County of Sac, without providing any independent analysis or treatment of the Sprague decision."
92059,91368,Poindexter v. Greenhow,Mentioned,"It must be regarded as a settled doctrine of this court, established by its recent decisions, that the question whether a suit is within the prohibition of the 11th Amendment is not always determined by reference to the nominal parties on the record. Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270, 287.","The Acting Decision cites Poindexter v. Greenhow as establishing settled doctrine regarding the 11th Amendment analysis, referencing it as authority without criticism or negative treatment."
92059,91371,Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad,Mentioned,"The grounds of this jurisdiction were stated in Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 114 U.S. 311. The vital principle in all such cases is that the defendants, though professing to act as officers of the State, are threatening a violation of the personal or property rights of the complainant, for which they are personally and individually liable.","The Acting Decision references Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad as establishing the grounds for jurisdiction in cases involving state officers, citing it as supportive authority without negative treatment."
92059,88673,Davis v. Gray,Mentioned,"And the point as involved in that case was stated by Mr. Justice Swayne, delivering the opinion of the court in Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 220, as follows: In deciding who are parties to the suit the court will not look beyond the record.","The Acting Decision cites Davis v. Gray to explain the principle about determining parties to a suit, referencing it as authority for a legal principle without criticism."
92059,87371,"Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON, GOVERNOR, &C.",Mentioned,"This view was reiterated by this court in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 98, where it was said to be settled, that where the State is a party, plaintiff or defendant, the Governor represents the State, and the suit may be, in form, a suit by him as Governor in behalf of the State, where the State is plaintiff, and he must be summoned or notified as the officer representing the State, where the State is defendant.","The Acting Decision cites Kentucky v. Dennison as reiterating established principles about state representation in suits, using it as supportive authority without negative treatment."
92059,91583,Hagood v. Southern,Mentioned,"The converse of that case is to be found in Hagood v. Southern, 117 U.S. 52. There, the State of South Carolina, which was the party in interest, was not nominally a defendant... The decrees of the Circuit Court granting the relief were reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to dismiss the bills, on the ground that the suits, though nominally against the officers of the State, were really against the State itself.","The Acting Decision cites Hagood v. Southern as a precedent that supports its analysis of when suits against state officers are actually suits against the state, using it as supportive authority."
92059,90667,United States v. Lee,Mentioned,"This principle is illustrated and enforced by the case of United States v. Lee, 106 U.S. 196. In that case the plaintiffs had been wrongfully dispossessed of their real estate by defendants, claiming to act under the authority of the United States.","The Acting Decision cites United States v. Lee as illustrating and enforcing the principle that defendants claiming governmental authority must show lawful authority, using it as supportive precedent."
92059,85451,Osborn v. Bank of United States,Distinguished,"But what was said by Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, supra, must be taken in connection with its immediate context... There is nothing, therefore, in the judgment in that cause, as finally defined, which extends its authority beyond the prevention and restraint of the specific act done in pursuance of the unconstitutional statute of Ohio, and in violation of the act of Congress chartering the bank, which consisted of the unlawful seizure and detention of its property.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Osborn v. Bank of United States by limiting its scope and explaining how the present case differs factually, noting that Osborn involved specific property seizure while the current case involves different circumstances."
99901,89506,Doyle v. Continental Insurance Co.,Overruled,"It follows that the cases of Doyle v. Continental Insurance Co., 94 U. S. 535 , and Security Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Prewitt, 202 U. S. 246 , must be considered as overruled and that the views of the minority judges in those cases have become the law of this court.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Doyle v. Continental Insurance Co. must be considered as overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value."
99901,96471,Security Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Prewitt,Overruled,"It follows that the cases of Doyle v. Continental Insurance Co., 94 U. S. 535 , and Security Mutual Life Insurance Co. v.

S. 1, 7 .","The case is cited merely as procedural authority for how to consider averments in a bill that are not denied by the answer, without any substantive discussion or treatment."
99901,88953,Insurance Co. v. Morse,Mentioned,"The cases in. this court in which the conflict between the power of a State to exclude a foreign corporation from doing business within its borders, and the federal constitutional right of such foreign corporation to resort to the federal courts has been considered, can not be reconciled. They began with Insurance Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445","The case is mentioned as the beginning of a line of cases addressing the conflict between state power and federal constitutional rights, but without specific analysis or treatment of its holding."
99901,91911,Barron v. Burnside,Mentioned,"They began with Insurance Co. v. Morse, 20 Wall. 445 , which was followed by Doyle v. Continental Insurance Co., 94 U. S. 535 ; Barron v. Burnside, 121 U. S. 186","The case is listed as part of a series of cases in the line of precedent addressing the conflict between state power and federal rights, but without specific discussion of its holding or reasoning."

S. 318","The case is listed as part of a series of cases in the line of precedent addressing the conflict between state power and federal rights, but without specific discussion of its holding or reasoning."

S. 329","The case is listed as part of a series of cases in the line of precedent addressing the conflict between state power and federal rights, but without specific discussion of its holding or reasoning."
99004,95042,Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway Co. v. Smith,Overruled,"The views therein expressed which are inconsistent with the right of the States to fix reasonable commutation fares when the carrier has itself established fares for such service, must be regarded as overruled by the decision in this case.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that the views in Lake Shore that are inconsistent with state authority to fix reasonable commutation fares must be regarded as overruled by this decision.
99004,3485674,Penna. R.R. Co. v. Public Ser. Com.,Mentioned,"on appeal the Court of Appeals of Maryland affirmed the decree and held that although the order fixing the rates declared the same to be in force for ten years, there should be reserved to the railroad company the right to apply to the Commission after the lapse of a reasonable time for a rescission or modification of its order if experience demonstrated that the revenue derived under the tariff as established by the Commission was not properly compensatory for the services performed. 126 Maryland, 59.",The Acting Decision merely references the lower court's holding without any critical analysis or treatment that would affect its precedential value.
99004,93379,Interstate Com. Commiss. v. B. & O. RAILROAD,Mentioned,"In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 145 U. S. 263, this court held that a 'party rate ticket' for the transportation of ten or more persons at a less rate than that charged a single individual did not make a discrimination against an individual charged more for the same service, or amount to an unjust or unreasonable discrimination within the meaning of the Act to Regulate Commerce.","The Acting Decision cites this case favorably to support the principle that reduced rates for special services do not constitute discrimination, using it as supportive authority without criticism."
99004,98392,"Norfolk and Western Railway Company v. Conley, Attorney General of the State of West Virginia",Mentioned,"In Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. West Virginia, 236 U. S. 605, 608, after making reference to Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, 236 U. S. 585, this court said: 'It was recognized [in the North Dakota Case] that the State has a broad field for the exercise .of its discretion in prescribing reasonable rates for common carriers within its jurisdiction; that it is not necessary that there should be uniform rates or the same percentage of profit on every sort of business; and that there is abundant room for reasonable classification and the adaptation of rates to various groups of services.'",The Acting Decision cites this case approvingly to support the principle that states have broad discretion in prescribing reasonable rates and classifications for different services.

Texas & Pacific Railway Co.,Overruled,We think that the Fried-lander case should be overruled so far as it supports such an exception and that the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.,The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Friedlander case should be overruled to the extent it supports the exception that employers are not liable for fraudulent acts of agents done for the agent's own benefit.
101368,4920593,Roy & Roy v. Northern Pacific Railway Co.,Mentioned,"To this extent the case has been often cited and followed. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Nat.

101368,5712559,Planters' Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants' National Bank,Mentioned,"The state courts, including those of Georgia where the cause of action arose, have very generally reached the opposite conclusion, holding that the liability of the principal for the false statement or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope of his authority is unaffected by his secret purpose or motives.

McGuire",Mentioned,"More than twenty-five years ago we set forth the applicable principle in these words, after referring to the cases where the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment had been broadly described: 'But it was recognized in the cases cited, as in many others, that freedom of contract is a qualified and not an absolute right.'","The Acting Decision cites McGuire as establishing the foundational principle that freedom of contract is qualified and not absolute, using it as supportive precedent."

102164,3568583,Reno Smelting Works v. Stevenson,Mentioned,"It was in virtue of this maxim of the common law that the supreme court of Nevada, in Reno Smelting Works v. Stevenson, 20 Nev. 269 ; 21 Pac. 317 , in a well reasoned opinion, held that the common law doctrine of riparian rights was unsuited to conditions prevailing in -the arid land states and territories of the west, and therefore was without force in Nevada; and that, in respect of the use of water, the applicable rule was based upon the doctrine of prior appropriation for a beneficial use.","The court cites this case as a positive example of how courts can modify common law rules when they become unsuited to changed conditions, supporting the court's own reasoning about the flexibility of common law."
102164,93442,Benson v. United States,Mentioned,"Petitioner contends that these cases, if not directly contrary to the decisions in Benson v. United States, 146 U.S. 325 , and Rosen v. United States, 245 U.S. 467 , are so in principle.","The court discusses the Benson case extensively as supporting precedent for the principle that courts can modify common law rules based on changed conditions and modern reasoning, without any negative treatment."

United States,Mentioned,"In the Logan case it was held that the competency of a witness to testify in a federal court sitting in one state, was not affected by his conviction and sentence for felony in another state; and that the competency of another witness was not affected by his conviction of felony in a Texas state court, where the witness had since been pardoned.","The court discusses the Logan case as part of its analysis of prior precedent regarding witness competency rules, describing its holding without criticism or negative treatment."
102164,86700,United States v. Reid,Criticized,"After saying that while the decision in the Reid case had not been specifically overruled, its authority was seriously shaken by the decisions in both the Logan and Benson cases, the court proceeded to dispose of the question, as it had been disposed ofin the Benson case, ' in the light of general authority and sound reason.'","The court explicitly states that the Reid case's authority was 'seriously shaken' and indicates that later cases rejected its approach in favor of more modern reasoning, showing disagreement with its methodology."
102164,91054,Hurtado v. California,Mentioned,"In Hurtado v. California., 110 U.S. 516, 530 , this court, after suggesting that it was better not to go too far back into antiquity for the best securities of our liberties, said: ' It is more consonant to the true philosophy of our historical legal institutions to say that the spirit of personal liberty and individual right, which they embodied, was preserved and developed by a progressive growth and wise adaptation to new circumstances and situations of the forms and processes found fit to give, from time to time, new expression and greater effect to modem ideas of self-government. '","The court cites Hurtado favorably to support its argument about the adaptability of legal institutions to changing circumstances, using it as positive authority for the principle of legal evolution."

United States, 281 U.S. 276, 306 .","The court cites Patton to support the principle that public policy can change over time, using it as authority for the proposition that legal rules should adapt to changing conditions."
102164,97335,Hendrix v. United States,Overruled,"Both thé Hendrix and Jin Fuey Moy cases are out of harmony with the Rosen and Benson cases and with the views which we have here expressed. In respect , of the question here under review, both are now) overruled.","The court explicitly states that the Hendrix case is 'overruled' because it is out of harmony with the court's current views on witness competency, directly nullifying its precedential value."
102164,99065,Rosen v. United States,Mentioned,"Petitioner contends that these cases, if not directly contrary to the decisions in Benson v. United States, 146 U.S. 325 , and Rosen v.

E. 260 ), held that the entire movement of the gas was interstate commerce and that, in the absence of contrary regulation by the Congress, the state commission had jurisdiction to prescribe such rates.","The Acting Decision references this state court decision as background information to explain the procedural history and findings that led to the Supreme Court's decision in Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission (1920), without any negative treatment."

Public Service Commission (1920),Limited,"But, however that may be, the opinion in that case must be disapproved to the extent that it is in conflict with our decision here.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Pennsylvania Gas Co. opinion must be disapproved to the extent it conflicts with the current decision, thereby limiting its precedential scope and applicability."
101750,101295,Sprout v. South Bend,Mentioned,"And, while a State may require payment of an occupation tax by one engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce, the exaction in order to be valid must be imposed solely on account of the intrastate business without enhancement because of the interstate business done, and it must appear that one engaged exclusively in interstate business would not be subject to the imposition and that the taxpayer could discontinue the intrastate business without withdrawing also from the interstate business. Sprout v. South Bend, 277 U. S. 163, 170-171 , and cases cited.","The Acting Decision cites Sprout v. South Bend as established authority for the legal principle regarding valid state occupation taxes on businesses engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce, without any negative treatment."

Attleboro Co., 273 U. S. 83, 89 .",The Acting Decision cites Public Util. Comm. v.

103012,101265,Black & White Taxicab & Transfer Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab & Transfer Co.,Criticized,"Criticism of the doctrine became widespread after the decision of Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co., 276 U. S. 518. There, Brown and Yellow, a Kentucky corporation owned by Kentuckians, and the Louisville and Nashville Railroad, also a Kentucky corporation, wished that the former should have the exclusive privilege of soliciting passenger and baggage transportation at the Bowling Green, Kentucky, railroad station; and that the Black and White, a competing Kentucky corporation, should be prevented from interfering with that privilege. Knowing that such a contract would be void under the common law of Kentucky, it was arranged that the Brown and Yellow reincorporate under the law of Tennessee, and that the contract with the railroad should be executed there.","The Acting Decision uses the Black & White Taxicab case as an example of the problematic consequences of the Swift v. Tyson doctrine, criticizing how it allowed manipulation of jurisdiction to avoid unfavorable state law."
103012,93638,Baltimore & Ohio Railroad v. Baugh,Mentioned,"As stated by Mr. Justice Field when protesting in Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U.

Tyson doctrine, but does not criticize the Baugh decision itself, merely using it as supportive authority."
103012,4088490,Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. R.,Mentioned,"The defendant contended that by the common law of Pennsylvania as declared by its highest court in Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R.

103012,86188,Swift v. Tyson,Overruled,The question for decision is whether the oft-challenged doctrine of Swift v. Tyson shall now be disapproved... In disapproving that doctrine we do not hold unconstitutional § 34 of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789 or any other Act of Congress. We merely declare that in applying the doctrine this Court and the lower courts have invaded rights which in our opinion are reserved by the Constitution to the several States.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that it is disapproving the doctrine of Swift v. Tyson and declares that the Court's application of this doctrine was unconstitutional, thereby overruling the precedent established in Swift v. Tyson."
103172,88308,Collector v. Day,Overruled,"Collector v. Day, supra, and New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, are overruled so far as they recognize an implied constitutional immunity from income taxation of the salaries of officers or employees of the national or a state government or their instrumentalities.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Collector v. Day is overruled regarding its recognition of constitutional immunity from income taxation of government employee salaries.
103172,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt,Mentioned,"In applying these controlling principles in the Gerhardt case the Court held that the salaries of employees of the New York Port Authority, a state instrumentality created by New York and New Jersey, were not immune from federal income tax, even though the Authority be regarded as not subject to federal taxation.","The Acting Decision relies on and applies the principles established in Helvering v. Gerhardt without criticizing or questioning its precedential value, using it as controlling authority."

103172,100771,Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell,Mentioned,"That assumption, made in Collector v. Day, supra, and in New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, is contrary to the reasoning and to the conclusions reached in the Gerhardt case and in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra","The Acting Decision favorably cites Metcalf & Eddy v.

103172,86223,Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County,Overruled,"Neither Dobbins v. Commissioners, 16 Pet. 435, and its offspring, nor Collector v. Day, supra, and its, can stand appeal to the Constitution and its historic purposes. Since both are the starting points of an interdependent doctrine, both should be, as I assume them to be, overruled this day.","The concurring opinion explicitly states that Dobbins v. Commissioners should be overruled, and the lead opinion's overruling of the immunity doctrine necessarily encompasses this case as well."
103172,102783,Brush v. Commissioner,Overruled,"From the decision just announced, it is clear that the Court has overruled Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County (1842) 16 Pet. 435; Collector v. Day (1871) 11 Wall. 113; New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, and Brush v. Commissioner (1937) 300 U. S. 352.","The dissenting opinion explicitly identifies Brush v.

Graham cannot survive to the extent it is inconsistent with the current ruling, which constitutes an express nullification of parts of that precedent."

Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431 , that 'the power to tax involves the power to destroy.'","The Acting Decision references M'Culloch v. Maryland only to quote Chief Justice Marshall's famous principle about taxation, without any criticism or negative treatment of the decision itself."
103214,99610,Evans v. Gore,Overruled,"By means of § 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932, Congress sought to avoid, at least in part, the consequences of Evans v. Gore, 253 U. S. 245","The Acting Decision explains that Congress enacted legislation specifically to avoid the consequences of Evans v. Gore, and the court's ruling upholding that legislation effectively nullifies the precedential value of Evans v. Gore regarding judicial salary taxation."
103290,102529,Colgate v. Harvey,Overruled,"In view of our conclusions, we look upon the decision in that case as repugnant to the line of reasoning adopted here. As a consequence, Colgate v.

103290,88661,Butchers' Benevolent Ass'n v. Crescent City Live-Stock Landing & Slaughter-House Co.,Mentioned,This Court declared in the Slaughter-House Cases that the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Thirteenth and Fifteenth were adopted to protect the negroes in their freedom. This almost contemporaneous interpretation extended the benefits of the privileges and immunities clause to other rights which are inherent in national citizenship but denied it to those which spring from state citizenship.,The Acting Decision references the Slaughter-House Cases to explain the historical interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment and privileges and immunities clause without criticizing or questioning its precedential value.

103290,103226,Haguer v.

103198,97661,Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States,Criticized,"In translating these important objectives for effectuating the Congressional scheme to enlarge the independent powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission into a seemingly technical distinction between 'negative' and 'affirmative' orders, the opinion in Procter & Gamble v. United States gave authority to a doctrine which harmonizes neither with the considerations which induced it nor with the course of decisions which have purported to follow it.",The Acting Decision directly criticizes the Procter & Gamble decision for creating a technical distinction between 'negative' and 'affirmative' orders that does not align with the underlying considerations or subsequent case law.
103198,101973,Alton Railroad v. United States,Mentioned,"Thus, the Court has had occasion to find that while an order was 'negative in form' it was 'affirmative in substance.'","The Acting Decision references the Alton Railroad case as an example of how courts have found orders to be 'affirmative in substance' despite being 'negative in form,' without criticizing or questioning the decision itself."
103198,102669,United States v. Corrick,Mentioned,"Under United States v. Corrick, 298 U. S. 435, 440, and United States v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 226, 229, the doctrine of 'negative orders' implies a jurisdictional defect which courts must consider sua sponte.","The Acting Decision cites Corrick as establishing that the negative orders doctrine creates a jurisdictional defect that courts must consider on their own motion, without any negative treatment of the decision."
103198,101012,United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad,Mentioned,The governing considerations which keep such orders without the area of judicial review were thus summarized for the Court by Mr. Justice Brandeis in denying reviewability of a 'final valuation' under the Valuations Act,"The Acting Decision references this case as an example of orders that are not reviewable, quoting Justice Brandeis's summary of the governing considerations, without any criticism or negative treatment."
103198,96063,Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baird,Mentioned,"Since it asserted a legal right under that Act to have the Commission apply different principles of law from those which led the Commission to dismiss the complaint, the ingredients for an adjudication — constituting a case or controversy — were present. Compare Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Brimson, supra; Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Baird, 194 U. S. 25, 38.","The Acting Decision cites Baird as support for the proposition that certain ingredients constitute a case or controversy for adjudication purposes, without any negative treatment of the decision."
103198,98242,Intermountain Rate Cases,Mentioned,"Where a complainant seeks the Commission's authority under the terms of a statute and the Commission's action is followed by legal consequences, as was the case in Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. United States, 243 U. S. 412, or where the Commission's order denies an exemption from the terms of the statute, as in the Intermountain Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 476, the road to the courts' jurisdiction seems to be clear.","The Acting Decision references the Intermountain Rate Cases as an example where the path to court jurisdiction is clear when the Commission denies an exemption, without any criticism or negative treatment."
103198,102969,United States v. Griffin,Mentioned,"Under United States v. Corrick, 298 U. S. 435, 440, and United States v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 226, 229, the doctrine of 'negative orders' implies a jurisdictional defect which courts must consider sua sponte.","The Acting Decision cites Griffin alongside Corrick as establishing that the negative orders doctrine creates a jurisdictional defect that courts must consider on their own motion, without any negative treatment of the decision."
103292,102488,Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co.,Overruled,We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine — untenable because they drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept and to which we adhere.,"The Acting Decision explicitly rejects and overrules the distinctions made in the St. Louis Trust cases, finding them untenable and inconsistent with the Klein doctrine that should govern estate tax law."
103292,101723,Klein v. United States,Mentioned,"Freed from the distinctions, introduced by the St. Louis Trust cases, the Klein case furnishes such a harmonizing principle.","The Acting Decision affirms and relies on Klein as providing the correct harmonizing principle for estate tax law, treating it as the controlling precedent that should be followed."
103292,101780,McCormick v. Burnet,Mentioned,"McCormick v. Burnet followed May v. Heiner. The court there held that neither a reservation by the grantor of a life estate with remainders over, nor a provision for a reverter in case all the beneficiaries should die in the lifetime of the grantor, made the gifts transfers intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the grantor's death.","The Acting Decision references McCormick v. Burnet as part of the historical development of the legal doctrine, providing factual background without expressing disagreement with its holding."
103292,101552,May v. Heiner,Mentioned,"In May v. Heiner, supra, it was held that a transfer in trust under which the income was payable to the transferor's husband for his life and, after his death, to the transferor during her life, with remainder to her children, was not subject to tax as a transfer intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after death.","The Acting Decision discusses May v. Heiner as part of the historical development of estate tax doctrine, referencing it neutrally without criticism or endorsement."
103292,1477043,Commissioner v. Schwarz,Mentioned,"I have been able to find only one case decided contra: Commissioner v. Schwarz, 74 F. 2d 712.","The Acting Decision merely references Commissioner v. Schwarz as the only contrary case in a footnote within the dissenting opinion, without any substantive analysis or treatment."
103292,1474615,Commissioner v. Hallock,Mentioned,"The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the trust instrument had conveyed the 'whole interest' of the decedent, subject only to a 'condition subsequent,' which left him nothing 'except a mere possibility of reverter.' Commissioner v. Hallock, 102 F. 2d 1, 3-4.","The Acting Decision references the lower court's holding in Commissioner v. Hallock as part of the factual background of the case, without expressing agreement or disagreement with that court's reasoning."
103292,102489,Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co.,Overruled,We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine — untenable because they drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept and to which we adhere.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co. along with the other St. Louis Trust cases, rejecting the distinctions they made as untenable and inconsistent with the Klein doctrine."

S. 404, 436 , et seq.","The case is cited for reference to Justice Stone's dissenting opinion, without any discussion of the majority holding or any negative treatment of the case itself."
103557,86014,Mayor of New York v. Miln,Overruled,"City of New York v. Miln was decided in 1837. Whatever may have been the notion then prevailing, we do not think that it will now be seriously contended that because a person is without employment and without funds he constitutes a 'moral pestilence.' Poverty and immorality are not synonymous. I agree with what I understand to be the holding of the Court that cases which may indicate the contrary are overruled.","The Court explicitly states that the outdated notion from City of New York v. Miln that poor people constitute a 'moral pestilence' is no longer valid, and Justice Jackson agrees that cases indicating the contrary are overruled."
103505,101453,Sinclair v. United States,Mentioned,"It has been held that an act of misbehavior though covered by the latter provisions may also be a contempt if committed in the 'presence' of the Court. Savin, Petitioner, supra. And see Sinclair v. United States, 279 U. S. 749.","The Acting Decision merely references Sinclair as supporting authority for the proposition that certain acts can be both contempt and covered by other provisions, without any negative treatment or criticism."
103505,99206,Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States,Overruled,"But for the reasons stated that decision must be overruled... And they necessitate an adherence to the original construction of the statute so that, unless its requirements are clearly satisfied, an offense will be dealt with as the law deals with the run of illegal acts.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States 'must be overruled' and criticizes its broad interpretation of the contempt statute as inconsistent with Congressional intent.
103505,88890,Ex Parte Robinson,Mentioned,"And when .the Act came before this Court in Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 511 , Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the Court, acknowledgéd that it had limited the power of those courts.","The Acting Decision cites Ex parte Robinson as historical support for the view that the Act of 1831 limited contempt power, without any criticism or negative treatment of the decision itself."

103505,92543,Cuddy,Mentioned,"So far as the decisions of this Court are concerned, that view persisted to the time when Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, was decided. See Ex parte Wall, 107 U. S. 265 ; Savin, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 267, 276 ; Cuddy, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 280, 285 ; Eilenbecker v. District Court, 134 U.

103555,89712,Dial v. Reynolds,Mentioned,"We come, then, to the so-called 'relitigation' cases, the first of which is Dial v. Reynolds, 96 U. S. 340 . The facts of the case are simple... It held that the 'gravamen' of the bills was an injunction to prevent Reynolds from proceeding in the state court. 'Such an injunction, except under the Bankrupt Act, no court of the United States can grant. With this exception, it is expressly forbidden by law.'",The Acting Decision presents Dial v. Reynolds as the first of the 'relitigation' cases and quotes it approvingly to support the prohibition against federal injunctions staying state court proceedings.
103555,99752,Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble,Criticized,"The opinion of Mr. Justice Day contains no reference to either the Act of March 2, 1793, or to Dial v. Reynolds. The opinion is devoted almost entirely to a discussion of whether the former decree is res judicata in the state suits. Having determined this question in the affirmative, the Court disposed of the remaining — § 265 — question in one sentence, citing only one case in support of its conclusion, Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co., supra, which, as we have seen, was not a relitigation case.","The Acting Decision criticizes the Supreme Tribe case for failing to properly address Section 265 and for relying on an inapplicable precedent, suggesting the decision was inadequately reasoned."
103555,93714,Root v. Woolworth,Distinguished,"Root v. Woolworth, 150 U. S. 401 , is erroneously regarded as illustrating a 'relitigation' exception to § 265. The case holds merely that courts of equity have jurisdiction to 'effectuate their own decrees by injunctions or writs of assistance in order to avoid the relitigation of questions once settled between the same parties.' 150 U. S. at 411-12 . The Court did not uphold a federal injunction against a state suit to relitigate a claim already settled by a previous federal decree — no such state suit had been brought.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Root v. Woolworth by clarifying that it does not actually support a 'relitigation' exception to Section 265, as no state suit was involved in that case."
103555,95802,Prout v. Starr,Mentioned,"The 'first come, first served' rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537 , was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U.

Wheeler,Mentioned,"And the determination of the necessity for a given improvement of navigable capacity, and the character and extent of it, is for Congress alone.","The Acting Decision cites Scranton v. Wheeler as authority for the principle that Congress has sole authority to determine navigation improvements, without any negative treatment or criticism."
103493,97899,United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co.,Mentioned,"The power of Congress extends not only to keeping clear the channels of interstate navigation by the prohibition or removal of actual obstructions located by the riparian owner, or others, but comprehends as well the power to improve and enlarge their navigability.","The Acting Decision cites this case as supportive authority for the broad scope of Congressional power over navigation improvements, without any negative treatment."
103493,95793,United States v. Lynah,Limited,"And we think that, so far as it sanctions such a principle, it is in irreconcilable conflict with our later decisions and cannot be considered as expressing the law.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Lynah case, insofar as it requires compensation for injury to property in navigable stream beds, conflicts with later decisions and cannot be considered as expressing current law, thus limiting its precedential value."
103493,98902,United States v. Cress,Distinguished,"What was said in the Cress case must be confined to the facts there disclosed. In that case, the Government's improvement in a navigable stream resulted in the flooding of the plaintiff's land in and adjacent to a non-navigable stream.","The Acting Decision distinguishes the Cress case by confining its holding to its specific facts involving non-navigable streams, indicating it does not apply to the current case involving navigable waters."
103493,87748,Gilman v. Philadelphia,Mentioned,"For this purpose they are the public property of the nation, and subject to all the requisite legislation by Congress.","The Acting Decision cites Gilman v. Philadelphia as authority for the principle that navigable waters are public property subject to Congressional regulation, without any negative treatment."

United States,Mentioned,"Whether, under local law, the title to the bed of the stream is retained by the State or the title of the riparian owner extends to the thread of the stream, or, as in this case, to low-water mark, the rights of the title holder are subordinate to the dominant power of the federal Government in respect of navigation.","The Acting Decision cites Gibson v. United States as authority for the principle that riparian property rights are subordinate to federal navigation power, without any negative treatment."
103493,103413,United States v. Appalachian Electric Power Co.,Mentioned,"The power of Congress extends not only to keeping clear the channels of interstate navigation by the prohibition or removal of actual obstructions located by the riparian owner, or others, but comprehends as well the power to improve and enlarge their navigability.","The Acting Decision cites this case as supportive authority for the broad scope of Congressional power over navigation, without any negative treatment."

State of Georgia,Mentioned,"The bed of a river is 'that portion of its soil which is alternately covered and left bare, as there may be an increase or diminution in the supply of water, and which is adequate to contain it at its average and mean stage during the entire year, without reference to the extraordinary freshets of the winter or spring, or the extreme droughts of the summer or autumn.'","The Acting Decision cites this case for its definition of a river bed, using it as authoritative guidance without any negative treatment."
103493,98436,Greenleaf Johnson Lumber Co. v. Garrison,Mentioned,The exercise of the power within these limits is not an invasion of any private property right in such lands for which the United States must make compensation.,"The Acting Decision cites this case as authority supporting the principle that federal navigation power can be exercised without compensation for property in stream beds, without any negative treatment."
103493,98694,Willink v. United States,Mentioned,The exercise of the power within these limits is not an invasion of any private property right in such lands for which the United States must make compensation.,"The Acting Decision cites this case as authority supporting the principle that federal navigation improvements do not require compensation for affected property in stream beds, without any negative treatment."
103493,97900,Lewis Blue Point Oyster Cultivation Co. v. Briggs,Mentioned,"It is not true, as respondents maintain, that only structures in the bed of a navigable stream which obstruct or adversely affect navigation may be injured or destroyed without compensation by a federal improvement of navigable capacity.","The Acting Decision cites this case as authority for the principle that structures in navigable stream beds can be affected without compensation regardless of whether they obstruct navigation, without any negative treatment."
103522,101315,Ribnik v. McBride,Overruled,"The drift away from Ribnik v. McBride, supra, has been so great that it can no longer be deemed a controlling authority... The Bibnik case, freed from.the test which it employed, can no longer survive.","The Court explicitly states that Ribnik v. McBride can no longer be deemed controlling authority and cannot survive, effectively overruling its precedential value."
103522,100181,Adkins v. Children's Hospital,Mentioned,"In 1937 Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261 U. S. 525 , was overruled and a statute ofWashington which authorized the fixing of minimum wages for women and minors was sustained.",The Court merely mentions that Adkins was overruled by another case (West Coast Hotel) without itself taking any action against Adkins.
103522,101029,Tyson & Brother v. Banton,Criticized,"That test, labelled by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent in the Tyson case (273 U. S. at p. 446) as 'little more than a fiction,' was discarded in Nebbia v. New York... those notions of public policy embedded in earlier decisions of this Court but. which, as Mr. Justice Holmes long admonished, should not be read into the Constitution.","The Court criticizes the test employed in Tyson & Brother v. Banton, calling it a 'fiction' and stating that its notions of public policy should not be read into the Constitution."
103522,101356,Williams v. Standard Oil Co.,Mentioned,"In the fol-lpwing year this Court held that Tennessee had no power to fix prices at which gasoline might be sold in the state. Williams v. Standard Oil Co., 278 U. S. 235 .",The Court simply mentions Williams v. Standard Oil Co. as an example of a decision limiting price-fixing powers without criticizing or distinguishing it.
103522,102681,Morehead v. New York Ex Rel. Tipaldo,Mentioned,"Save for that decision and Morehead v. Tipaldo, 298 U. S. 587 , holding unconstitutional a New York statute authorizing the fixing of women's wages, the subsequent cases in this Court haye given increasingly wider scope to the price-fixing powers of the states and of Congress.","The Court mentions Morehead as one of the few decisions that limited price-fixing powers, but does not criticize or distinguish it directly."
103522,101511,Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States,Mentioned,"Tagg Bros. v. United States, 280 U. S. 420 , decidedv,in 1930, upheld the power of the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act to determine the just and reasonable charges of persons engaged in the business of buying and selling in interstate commerce livestock at a stockyard on a commission basis.","The Court mentions Tagg Bros. as a positive example of a case that upheld price-fixing powers, supporting the trend away from Ribnik."

Co.",Mentioned,"In 1931 a New Jersey statute limiting commissions of agents- of fire insurance companies was sustained by O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U.

S. at p. 446) as 'little more than a fiction,' was discarded in Nebbia v.

S. 510, 514",The Acting Decision cites Seven Cases as precedent supporting that Congress's commerce power can overlap with traditional state police powers without constitutional objection.
103442,99412,United States v. Ferger,Mentioned,"It extends to those activities intrastate which so affect interstate commerce or the exercise of the power of Congress over it as to make regulation of them appropriate means to the attainment of a legitimate end, the exercise of the granted power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 . Cf. United States v. Ferger, 250 U. S. 199",The Acting Decision cites United States v. Ferger as supportive precedent for Congress's power to regulate intrastate activities that affect interstate commerce.
103442,100469,James Everard's Breweries v. Day,Mentioned,"Such legislation has often been sustained with respect to powers, other than the commerce power granted to the national government, when the means chosen, although not themselves within the granted power, were nevertheless deemed appropriate aids to the accomplishment of some purpose within an admitted power of the national government. See Jacob Ruppert, Inc. v. Caffey, 251 U. S. 264 ; Everard's Breweries v. Day, 265 U. S. 545, 560",The Acting Decision cites Everard's Breweries as precedent supporting Congress's ability to use means that aid in accomplishing purposes within its granted powers.
103442,98232,"Houston, East & West Texas Railway Co. v. United States",Mentioned,"A familiar like exercise of power is the regulation of intrastate transactions which are so commingled with or related to interstate commerce that all must be regulated if the interstate commerce is to be effectively controlled. Shreveport Case, 234 U. S. 342","The Acting Decision cites the Shreveport Case (Houston, East & West Texas Railway) as precedent for regulating intrastate transactions that are commingled with interstate commerce."
103442,99906,"Wisconsin RR Comm. v. C., B. & QRR CO.",Mentioned,"A familiar like exercise of power is the regulation of intrastate transactions which are so commingled with or related to interstate commerce that all must be regulated if the interstate commerce is to be effectively controlled. Shreveport Case, 234 U. S. 342 ; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563",The Acting Decision cites this case as supportive precedent for Congress's power to regulate intrastate transactions that are related to interstate commerce.
103442,102204,"Local 167, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States",Mentioned,"The Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act are familiar examples of the exertion of the commerce power to prohibit or control activities wholly intrastate because of their effect on interstate commerce. See as to the Sherman Act, Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197 ; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U. S. 375 ; United States v. Patten, 226 U. S. 525 ; United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U. S. 344 ; Local No. 167 v. United States, 291 U. S. 293",The Acting Decision cites Local 167 as an example of the Sherman Act being used to control intrastate activities that affect interstate commerce.
103442,97451,Balt. & Ohio RR v. Int. Com. Comm.,Mentioned,"The requirement for records even of the intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to the legitimate end. See Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 221 U. S. 612",The Acting Decision cites Baltimore & Ohio as precedent supporting Congress's power to require record-keeping as a means of enforcing valid commerce regulations.
103442,100188,Board of Trade of Chicago v. Olsen,Mentioned,"The requirement for records even of the intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to the legitimate end. See Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 221 U. S. 612 ; Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Goodrich Transit Co., 224 U. S. 194 ; Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, 262 U. S. 1, 42",The Acting Decision cites Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen as supportive precedent for Congress's power to require record-keeping in connection with commerce regulation.
103442,2621060,Bunting v. Oregon,Mentioned,"Nor is it any longer open to question that it is within the legislative power to fix maximum hours. Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366 ; Muller v. Oregon, 208 U. S. 412 ; Bunting v. Oregon, 243 U. S. 426",The Acting Decision cites Bunting v. Oregon as precedent establishing that fixing maximum hours is within legislative power and constitutional.
103442,99190,Hammer v. Dagenhart,Overruled,"The conclusion is inescapable that Hammer v. Dagenhart , was a departure from the principles which have prevailed in the interpretation of the Commerce Clause both before and since the decision and that such vitality, as a precedent, as it then had has long since been exhausted. It should be and now is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Hammer v. Dagenhart should be and now is overruled, finding it inconsistent with established Commerce Clause principles."
103639,2620693,Bullen v. Wisconsin,Mentioned,"But the contention that the due process clause forecloses taxation of an interest in intangibles by the state of its owner when they are held in trust in another state was rejected in Bullen v. Wisconsin, 240 U. S. 625. In that case, a fund had been given in trust reserving to the donor a general power of revocation and the disposition of the trust income during life. This Court held that upon his death an inheritance tax could be levied by the state of his domicile although the trustee and the trust fund were outside the state.","The Acting Decision cites Bullen v. Wisconsin favorably as precedent supporting the principle that intangibles can be taxed at the owner's domicile even when held in trust elsewhere, without criticizing or limiting its holding."
103639,103220,Graves v. Elliott,Mentioned,"His transfer of interests in intangibles, by virtue of the exercise of a donated power instead of that derived from ownership, stands on the same footing. In both cases the sovereign's control over his person and estate at the place of his domicile, and his duty to contribute to the financial support of government there, afford adequate constitutional basis for the imposition of a tax. Curry v. McCanless, 307 U. S. 357; cf. Graves v. Elliott, 307 U. S. 383.","The Acting Decision references Graves v. Elliott as supporting authority for the constitutional basis of taxation at domicile, using it to reinforce the court's reasoning without any negative treatment."
103639,100955,Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton,Overruled,"The conclusion there reached and the reasons advanced in its support cannot be reconciled with the decision and the reasoning of the Bullen, the McCanless and the Elliott cases. It is plain that if appropriate emphasis be placed on-the orderly administration of justice rather than blind adherence to conflicting precedents, the Wachovia case must be overruled... The Wachovia case should be and now is overruled and the constitutional power of New York to levy the present tax is sustained.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Wachovia case 'must be overruled' and 'should be and now is overruled,' directly nullifying its precedential value due to irreconcilable conflicts with other established precedents."
103639,103219,Curry v. McCanless,Mentioned,"His transfer of interests in intangibles, by virtue of the exercise of a donated power instead of that derived from ownership, stands on the same footing.

Curry v. McCanless, 307 U. S. 357; cf. Graves v. Elliott, 307 U. S. 383.","The Acting Decision cites Curry v. McCanless as supporting precedent for the constitutional authority to tax at domicile, reinforcing the court's reasoning without any criticism or limitation."

Gilman as supporting precedent for the principle that interests in intangibles are taxable at the owner's domicile, referencing it favorably without criticism."

Saltonstall,Mentioned,"And such interests taxable at the domicile of the owner have been deemed to include the exercise or relinquishment of a power to dispose of intangibles. Chanler v. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466; Bullen v. Wisconsin, supra; cf. Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260.","The Acting Decision references Saltonstall v. Saltonstall as precedent supporting the taxation of powers to dispose of intangibles at domicile, citing it as favorable authority without any negative treatment."
103639,101277,Blodgett v. Silberman,Mentioned,"A transfer in one state of a chose in action or a share of stock may be taxed there even though the transferee in order to enjoy its benefits must depend in part upon the law of the state of the debtor or of the corporation. Blodgett v. Silberman, 277 U. S. 1, 10-17.","The Acting Decision cites Blodgett v. Silberman as precedent supporting the principle that transfers can be taxed in one state even when the transferee must rely on another state's law, using it as favorable authority."
103831,103705,Jones v. Opelika,Overruled,"The judgment in Jones v. Opelika has this day been vacated. Freed from that controlling precedent, we can restore to their high, constitutional position the liberties of itinerant evangelists who disseminate their religious beliefs and the tenets of their faith through distribution of literature.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the judgment in Jones v. Opelika has been vacated and refers to being freed from that controlling precedent, indicating that Jones v. Opelika has been overruled."
103831,103355,Cantwell v. Connecticut,Mentioned,"Furthermore, the present ordinance is not narrowly drawn to safeguard the people of the community in their homes against the evils of solicitations. See Cantwell v. Connecticut, supra, 306.","The Acting Decision merely cites Cantwell v. Connecticut as a reference point for comparison regarding narrowly drawn ordinances, without any criticism or negative treatment of the decision itself."
103831,103601,Grosjean v. American Press Co.,Mentioned,"The taxes imposed by this ordinance can hardly help but be as severe and telling in their impact on the freedom of the press and religion as the 'taxes on knowledge' at which the First Amendment was partly aimed. Grosjean v. American Press Co., supra, pp. 244-249.","The Acting Decision references Grosjean v. American Press Co. to support its argument about taxes on knowledge and their impact on First Amendment freedoms, using it as supportive precedent without any negative treatment."
103831,101773,Near v. Minnesota Ex Rel. Olson,Mentioned,"We do not mean to say that religious groups and the press are free from all financial burdens of government. See Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233, 250.","Near v. Minnesota is not actually discussed or cited in the provided text of the Acting Decision. The citation appears to be incorrectly identified in the metadata, as the text only references Grosjean v. American Press Co. in this context."
103736,96454,Haddock v. Haddock,Overruled,"But we do not think it was. The Haddock case involved a suit for separation and alimony, brought in New York by the wife on personal service of the husband. The husband pleaded in defense a divorce decree obtained by him in Connecticut where he had established a separate domicil. This Court held that New York, the matrimonial domicil where the wife still resided, need not give full faith and credit to the Connecticut decree, since it was obtained by the husband who wrongfully left his wife in the matrimonial domicil, service on her having been obtained by publication and she not having entered an appearance in the action. But we do not agree with the theory of the Haddock case... Haddock v. Haddock is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that it does not agree with the theory of the Haddock case and expressly declares 'Haddock v. Haddock is overruled,' thereby nullifying its precedential value."
103736,95457,Atherton v. Atherton,Mentioned,Atherton v. Atherton held that full faith and credit must be given a decree of divorce granted by the state of the matrimonial domicil on constructive service against the other spouse who was a non-resident of that state.,"The Acting Decision references Atherton v. Atherton to explain existing precedent regarding full faith and credit for divorce decrees, without criticizing or questioning its validity."
103736,87830,Christmas v. Russell,Mentioned,"It does not purport to challenge or disturb the rule, earlier established by Christmas v. Russell, supra, and subsequently fortified by Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra, that, even though the cause of action could not have been entertained in the state of the forum, a judgment obtained thereon in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit.","The Acting Decision cites Christmas v. Russell as establishing a rule that supports its reasoning, referencing it positively without any negative treatment."
103736,95458,Bell v. Bell,Distinguished,"But there are two reasons why we do not reach that issue in this case... Moreover it admits that there probably is enough evidence in the record to require that petitioners be considered 'to have been actually domiciled in Nevada.'... If the case had been tried and submitted on that issue only, we would have quite a different problem, as Bell v. Bell indicates.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Bell v. Bell by noting that the current case presents different factual circumstances regarding domicile, indicating that Bell v. Bell would apply in different situations but not the present case."
103736,102404,Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n of Cal.,Mentioned,"This Court, to be sure, has recognized that in case of statutes, 'the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed,' some 'accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states' is necessary. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 294 U. S. 532, 547.","The Acting Decision cites Alaska Packers to explain a principle about accommodating conflicting state interests, using it as supportive authority without any negative treatment."

These decisions refuse to require courts of one state to allow acts or judgments of another to control the disposition or devolution of realty in the former.","The Acting Decision mentions Hood v. McGehee as part of a group of cases that establish exceptions to the full faith and credit rule regarding real property, citing it neutrally as existing precedent."
103736,102412,Broderick v. Rosner,Mentioned,"But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandéis in Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642 , 'the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one.'","The Acting Decision quotes Broderick v. Rosner to support its argument about the limited exceptions to the full faith and credit clause, using it as supportive authority."
103736,97084,Fall v. Eastin,Mentioned,"Fall v. Eastin, 215 U. S. 1 ; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U. S. 386 ; Hood v. McGehee, 237 U. S. 611 .

Lum as fortifying the rule established in Christmas v. Russell, referencing it positively as supportive precedent."
103736,103417,Milliken v. Meyer,Mentioned,"There is no constitutional barrier if the form and nature of the substituted service (see Milliken v. Meyer, supra, p. 463 ) meet the requirements of due process.","The Acting Decision references Milliken v. Meyer regarding due process requirements for substituted service, citing it as established authority without any negative treatment."
103761,101495,Johnson v. United States Shipping Bd. Emergency Fleet Corporation,Limited,"Our conclusion, however, is that that position is untenable and that the Lustgarten case so far as it would prevent a private operator from being sued under the circumstances of this case must be considered as no longei controlling.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Lustgarten case (a companion case to Johnson) is no longer controlling insofar as it would prevent suits against private operators, thus limiting the scope of the Johnson decision."
103761,102049,Vancouver Steamship Co. v. Rice,Mentioned,"We agree with the court below that this was a maritime tort over which the admiralty court has jurisdiction. Vancouver S. S. Co. v. Rice, 288 U. S. 445","The decision is cited merely to support the proposition that admiralty courts have jurisdiction over maritime torts, without any critical analysis or limitation of its holding."

103761,100968,Eastern Transportation Co. v.

Johnson v. Emergency Fleet Corp., supra. The sole question here is whether the Suits in Admiralty Act makes private operators such as respondent non-suable for their torts. Eastern Transportation Co. v. United States, 272 U. S. 675","The decision is cited to support the established principle that suits in admiralty under the Act are the exclusive remedy against the United States, without any critical treatment."

Rosenberg Brothers & Co.,Mentioned,"Moreover, if all suits to enforce maritime causes of action must be brought in such cases under § 2 of the Act the short statute of limitations of two years contained in § 5 is applicable. Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Rosenberg Bros. & Co., supra.","The decision is cited to establish that the two-year statute of limitations applies under the Suits in Admiralty Act, without any criticism or limitation of its holding."

103761,102452,Federal Land Bank v. Priddy,Mentioned,"That it had the power to grant or withhold immunity from suit on behalf of governmental corporations is plain. Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, 295 U.

103761,103284,Yearsley v. W. A. Ross Construction Co.,Distinguished,But here the situation is quite different. The question is not whether the Commission had authority to delegate to respondent responsibilities for managing and operating the vessel as its agent.

Hitchcock,Mentioned,"Furthermore, if the United States were to become the real party in interest by reason of a contract for exoneration or indemnity, a basic alteration in that concept (Minnesota v.

Natural Gas Pipeline Co., supra, that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of for-mulae in determining rates. Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of 'pragmatic adjustments.' Id., p. 586. And when the Commission's order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order 'viewed in its entirety' meets the requirements of the Act.",The Acting Decision cites the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. case to support its holding that the Commission has flexibility in rate-making methodology and that courts should evaluate orders holistically rather than focusing on specific formulas.
103915,101364,United Fuel Gas Co. v.

103915,102270,Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission,Mentioned,"The incongruity between the actual operations and the return computed on the basis of reproduction cost suggests that the Commission was wholly justified in rejecting the latter as the measure of the rate base.

S. 725, upon a petition which urged that the statement quoted from The Pinar Del Rio, supra, does not rule this case, and that the decision below is inconsistent with the decisions in The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158, and in Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, 305 U. S. 424.","The Acting Decision cites Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith as supporting precedent that is inconsistent with the lower court's decision, using it as authority for its position."
103927,101292,"Plamals v. S. S. ""Pinar Del Rio""",Overruled,"So far as this statement supports these assumptions, it is disapproved. We cannot follow it, and also follow The Osceola, supra, the cases which it approved and Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra.","The Acting Decision explicitly disapproves and refuses to follow The Pinar Del Rio decision, stating it cannot follow both that case and established precedent, effectively overruling it."
103927,102648,The Arizona v. Anelich,Mentioned,"Whether petitioner knew of the defective condition of the rope does not appear, but in any case the seaman, in the performance of his duties, is not deemed to assume the risk of unseaworthy appliances. The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 123-124.","The Acting Decision cites The Arizona v. Anelich as supporting authority for the principle that seamen do not assume the risk of unseaworthy appliances, using it to support its holding."

S. 705, 719","The Acting Decision merely references the Seber case to support a point about the purpose of the 1933 Act, without any negative treatment or criticism of the decision."

Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U. S. 575","The Acting Decision cites Shaw to establish that certain land was taxable, using it as precedent without any negative treatment."
103869,103192,United States Trust Co. v. Helvering,Mentioned,"The State argues that congressional exemption of the land from direct state taxation does not exempt the land from an estate tax, because of the principles announced in United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, supra.","The Acting Decision references the principles from this case but ultimately distinguishes it, stating that 'A majority of the Court concludes that this principle does not apply to Indian lands specifically exempted from direct taxation.'"
103869,97425,Tiger v. Western Investment Co.,Mentioned,"Such power exists to prevent impairment of the manner in, or means by which Congress effectuates its Indian policy, at least so long as Congress has not determined that the interests of the Indians require their complete release from tutelage or the final termination of the United States' guardianship over them.

S. 286, 315-16","The Acting Decision cites Tiger in the dissenting opinion to support the argument about Congress's plenary power over Indians, without negative treatment."
103869,102986,Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp.,Mentioned,"Childers v. Beaver, supra, was in effect overruled by the Mountain Producers decision.

103869,95792,United States v. Rickert,Distinguished,"Their lands are held in fee, not in trust, as in the Rickert case, and the doctrine of constitutional immunity from taxation for the income of their holdings on the federal instrumentality theory has been renounced","The Acting Decision distinguishes Rickert by noting that the current case involves lands held in fee rather than in trust, making the Rickert precedent inapplicable."
103869,103172,Graves v. New York Ex Rel. O'Keefe,Mentioned,"Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 , permitted states to impose income taxes upon government employees",The Acting Decision cites Graves positively as part of a trend toward eliminating tax favoritism and promoting equality of taxation.

Oklahoma, supra.","The Acting Decision notes that Gillespie was overruled by Mountain Producers Corp., but does not itself overrule or criticize Gillespie - it merely acknowledges the existing precedent."
103869,101499,Carpenter v. Shaw,Mentioned,"The constitution adopted by the people of Oklahoma renounced any claims to Indian lands (Art. 1, § 3), and exempted from taxation 'such property as may be exempt by reason of treaty stipulations, existing between the Indians and the United States Government, or by Federal laws, during the force and effect of such treaties or Federal laws' (Art.

103869,97639,Choate v. Trapp,Mentioned,"Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665 , holding that under certain circumstances the United States could not withdraw a tax exemption once assured, has no bearing on the instant problem since it is conceded that the question here is entirely one of what Congress has in fact directed.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Choate by noting it has no bearing on the current case, but does not criticize or question the decision itself."

Schwimmer,Overruled,"We conclude that the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases do not state the correct rule of law.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Schwimmer case does not state the correct rule of law, effectively overruling its precedential value regarding naturalization requirements for conscientious objectors."
104285,101765,United States v. MacIntosh,Overruled,"We conclude that the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases do not state the correct rule of law.","The Acting Decision explicitly groups MacIntosh with the other cases and declares that they do not state the correct rule of law, thereby overruling its precedential authority."
104285,101766,United States v. Bland,Overruled,"We conclude that the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases do not state the correct rule of law.","The Acting Decision explicitly includes Bland in its declaration that these cases do not state the correct rule of law, effectively overruling its precedential value."
104285,103367,Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader,Mentioned,"From this it is argued that Congress adopted and reenacted the rule of the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases. Cf. Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U. S. 469, 488-489.","The Cited Decision is referenced only as a comparison point regarding congressional silence and adoption of judicial rules, without any criticism or significant analysis of its holding."
103962,103531,United States v. Classic,Mentioned,"We did decide, however, United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299 . We there held that § 4 of Article I of the Constitution authorized Congress to regulate primary as well as general elections, 313 U.

S. at 318 .","The Acting Decision references Classic to establish the principle that primaries can be regulated by Congress when they are integral to the election process, using it as supportive precedent without criticism or limitation."
103962,102431,Grovey v. Townsend,Overruled,"Here we are applying, contrary to the recent decision in Orovey v. Townsend , the well-established principle of the Fifteenth Amendment, forbidding the abridgement by a State of a citizen's right to vote. Orovey v. Townsend is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Grovey v. Townsend is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value and casting doubt on its authority."
103962,101911,Nixon v. Condon,Mentioned,"This Court again reversed the dismissal of the suit for the reason that the Committee action was deemed to be state action and invalid as discriminatory under the Fourteenth Amendment. The test was said to be whether the Committee operated as representative of the State in the discharge of the State's authority. Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73 .","The Acting Decision references Nixon v. Condon as part of the historical development of the law regarding primary elections, using it as supportive precedent without any negative treatment."
103962,4209365,Bell v. Hill,Mentioned,"The Democratic party of Texas is held by the Supreme Court of that State to be a 'voluntary association,' Bell v. Hill, 123 Tex. 531, 534 , protected by § 27 of the Bill of Rights, Art. 1, Constitution of Texas, from interference by the State","The Acting Decision cites Bell v.

S. 602 , this Court has consistently held that the owner of a patent may not employ it to secure a limited monopoly of an unpatented material used in applying the invention. Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., supra; Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., supra; Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., 314 U. S. 488 ; B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, 314 U. S. 495 .","The Acting Decision cites Carbice Corp. as part of a consistent line of cases establishing the principle that patent owners cannot use patents to secure monopolies over unpatented materials, without any negative treatment or criticism."
103916,97018,Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 2),Overruled,"The protection which the Court in that case extended to the phonograph record, which was an unpat-ented part of the patented phonograph, is in substance inconsistent with the view which we have expressed in this case. The rule of the Leeds & Catlin case (No. 2) accordingly must no longer prevail against the defense that a combination patent is being used to protect an unpatented part from competition.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the rule from Leeds & Catlin case is inconsistent with the current view and 'must no longer prevail,' which constitutes an express overruling of the precedent."
103916,102889,Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co.,Mentioned,"Ever since Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1 , was overruled by Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U.

S. 602 , this Court has consistently held that the owner of a patent may not employ it to secure a limited monopoly of an unpatented material used in applying the invention.","The Acting Decision references Motion Picture Co. as the case that overruled Henry v. A.B. Dick Co. and established the principle being applied, treating it as supportive precedent without criticism."

103916,103678,United States v. Masonite Corp.,Mentioned,"The fact that the patentee has the power to refuse a license does not enable him to enlarge the monopoly of the patent by the expedient of attaching conditions to its use.

Masonite Corp. to support the principle that patentees cannot enlarge patent monopolies through licensing conditions, treating it as supportive precedent without criticism."
104380,3917155,Bullington v. Angel (1941),Mentioned,"The North Carolina Supreme Court, holding that the North Carolina Act of 1933 barred Bullington's suit against Angel, reversed the Superior Court and dismissed the action. 220 N. C. 18 , 16 S. E. 2d 411 .",The Acting Decision merely references the prior North Carolina Supreme Court decision as factual background without criticizing or questioning its precedential value.

104380,97674,David Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club of America (1912),Overruled,"Cases like Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club, 225 U. S. 489, are obsolete insofar as they are based on a view of diversity jurisdiction which came to an end with Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 .","The Acting Decision explicitly declares that Lupton's Sons is obsolete and no longer valid law due to the intervening Erie decision, effectively overruling its precedential value."
104380,103012,Erie Railroad v. Tompkins (1938),Mentioned,"Cases like Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club, 225 U. S. 489, are obsolete insofar as they are based on a view of diversity jurisdiction which came to an end with Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 . That decision drastically limited the power of federal district courts to entertain suits in diversity cases that could not be brought in the respective State courts or were barred by defenses controlling in the State courts.","The Acting Decision references Erie favorably as the controlling precedent that changed diversity jurisdiction law, using it to support the court's reasoning without any negative treatment."
104704,104459,Caldarola v. Eckert,Mentioned,"The Caldarola case, 332 U. S. 155, undermined the foundations of Hust. Caldarola held that the general agents under the standard form contract were not in possession and control of the vessel so as to make them liable under New York law to an invitee for injuries arising from negligence in its maintenance.","The Acting Decision uses Caldarola to support its reasoning and relies on its holding to distinguish liability principles, without criticizing or questioning the decision itself."
104704,104320,"Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc.",Overruled,"Notwithstanding there may be some undesirable results in overruling Hust, such as loss of rights under the Suits in Admiralty Act by reliance on Hust, we think that in view of Caldarola, the uncertainty as to remedies that the two decisions generate, and the desirability of clarifying the position of the United States as an employer through the War Shipping Administration, that case should be and is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Hust is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value due to inconsistencies with later decisions and the need for legal clarity."
104704,1476725,McAllister v. Cosmopolitan Shipping Co.,Reversed,"On appeal the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. McAllister v. Cosmopolitan Shipping Co., 169 F. 2d 4... The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington is Affirmed. Reversed.","The Acting Decision directly overturns the Court of Appeals decision in the same case, as indicated by the final 'Reversed' ruling at the end of the opinion."
104704,103979,"National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc.",Mentioned,"We assume, without deciding, that the rule of the Hearst case applies, that is, the word 'employment' should be construed so as to give protection to seamen for torts committed against them by those standing in the proximate relation of employer, and the rules of private agency should not be rigorously applied.","The Acting Decision references the Hearst case to discuss employment interpretation principles but assumes its applicability without deciding the issue, indicating a neutral mention rather than any negative treatment."
104704,104389,"American Stevedores, Inc. v. Porello",Mentioned,"As welfare legislation, this statute is entitled to a liberal construction to accomplish its beneficent purposes. Compare Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 318 U. S. 724; American Stevedores v. Porello, 330 U. S. 446.","The Acting Decision cites Porello as a comparative example to support the principle of liberal construction for welfare legislation, without any criticism or negative treatment."
104704,103761,Brady v. Roosevelt Steamship Co.,Limited,"As to the first conclusion, we think it arises from a misconception of the ruling of the Brady case. The Brady case decided no more, directly or by implication, than that an action could be maintained against agents of the United States at common law for the agents' own torts. The case did not involve the right to recover against employers under the Jones Act.","The Acting Decision narrows the scope and applicability of Brady by clarifying that it was misconstrued in Hust and limiting its holding to a specific narrow issue, thereby restricting its broader application."
2764117,104139,Williams v. North Carolina (1945),Distinguished,"Here, unlike the situation presented in Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U. S. 226 (1945), the finding of the requisite jurisdictional facts was made in proceedings in which the defendant appeared and participated.","The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes Williams v. North Carolina (1945) by noting that unlike that case, here the defendant appeared and participated in the proceedings, making it a different factual situation requiring different legal treatment."
2764117,103096,Stoll v. Gottlieb (1938),Mentioned,"Thus in Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 172 (1938), it was said: 'Courts to determine the rights of parties are an integral part of our system of government. It is just as important that there should be a place to end as that there should be a place to begin litigation.'","The Acting Decision cites Stoll v. Gottlieb to support the general principle of res judicata and the importance of finality in litigation, without criticizing or questioning the precedent."
2764117,103736,Williams v. North Carolina (1943),Mentioned,"If in its application local policy must at times be required to give way, such 'is part of the price of our federal system.' Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 302 (1942).","The Acting Decision cites Williams v. North Carolina (1943) to support the principle that local policy must sometimes yield to federal constitutional requirements, using it as supportive authority without negative treatment."
2764117,103084,Davis v. Davis (1938),Mentioned,We believe that the decision of this Court in the Davis case and those in related situations are clearly indicative of the result to be reached here. Those cases stand for the proposition that the requirements of full faith and credit bar a defendant from collaterally attacking a divorce decree on jurisdictional grounds in the courts of a sister State where there has been participation by the defendant in the divorce proceedings.,"The Acting Decision relies on Davis v. Davis as supportive precedent for its holding, treating it as clearly indicative authority without any negative commentary or limitation."
2764117,103236,Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co. (1940),Mentioned,"This Court has also held that the doctrine of res judicata must be applied to questions of jurisdiction in cases arising in state courts involving the application of the full faith and credit clause where, under the law of the state in which the original judgment was rendered, such adjudications are not susceptible to collateral attack.","The Acting Decision cites Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co. as part of a string citation supporting the application of res judicata principles to jurisdictional questions, without any critical analysis."
2764117,95768,Andrews v. Andrews (1903),Limited,"But insofar as the rule of that case may be said to be inconsistent with the judgment herein announced, it must be regarded as having been superseded by subsequent decisions of this Court. The Andrews case was decided prior to the considerable modern development of the law with respect to finality of jurisdictional findings.","The Acting Decision explicitly limits the precedential value of Andrews v. Andrews by stating that insofar as it is inconsistent with the current decision, it has been superseded by subsequent developments in the law."
2764117,98932,Chicago Life Insurance v. Cherry (1917),Mentioned,"Under such circumstances, there is nothing in the concept of due process which demands that a defendant be afforded a second opportunity to litigate the existence of jurisdictional facts. Chicago Life Insurance Co. v. Cherry, 244 U. S. 25 (1917).","The Acting Decision cites Chicago Life Insurance v. Cherry as supportive authority for the principle that due process does not require a second opportunity to litigate jurisdictional facts, without any negative treatment."

(1931),Mentioned,"Under such circumstances, there is nothing in the concept of due process which demands that a defendant be afforded a second opportunity to litigate the existence of jurisdictional facts.

S. 165 (1938); Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U. S. 371 (1940).","The Acting Decision includes Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank in a string citation supporting the application of res judicata principles to jurisdictional determinations, without any negative treatment."
104641,102539,Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries,Overruled,"In the light of the broad groundings of the Mountain Producers decision and of later decisions, we cannot say that the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions remain immune to the effects of the Mountain Producers decision and others which have followed it. They 'are out of harmony with correct principle,' as were the Gillespie and Coronado decisions and, accordingly, they should be, and they now are, overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Barnsdall Refineries decision is overruled along with the Gipsy Oil and Large Oil decisions because they are out of harmony with correct principle established by the Mountain Producers decision.
104641,102986,Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp.,Mentioned,"The opportunity to reexamine the Gillespie and Coronado cases arose in 1938 in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376, the decision upon which the Oklahoma commission relies most strongly to secure reversal of the judgments in the present cases.","The Acting Decision extensively discusses and relies upon the Mountain Producers decision as controlling precedent that undermines earlier immunity decisions, using it as the foundation for overruling other cases without criticizing or questioning its validity."
104641,98296,"Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad v. Harrison",Overruled,"Moreover, since the decisions in Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. Harrison, supra, and Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, supra, rest upon the same foundations as those underlying the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions, indeed supplied those foundations, we think they too should be, and they now are, overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the Choctaw decision because it rests upon the same foundations as the other overruled decisions and actually supplied the foundations for those later decisions.
104641,102861,James v. Dravo Contracting Co.,Mentioned,"Later this Court sustained a state tax on the gross receipts of a contractor with the Federal Government, James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134; Silas Mason Co. v. Tax Commission, 302 U. S. 186; a state tax on the net income of such a contractor, Atkinson v. Tax Commission, 303 U. S. 20","The Acting Decision cites James v. Dravo Contracting Co. as part of a series of cases that sustained various state taxes on contractors with the Federal Government, using it as supportive precedent without any negative treatment."
104641,98689,Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma,Overruled,"Moreover, since the decisions in Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. Harrison, supra, and Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, supra, rest upon the same foundations as those underlying the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions, indeed supplied those foundations, we think they too should be, and they now are, overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. decision because it rests upon the same foundations as the other overruled decisions and actually supplied the foundations for those later decisions.
104641,8181584,Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co.,Overruled,"In the light of the broad groundings of the Mountain Producers decision and of later decisions, we cannot say that the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions remain immune to the effects of the Mountain Producers decision and others which have followed it. They 'are out of harmony with correct principle,' as were the Gillespie and Coronado decisions and, accordingly, they should be, and they now are, overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Gipsy Oil decision is overruled along with the Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions because they are out of harmony with correct principle established by the Mountain Producers decision.
104641,8181635,Large Oil Co. v. Howard,Overruled,"In the light of the broad groundings of the Mountain Producers decision and of later decisions, we cannot say that the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions remain immune to the effects of the Mountain Producers decision and others which have followed it. They 'are out of harmony with correct principle,' as were the Gillespie and Coronado decisions and, accordingly, they should be, and they now are, overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Large Oil decision is overruled along with the Gipsy Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions because they are out of harmony with correct principle established by the Mountain Producers decision.
105014,98362,Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Commission of Ohio,Overruled,"To the extent that language in the opinion in Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm'n, supra, is out of harmony with the views here set forth, we no longer adhere to it.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that it no longer adheres to language in the Mutual Film decision that conflicts with its holding that motion pictures are protected by the First Amendment, effectively overruling that portion of the precedent."
105014,101773,Near v. Minnesota Ex Rel. Olson,Mentioned,"This Court recognized many years ago that such a previous restraint is a form of infringement upon freedom of expression to be especially condemned. Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, 283 U. S. 697 (1931).","The Acting Decision cites Near favorably as establishing the principle that prior restraints on expression are especially condemned, using it to support its constitutional analysis without criticism or limitation."
105014,102991,Lovell v. City of Griffin,Mentioned,"See Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444, 452 (1938).","The Acting Decision references Lovell in a footnote as part of a series of cases establishing First Amendment principles, without any negative treatment or significant discussion."
105014,104623,Kovacs v. Cooper,Mentioned,"E. g., Feiner v. New York, 340 U. S. 315 (1951); Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77 (1949); Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 (1942); Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569 (1941).","The Acting Decision cites Kovacs as one of several examples demonstrating that the Constitution does not require absolute freedom for every form of expression, using it neutrally to support its analysis."
105014,103355,Cantwell v. Connecticut,Mentioned,"In Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 310 (1940), Mr. Justice Roberts, speaking for the whole Court, said: 'In the realm of religious faith, and in that of political -belief, sharp differences arise. In both fields the tenets of one man may seem the rankest error to his neighbor.'","The Acting Decision quotes Cantwell approvingly to support its reasoning about religious differences and the difficulty of defining what constitutes sacrilege, using it as supportive authority."
105014,102601,Grosjean v. American Press Co.,Mentioned,"We fail to see why operation for profit should have any different effect in the case of motion pictures. See Grosjean v. American Press Co., 297 U. S. 233 (1936); Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 531 (1945).","The Acting Decision cites Grosjean to support the principle that commercial operation does not disqualify expression from First Amendment protection, using it as favorable precedent."
105014,2568568,"MATTER OF JOSEPH BURSTYN, INC. v. Wilson",Reversed,Reversed.,"The Acting Decision directly reverses the New York Court of Appeals decision, which had upheld the Board of Regents' determination that the film was sacrilegious and could be banned."

104965,96482,Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky,Mentioned,"Under the earlier view governing the taxability of vessels moving in the inland waters (St. Louis v. Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423 ; Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, 202 U. S. 409 ; cf. Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia, 198 U. S. 299 ), Ohio, the state of the domicile, would have a strong claim to the whole of the tax that has been levied.","The decision is referenced as part of the earlier view on vessel taxation but without criticism or negative treatment, merely as background context for the legal framework."
104965,93124,Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania,Mentioned,"But the rationale of those cases was rejected in Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co., 336 U. S. 169 , where we held that vessels moving in interstate operations along the inland waters were taxable by the same standards as those which Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141 U. S. 18 , first applied to railroad cars in interstate commerce.","The decision is referenced positively as establishing the apportionment formula that was applied to inland water transportation, without any negative treatment."
104965,96299,Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia,Mentioned,"Under the earlier view governing the taxability of vessels moving in the inland waters (St. Louis v. Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423 ; Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, 202 U. S. 409 ; cf. Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia, 198 U. S. 299 ), Ohio, the state of the domicile, would have a strong claim to the whole of the tax that has been levied.","The decision is cited as part of the earlier legal framework without criticism, merely providing context for the previous approach to vessel taxation."
104965,96495,New York Central R. Co. v. Miller,Distinguished,"New York Central R. Co. v. Miller, 202 U. S. 584 , sustained a tax by the domiciliary state on all the rolling stock.of a railroad. But in that case it did not appear that 'any specific cars or any average of cars' was so continuously in another state as to be taxable there.","The court distinguishes this case by noting the factual difference that in Miller, the rolling stock was not continuously in another state, unlike the present case where the vessels were almost continuously outside Ohio."
104965,88336,St. Louis v. Ferry Co.,Mentioned,"Under the earlier view governing the taxability of vessels moving in the inland waters (St. Louis v. Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423 ; Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, 202 U. S. 409 ; cf. Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia, 198 U. S. 299 ), Ohio, the state of the domicile, would have a strong claim to the whole of the tax that has been levied.","The decision is referenced as part of the earlier view on vessel taxation without negative treatment, serving as background for the legal framework that was later modified."
104965,104628,Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co.,Mentioned,"But the rationale of those cases was rejected in Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co., 336 U. S. 169 , where we held that vessels moving in interstate operations along the inland waters were taxable by the same standards as those which Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141 U. S. 18 , first applied to railroad cars in interstate commerce.","The decision is cited approvingly as establishing the current standard for taxing vessels in interstate operations, with the court applying its apportionment principle to the present case."
104965,103990,"Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Minnesota",Distinguished,"Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Minnesota, 322 U. S. 292 , allowed the domiciliary state to tax the entire fleet: of airplanes operating interstate; but in that case, as in the Miller case, it was not shown that 'a. defined part of the domiciliary corpus' had acquired a. taxable situs elsewhere.","The court distinguishes this case by noting that unlike Northwest Airlines, where no defined part had acquired a taxable situs elsewhere, in the present case the vessels were almost continuously outside Ohio and could be taxed by other states."
104965,96335,Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky,Mentioned,"The rule which permits taxatioft by two or more states on. an apportionment basis precludes taxation of all of the property by the state of the domicile. See Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194 .","The decision is cited to support the principle that apportionment taxation by multiple states precludes full taxation by the domiciliary state, without any negative treatment."
105319,103173,Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n,Mentioned,"Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission, 306 U. S. 493, departed, however, from the Clapper decision. There a resident of Massachusetts regularly employed in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts corporation was injured while doing temporary duty in California. The Massachusetts Compensation Act purported to give an exclusive remedy, even for injuries incurred beyond its borders. But California also had a Compensation Act which undertook to fix liability on employers, irrespective of any contract, rule, or regulation, a provision which the California courts strictly enforced. The Court, therefore, held that the exclusive nature of the Massachusetts Act was 'obnoxious' to the policy of California.","The Acting Decision discusses Pacific Employers as establishing precedent that allows the state where injury occurs to override the compensation act of the home state, using it as supportive authority without criticism or limitation."
105319,101915,Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper,Distinguished,"It was indeed held in the Clapper case that a Vermont Compensation Act, which purported to give an exclusive remedy, barred a common-law action on the same claim in the New Hampshire courts by a Vermont employee against a Vermont employer, even though the injury occurred in New Hampshire. The Clapper case allowed a State to fix one exclusive remedy for personal injuries involving its residents, and required the other States to refuse to enforce any inconsistent remedy.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Clapper by noting that it involved different factual circumstances (Vermont employee against Vermont employer) and explains how the Pacific Employers case departed from Clapper's approach.
105319,102412,Broderick v. Rosner,Mentioned,"This is not a case like Hughes v. Fetter, 341 U. S. 609, where the State of the forum seeks to exclude from its courts actions arising under a foreign statute. In that case, we held that Wisconsin could not refuse to entertain a wrongful death action under an Illinois statute for an injury occurring in Illinois, since we found no sufficient policy considerations to warrant such refusal. And see Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629.","The Acting Decision merely references Broderick v. Rosner as additional support for the principle established in Hughes v. Fetter, without any critical analysis or limitation of its precedential value."
105319,3551998,Bunner v. Patti,Mentioned,"The Missouri Supreme Court has construed the Missouri Compensation Act as providing the exclusive remedy, even when, as here, the employee of the subcontractor sues the general contractor for common-law damages. Bunner v. Patti, 343 Mo. 274, 283, 121 S. W. 2d 153, 156-157.","The Acting Decision cites Bunner v. Patti to establish Missouri law regarding the exclusivity of the compensation act, using it as factual background without challenging its precedential value."
105319,104916,Hughes v. Fetter,Mentioned,"This is not a case like Hughes v. Fetter, 341 U. S. 609, where the State of the forum seeks to exclude from its courts actions arising under a foreign statute. In that case, we held that Wisconsin could not refuse to entertain a wrongful death action under an Illinois statute for an injury occurring in Illinois, since we found no sufficient policy considerations to warrant such refusal.","The Acting Decision uses Hughes v. Fetter to distinguish the present case, explaining that Arkansas is not adopting a policy of hostility but rather applying its own law, without criticizing the cited decision's reasoning or precedential value."
105543,103736,Williams v. North Carolina,Mentioned,"If it is due process for Nevada to adjudicate the marriage status of a domiciliary without personal service over the absent spouse (as it clearly is, see Williams v. North Carolina, I, 317 U. S. 287 ), I see no reason why Nevada cannot, at least for the purposes of her own law, also adjudicate the incidents of that status.","The dissenting opinion references Williams v. North Carolina as established precedent regarding Nevada's power to adjudicate marriage status without personal service, using it as support for an argument without criticizing or questioning its validity."
105543,89656,Pennoyer v. Neff,Mentioned,It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.,"The lead opinion cites Pennoyer v. Neff as establishing the foundational constitutional rule regarding personal jurisdiction, treating it as settled precedent without any negative commentary."
105543,97747,Thompson v. Thompson,Limited,"For the reasons given in a concurring opinion in Armstrong v. Armstrong, 350 U. S. 568, 575 , at 580-581, the Thompson case, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.","The Court explicitly states that Thompson v. Thompson 'can no longer be considered controlling' regarding its holding on ex parte divorce destroying alimony rights, thereby limiting its precedential scope and applicability."
105543,104568,Estin v. Estin,Mentioned,"In Estin v. Estin, 334 U. S. 541 , this Court decided that a Nevada divorce court, which had no personal jurisdiction over the wife, had no power to terminate a husband's obligation to provide her support as required in a preexisting New York separation decree.","The Court references Estin v. Estin as precedent that supports its reasoning in the current case, treating it as established authority without any criticism or limitation of its holding."
106285,104709,Wolf v. Colorado,Overruled,"We hold that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court.","The Court explicitly overrules Wolf v. Colorado by extending the federal exclusionary rule to state courts, directly contradicting Wolf's holding that states were not required to exclude illegally obtained evidence."
106285,3599253,People v. Defore,Criticized,"Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the 'weighty testimony' of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13, 150 N. E. 585 (1926). There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the Weeks exclusionary rule in New York, had said that '[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax.' However, the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court.","The Court explicitly states that time has set its face against Defore and that the force of its reasoning has been largely vitiated, indicating strong disagreement with the decision's reasoning and conclusions."
106285,104943,Rochin v. California,Mentioned,"The philosophy of each Amendment and of each freedom is complementary to, although not dependent upon, that of the other in its sphere of influence — the very least that together they assure in either sphere is that no man is to be convicted on unconstitutional evidence. Cf. Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 173 (1952).","The Court merely cites Rochin as a comparison point to support its broader argument about constitutional protections, without any negative treatment or significant analysis of the decision itself."
106285,106107,Elkins v. United States,Mentioned,"Only last year the Court itself recognized that the purpose of the exclusionary rule 'is to deter — to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way — by removing the incentive to disregard it.' Elkins v. United States, supra, at 217.","The Court favorably cites Elkins to support its reasoning about the purpose of the exclusionary rule, using it as authority for the Court's current holding without any negative treatment."
106285,98094,Weeks v. United States,Mentioned,"Less than 30 years after Boyd, this Court, in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 (1914), stated that 'the Fourth Amendment . . . put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints [and] . . . forever secure [d] the people, their persons, houses, papers and effects against all unreasonable searches and seizures under the guise of law . . . and the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon all entrusted under our Federal system with the enforcement of the laws.'","The Court extensively discusses and relies upon Weeks as foundational precedent for the exclusionary rule in federal courts, using it as the basis for extending the rule to state courts without any criticism or limitation."
106285,105194,Irvine v. California,Mentioned,"The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been recognized by this Court since Wolf. See Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 137 (1954).","The Court cites Irvine as support for its argument that alternative remedies to the exclusionary rule have proven futile, using it to bolster the case for overruling Wolf without any negative treatment of Irvine itself."
106285,1237532,People v. Cahan,Mentioned,"Significantly, among those now following the rule is California, which, according to its highest court, was 'compelled to reach tha(t conclusion because other remedies have completely failed to secure compliance with the constitutional provisions . . . .' People v. Cohan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445, 282 P. 2d 905, 911 (1955).","The Court favorably cites Cahan as an example of a state court that adopted the exclusionary rule due to the failure of other remedies, using it to support the argument for applying the rule nationwide."
106285,91573,Boyd v. United States,Mentioned,"Seventy-five years ago, in Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 630 (1886), considering the Fourth and Fifth Amendments as running 'almost into each other' on the facts before it, this Court held that the doctrines of those Amendments 'apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employés of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.'","The Court cites Boyd as foundational precedent establishing the constitutional basis for privacy rights and the exclusionary principle, using it as historical support for the current holding without any negative treatment."
106235,104252,Commissioner v. Wilcox,Overruled,"We believe that Wilcox was wrongly decided and we find nothing in congressional history since then to persuade us that Congress intended to legislate the rule. Thus, we believe that we should now correct the error and the confusion resulting from it, certainly if we do so in a manner that will not prejudice those who might have relied on it.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Wilcox was wrongly decided and should be corrected, and later confirms that 'Since Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, and Mr. Justice Clark agree with us concerning Wilcox, that case is overruled.'"
106235,104992,Rutkin v. United States,Mentioned,"Six years later, this Court held, in Rutkin v. United States, 343 U. S. 130, that extorted money does constitute taxable income to the extortionist in the year that the money is received under § 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.","The Acting Decision uses Rutkin to demonstrate inconsistency with Wilcox and to support its reasoning for overruling Wilcox, but does not criticize or question Rutkin's precedential value."
106235,1495711,McKnight v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,Mentioned,"When a law-abiding taxpayer mistakenly receives income in one year, which receipt is assailed and found to be invalid in a subsequent year, the taxpayer must nonetheless report the amount as 'gross income' in the year received. United States v. Lewis, supra; Healy v. Commissioner, supra.","The case is referenced in passing as support for the principle that taxpayers must report income in the year received even if later found invalid, without any negative treatment."
106235,101568,Corliss v. Bowers,Mentioned,"In such case, the taxpayer has 'actual command over the property taxed — the actual benefit for which the tax is paid,' Corliss v. Bowers, supra.","The Acting Decision cites Corliss v. Bowers to support its standard for determining taxable income based on actual command over property, without questioning its precedential value."
106235,101083,United States v. Sullivan,Mentioned,"Thereafter, the Court held that gains from illicit traffic in liquor are includible within 'gross income.' Ibid. See also Johnson v. United States, 318 U. S. 189; United States v. Johnson, 319 U. S. 503.","The Acting Decision references Sullivan as precedent supporting the taxation of unlawful gains, using it to bolster the argument that illegal income should be taxed."
106235,103292,Helvering v. Hallock,Mentioned,"But the fact that Congress has remained silent or has re-enacted a statute which we have construed, or that congressional attempts to amend a rule announced by this Court have failed, does not necessarily debar us from re-examining and correcting the Court's own errors. Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 69-70; Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119-122.","The Acting Decision cites Helvering v. Hallock as precedent supporting the Court's authority to correct its own errors despite congressional silence, without any negative treatment."
106235,101937,North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet,Mentioned,"When a taxpayer acquires earnings, lawfully or unlawfully, without the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay and without restriction as to their disposition, 'he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.' North American Oil v. Burnet, supra, at p. 424.","The Acting Decision quotes North American Oil to establish the standard for when receipts constitute taxable income, using it as supportive precedent without questioning its validity."
106235,104867,United States v. Lewis,Mentioned,"When a law-abiding taxpayer mistakenly receives income in one year, which receipt is assailed and found to be invalid in a subsequent year, the taxpayer must nonetheless report the amount as 'gross income' in the year received. United States v. Lewis, supra; Healy v. Commissioner, supra.","The Acting Decision cites Lewis as precedent for the principle that income must be reported in the year received even if later determined to be invalid, without any negative treatment."
106883,106545,Gideon v. Wainwright,Mentioned,"In Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 , we held that every person accused of a crime, whether state or federal, is entitled to a lawyer at trial.","The Acting Decision cites Gideon as established precedent for the right to counsel at trial, using it as foundational support without criticism or limitation."
106883,2193029,The PEOPLE v. Escobedo,Reversed,"We conclude, for the reasons stated below, that it was not and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of conviction.","The Acting Decision directly overturns the outcome of the Illinois Supreme Court's decision in the same case, reversing the conviction."
106883,106822,Massiah v. United States,Mentioned,"In Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 , this Court observed that 'a Constitution which guarantees a defendant the aid of counsel at . . . trial could surely vouchsafe no less to an indicted defendant under interrogation by the police in a completely extrajudicial proceeding.'","The Acting Decision cites Massiah favorably as supporting precedent for extending the right to counsel to pre-trial interrogation, building upon its reasoning without criticism."
106883,105750,Cicenia v. Lagay,Limited,"In any event, to the extent that Cicenia or Crooker may be inconsistent with the principles announced today, they are not to be regarded as controlling.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Cicenia should not be regarded as controlling to the extent it conflicts with the new rule, thereby limiting its precedential value."
106883,106595,White v. Maryland,Mentioned,"It was a stage surely as critical as was the arraignment in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 , and the preliminary hearing in White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 .","The Acting Decision cites White v. Maryland as an example of a critical stage requiring counsel, using it as supportive precedent without any negative treatment."
106883,105917,Spano v. New York,Mentioned,"When petitioner requested, and was denied, an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, the investigation had ceased to be a general investigation of 'an unsolved crime.' Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 327 (Stewart, J., concurring).","The Acting Decision cites Spano favorably to support the distinction between general investigation and focused interrogation, using it as supportive authority."
106883,105745,Crooker v. California,Limited,"In any event, to the extent that Cicenia or Crooker may be inconsistent with the principles announced today, they are not to be regarded as controlling.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Crooker should not be regarded as controlling to the extent it conflicts with the new rule, thereby limiting its precedential value."
106883,106300,Hamilton v. Alabama,Mentioned,"It was a stage surely as critical as was the arraignment in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 , and the preliminary hearing in White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 .","The Acting Decision cites Hamilton v. Alabama as an example of a critical stage requiring counsel, using it as supportive precedent without any negative treatment."
106576,100181,Adkins v. Children's Hospital,Criticized,"The doctrine that prevailed in Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns, and like cases — that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely- — -has long since been discarded.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that the doctrine from Adkins has been discarded and criticizes the approach of using due process to strike down laws based on judicial views of legislative wisdom.
106576,96276,Lochner v. New York,Criticized,"The doctrine that prevailed in Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns, and like cases — that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely- — -has long since been discarded.",The Acting Decision explicitly criticizes Lochner as part of a discarded doctrine that improperly allowed courts to substitute their judgment for that of legislatures.
106576,101029,Tyson & Brother v. Banton,Mentioned,"Dissenting from the Court's invalidating a state statute which regulated the resale price of theatre and other tickets, Mr. Justice Holmes said, 'I think the proper course is to recognize that a state legislature can do whatever it sees fit to do unless it is restrained by some express prohibition in the Constitution'","The Acting Decision cites Justice Holmes' dissent in Tyson favorably to support the principle of judicial restraint, using it as authority for the court's current position."
106576,103522,"Olsen v. Nebraska Ex Rel. Western Reference & Bond Assn., Inc.",Mentioned,"As this Court stated in a unanimous opinion in 1941, 'We are not concerned . . . with the wisdom, need, or appropriateness of the legislation.'","The Acting Decision cites Olsen approvingly to support the principle that courts should not concern themselves with the wisdom of legislation, using it as authority for judicial restraint."
106576,101935,Sproles v. Binford,Mentioned,this Court does not sit to 'subject the State to an intolerable supervision hostile to the basic principles of our Government and wholly beyond the protection which the general clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to secure.',"The Acting Decision cites Sproles favorably to support the principle that courts should not engage in excessive supervision of state legislation, reinforcing the court's position on judicial restraint."
106576,104610,Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Co.,Mentioned,"It is now settled that States 'have power to legislate against what are found to be injurious practices in their internal commercial and business affairs, so long as their laws do not run afoul of some specific federal constitutional prohibition, or of some valid federal law.'","The Acting Decision cites Lincoln Federal Labor Union approvingly to establish the settled principle that states have broad power to regulate business practices, supporting the court's deference to legislative judgment."
106576,105285,"Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.",Mentioned,"we emphatically refuse to go back to the time when courts used the Due Process Clause 'to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.'","The Acting Decision cites Williamson favorably to support its rejection of substantive due process review of economic legislation, using it as authority for judicial restraint."
106576,2093296,"Home Budget Service, Inc. v. Boston Bar Association",Mentioned,"Massachusetts and Virginia prohibit debt pooling by laymen by declaring it to constitute the practice of law. Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. (1958) c. 221, § 46C; Va. Code Ann. (1958) §54-44.1. The Massachusetts statute was upheld in Home Budget Service, Inc., v. Boston Bar Assn., 335 Mass. 228, 139 N. E. 2d 387 (1957).","The Acting Decision merely references Home Budget Service as an example of a court upholding a similar statute, providing factual context without any critical analysis of the decision."
106576,98999,Adams v. Tanner,Criticized,"reliance on Adams v. Tanner is as mistaken as would be adherence to Adkins v. Children's Hospital, overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937). Not only has the philosophy of Adams been abandoned, but also this Court almost 15 years ago expressly pointed to another opinion of this Court as having 'clearly undermined' Adams.","The Acting Decision explicitly criticizes Adams v. Tanner, stating that reliance on it is mistaken, that its philosophy has been abandoned, and that it has been undermined by subsequent decisions."
107121,105848,Brown v. United States,Overruled,"We overrule Brown v. United States, supra, and reverse and remand this case for proceedings under Rule 42 (b).","The Acting Decision explicitly states that it overrules Brown v.

Andimo Pappadio,Mentioned,"In more than one instance in the Southern District of New York, from which this case comes, witnesses cited for testimonial contempt before the grand jury were given hearings under Rule 42 (b).

Carmine Tramunti,Mentioned,"In more than one instance in the Southern District of New York, from which this case comes, witnesses cited for testimonial contempt before the grand jury were given hearings under Rule 42 (b). E. g., United States v. Castaldi, 338 F. 2d 883 ; United States v. Tramunti, 343 F. 2d 548 ; United States v. Shillitani, 345 F. 2d 290; United States v.

S. 289, 314 ) in the 'actual presence of the court.'","The case is cited to support the definition of summary contempt for misbehavior, providing clarification without challenging its precedential value."
107121,106057,Levine v. United States,Mentioned,"Brown v. United States was reaffirmed and followed in Levine v. United States, 362 U. S. 610 .","The case is mentioned in the dissenting opinion as having reaffirmed Brown, but this is merely a factual reference without any treatment by the majority opinion."
107121,266063,United States v. Anthony Castaldi,Mentioned,"In more than one instance in the Southern District of New York, from which this case comes, witnesses cited for testimonial contempt before the grand jury were given hearings under Rule 42 (b). E. g., United States v. Castaldi, 338 F. 2d 883 ; United States v. Tramunti, 343 F. 2d 548 ; United States v. Shillitani, 345 F. 2d 290; United States v.

105525,93107,In re Ross,Criticized,"The Ross approach that the Constitution has no applicability abroad has long since been directly repudiated by numerous cases. That approach is obviously erroneous if the United States Government, which has no power except that granted by the Constitution, can and does try citizens for crimes committed abroad. Thus the Ross case rested, at least in substantial part, on a fundamental misconception and the most that can be said in support of the result reached there is that the consular court jurisdiction had a long history antedating the adoption of the Constitution.",The Acting Decision directly criticizes the Ross case as being based on a fundamental misconception and states that its approach has been repudiated by numerous cases.
105525,105326,United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles,Mentioned,"Just last Term, this Court held in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, that military courts could not constitutionally try a discharged serviceman for an offense which he had allegedly committed while in the armed forces.","The Acting Decision references Toth v. Quarles to support its reasoning about the limits of military jurisdiction over civilians, without criticizing or questioning its precedential value."
105525,96130,Dorr v. United States,Mentioned,"See Dorr v. United States, 195 U. S. 138, 144-148.","The Acting Decision merely cites Dorr v. United States in a footnote regarding constitutional rights that are considered 'fundamental' for Americans abroad, without significant discussion or criticism."
105525,105412,Kinsella v. Krueger,Overruled,"The two cases were consolidated and argued last Term and a majority of the Court, with three Justices dissenting and one reserving opinion, held that military trial of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert for their alleged offenses was constitutional. 351 U. S. 470, 487. Subsequently, the Court granted a petition for rehearing, 352 U. S. 901. Now, after further argument and consideration, we conclude that the previous decisions cannot be permitted to stand.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that the previous decisions in these same cases cannot be permitted to stand and overrules them after rehearing.
105525,95504,Downes v. Bidwell,Limited,"The 'Insular Cases' can be distinguished from the present cases in that they involved the power of Congress to provide rules and regulations to govern temporarily territories with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions whereas here the basis for governmental power is American citizenship. Moreover, it is our judgment that neither the cases nor their reasoning should be given any further expansion.","The Acting Decision distinguishes the Insular Cases and explicitly states that their reasoning should not be given any further expansion, thereby limiting their scope and applicability."
105525,95894,Hawaii v. Mankichi,Limited,"The 'Insular Cases,' which arose at the turn of the century, involved territories which had only recently been conquered or acquired by the United States. Moreover, it is our judgment that neither the cases nor their reasoning should be given any further expansion.","As part of the Insular Cases, the Acting Decision limits Hawaii v. Mankichi by stating that these cases should not be given any further expansion in their reasoning or application."
105525,85272,McCulloch v. Maryland,Mentioned,"Nothing said here contravenes the rule laid down in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, at 421, that: 'Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.'","The Acting Decision cites McCulloch v. Maryland approvingly to clarify that its holding does not contradict the established rule about the Necessary and Proper Clause, without any negative treatment."
105525,2181793,In re Di Bartolo,Mentioned,"In re Di Bartolo, 50 F. Supp. 929.","The Acting Decision merely cites In re Di Bartolo in a footnote as one of several cases involving military trial of civilians performing services for the armed forces during wartime, without significant discussion."
105525,105004,Madsen v. Kinsella,Distinguished,"Madsen v. Kinsella, 343 U. S. 341, is not controlling here. It concerned trials in enemy territory which had been conquered and held by force of arms and which was being governed at the time by our military forces.","The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes Madsen v. Kinsella based on the different factual circumstances involving conquered enemy territory, thereby limiting its applicability to the present case."
105525,1528394,Ex parte Milligan,Mentioned,"Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, one of the great landmarks in this Court's history, held that military authorities were without power to try civilians not in the military or naval service by declaring martial law in an area where the civil administration was not deposed and the courts were not closed.","The Acting Decision cites Ex parte Milligan approvingly as a landmark case supporting the principle that military jurisdiction over civilians is limited, using it to support its reasoning without any negative treatment."
105525,99954,Balzac v. Porto Rico,Limited,"The 'Insular Cases' can be distinguished from the present cases in that they involved the power of Congress to provide rules and regulations to govern temporarily territories with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions whereas here the basis for governmental power is American citizenship.

Porto Rico by stating that these cases should not be given any further expansion in their reasoning or application."
105525,105413,"Reid v. Covert, 351 U.S. 487",Overruled,"The two cases were consolidated and argued last Term and a majority of the Court, with three Justices dissenting and one reserving opinion, held that military trial of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert for their alleged offenses was constitutional. 351 U. S. 470, 487. Subsequently, the Court granted a petition for rehearing, 352 U. S. 901. Now, after further argument and consideration, we conclude that the previous decisions cannot be permitted to stand.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules its own previous decision in Reid v. Covert from 1956, stating that the previous decision cannot be permitted to stand after rehearing and further consideration."
107081,104790,American Communications Assn. v. Douds,Distinguished,"This case is not necessarily controlled by Douds. For to prove its assertion that § 9 (h) was preventive rather than retributive in purpose, the Court in Douds focused on the fact that members of the Communist Party could escape from the class of persons specified by Congress simply by resigning from the Party... Section 504, unlike § 9 (h), disqualifies from the holding of union office not only present members of the Communist Party, but also anyone who has within the past five years been a member of the Party.","The Court distinguishes Douds by noting key factual differences between the statutes, particularly that Section 504 includes a five-year lookback period that prevents escape from the class through resignation, unlike the statute in Douds."
107081,106267,Communist Party of United States v. Subversive Activities Control Bd.,Mentioned,"Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U. S. 1, lends support to our conclusion. That case involved an appeal from an order by the Control Board ordering the Communist Party to register as a 'Communist-action organization,' under the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950... the majority clearly implied that if the Act had applied to the Communist Party by name, it would have been a bill of attainder","The Court cites this decision to support its conclusion about bill of attainder analysis, using it as precedential support for the principle that naming specific organizations would constitute a bill of attainder."
107081,104353,Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System v. Agnew,Distinguished,"We find this argument without merit. First, we note that § 504, unlike § 32 of the Banking Act, inflicts its deprivation upon the members of a political group thought to present a threat to the national security... Second, § 32 incorporates no judgment censuring or condemning any man or group of men... Third, we cannot accept the suggestion that § 32 constitutes an exercise in specification rather than rule-making.","The Court distinguishes Agnew by identifying three key differences between the conflict-of-interest statute in that case and Section 504, rejecting the government's argument that they are analogous."
107081,87778,Cummings v. Missouri,Mentioned,"The approach which Chief Justice Marshall had suggested was followed in the twin post-Civil War cases of Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, and Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333. Cummings involved the constitutionality of amendments to the Missouri Constitution of 1865 which provided that no one could engage in a number of specified professions (Cummings was a priest) unless he first swore that he had taken no part in the rebellion against the Union.","The Court cites Cummings as historical precedent supporting its interpretation of the Bill of Attainder Clause, using it to establish the principle that legislative punishment of specific groups constitutes a bill of attainder."
107081,104303,United States v. Lovett,Mentioned,"The next extended discussion of the Bill of Attainder Clause came in 1946, in United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, where the Court invalidated § 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, 1943, 57 Stat. 431, 450, which prohibited payment of further salary to three named federal employees, as a bill of attainder.","The Court cites Lovett as precedential support for its bill of attainder analysis, using it to establish the principle that legislative acts targeting specific individuals without judicial trial constitute bills of attainder."
107081,94855,Hawker v. New York,Mentioned,"The leading case is Hawker v. New York, 170 U. S. 189, which upheld a provision prohibiting convicted felons from practicing medicine against a claim that, as applied to one convicted before its enactment, it was an ex post facto law.","The Court mentions Hawker in the dissenting opinion as an example of legitimate legislative classification that would be threatened by the majority's approach, but does not directly engage with or criticize the decision itself."
107081,106534,Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,Mentioned,"We summarized the relevant considerations in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, supra: 'Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment— retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions.'","The Court cites Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez in the dissenting opinion to outline the traditional multi-factor test for determining whether a statute constitutes punishment, without criticizing the decision itself."
107464,105658,Perez v. Brownell,Overruled,Perez v. Brownell is overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that Perez v. Brownell is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value."
107464,94842,United States v. Wong Kim Ark,Mentioned,"And this was the unequivocal statement of the Court in the case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649. The issues in that case were whether a person born in the United States to Chinese aliens was a citizen of the United States and whether, nevertheless, he could be excluded under the Chinese Exclusion Act, 22 Stat. 58. The Court first held that within the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment, Wong Kim Ark was a citizen of the United States, and then pointed out that though he might 'renounce this citizenship, and become a citizen of . . . any other country,' he had never done so.","The Acting Decision references Wong Kim Ark to support its position on citizenship rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, providing additional analysis without questioning its precedential value."
107464,91470,Kurtz v. Moffitt,Mentioned,"his general understanding of the statute was approved by this Court in Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U. S. 487, 501.","The Acting Decision merely references Kurtz v. Moffitt in the dissenting opinion as supporting evidence for a particular interpretation of a statute, without any negative treatment."
107464,105659,Trop v. Dulles,Mentioned,"Moreover, in the other cases decided with and since Perez, this Court has consistently invalidated on a case-by-case basis various other statutory sections providing for involuntary expatriation.","The Acting Decision references Trop v. Dulles as one of the cases that cast doubt on Perez, but does not directly treat or analyze the decision itself."
107464,98579,MacKenzie v. Hare,Mentioned,"Finally, the dictum must be read in light of the subsequent opinion for the Court, written by Mr. Justice McKenna, in Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U. S. 299. Despite counsel's invocation of Wong Kim Ark, id., at 302 and 303, the Court held in Mackenzie that marriage between an American citizen and an alien, unaccompanied by any intention of the citizen to renounce her citizenship, nonetheless permitted Congress to withdraw her nationality.","The Acting Decision references MacKenzie v. Hare in the dissenting opinion to illustrate a point about prior precedent, without expressing any negative treatment toward the decision."
107473,105880,Frank v. Maryland,Overruled,"Having concluded that Frank v. Maryland, to the extent that it sanctioned such warrantless inspections, must be overruled, we reverse.","The Court explicitly states that Frank v. Maryland must be overruled to the extent it sanctioned warrantless inspections, directly nullifying the precedential value of that decision."
107473,106109,Ohio Ex Rel. Eaton v. Price,Mentioned,"In Eaton v. Price, 364 U. S. 263, a similar conviction was affirmed by an equally divided Court.","The decision is referenced factually as background information about similar cases, without any critical analysis or negative treatment of its holding."
107473,106641,Ker v. California,Mentioned,"As such, the Fourth Amendment is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 30.","The decision is cited as supportive authority for the established principle that the Fourth Amendment applies to states through the Fourteenth Amendment, without any criticism or limitation."
107473,2305304,Givner v. State,Mentioned,"Relying on Frank v. Maryland, Eaton v. Price, and decisions in other States, the District Court of Appeal held that § 503 does not violate Fourth Amendment rights","The decision is mentioned as one of the state court decisions that the lower court relied upon, but there is no direct treatment or analysis of this decision by the Acting Decision."
107473,106777,Stoner v. California,Mentioned,"except in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper consent is 'unreasonable' unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. See, e. g., Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483","The decision is cited as an example supporting the general principle that searches without warrants are unreasonable, without any criticism or negative treatment."
107473,104605,McDonald v. United States,Mentioned,"except in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper consent is 'unreasonable' unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. See, e. g., Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483; United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451","The decision is cited as supportive authority for the established warrant requirement principle, without any criticism or limitation of its precedential value."
107473,2062881,Paquette v. City of Fall River,Mentioned,numerous courts have upheld the police power of municipalities to impose and enforce such minimum standards even upon existing structures,"The decision is mentioned as one of several cases supporting the municipal police power to enforce housing standards, without any critical analysis or negative treatment."
107473,2008391,Commonwealth v. Hadley,Mentioned,"See also State v. Rees, 258 Iowa 813, 139 N. W. 2d 406 (1966); Commonwealth v. Hadley, 351 Mass. 439, 222 N. E. 2d 681 (1966)","The decision is listed among other state court cases that have addressed similar issues, without any substantive discussion or treatment of its holding."
107473,3637215,Adamec v. Post,Mentioned,numerous courts have upheld the police power of municipalities to impose and enforce such minimum standards even upon existing structures,"The decision is mentioned as one of several cases supporting municipal authority to enforce housing standards, without any critical analysis or negative treatment."
107473,107262,Schmerber v. California,Mentioned,"the question is not whether the public interest justifies the type of search in question, but whether the authority to search should be evidenced by a warrant, which in turn depends in part upon whether the burden of obtaining a warrant is likely to frustrate the governmental purpose behind the search. See Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770-771.","The decision is cited as supportive authority for the principle about balancing warrant requirements against governmental purposes, without any criticism or limitation."
103870,,,,,
107564,107483,Berger v. New York,Mentioned,"Only last Term we sustained the validity of such an authorization, holding that, under sufficiently 'precise and discriminate circumstances,' a federal court may empower government agents to employ a concealed electronic device 'for the narrow and particularized purpose of ascertaining the truth of the . . . allegations' of a 'detailed factual affidavit alleging the commission of a specific criminal offense.' Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323, 329-330. Discussing that holding, the Court in Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, said that 'the order authorizing the use of the electronic device' in Osborn 'afforded similar protections to those ... of conventional warrants authorizing the seizure of tangible evidence.'","The Court references Berger v. New York to support its discussion of proper electronic surveillance procedures and warrant requirements, without criticizing or questioning the decision's validity."
107564,107465,"Warden, Maryland Penitentiary v. Hayden",Mentioned,"But '[t]he premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.' Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 304.","The Court cites Warden v. Hayden to support its argument that Fourth Amendment protections extend beyond property interests, using it as authority for expanding Fourth Amendment coverage."
107564,106187,Silverman v. United States,Mentioned,"Indeed, we have expressly held that the Fourth Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements, overheard without any 'technical trespass under . . . local property law.' Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511.","The Court cites Silverman as precedent supporting the extension of Fourth Amendment protections to oral statements and recordings, using it to bolster its argument against the trespass doctrine."
107564,106622,Lopez v. United States,Mentioned,"In previous eases, which are undisturbed by today's decision, the Court has upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, admission at trial of evidence obtained (1) by an undercover police agent to whom a defendant speaks without knowledge that he is in the employ of the police, Hoffa v. United States, 385 U. S. 293 (1966); (2) by a recording device hidden on the person of such an informant, Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427 (1963)","The Court mentions Lopez v. United States as an example of previously upheld surveillance methods that remain valid, distinguishing it from the current case without criticizing the decision."
107564,106641,Ker v. California,Mentioned,"But if Osborn had been told in advance that federal officers intended to record his conversations, the point of making such recordings would obviously have been lost; the evidence in question could not have been obtained. In omitting any requirement of advance notice, the federal court that authorized electronic surveillance in Osborn simply recognized, as has this Court, that officers need not announce their purpose before conducting an otherwise authorized search if such an announcement would provoke the escape of the suspect or the destruction of critical evidence. See Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 37-41.","The Court cites Ker v. California to support the principle that advance notice is not always required for searches when it would defeat the purpose, using it as supporting authority without criticism."
107564,106108,Rios v. United States,Mentioned,"But what he seeks-to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected. See Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253; Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733.","The Court cites Rios v. United States as supporting precedent for the principle that privacy can be constitutionally protected even in publicly accessible areas, using it to support its reasoning without negative treatment."
107564,103664,Goldman v. United States,Overruled,We conclude that the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the 'trespass' doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling.,"The Court explicitly states that Goldman's trespass doctrine can no longer be regarded as controlling and that its underpinnings have been eroded, effectively overruling the precedential value of Goldman."
107564,101320,Olmstead v. United States,Overruled,We conclude that the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the 'trespass' doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling.,"The Court explicitly states that Olmstead's trespass doctrine can no longer be regarded as controlling and that its underpinnings have been eroded, effectively overruling the precedential value of Olmstead."
107343,104974,Adler v. Board of Education,Overruled,"Moreover, to the extent that Adler sustained the provision of the Feinberg Law constituting membership in an organization advocating forceful overthrow of government a ground for disqualification, pertinent constitutional doctrines have since rejected the premises upon which that conclusion rested. Adler is therefore not dispositive of the constitutional issues we must decide in this case.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that constitutional doctrines have rejected the premises upon which Adler's conclusion rested, making it not dispositive and effectively overruling its holding regarding membership-based disqualification."
107343,106837,Baggett v. Bullitt,Mentioned,"We cannot gainsay the potential effect of this obscure wording on 'those with a conscientious and scrupulous regard for such undertakings.' Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 374.","The Acting Decision cites Baggett v. Bullitt to support its analysis of vague statutory language and its chilling effect, using it as supportive authority without criticism or limitation."
107343,107210,Elfbrandt v. Russell,Mentioned,"In Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11, we said, 'Those who join an organization but do not share its unlawful purposes and who do not participate in its unlawful activities surely pose no threat, either as citizens or as public employees.'",The Acting Decision cites Elfbrandt v. Russell favorably to establish the governing standard that mere knowing membership without specific intent is insufficient for constitutional exclusion from employment.
107343,106514,N.A.A.C.P. v. Button,Mentioned,"We emphasize once again that '[precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms,' N. A. A. C. P. v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 438","The Acting Decision cites N.A.A.C.P. v. Button as supportive authority for the principle that regulations affecting First Amendment freedoms must be precisely crafted, using it to support its constitutional analysis."
107343,105751,Speiser v. Randall,Mentioned,"When one must guess what conduct or utterance may lose him his position, one necessarily will 'steer far wider of the unlawful zone . . . .' Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 526.","The Acting Decision cites Speiser v. Randall to illustrate the chilling effect of vague regulations on constitutional rights, using it as supportive precedent for its vagueness analysis."
107343,106142,Shelton v. Tucker,Mentioned,"But 'even though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.' Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479, 488.",The Acting Decision cites Shelton v. Tucker favorably to establish the principle that legitimate governmental purposes cannot justify overly broad restrictions on fundamental liberties when narrower means are available.
107343,105537,Yates v. United States,Mentioned,"It may well prohibit the employment of one who merely advocates the doctrine in the abstract without any attempt to indoctrinate others, or incite others to action in furtherance of unlawful aims. See Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242 ; Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298","The Acting Decision cites Yates v. United States as supportive authority for the distinction between abstract advocacy and incitement to action, using it to support its analysis of the statute's overbreadth."
107343,106311,Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction,Mentioned,"The regulatory maze created by New York is wholly lacking in 'terms susceptible of objective measurement.' Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, supra, at 286.",The Acting Decision cites Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction to support its finding that the New York regulatory scheme lacks the objective measurement standards required for constitutional validity in the area of First Amendment rights.
107689,106050,Parker v. Ellis,Overruled,"The federal habeas corpus statute does not require this result, and Parker v. Ellis must be overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Parker v. Ellis must be overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value regarding habeas corpus jurisdiction when a petitioner is released from custody."
107689,264986,"United States of America Ex Rel. James P. Carafas v. J. Edwin Lavallee, Warden, Auburn Prison, Auburn, New York",Mentioned,"334 F. 2d 331 (1964); petition for writ of certiorari denied, 381 U. S. 951 (1965).

107689,107408,Nowakowski v. Maroney,Mentioned,"In Nowakowski , we held that 'when a district judge grants ... a certificate [of probable cause], the court of appeals must grant an appeal in forma pauperis (assuming the requisite showing of poverty), and proceed to a disposition of the appeal in accord with its ordinary procedure.'","The decision is cited favorably and applied to the facts of the case, with the court following its holding without criticism or modification."
107689,104336,Fiswick v. United States,Mentioned,"Because of these 'disabilities or burdens [which] may flow from' petitioner's conviction, he has 'a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on him.' Fiswick v. United States, 329 U. S. 211, 222 (1946).","The decision is cited supportively to establish the principle that collateral consequences prevent a case from becoming moot, without any negative treatment."

107689,107084,Linkletter v. Walker,Mentioned,"Although Nowakowski was decided after the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal, its holding applies to a habeas corpus proceeding which, like this one, was not concluded at the time Nowakowski was decided.

107689,106285,Mapp v. Ohio,Mentioned,"On direct appeal (following Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)), petitioner claimed that illegally obtained evidence had been introduced against him at trial.","The decision is referenced only as part of the procedural history to provide context for the petitioner's claim, without substantive legal analysis."

S. 629, 633-634, n. 2 (1968)","The decision is cited supportively as authority for the collateral consequences doctrine that prevents mootness, without any criticism or negative treatment."
107689,95249,Ex Parte Baez,Mentioned,"If there has been, or will be, an unconditional release from custody before inquiry can be made into the legality of detention, it has been held that there is no habeas corpus jurisdiction. See Parker v. Ellis, supra, at 582, n. 8 (WARREN, C. J., dissenting); Ex parte Baez, 177 U. S. 378 (1900)","The decision is cited as an example of the traditional rule that habeas corpus jurisdiction is lost upon release from custody, but this is presented as background rather than endorsed."
107689,1425143,United States Ex Rel. Rivera v. Reeves,Mentioned,"If there has been, or will be, an unconditional release from custody before inquiry can be made into the legality of detention, it has been held that there is no habeas corpus jurisdiction. See Parker v. Ellis, supra, at 582, n. 8 (WARREN, C. J., dissenting); Ex parte Baez, 177 U. S. 378 (1900); United States ex rel. Rivera v. Reeves, 246 F. Supp. 599 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1965)","The decision is cited as an example of the traditional rule regarding loss of habeas corpus jurisdiction upon release, presented as background information rather than endorsed."
107689,105176,United States v. Morgan,Mentioned,"On account of these 'collateral consequences,' the case is not moot. Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 633-634, n. 2 (1968); Fiswick v. United States, supra, at 222, n. 10; United States v. Morgan, 346 U.

107689,107631,Walker v. Wainwright,Mentioned,"At one point, the new § 2244 (b) (1964 ed., Supp. II) speaks in terms of 'release from custody or other remedy.' See Peyton v. Rowe, supra; Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U. S. 335 (1968).",The decision is cited as supporting authority for the proposition that habeas corpus relief can include remedies other than immediate release from custody.
107689,105722,Eskridge v. Washington State Board of Prison Terms & Paroles,Mentioned,"Although Nowakowski was decided after the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal, its holding applies to a habeas corpus proceeding which, like this one, was not concluded at the time Nowakowski was decided. Cf. Eskridge v. Washington Prison Board, 357 U. S. 214 (1958)","The decision is cited as a supporting reference for the principle of retroactive application of decisions to pending cases, without any negative treatment."
107689,103486,Ex Parte Hull,Mentioned,"At one point, the new § 2244 (b) (1964 ed., Supp. II) speaks in terms of 'release from custody or other remedy.' See Peyton v. Rowe, supra; Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U. S. 335 (1968). Cf. Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S. 546 (1941).","The decision is cited as a comparative reference supporting the broad remedial power of habeas corpus courts, without substantive analysis or negative treatment."
107746,105055,Schwartz v. Texas,Overruled,"In view of the Nardone and Benanti decisions, the doctrine of Schwartz v. Texas cannot survive the demise of Wolf v. Colorado, supra.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the doctrine of Schwartz v. Texas cannot survive, effectively overruling its precedential value regarding the admissibility of intercepted communications in state courts."
107746,104709,Wolf v. Colorado,Overruled,"That doctrinal underpinning of the Schwartz decision was, of course, completely removed by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, which overruled Wolf and squarely held that evidence obtained by state officers in an unreasonable search is inadmissible in a state criminal trial.","The Acting Decision acknowledges that Wolf v. Colorado was overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, removing the doctrinal foundation that previously supported allowing state courts to accept illegally obtained evidence."
107746,102883,Nardone v. United States,Mentioned,"In Nardone v. United States, 302 U. S. 379, the Court was first called upon to decide whether § 605 had indeed served to render evidence of intercepted communications inadmissible in a federal trial.","The Acting Decision references Nardone favorably as establishing the principle that § 605 forbids divulgence of intercepted communications in federal courts, using it as supportive precedent without criticism."
107746,98094,Weeks v. United States,Mentioned,"Indeed, evidence obtained by a state officer by means which would constitute an unlawful search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution is nonetheless admissible in a state court, Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, while such evidence, if obtained by a federal officer, would be clearly inadmissible in a federal court. Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383.","The Acting Decision references Weeks as establishing the exclusionary rule in federal courts for illegally obtained evidence, using it as background precedent without any negative treatment."
107746,106107,Elkins v. United States,Mentioned,"But the decision we reach today is not based upon language and doctrinal symmetry alone. It is buttressed as well by the 'imperative of judicial integrity.' Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 222.","The Acting Decision cites Elkins favorably to support the principle of judicial integrity and the need for mandatory exclusion of illegal evidence, using it as supportive authority for the court's reasoning."
107679,102317,McNally v. Hill,Overruled,We overrule McNally and hold that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is 'in custody' under any one of them for purposes of § 2241 (c)(3).,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that it overrules McNally v. Hill, finding that the decision was neither compelled by statute nor history and represents an indefensible barrier to prompt adjudication of constitutional claims."
107679,106507,Jones v. Cunningham,Mentioned,"What we said of the writ in a similar context in Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963), is equally applicable here. '[The writ] is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose — the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty.'","The Acting Decision cites Jones v. Cunningham favorably to support its interpretation of the evolving nature of habeas corpus, using it to reinforce the Court's reasoning without any negative treatment."
107679,100122,Moore v. Dempsey,Mentioned,"Third, at least tentatively in Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309 (1915), and more clearly in Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86 (1923), this Court had recognized that a district court was authorized to look behind the bare record of a trial proceeding and conduct a factual hearing to determine the merits of alleged deprivations of constitutional rights","The Acting Decision references Moore v. Dempsey positively as establishing precedent for factual hearings in habeas corpus proceedings, supporting the Court's analysis of the writ's development without any criticism."
107679,106548,Fay v. Noia,Mentioned,"Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75 (1807); Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163 (1874); Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U. S. 86 (1923); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953); Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963).","The Acting Decision cites Fay v. Noia as part of a series of cases that established habeas corpus as a symbol and guardian of individual liberty, referencing it positively without any negative treatment."
107606,104585,Shapiro v. United States,Distinguished,"We think that neither Shapiro nor the cases upon which it relied are applicable here. Each of the three principal elements of the doctrine, as it is described in Shapiro, is absent from this situation.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Shapiro is not applicable to the current case and distinguishes it by identifying three principal elements of the Shapiro doctrine that are absent from the present situation.
107606,105090,United States v. Kahriger,Overruled,We conclude that nothing in the Court's opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner's assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.,The Acting Decision explicitly states that Kahriger is overruled to the extent that it would preclude the petitioner's assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege as a defense.
107606,101083,United States v. Sullivan,Distinguished,"Neither reason suffices to prevent this petitioner's assertion of the privilege. The first is, as we have indicated, inapplicable, and we find the second unpersuasive in this situation.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Sullivan by finding that the reasoning from Sullivan does not apply to the current case, noting that the circumstances are different and Sullivan's rationale is inapplicable or unpersuasive here."
107606,105280,Lewis v. United States,Overruled,We conclude that nothing in the Court's opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner's assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.,The Acting Decision explicitly states that Lewis is overruled to the extent that it would preclude the petitioner's assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege as a defense.
107606,107110,Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board,Mentioned,"Every aspect of petitioner's wagering activities thus subjected him to possible state or federal prosecution. By any standard, in Connecticut and throughout the United States, wagering is 'an area permeated with criminal statutes,' and those engaged in wagering are a group 'inherently suspect of criminal activities.' Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70, 79.","The Acting Decision cites Albertson for the proposition that wagering activities constitute an area permeated with criminal statutes and involve groups inherently suspect of criminal activities, using it as supportive authority without any negative treatment."
107606,106864,Murphy v. Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor,Mentioned,"It is suggested that these restrictions might be similar to those imposed by the Court in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U. S. 52.","The Acting Decision references Murphy as a potential model for restrictions that could be imposed, but ultimately decides against implementing such restrictions in this case. The citation is merely referential without negative treatment of the decision itself."
107685,102879,Palko v. Connecticut,Overruled,"In Malloy v. Hogan, supra, the Court rejected Palko's discussion of the self-incrimination clause. Respectfully, we reject the prior dicta regarding jury trial in criminal cases.","The Court explicitly rejects Palko's dicta regarding jury trial, stating that the observations in Palko about jury trial not being essential to ordered liberty are unsupported by holdings and should be rejected."
107685,106862,Malloy v. Hogan,Mentioned,"The claim before us is that the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment meets these tests. The position of Louisiana, on the other hand, is that the Constitution imposes upon the States no duty to give a jury trial in any criminal case, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or the size of the punishment which may be imposed.","Malloy v. Hogan is cited as establishing the test for determining fundamental rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, without any negative treatment or criticism of the decision itself."
107685,107014,Pointer v. Texas,Mentioned,"and whether it is 'a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,' Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 343-344 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965).","Pointer v. Texas is cited as one of the cases establishing the test for fundamental rights essential to a fair trial, with no criticism or negative treatment of the decision."
107685,1236300,Powell v. Alabama,Mentioned,"The question has been asked whether a right is among those ' fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions, ' Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 67 (1932)","Powell v. Alabama is cited approvingly as establishing one of the tests for determining whether a right is fundamental under the Fourteenth Amendment, with no negative treatment."
107685,102801,District of Columbia v. Clawans,Mentioned,"The penalty authorized by the law of the locality may be taken 'as a gauge of its social and ethical judgments,' 300 U. S., at 628 , of the crime in question. In Clawans the defendant was jailed for 60 days, but it was the 90-day authorized punishment on which the Court focused in determining that the offense was not one for which the Constitution assured trial by jury.","The Court cites Clawans approvingly as guidance for determining the line between petty offenses and serious crimes based on authorized penalties, using it as precedential support."
107685,106545,Gideon v. Wainwright,Mentioned,"and whether it is 'a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,' Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 343-344 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965).","Gideon v. Wainwright is cited as establishing the test for fundamental rights essential to a fair trial, with no criticism or negative treatment of the decision."
107685,95204,Maxwell v. Dow,Overruled,Maxwell held that no provision of the Bill of Rights applied to the States— a position long since repudiated — and that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not prevent a State from trying a defendant for a noncapital offense with fewer than 12 men on the jury.,"The Court explicitly states that Maxwell's position that no provision of the Bill of Rights applied to the States has been 'long since repudiated,' effectively overruling that aspect of the decision."
107685,106259,Irvin v. Dowd,Mentioned,"See also Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717, 721-722 (1961); United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 16 (1955); Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 , 122-123 (1866); People v. Garbutt, 17 Mich. 9, 27 (1868).","Irvin v. Dowd is cited in a string citation supporting the historical importance of jury trial, with no negative treatment or criticism of the decision."
104610,,,,,
107980,107685,Duncan v. Louisiana,Mentioned,"Only last Term we found that the right to trial by jury in criminal cases was 'fundamental to the American scheme of justice,' Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.","The Acting Decision cites Duncan v. Louisiana as supportive precedent for applying Bill of Rights guarantees to the States, using it to establish the framework for finding double jeopardy protections fundamental and applicable to states."
107980,102879,Palko v. Connecticut,Overruled,"Insofar as it is inconsistent with this holding, Palko v. Connecticut is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Palko v. Connecticut, stating that it represented an approach to constitutional rights that the Court's recent decisions have rejected, and that its 'watered-down' approach to applying Bill of Rights protections to states is no longer valid."
107980,94515,United States v. Ball,Mentioned,"This argument was answered here over 70 years ago in United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896). In that case Millard Fillmore Ball was indicted, together with two other men, for the murder of one William T. Box in the Indian Territory. He was acquitted and his codefendants were convicted.","The Acting Decision cites United States v. Ball as controlling precedent that supports petitioner's double jeopardy claim, using it to establish that a defendant cannot be retried after acquittal even when the original indictment was technically defective."
107980,107730,Sibron v. New York,Mentioned,"In Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 (1968), we held that a criminal case did not become moot upon the expiration of the sentence imposed. We noted 'the obvious fact of life that most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal consequences.'","The Acting Decision cites Sibron v. New York to establish that criminal cases remain justiciable even when sentences have expired due to potential collateral consequences, supporting the Court's jurisdiction to hear the case despite concurrent sentences."
107980,106862,Malloy v. Hogan,Mentioned,"In an increasing number of cases, the Court 'has rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a ""watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights ....""' Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10-11 (1964)","The Acting Decision cites Malloy v. Hogan as part of the line of precedent supporting the incorporation of Bill of Rights protections against the states, using it to build the foundation for applying the Double Jeopardy Clause to state proceedings."
107965,104914,Dennis v. United States,Criticized,"But in Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494 , we opened wide the door, distorting the 'clear and present danger' test beyond recognition.",The concurring opinion explicitly criticizes Dennis for distorting the clear and present danger test and describes it as making the trial an 'all-out political trial which was part and parcel of the cold war that has eroded substantial parts of the First Amendment.'
107965,102821,Herndon v. Lowry,Mentioned,"The Court in Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242 , overturned a conviction for exercising First Amendment rights to incite insurrection because of lack of evidence of incitement.","The decision is referenced positively as an example of proper application of First Amendment principles, but without any negative treatment or criticism of the cited decision itself."
107965,105537,Yates v. United States,Mentioned,"Advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow of government as an abstract principle is immune from prosecution. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 318 .","The decision is cited approvingly as establishing the principle that abstract advocacy is protected speech, without any criticism or negative treatment."
107965,99321,Frohwerk v. United States,Mentioned,"Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U. S. 204 , also authored by Mr. Justice Holmes, involved prosecution and punishment for publication of articles very critical of the war effort in World War I.","The decision is mentioned as part of the historical development of the clear and present danger test during World War I, without expressing approval or disapproval of the decision itself."
107965,99322,Debs v. United States,Mentioned,"Debs v. United States, 249 U. S. 211 , was the third of the trilogy of the 1918 Term. Debs was convicted of speaking in opposition to the war where his 'opposition was so expressed that its natural and intended effect would be to obstruct recruiting.'","The decision is mentioned as part of the World War I trilogy of cases that established the clear and present danger test, without expressing criticism or approval of the specific decision."
107965,101097,Whitney v. California,Overruled,"The contrary teaching of Whitney v. California, supra, cannot be supported, and that decision is therefore overruled.","The lead opinion explicitly states that Whitney v. California is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value regarding the constitutionality of criminal syndicalism statutes."
107979,104769,United States v. Rabinowitz,Overruled,"Rabinowitz and Harris have been the subject of critical commentary for many years, and have been relied upon less and less in our own decisions. It is time, for the reasons we have stated, to hold that on their own facts, and insofar as the principles they stand for are inconsistent with those that we have endorsed today, they are no longer to be followed.","The Court explicitly states that Rabinowitz is no longer to be followed insofar as its principles are inconsistent with the new rule established in Chimel, effectively overruling it."
107979,106641,Ker v. California,Mentioned,"Since that time, the rule of Weeks, Marron, Harris, and Rabinowitz has clearly been the law. E. g., Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., writing for the Court) ; Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963).","The case is merely cited as an example of decisions that followed the Rabinowitz rule, without any critical analysis or negative treatment by the Acting Decision."
107979,106021,Abel v. United States,Mentioned,"Since that time, the rule of Weeks, Marron, Harris, and Rabinowitz has clearly been the law. E. g., Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., writing for the Court) ; Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963).","The case is merely cited as an example of decisions that followed the Rabinowitz rule, without any critical analysis or negative treatment by the Acting Decision."
107979,98094,Weeks v. United States,Mentioned,"Approval of a warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest seems first to have been articulated by the Court in 1914 as dictum in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, in which the Court stated: 'What then is the present case? Before answering that inquiry specifically, it may be well by a process of exclusion to state what it is not. It is not an assertion of the right on the part of the Government, always recognized under English and American law, to search the person of the accused when legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime.'","The Court discusses Weeks as the historical starting point for search incident to arrest doctrine, providing context without criticizing or overruling the decision."
107979,104576,Trupiano v. United States,Mentioned,"Only a year after Harris, however, the pendulum swung again. In Trupiano v. United States, 334 U. S. 699, agents raided the site of an illicit distillery, saw one of several conspirators operating the still, and arrested him, contemporaneously 'seiz[ing] the illicit distillery.' Id., at 702. The Court held that the arrest and others made subsequently had been valid, but that the unexplained failure of the agents to procure a search warrant — in spite of the fact that they had had more than enough time before the raid to do so — rendered the search unlawful.","The Court discusses Trupiano as part of the historical development of search incident to arrest doctrine, noting how it was later overruled by Rabinowitz, without expressing any negative treatment toward Trupiano itself."
107979,101164,Marron v. United States,Mentioned,"And in Marron v. United States, 275 U. S. 192, two years later, the dictum of Agnello appeared to be the foundation of the Court's decision. In that case federal agents had secured a search, warrant authorizing the seizure of liquor and certain articles used in its manufacture.","The Court discusses Marron as part of the historical development of search incident to arrest doctrine, explaining how it expanded the scope of searches, without expressing criticism or negative treatment."
107979,101643,Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States,Mentioned,"That the Marron opinion did not mean all that it seemed to say became evident, however, a few years later in Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 344, and United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U. S. 452. In each of those cases the opinion of the Court was written by Mr. Justice Butler, the author of the opinion in Marron.","The Court discusses Go-Bart as part of the historical development showing how it limited the Marron decision, without expressing any negative treatment toward Go-Bart itself."
107979,107729,Terry v. Ohio,Mentioned,"Only last Term in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, we emphasized that 'the police must, whenever practicable, obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure,' id., at 20, and that '[t]he scope of [a] search must be 'strictly tied to and justified by' the circumstances which rendered its initiation permissible.'",The Court cites Terry favorably to support its reasoning about the warrant requirement and the need for searches to be strictly tied to their justifying circumstances.
107979,100567,Carroll v. United States,Mentioned,"Eleven years later the case of Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, brought the following embellishment of the Weeks statement: 'When a man is legally arrested for an offense, whatever is found upon his person or in his control which it is unlawful for him to have and which may be used to prove the offense may be seized and held as evidence in the prosecution.'","The Court discusses Carroll as part of the historical development of search incident to arrest doctrine, showing how it expanded upon Weeks, without expressing any negative treatment."
107979,104422,Harris v. United States,Overruled,"Rabinowitz and Harris have been the subject of critical commentary for many years, and have been relied upon less and less in our own decisions. It is time, for the reasons we have stated, to hold that on their own facts, and insofar as the principles they stand for are inconsistent with those that we have endorsed today, they are no longer to be followed.","The Court explicitly states that Harris is no longer to be followed insofar as its principles are inconsistent with the new rule established in Chimel, effectively overruling it."
107919,106850,Reynolds v. Sims,Mentioned,"Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 , held that a State in an apportionment of state representatives and senators among districts and counties could not deprive voters in the more populous counties of their proportionate share of representatives and senators. 'The right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government. And the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.' 377 U. S., at 555.","The Acting Decision cites Reynolds v. Sims favorably to support its reasoning about equal protection and voting rights, using it as precedential authority without any negative treatment."
107919,104593,MacDougall v. Green,Overruled,We have said enough to indicate why MacDougall v. Green is out of line with our recent apportionment cases... MacDougall v. Green is overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that MacDougall v. Green is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value after finding it inconsistent with recent apportionment cases."
107919,107449,Dusch v. Davis,Distinguished,"Dusch v. Davis, 387 U. S. 112 , is not relevant to the problem of this case. There each councilman was required to be a resident of the borough from which he was elected. Like the residence requirement for state senators from a multi-district county (Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U. S. 433 ), the place of residence did not mark the voting unit; for in Dusch all the electors in the city voted for each councilman.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Dusch v. Davis is not relevant to the current case and explains the factual differences that make it distinguishable from the present situation.
107919,104311,Colegrove v. Green,Mentioned,"While the majority cited Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549 , as their authority for denying relief and while a few who took part in Colegrove put this type of question in the 'political' as distinguished from the 'justiciable' category, 328 U. S., at 552 , that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 202.","The Acting Decision references Colegrove v. Green in the context of explaining how the justiciability issue it raised was later resolved by Baker v. Carr, without directly criticizing or overruling it."
107919,106366,Baker v. Carr,Mentioned,"that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 202 . When a State makes classifications of voters which favor residents of some counties over residents of other counties, a justiciable controversy is presented. 369 U. S., at 198-204.",The Acting Decision cites Baker v. Carr favorably as having authoritatively resolved the justiciability question and establishing that voter classification cases present justiciable controversies.
107748,90897,Civil Rights Cases,Distinguished,"Whatever the present validity of the position taken by the majority on that issue — a question rendered largely academic by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243 (see Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 ; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 ) — we note that the entire Court agreed upon at least one proposition: .The Thirteenth Amendment authorizes Congress not only to outlaw all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude but also to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of a society half slave and half free, by securing to all citizens, of every race and color, 'the same right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.'","The Court distinguishes the Civil Rights Cases by noting that while the earlier case dealt with public accommodations, the entire Court in that case agreed that the Thirteenth Amendment authorizes Congress to secure property rights for all citizens, which supports the Court's interpretation of § 1982."
107748,104546,Hurd v. Hodge,Distinguished,"The basic source of the injury in Hurd was, of course, the action of private individuals — white citizens who had agreed to exclude Negroes from a residential area. But an arm of the Government — in that case, a federal court — had assisted in the enforcement of that agreement. Thus Hurd v. Hodge, supra, did not present the question whether purely private discrimination, unaided by any action on the part of government, would violate § 1982 if its effect were to deny a citizen the right to rent or buy property solely because of his race or color.","The Court distinguishes Hurd v. Hodge by noting that while it involved private discrimination, it also involved governmental assistance through judicial enforcement, whereas the present case involves purely private discrimination without any governmental involvement."
107748,1447641,Hodges v. United States,Overruled,"The conclusion of the majority in Hodges rested upon a concept of congressional power under the Thirteenth Amendment irreconcilable with the position taken by every member of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases and incompatible with the history and purpose of the Amendment itself. Insofar as Hodges is inconsistent with our holding today, it is hereby overruled.","The Court explicitly overrules Hodges v. United States, stating that its narrow interpretation of the Thirteenth Amendment is incompatible with the Amendment's history and purpose and inconsistent with the Court's current holding."
107748,100887,Corrigan v. Buckley,Distinguished,"Even if Corrigan should be regarded as an adjudication that 42 U. S. C. § 1982 (then § 1978 of the Revised Statutes) does not prohibit private individuals from agreeing not to sell their property to Negroes, Corrigan would not settle the question whether § 1982 prohibits an actual refusal to sell to a Negro. Moreover, since the appellants in Corrigan had not even argued in this Court that the statute prohibited private agreements of the sort there involved, it would be a mistake to treat the Corrigan decision as a considered judgment even on that narrow issue.","The Court distinguishes Corrigan v. Buckley by noting that even if it held that § 1982 doesn't prohibit private agreements not to sell to Negroes, it doesn't address whether § 1982 prohibits actual refusals to sell, and the decision wasn't a considered judgment on the statutory interpretation issue."
107748,90040,Virginia v. Rives,Distinguished,"Two of this Court's early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action. Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 ; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17. But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra, actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial.","The Court distinguishes Virginia v. Rives by clarifying that its statements about § 1982 being limited to state action were merely dicta, and the case actually held something much narrower about removal of state prosecutions under a different statutory provision."
107973,1178568,"Adkins v. Lear, Inc. (1967)",Reversed,The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.,"The Acting Decision directly overturns the outcome of the California Supreme Court's decision in favor of Adkins, vacating the judgment and remanding for proceedings consistent with the new ruling that overrules licensee estoppel."
107973,106758,"Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. (1964)",Mentioned,"We granted certiorari in the present case, 391 U. S. 912 , to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule in the light of our recent decisions emphasizing the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection. Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225 (1964); Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U. S. 234 (1964).","The Cited Decision is referenced as supporting precedent for the federal policy favoring free competition in ideas, without any criticism or limitation of its holding."
107973,8928994,"Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc (1950)",Overruled,"We are satisfied that Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., supra, itself the product of a clouded history, should no longer be regarded as sound law with respect to its 'estoppel' holding, and that holding is now overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly nullifies the estoppel holding of the Cited Decision, stating it should no longer be regarded as sound law and explicitly overruling it."
107973,106757,"Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co. (1964)",Mentioned,"We granted certiorari in the present case, 391 U. S. 912 , to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule in the light of our recent decisions emphasizing the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection. Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225 (1964); Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U.

107973,100520,Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. v. Formica Insulation Co. (1924),Criticized,"Workable or not, the result proved to be an anomaly: if a patent had some novelty Formica permitted the old owner to defend an infringement action by showing that the invention's novel aspects did not extend to the inclusion of the old owner's products; on the other hand, if a patent had no novelty at all, the old owner could not defend successfully since he would be obliged to launch the direct attack on the patent that Formica seemed to forbid. The incongruity of this position compelled at least one court of appeals to carry the reasoning of the Formica exception to its logical conclusion.",The Acting Decision criticizes the Cited Decision as creating an anomalous and incongruous result that undermined the basis of patent estoppel doctrine.
107973,104194,Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Manufacturing Co. (1945),Mentioned,"In Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Manufacturing Co., 326 U. S. 249 (1945), this Court adopted a position similar to the Seventh Circuit's, undermining the basis of patent estoppel even more than Formica had done.","The Cited Decision is referenced as part of the historical development that undermined patent estoppel doctrine, but without direct criticism of its reasoning or result."
107973,103320,McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique (1940),Mentioned,"In McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430 (1940), the Court, while recognizing it had jurisdiction to determine whether a New York tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, refused to consider whether the tax was a prohibited impost or duty on imports and exports","The Cited Decision is referenced as precedent for the principle that courts should decline to consider questions not urged or considered in lower courts, without any criticism of its holding."
107973,104256,Wilson v. Cook (1946),Mentioned,"Wilson v. Cook, 327 U. S. 474 (1946), reached a similar conclusion. There the Court denied a government contractor the benefit of the implied constitutional immunity of the Federal Government from taxation by the State, but at the same time declined to consider whether the state tax at issue placed a forbidden tax directly on the United States.","The Cited Decision is referenced as supporting precedent for the principle that courts should not consider grounds not presented to or decided by lower courts, without any criticism."
107973,106930,Brulotte v. Thys Co. (1964),Mentioned,"This possibility and others serve to indicate the wisdom of refraining from any pronouncement now, and particularly from any rigid line drawing, in advance of consideration by the courts below and by the parties. Cf. Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U. S. 29, 31 (1964).","The Cited Decision is briefly referenced in the concurring opinion as a comparison point regarding post-patent royalties, without any substantive discussion or criticism of its holding."
108154,106432,Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson,Overruled,"Having concluded that Sinclair was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity, we overrule that decision and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Sinclair was erroneously decided and overrules that decision, directly nullifying its precedential value."
108154,105511,Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.,Mentioned,"Lincoln Mills held generally that 'the substantive law to apply in suits under § 301 (a) is federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws,' 353 U. S., at 456, and more specifically that a union can obtain specific performance of an employer's promise to arbitrate grievances.","The Acting Decision references Lincoln Mills to explain established precedent regarding federal labor law and arbitration, without criticizing or questioning its validity."
108154,107655,"Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, International Ass'n of MacHinists & Aerospace Workers",Mentioned,"Furthermore, in light of developments subsequent to Sinclair, in particular our decision in Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge 735, 390 U. S. 557 (1968), it has become clear that the Sinclair decision does not further but rather frustrates realization of an important goal of our national labor policy.","The Acting Decision cites Avco as a subsequent development that undermined Sinclair, but does not criticize Avco itself; rather uses it as support for overruling Sinclair."
108154,103292,Helvering v. Hallock,Mentioned,"[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.","The Acting Decision quotes Helvering v. Hallock to support its position on when stare decisis should not prevent reconsideration of precedent, using it as authority without any negative treatment."
108164,105594,Green v. United States,Mentioned,"The rationale of the Green holding applies here. The concept of continuing jeopardy implicit in the Ball case would allow petitioner's retrial for voluntary manslaughter after his first conviction for that offense had been reversed. But, as the Kepner and Green cases illustrate, this Court has consistently refused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after an acquittal, whether that acquittal is express or implied by a conviction on a lesser included offense when the jury was given a full opportunity to return a verdict on the greater charge.","The Acting Decision applies the rationale from Green v. United States to support its holding, treating it as controlling precedent without criticism or limitation."
108164,1276937,Price v. State (1968),Reversed,"The Georgia Court of Appeals then heard the appeal and affirmed the second conviction, rejecting petitioner's argument, among others, that his retrial for murder constituted double jeopardy... We granted the writ, 395 U. S. 975 (1969), and now reverse.","The Acting Decision directly overturns the Georgia Court of Appeals decision that affirmed petitioner's second conviction, explicitly stating 'and now reverse.'"
108164,5726506,Brantley v. State,Overruled,"While the Brantley holding may have had some vitality at the time the Georgia courts rendered their decisions in this case, it is no longer a viable authority and must now be deemed to have been overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Brantley is no longer viable authority and must be deemed overruled by subsequent Supreme Court decisions.
108164,94515,United States v. Ball,Mentioned,"In United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662, 669 (1896), this Court observed: 'The Constitution of the United States, in the Fifth Amendment, declares, 'nor shall any person be subject [for the same offense] to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.' The prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy . . . .'",The Acting Decision cites Ball to establish foundational principles about double jeopardy without criticizing or limiting its precedential value.
108164,1395638,Price v. State (1968),Mentioned,"but that court transferred the case to the Court of Appeals of Georgia, declaring that '[o]nly questions as to the application of plain and unambiguous provisions of the Constitution of the United States being involved, . . the case is one for the consideration of the Court of Appeals . . . Price v. State, 224 Ga. 306, 307 , 161 S. E. 2d 825, 826 (1968).",The Acting Decision merely references this procedural decision by the Georgia Supreme Court to transfer the case without any substantive treatment or analysis.
108164,8887067,United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins,Mentioned,"Further, and perhaps of more importance, we cannot determine whether or not the murder charge against petitioner induced the jury to find him guilty of the less serious offense of voluntary manslaughter rather than to continue to debate his innocence. See United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 913 (1966).","The Acting Decision cites Hetenyi v. Wilkins as supporting authority for the proposition that murder charges may influence jury verdicts on lesser offenses, without any negative treatment."
108114,105687,Hoag v. New Jersey,Distinguished,"The doctrine of Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 , puts the issues in the present case in a perspective quite different from that in which the issues were perceived in Hoag v. New Jersey, supra. The question is no longer whether collateral estoppel is a requirement of due process, but whether it is a part of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee against double jeopardy.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Hoag by explaining that the constitutional framework has changed since Benton v. Maryland, making the analysis different from what was applied in Hoag, even though the factual circumstances are virtually identical."
108114,105860,Abbate v. United States,Mentioned,"The two prosecutions, the first for the robbery of Knight and the second for the robbery of Roberts, grew out of one criminal episode, and therefore I think it clear on the facts of this case that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited Missouri from prosecuting petitioner for each robbery at a different trial. Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 196-201 (1959) (separate opinion).","The concurring opinion references Abbate to support the position that prosecutions arising from a single criminal episode should be barred, but does not criticize or question the precedential value of the decision."
108114,107978,North Carolina v. Pearce,Mentioned,"For whatever else that constitutional guarantee may embrace, North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 , it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to 'run the gantlet' a second time.",The Acting Decision cites Pearce as support for the broader principle of double jeopardy protection without any negative treatment or criticism of the decision.
108114,107980,Benton v. Maryland,Mentioned,"In Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 , the Court held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.","The Acting Decision relies on Benton as the foundational precedent that makes the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy guarantee applicable to state proceedings, treating it as established controlling law."
108114,105594,Green v. United States,Mentioned,"For whatever else that constitutional guarantee may embrace, North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 , it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to 'run the gantlet' a second time. Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 190 .","The Acting Decision cites Green favorably to support the principle that the double jeopardy guarantee protects against having to 'run the gantlet' a second time, using it as supportive authority without any negative treatment."
108362,90728,United States v. Harris,Distinguished,"The constitutionality of § 1985 (3) might once have appeared to have been settled adversely by United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 , and Baldwin v. Franks, 120 U. S. 678 , which held unconstitutional its criminal counterpart, then § 5519 of the Revised Statutes. The Court in those cases, however, followed a severability rule that required invalidation of an entire statute if any part of it was unconstitutionally overbroad, unless its different parts could be read as wholly independent provisions. This Court has long since firmly rejected that rule in such cases as United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 20-24 .","The Court distinguishes Harris by explaining that the severability rule applied in that case has been rejected, allowing the current Court to uphold § 1985(3) even if some applications might be unconstitutional."
108362,107201,United States v. Guest,Mentioned,"Our cases have firmly established that the right of interstate travel is constitutionally protected, does not necessarily rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, and is assertable against private as well as governmental interference. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 629-631 ; id., at 642-644 (concurring opinion); United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745 , 757-760 and n. 17","The Court cites Guest as supportive authority for the proposition that the right of interstate travel is constitutionally protected and can be asserted against private interference, without any negative treatment."
108362,107748,Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.,Mentioned,"The approach of this Court to other Reconstruction civil rights statutes in the years since Collins has been to 'accord [them] a sweep as broad as [their] language.' United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 801 ; Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409, 437 .","The Court cites Jones favorably as support for giving civil rights statutes broad interpretation, and later relies on it for Thirteenth Amendment authority without any criticism or limitation."
108362,96885,Twining v. New Jersey,Mentioned,"The 'right to pass freely from State to State' has been explicitly recognized as 'among the rights and privileges of National citizenship.' Twining v. New Jersey, supra, at 97 . That right, like other rights of national citizenship, is within the power of Congress to protect by appropriate legislation.","The Court cites Twining as supportive authority for the principle that interstate travel is a right of national citizenship that Congress can protect, without any negative treatment."
108362,104918,Collins v. Hardyman,Limited,"Whether or not Collins v. Hardyman was correctly decided on its own facts is a question with which we need not here be concerned. But it is clear, in the light of the evolution of decisional law in the years that have passed since that case was decided, that many of the constitutional problems there perceived simply do not exist. Little reason remains, therefore, not to accord to the words of the statute their apparent meaning.","The Court significantly narrows the scope and applicability of Collins by explaining that constitutional developments have eliminated the problems that led to its restrictive interpretation, effectively limiting its precedential value."
108350,103548,Reitz v. Mealey,Overruled,We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of Kesler and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than one of frustration.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states it can no longer adhere to the doctrine of Reitz and characterizes it as 'aberrational,' directly overruling the precedential value of the Cited Decision."
108350,1198518,Schecter v. Killingsworth,Mentioned,"In Schecter v. Killingsworth, 93 Ariz. 273, 380 P. 2d 136 (1963), the Supreme Court of Arizona held that [t]he Financial Responsibility Act has for its principal purpose the protection of the public using the highways from financial hardship which may result from the use of automobiles by financially irresponsible persons.","The Acting Decision cites Schecter to establish the Arizona Supreme Court's construction of the state statute's purpose, using it as authoritative precedent without criticism or negative treatment."
108350,288328,Perez v. Campbell (Court of Appeals),Reversed,The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.,"The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals judgment in the same case, directly overturning the lower court's ruling."
108350,106365,Kesler v. Department of Public Safety of Utah,Overruled,We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of Kesler and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than one of frustration.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states it can no longer adhere to the doctrine of Kesler and characterizes it as 'aberrational,' directly overruling the precedential value of the Cited Decision."
108350,100616,Lewis v. Roberts,Mentioned,"There can be no doubt, given Lewis v. Roberts, 267 U. S. 467 (1925), that Congress intended this 'new opportunity' to include freedom from most kinds of pre-existing tort judgments.","The Acting Decision cites Lewis v. Roberts as supportive authority for the proposition that Congress intended bankruptcy discharge to provide freedom from pre-existing tort judgments, without any negative treatment."
108730,104590,Ahrens v. Clark,Limited,"In view of these developments since Ahrens v. Clark, we can no longer view that decision as establishing an inflexible jurisdictional rule, dictating the choice of an inconvenient forum even in a class of cases which could not have been foreseen at the time of our decision.","The Court explicitly narrows the scope and applicability of Ahrens v. Clark by stating it cannot be viewed as establishing an inflexible jurisdictional rule, thereby limiting its precedential value and authority."
108730,107824,Smith v. Hooey,Mentioned,"alleging denial of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969), and praying that an order issue directing respondent to afford him an immediate trial on a then three-year-old Kentucky indictment.","The Court references Smith v. Hooey as establishing the constitutional right to a speedy trial that forms the basis of petitioner's claim, without criticizing or limiting the decision's precedential value."
108730,107679,Peyton v. Rowe,Mentioned,"Prior to our decision in Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), the 'prematurity doctrine' of McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934), would, of course, have barred his petition for relief. But our decision in Peyton v. Rowe discarded the prematurity doctrine","The Court cites Peyton v. Rowe favorably as the decision that discarded the prematurity doctrine and enabled the current action, providing additional clarification of its application without questioning its precedential value."
108730,91598,Ex Parte Royall,Distinguished,"It is also true, as our Brother Rehnquist points out in dissent, that federal habeas corpus does not lie, absent 'special circumstances,' to adjudicate the merits of an affirmative defense to a state criminal charge prior to a judgment of conviction by a state court. Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 253 (1886). Petitioner does not, however, seek at this time to litigate a federal defense to a criminal charge, but only to demand enforcement of the Commonwealth's affirmative constitutional obligation to bring him promptly to trial.","The Court distinguishes Ex Parte Royall by explaining that the current case involves different facts - petitioner is not seeking to litigate a defense but to enforce the state's obligation to provide a speedy trial, thus requiring a different application of the law."
108730,108193,Nelson v. George,Mentioned,"Nor does petitioner challenge the 'present effect being given the [Kentucky] detainer by the [Alabama] authorities . . . .' Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224, 225 (1970).","The Court references Nelson v. George to clarify what petitioner is not challenging in this case, using it for additional clarification without affecting its precedential value."
108721,102839,Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co.,Mentioned,"Thus, in Carmichael v. Southern Coal Co., 301 U. S. 495 , the Court, in sustaining an unemployment tax on employers, said: 'A state legislature, in the enactment of laws, has the widest possible latitude within the limits of the Constitution. In the nature of the case it cannot record a complete catalogue of, the considerations which move its members to enact laws. In the absence of such a record courts cannot assume that its action is capricious, or that, with its informed acquaintance with local conditions to which the legis lation is to be applied, it was not aware of facts which afford reasonable basis for its action. Only by faithful adherence to this guiding principle of judicial review of legislation is it possible to preserve to the legislative branch its rightful independence and its ability to function.'","The Acting Decision cites Carmichael favorably to support the principle that courts should defer to legislative judgment in taxation matters, using it as precedential authority without criticism or limitation."
108721,2042261,Lake Shore Auto Parts Co. v. Korzen,Reversed,"All respondents in both cases appealed to the Illinois Supreme Court, which held that Art. IX-A did not affect all forms of real and personal property taxes but only personal property taxes on individuals, which it construed to mean 'ad valorem taxation of personal property owned by a natural person or by two or more natural persons as joint tenants or tenants in common.' 49 Ill. 2d 137, 148 , 273 N. E. 2d 592, 597 . As so construed, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the tax violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.","The Acting Decision directly overturns the Illinois Supreme Court's ruling that found the tax violated the Equal Protection Clause, as evidenced by the final word 'Reversed' in the opinion."
108721,103290,Madden v. Kentucky Ex Rel. Commissioner,Mentioned,"In Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83 , a State laid an ad valorem tax of 50$ per $100 on deposits in banks outside the State and only 10(i per $1,000 on deposits within the State. The classification was sustained against the charge of invidious discrimination, the Court noting that 'in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.'",The Acting Decision cites Madden favorably as precedential support for the principle that legislatures have great freedom in tax classification and that there is a presumption of constitutionality.
108721,97378,Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.,Mentioned,"Each of these dissenters thought Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107 , should govern Quaker City Cab. The Flint case involved a federal tax upon the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity, but it was not laid on businesses carried on by a partnership or private individual.","The Acting Decision references Flint as precedent that supports differential taxation between corporations and individuals, citing it favorably for the principle that corporations have distinctive privileges that justify separate tax treatment."
108721,101317,Quaker City Cab Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,Overruled,"Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania is only a relic of a bygone era. We cannot follow it and stay within the narrow confines of judicial review, which is an important part of our constitutional tradition.","The Acting Decision explicitly declares that Quaker City Cab is 'only a relic of a bygone era' and states they 'cannot follow it,' effectively overruling its precedential value."
108889,101340,Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Baldridge,Overruled,"The Liggett case, being a derelict in the stream of the law, is hereby overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the Liggett case is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value and characterizing it as inconsistent with current constitutional doctrine."
108889,107235,Mills v. Alabama,Mentioned,"Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 , involved the constitutionality of a state statute in effect making it a crime for a newspaper editor on election day to urge people to vote a certain way on the issues being submitted. The state court held the act did not violate the Federal Constitution and remanded the case for trial. It was argued that the judgment was not 'final' for purposes of 28 U. S. C. § 1257 . We noted that the point had 'a surface plausibility, since it is true the judgment of the State Supreme Court did not literally end the case.' 384 U. S., at 217 . We held it 'final,' however, because if the Act were constitutional the editor wbuld in reality have no defense.","The Acting Decision references Mills v. Alabama as precedent supporting the finality analysis without any criticism or limitation, using it to support the court's reasoning on jurisdictional requirements."
108889,86449,Forgay v. Conrad,Mentioned,"The exceptions noted have a long lineage dating back to Mr. Chief Justice Taney's opinion in Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201 , where the Court held 'final' an interlocutory decree requiring a litigant 'to deliver up property which he claims,' even though a final accounting has yet to be made.","The Acting Decision cites Forgay v. Conrad as historical precedent establishing exceptions to the finality requirement, referencing it neutrally to trace the lineage of the legal doctrine without any negative treatment."
108889,104183,"Radio Station Wow, Inc. v. Johnson",Mentioned,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, writing for the Court in Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, 326 U. S. 120, 124 , summarized the requirement by Congress that in appeals from federal district courts as well as in review of state court decisions the judgments be 'final': 'This requirement has the support of considerations generally applicable to good judicial administration.'","The Acting Decision references Radio Station WOW v. Johnson as authoritative precedent explaining the finality requirement, quoting it approvingly to support the court's jurisdictional analysis without any criticism or limitation."
108186,107685,Duncan v. Louisiana,Mentioned,"In Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), we held that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right to trial by jury in all criminal cases that — were they to be tried in a federal court — would come within the Sixth Amendment's guarantee.","The Acting Decision references Duncan v. Louisiana as establishing precedent for the right to jury trial, using it as foundational authority without criticizing or questioning its validity."
108186,94866,Thompson v. Utah,Criticized,"The leading case so construing the Sixth Amendment is Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898)... Noticeably absent was any discussion of the essential step in the argument: namely, that every feature of the jury as it existed at common law — whether incidental or essential to that institution — was necessarily included in the Constitution wherever that document referred to a 'jury.'","The Acting Decision criticizes Thompson v. Utah for its lack of analysis and reasoning, pointing out that it made assumptions without proper justification for equating constitutional and common-law characteristics of juries."
108186,95043,Capital Traction Co. v. Hof,Mentioned,"See Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 13-14 (1899); American Publishing Co. v. Fisher, 166 U. S. 464, 468 (1897).","The Acting Decision merely cites Capital Traction Co. v. Hof as an example of cases that interpret Seventh Amendment jury trial provisions, without significant discussion or analysis."
108186,106862,Malloy v. Hogan,Mentioned,"Given Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964), I join that part of the Court's opinion in No. 927 relating to the Florida 'alibi' procedure.","Justice Harlan references Malloy v. Hogan as a basis for joining part of the Court's opinion regarding the alibi procedure, treating it as established precedent without criticism."
108186,96270,Rassmussen v. United States,Mentioned,"See Patton v. United States, 281 U. S. 276, 288 (1930); Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U. S. 516, 519 (1905); Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S. 581, 586 (1900).","The Acting Decision cites Rassmussen v. United States as one of several cases that reaffirmed the 12-person jury requirement, without significant analysis or criticism of the decision itself."
108186,92280,Callan v. Wilson,Mentioned,"It is to the distinction between 'petty' and 'serious' offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937); Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65 (1904); Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 552 (1888).","The Acting Decision references Callan v. Wilson as precedent for distinguishing between petty and serious offenses in determining jury trial rights, treating it as established authority."
108186,106641,Ker v. California,Mentioned,"In Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963), I noted in an opinion concurring in the result that: 'The rule [of 'incorporation'] is unwise because the States, with their differing law enforcement problems, should not be put in a constitutional strait jacket....'","Justice Harlan references his own concurring opinion in Ker v. California to support his argument against the incorporation doctrine, using it as precedent for his position without criticizing the case itself."
108186,102801,District of Columbia v. Clawans,Mentioned,"It is to the distinction between 'petty' and 'serious' offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937); Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65 (1904); Callan v. Wilson, 127 U.

Clawans as precedent for the distinction between petty and serious offenses in jury trial rights, treating it as established authority without criticism."
108186,107486,United States v. Wade,Mentioned,"Although I have disagreed with particular holdings like Gilbert v. California, supra, where the Court held that the States must arrange presence of counsel at lineups, see Mr. Justice White's separate opinion in United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 250 (1967), which I joined...","Justice Harlan references United States v. Wade in the context of discussing his agreement with Justice White's separate opinion, treating it as precedent without criticism of the case itself."

109346,108288,Durham v. United States,Overruled,"To the extent that Durham v. United States, 401 U. S. 481 (1971), may be inconsistent with this ruling, Durham is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Durham is overruled to the extent it may be inconsistent with the current ruling, which directly nullifies parts of the Cited Decision's precedential value."
109514,321071,"Nancy Dukes, D/B/A Louisiana Concessions v. The City of New Orleans",Reversed,"The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed. 501 F. 2d 706 (1974). We postponed the question of this Court's jurisdiction to a hearing on the merits, 421 U. S. 908 (1975). We hold that we have jurisdiction of appellant's appeal, and on the merits reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that it reverses the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which is the same case being appealed to the Supreme Court."
109514,105546,Morey v. Doud,Overruled,"Actually, the reliance on the statutes potential irrationality in Morey v. Doud, as the dissenters in that case correctly pointed out, see 354 U. S., at 474-475 (Frankfurter, J., joined by Harlan, J., dissenting), was a needlessly intrusive judicial infringement on the States legislative powers, and we have concluded that the equal protection analysis employed in that opinion should no longer be followed. Morey was the only case in the last half century to invalidate a wholly economic regulation solely on equal protection grounds, and we are now satisfied that the decision was erroneous... the decision so far departs from proper equal protection analysis in cases of exclusively economic regulation that it should be, and it is, overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Morey v. Doud was erroneous and should be overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value."
109514,105285,"Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.",Mentioned,"Legislatures may implement their program step by step, Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966), in such economic areas, adopting regulations that only partially ameliorate a perceived evil and deferring complete elimination of the evil to future regulations. See, e. g., Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 488-489 (1955).","The Acting Decision cites Williamson v. Lee Optical as supportive authority for the principle that legislatures may implement programs step by step, without any negative treatment or criticism."
109514,106576,Ferguson v. Skrupa,Mentioned,"in the local economic sphere, it is only the invidious discrimination., the wholly arbitrary act, which cannot stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g., Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 732 (1963).","The Acting Decision cites Ferguson v. Skrupa as supportive authority for the principle regarding equal protection analysis in economic regulation cases, without any negative treatment."
109514,107256,Katzenbach v. Morgan,Mentioned,"The governing constitutional principle was stated in Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra, at 657: '[W]e are guided by the familiar principles that a statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did,' Roschen v. Ward, 279 U. S. 337, 339, that a legislature need not strike at all evils at the same time,' Semler v. Dental Examiners, 294 U. S. 608, 610, and that reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind,' Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 489.'","The Acting Decision cites Katzenbach v. Morgan as establishing the governing constitutional principle that supports the city's gradual approach to regulation, treating it as authoritative precedent."
109390,104216,Marsh v. Alabama,Mentioned,"It was the Marsh case that in 1968 provided the foundation for the Court's decision in Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308.","The Acting Decision references Marsh v. Alabama as foundational precedent for Logan Valley Plaza without criticizing or questioning its validity, merely explaining its historical role in the development of First Amendment jurisprudence."
109390,107692,"Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc.",Overruled,"But the fact is that the reasoning of the Court's opinion in Lloyd cannot be squared with the reasoning of the Court's opinion in Logan Valley... we make clear now, if it was not clear before, that the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive the Court's decision in the Lloyd case.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Logan Valley's rationale did not survive Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner and makes clear that Logan Valley is effectively overruled, nullifying its precedential value."
109390,108592,Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner,Mentioned,"Four years later the Court had occasion to reconsider the Logan Valley doctrine in Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551. That case involved a shopping center covering some 50 acres in downtown Portland, Ore.","The Acting Decision discusses Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner extensively as controlling precedent that effectively overruled Logan Valley, treating it as authoritative law without criticism or limitation."
109390,105389,National Labor Relations Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co.,Mentioned,The Babcock & Wilcox opinion established the basic objective under the Act: accommodation of § 7 rights and private property rights 'with as little destruction of one as is consistent with the maintenance of the other.',"The Acting Decision cites Babcock & Wilcox as establishing the controlling standard for balancing Section 7 rights with property rights under the National Labor Relations Act, treating it as authoritative precedent."
109390,108591,Central Hardware Co. v. National Labor Relations Board,Mentioned,"Under the Act the task of the Board, subject to review by the courts, is to resolve conflicts between § 7 rights and private property rights, 'and to seek a proper accommodation between the two.' Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S., at 543.","The Acting Decision references Central Hardware as supporting authority for the Board's task of accommodating competing rights under the National Labor Relations Act, treating it as established precedent without criticism."
109570,1489061,Walker v. Hall (1975),Reversed,"A three-judge court convened under 28 U. S. C. § 2281 sustained the constitutionality of the statutory differential and dismissed the action. 399 F. Supp. 1304 (1975). We noted probable jurisdiction of appellants' appeal, 423 U. S. 1047 (1976). We reverse.","The Acting Decision directly overturns the outcome of the District Court's decision in Walker v. Hall, which had sustained the constitutionality of Oklahoma's gender-based beer statute."
109570,109235,Stanton v. Stanton (1975),Mentioned,"And only two Terms ago, Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7 (1975), expressly stating that Reed v. Reed was 'controlling,' 421 U. S., at 13, held that Reed required invalidation of a Utah differential age-of-majority statute","The Acting Decision cites Stanton v. Stanton as supportive precedent that follows Reed v. Reed in invalidating gender-based statutory classifications, without criticizing or questioning its authority."
109570,108404,Reed v. Reed (1971),Mentioned,"Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that Reed emphasized that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are 'subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.' 404 U. S., at 75. To withstand constitutional challenge, previous cases establish that classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.","The Acting Decision relies on Reed v. Reed as controlling precedent that establishes the standard for gender-based classifications under equal protection analysis, applying its principles to the case at hand."
109570,105152,Barrows v. Jackson (1953),Mentioned,"our decisions have settled that limitations on a litigant's assertion of jus tertii are not constitutionally mandated, but rather stem from a salutary 'rule of self-restraint' designed to minimize unwarranted intervention into controversies where the applicable constitutional questions are ill-defined and speculative. See, e. g., Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249, 255, 257 (1953)","The Acting Decision cites Barrows v. Jackson as supportive precedent regarding third-party standing doctrine, using it to support the vendor's standing to assert equal protection claims on behalf of young males."
109570,108497,Stanley v. Illinois (1972),Mentioned,"Decisions following Reed similarly have rejected administrative ease and convenience as sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-based classifications. See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 656 (1972)","The Acting Decision cites Stanley v. Illinois as an example of cases following Reed that reject administrative convenience as justification for gender-based classifications, supporting the Court's analysis."
109570,109013,Kahn v. Shevin (1974),Distinguished,"Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498 (1975), upholding the use of gender-based classifications, rested upon the Court's perception of the laudatory purposes of those laws as remedying disadvantageous conditions suffered by women in economic and military life. See 416 U. S., at 353-354; 419 U. S., at 508. Needless to say, in this case Oklahoma does not suggest that the age-sex differential was enacted to ensure the availability of 3.2% beer for women as compensation for previous deprivations.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Kahn v. Shevin by noting that unlike that case, which involved remedial purposes for women's disadvantages, Oklahoma's statute serves no such compensatory purpose."
109570,108781,Frontiero v. Richardson (1973),Mentioned,"Decisions following Reed similarly have rejected administrative ease and convenience as sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-based classifications. See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 656 (1972); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 690 (1973)","The Acting Decision cites Frontiero v. Richardson as an example of cases following Reed that reject administrative convenience as justification for gender-based classifications, supporting the Court's equal protection analysis."
109570,108489,Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972),Mentioned,"Indeed, the jus tertii question raised here is answered by our disposition of a like argument in Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra. There, as here, a state statute imposed legal duties and disabilities upon the claimant, who was convicted of distributing a package of contraceptive foam to a third party.","The Acting Decision uses Eisenstadt v. Baird as controlling precedent to resolve the third-party standing issue, drawing parallels between the vendor's situation and Baird's standing to defend third-party privacy interests."
109570,109132,Schlesinger v. Ballard (1975),Distinguished,"Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.

109570,104606,Goesaert v. Cleary (1948),Overruled,"Insofar as Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948), may be inconsistent, that decision is disapproved.","The Acting Decision explicitly disapproves Goesaert v. Cleary, indicating that its equal protection analysis regarding gender-based classifications in alcohol regulation is no longer valid precedent."
109532,108605,Furman v. Georgia,Distinguished,"While Furman did not hold that the infliction of the death penalty per se violates the Constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishments, it did recognize that the penalty of death is different in kind from any other punishment imposed under our system of criminal justice. Because of the uniqueness of the death penalty, Furman held that it could not be imposed under sentencing procedures that created a substantial risk that it would be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.","The Court distinguishes Furman by explaining that while Furman found constitutional problems with arbitrary sentencing procedures, it did not hold the death penalty unconstitutional per se, and the new Georgia procedures address Furman's concerns about arbitrariness."
109532,105659,Trop v. Dulles,Mentioned,"As Mr. Chief Justice Warren said, in an oft-quoted phrase, '[t]he Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.' Trop v. Dulles, supra, at 101.","The Court cites Trop v. Dulles for the well-established principle that the Eighth Amendment must be interpreted according to evolving standards of decency, without any negative treatment of the precedent."
109532,1220970,Coley v. State,Mentioned,"As a result, while some jury discretion still exists, 'the discretion to be exercised is controlled by clear and objective standards so as to produce non-discriminatory application.' Coley v. State, 231 Ga. 829, 834, 204 S. E. 2d 612, 615 (1974).",The Court cites Coley favorably to demonstrate that the Georgia Supreme Court has interpreted the new sentencing procedures as providing adequate guidance to control jury discretion.
109532,1391146,Jarrell v. State,Mentioned,"On the other hand, the court expressly reversed a finding of great risk when the victim was simply kid-naped in a parking lot. See Jarrell v. State, 234 Ga. 410, 424, 216 S. E. 2d 258, 269 (1975).","The Court cites Jarrell as an example of how the Georgia Supreme Court has narrowly construed statutory aggravating circumstances, demonstrating that the court provides meaningful review to prevent arbitrary application."
109532,1335744,Gregg v. State,Mentioned,"The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed the convictions and the imposition of the death sentences for murder. 233 Ga. 117, 210 S. E. 2d 659 (1974).","This is simply a factual reference to the lower court decision in the same case, noting that the Georgia Supreme Court affirmed the death sentences that are now under review."
109532,97242,Weems v. United States,Mentioned,"The Court early recognized that 'a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth.' Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 373 (1910). Thus the Clause forbidding 'cruel and unusual' punishments 'is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.'",The Court cites Weems favorably to support the principle that the Eighth Amendment should be interpreted dynamically rather than being limited to 18th century understandings of cruel and unusual punishment.
109532,1260876,People v. Anderson,Mentioned,"In the only statewide referendum occurring since Furman and brought to our attention, the people of California adopted a constitutional amendment that authorized capital punishment, in effect negating a prior ruling by the Supreme Court of California in People v. Anderson, 6 Cal. 3d 628, 493 P. 2d 880, cert. denied, 406 U. S. 958 (1972), that the death penalty violated the California Constitution.","The Court mentions Anderson as an example of a state court decision that was overturned by popular referendum, using it to demonstrate public support for capital punishment rather than criticizing the decision itself."
109532,1381163,Moore v. State,Mentioned,"The court on another occasion stated that 'we view it to be our duty under the similarity standard to assure that no death sentence is affirmed unless in similar cases throughout the state the death penalty has been imposed generally . . .' Moore v. State, 233 Ga. 861, 864, 213 S. E. 2d 829, 832 (1975).",The Court cites Moore favorably to demonstrate that the Georgia Supreme Court takes its proportionality review responsibilities seriously in ensuring death sentences are not disproportionate.
109532,2097666,Commonwealth v. O'Neal,Mentioned,"The Ehrlich study, in short, is of little, if any, assistance in assessing the deterrent impact of the death penalty. Accord, Commonwealth v. O'Neal, -Mass. -, -, 339 N. E. 2d 676, 684 (1975).","This citation appears in Justice Marshall's dissenting opinion, where he cites Commonwealth v. O'Neal in agreement with his view that empirical studies do not support the deterrent effect of capital punishment."
109532,106451,Robinson v. California,Mentioned,"The substantive limits imposed by the Eighth Amendment on what can be made criminal and punished were discussed in Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962). The Court found unconstitutional a state statute that made the status of being addicted to a narcotic drug a criminal offense.","The Court cites Robinson as an example of how the Eighth Amendment has been applied to find certain punishments unconstitutional, using it to illustrate the evolution of Eighth Amendment jurisprudence without any negative treatment."
109532,108329,McGautha v. California,Limited,"In McGautha v. California, supra, this Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require that a jury be provided with standards to guide its decision whether to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment or death or that the capital-sentencing proceeding be separated from the guilt-determination process. McGautha was not an Eighth Amendment decision, and to the extent it purported to deal with Eighth Amendment concerns, it must be read in light of the opinions in Furman v. Georgia.","The Court limits McGautha by explaining that it was a Due Process case rather than an Eighth Amendment case, and that Furman has substantially undermined McGautha's assumptions about standardless sentencing procedures."
109508,105999,National Labor Relations Board v. Insurance Agents' International Union,Mentioned,"Insurance Agents, supra, involved a charge of a refusal by the union to bargain in good faith in violation of § 8 (b) (3) of the Act. The charge was based on union activities that occurred during good-faith bargaining over the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement.","The Court extensively discusses Insurance Agents as supportive precedent for its holding that certain union activities are protected from state regulation because Congress intended them to be controlled by free economic forces, without criticizing or limiting the decision."
109508,104636,"International Union, U. A. W. A., A. F. of L., Local 232 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board",Overruled,"We hold today that the ruling of Briggs-Stratton, permitting state regulation of partial strike activities such as are involved in this case is likewise 'no longer of general application.' ... Briggs-Stratton is expressly overruled.",The Court explicitly states that Briggs-Stratton is 'expressly overruled' because it conflicts with the federal policy of leaving certain economic weapons unregulated by both federal and state authorities.
109508,105866,San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,Mentioned,"Federal labor policy as reflected in the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, has been construed not to preclude the States from regulating aspects of labor relations that involve 'conduct touch [ing] interests so deeply rooted in local feeling and responsibility that ... we could not infer that Congress had deprived the States of the power to act.' San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236, 244 (1959).","The Court cites Garmon as establishing the framework for federal preemption analysis in labor law, using it as foundational precedent without any negative treatment."
109508,107123,"Hanna Mining Co. v. District 2, Marine Engineers Beneficial Ass'n",Mentioned,"'[T]he legislative purpose may . . . dictate that certain activity neither protected nor prohibited' be deemed privileged against state regulation.' Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181, 187 (1965).",The Court cites Hanna Mining as support for the principle that Congress may intend certain activities to be privileged against state regulation even when they are neither explicitly protected nor prohibited by federal law.
109508,106827,"Local 20, Teamsters, Chauffeurs & Helpers Union v. Morton",Mentioned,"Central to Morton's analysis was the observation that ' [i] n selecting which forms of economic pressure should be prohibited . . . , Congress struck the 'balance . . . between the uncontrolled power of management and labor to further their respective interests,' ' id,., at 258-259","The Court relies on Morton as precedent supporting the principle that Congress struck a balance between labor and management interests, and that state interference with this balance frustrates federal policy."
109508,107886,Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co.,Mentioned,"Whether self-help economic activities are employed by employer or union, the crucial inquiry regarding pre-emption is the same: whether 'the exercise of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act's processes.' Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S., at 380.","The Court cites Railroad Trainmen as establishing the test for determining when state authority is preempted in labor relations, using it as supportive precedent for the preemption analysis."
109344,85534,Brown v. Maryland,Distinguished,"But the opinion in Brown v. Maryland cannot properly be read to propose such a broad definition of 'imposts' or 'duties.' The tax there held to be prohibited by the Import-Export Clause was imposed under a Maryland statute that required importers of foreign goods, and wholesalers selling the same by bale or package, to obtain a license and pay a $50 fee therefor, subject to certain forfeitures and penalties for noncompliance.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Brown v. Maryland by clarifying that its holding was limited to license fees on importers and did not establish a broad prohibition against all nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes on imported goods.
109344,88429,Low v. Austin,Overruled,"We hold that, in any event, Georgia's assessment of a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax against the imported tires is not within the constitutional prohibition against laying 'any Imposts or Duties on Imports . . and that insofar as Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29 (1872) is to the contrary, that decision is overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly overrules Low v. Austin, stating that it was wrongly decided and misread the precedent in Brown v. Maryland regarding the scope of prohibited imposts and duties."
109344,105833,Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers,Mentioned,"Taxes imposed after an initial sale, after the breakup of the shipping packages, or the moment goods imported for use are committed to current operational needs are also all likely to have an incidental effect on the volume of goods imported; yet all are permissible. See, e. g., Waring v. The Mayor, 8 Wall. 110 (1869) (taxation after initial sale); May v. New Orleans, supra (taxation after breakup of shipping packages); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 534 (1959) (taxation of goods committed to current operational needs by manufacturer).",The Acting Decision merely cites Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers as an example of permissible taxation without any critical analysis or challenge to its precedential value.
109344,86429,Thurlow v. Massachusetts,Distinguished,"Low v. Austin quoted this excerpt, 13 Wall., at 33-34, as supporting the holding, id., at 34, that 'a tax upon [imported goods], in any shape, is within the constitutional prohibition.' But Mr. Chief Justice Taney said much more in his opinion in the License Cases, and what he said further makes crystal clear that the prohibition applied only to state exactions upon imports as imports and did not apply to nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes.","The Acting Decision distinguishes the License Cases (which includes Thurlow v. Massachusetts) by showing that Chief Justice Taney's complete opinion actually supported nondiscriminatory property taxes, contrary to how Low v. Austin had interpreted and quoted only a portion of his reasoning."
109615,104587,Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Stone,Mentioned,"The narrowing of the rule to one of draftsmanship and phraseology began with another Mississippi case, Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, 335 U. S. 80 (1948).","The Court references Memphis Gas as an example of how the Spector rule was narrowed to draftsmanship issues, but does not criticize or question the decision itself."
109615,109239,Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle,Mentioned,"The unsatisfactory operation of the Spector rule is well demonstrated by our recent case of Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle, 421 U. S. 100 (1975).","The Court uses Colonial Pipeline as an example to demonstrate problems with the Spector rule, but affirms and relies on Colonial Pipeline's reasoning without criticizing the decision itself."
109615,104869,"Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor",Overruled,"Accordingly, we now reject the rule of Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor, that a state tax on the 'privilege of doing business' is per se unconstitutional when it is applied to interstate commerce, and that case is overruled.","The Court explicitly states that it is overruling Spector Motor Service, directly nullifying the precedential value of that decision's rule regarding privilege taxes on interstate commerce."
109615,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,Mentioned,"It is a truism that the mere act of carrying on business in interstate commerce does not exempt a corporation from state taxation. It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business.' Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938).","The Court favorably cites Western Live Stock to support its position that interstate commerce should pay its fair share of state taxes, using it as authority without any negative treatment."
109615,105828,"Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. Virginia",Mentioned,"In upholding the statute, the Court's opinion recognized that the rule against taxing the 'privilege' of doing interstate business had created a situation where 'the use of magic words or labels' could 'disable an otherwise constitutional levy.' Id., at 441.","The Court references Railway Express II to illustrate how the Spector rule had become merely a matter of draftsmanship, but does not criticize the Railway Express decision itself."
109716,107491,"United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co. (1967)",Overruled,"Accordingly, we conclude that the per se rule stated in Schwinn must be overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the per se rule established in Schwinn must be overruled, directly nullifying the precedential value of that decision's core holding."
109716,336461,"Gte Sylvania Incorporated v. Continental T v. Inc., a Corporation (1976)",Reversed,"Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.","This is the lower court decision in the same case that the Acting Decision is reviewing on appeal, and the Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision, which had reversed the District Court's ruling."
109716,105646,Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States (1958),Mentioned,"We revert to the standard articulated in Northern Pac. R. Co., and reiterated in White Motor, for determining whether vertical restrictions must be 'conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.'","The Acting Decision references Northern Pacific Railway to establish the standard for determining when per se rules are appropriate, using it as authoritative precedent without criticism or limitation."
109716,1458770,"United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co. (1965)",Mentioned,The District Court rejected the price-fixing allegation because of a failure of proof and held that Schwinn's limitation of retail bicycle sales to franchised retailers was permissible under § 1.,"The Acting Decision references the District Court decision in Schwinn to provide factual background and context for understanding the Supreme Court's Schwinn decision, without any negative treatment."
109450,108848,Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations,Distinguished,"The Court, however, upheld the ordinance on the ground that the restriction it imposed was permissible because the discriminatory hirings proposed by the advertisements, and by their newspaper layout, were themselves illegal.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Pittsburgh Press by noting that case involved advertisements for illegal discriminatory hiring, whereas the present case involves entirely lawful prescription drug transactions."
109450,109271,Bigelow v. Virginia,Mentioned,"Last Term, in Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975), the notion of unprotected 'commercial speech' all but passed from the scene.","The Acting Decision references Bigelow as precedent that moved away from the commercial speech exception, using it to support the evolution of First Amendment protection for commercial speech."
109450,106761,New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,Mentioned,"It is clear, for example, that speech does not lose its First Amendment protection because money is spent to project it, as in a paid advertisement of one form or another.","The Acting Decision cites New York Times Co. v. Sullivan as established precedent that paid advertisements can receive First Amendment protection, supporting the argument for protecting commercial speech."
109450,2239749,Patterson Drug Company v. Kingery,Distinguished,"The District Court seized on the identity of the plaintiff-appellees as consumers as a feature distinguishing the present case from Patterson Drug Co. v. Kingery, supra. Because the unsuccessful plaintiffs in that earlier case were pharmacists, the court said, 'theirs was a prima facie commercial approach.'","The Acting Decision distinguishes Patterson Drug by noting that the earlier case involved pharmacists as plaintiffs with commercial interests, while the present case involves consumers asserting health-related interests."
109450,103347,Thornhill v. Alabama,Mentioned,"The interests of the contestants in a labor dispute are primarily economic, but it has long been settled that both the employee and the employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome.","The Acting Decision cites Thornhill as precedent showing that economic interests do not disqualify speech from First Amendment protection, supporting the argument for protecting commercial speech."
109450,2098134,"Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. v. State Board of Pharmacy",Mentioned,"The three-judge District Court declared the quoted portion of the statute 'void and of no effect,' Jurisdictional Statement, App. 1, and enjoined the defendant-appellants, the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy and the individual members of that Board, from enforcing it. 373 F. Supp. 683 (ED Va. 1974).","The Acting Decision simply references the lower court decision that it is reviewing on appeal, providing procedural background without expressing any treatment of the decision's reasoning."
109450,103654,Valentine v. Chrestensen,Limited,"Chrestensen's continued validity was questioned, and its holding was described as 'distinctly a limited one' that merely upheld 'a reasonable regulation of the manner in which commercial advertising could be distributed.'","The Acting Decision explicitly limits the scope and applicability of Valentine v. Chrestensen, narrowing its precedential value by describing it as having limited validity and a narrow holding."
109450,105285,"Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.",Distinguished,"The District Court recognized that this Court had upheld — against federal constitutional challenges other than on First Amendment grounds — state restrictions on the advertisement of prices for optometrists' services, Head v. New Mexico Board, 374 U. S. 424 (1963), for eyeglass frames, Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483 (1955), and for dentists' services, Semler v. Dental Examiners, 294 U. S. 608 (1935).","The Acting Decision distinguishes Williamson by noting it involved challenges on grounds other than the First Amendment, whereas the present case is based on First Amendment grounds."
109450,107970,National Labor Relations Board v. Gissel Packing Co.,Mentioned,"The interests of the contestants in a labor dispute are primarily economic, but it has long been settled that both the employee and the employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome.","The Acting Decision cites Gissel Packing as precedent showing that economic interests in labor disputes receive First Amendment protection, supporting the argument that commercial speech should also be protected."
109450,8985546,"Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove",Mentioned,"To this end, the free flow of commercial information is indispensable. See Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (1971) (Douglas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).",The Acting Decision references Justice Douglas's dissent in Dun & Bradstreet to support the argument that free flow of commercial information serves important societal interests.
109499,104222,New York v. United States (1946),Mentioned,"In New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), Mr. Chief Justice Stone, speaking for four Members of an eight-Member Court in rejecting the proposition that Congress could impose taxes on the States so long as it did so in a nondiscriminatory manner, observed: 'A State may, like a private individual, own real property and receive income. But in view of our former decisions we could hardly say that a general non-discriminatory real estate tax (apportioned), or an income tax laid upon citizens and States alike could be constitutionally applied to the State's capitol, its State-house, its public school houses, public parks, or its revenues from taxes or school lands, even though all real property and all income of the citizen .is taxed.'","The Acting Decision cites New York v. United States as supportive precedent for the principle that there are limits on Congress's power to regulate states, without criticizing or questioning its validity."
109499,109259,Fry v. United States (1975),Distinguished,"With regard to Fry, we disagree with appellee. There the Court held that the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 was constitutional as applied to temporarily freeze the wages of state and local government employees... We think our holding today quite consistent with Fry. The enactment at issue there was occasioned by an extremely serious problem which endangered the well-being of all the component parts of our federal system and which only collective action by the National Government might forestall.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Fry by explaining that the circumstances in Fry were different - it involved a temporary emergency measure that did not interfere with state choices about governmental operations, unlike the permanent FLSA amendments at issue."
109499,107734,Maryland v. Wirtz (1968),Overruled,We are therefore persuaded that Wirtz must be overruled... we do not believe the reasoning in Wirtz may any longer be regarded as authoritative.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that Wirtz must be overruled and that its reasoning is no longer authoritative, directly nullifying the precedential value of the Cited Decision."
109499,102593,United States v. California (1936),Criticized,"We think the dicta from United States v. California, simply wrong.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the dicta from United States v. California is 'simply wrong,' directly criticizing the reasoning of the Cited Decision."
109499,103442,United States v. Darby (1941),Mentioned,"This Court unanimously upheld the Act as a valid exercise of congressional authority under the commerce power in United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941), observing: 'Whatever their motive and purpose, regulations of commerce which do not infringe some constitutional prohibition are within the plenary power conferred on Congress by the Commerce Clause.'",The Acting Decision cites Darby as established precedent supporting Congress's commerce power authority without any negative treatment or criticism.
109499,85412,Gibbons v. Ogden (1824),Mentioned,"That authority is, in the words of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), 'the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.'",The Acting Decision cites Gibbons v. Ogden as foundational authority for defining Congress's commerce power without any criticism or negative treatment.
109499,104231,Case v. Bowles (1946),Distinguished,"It also seems appropriate to note that Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92 (1946), has not been overruled as the dissent asserts. Indeed that decision, upon which our Brother heavily relies, has no direct application to the questions we consider today at all. For there the Court sustained an application of the Emergency Price Control Act to a sale of timber by the State of Washington, expressly noting that the 'only question is whether the State's power to make the sales must be in subordination to the power of Congress to fix maximum prices in order to carry on war.'","The Acting Decision distinguishes Case v. Bowles by explaining that it involved different circumstances (war powers) and has no direct application to the current case, thereby limiting its relevance."
109499,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt (1938),Mentioned,"In Fry, supra, the Court recognized that an express declaration of this limitation is found in the Tenth Amendment: 'While the Tenth Amendment has been characterized as a truism,' stating merely that all is retained which has not been surrendered, United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 124 (1941), it is not without significance.'","The Acting Decision references the characterization of the Tenth Amendment from Darby (which cites Helvering v. Gerhardt) without any negative treatment, using it as part of the constitutional analysis."
109499,97448,Coyle v. Smith (1911),Mentioned,"In Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911), the Court gave this example of such an attribute: 'The power to locate its own seat of government and to determine when and how it shall be changed from one place to another, and to appropriate its own public funds for that purpose, are essentially and peculiarly state powers.'",The Acting Decision cites Coyle as supportive precedent for the principle of state sovereignty and attributes of state power without any criticism or negative treatment.
109499,87985,Lane County v. Oregon (1869),Mentioned,"In Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 (1869), his opinion for the Court said: 'Both the States and the United States existed before the Constitution. The people, through that instrument, established a more perfect union by substituting a national government, acting, with ample power, directly upon the citizens, instead of the Confederate government, which acted with powers, greatly restricted, only upon the States.'",The Acting Decision cites Lane County v. Oregon as supportive precedent for the principle of state sovereignty and the federal system without any negative treatment.
109499,106821,Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama State Docks Department (1964),Mentioned,"For the same reasons, despite Mr. Justice Brennan's claims to the contrary, the holdings in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), are likewise unimpaired by our decision today.","The Acting Decision states that Parden's holding is unimpaired by the current decision, indicating that it remains valid precedent without negative treatment."
109499,108763,Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health (1973),Mentioned,"We sustained the validity of the combined effect of these two amendments in Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968).","The Acting Decision references the case as part of the historical development of Fair Labor Standards Act coverage without any negative treatment, though it is mentioned in the context of discussing Wirtz which is later overruled."
109835,109344,Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages,Mentioned,"In Michelin the Court upheld the application of a general ad valorem property tax to imported tires and tubes. The Court surveyed the history and purposes of the Import-Export-Clause to determine, for the first time, which taxes fell within the absolute ban on 'Imposts or Duties.'","The Acting Decision relies on and applies the analytical framework established in Michelin without criticizing or questioning its validity, using it as the foundation for its Import-Export Clause analysis."
109835,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady",Mentioned,"We conclude that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, where the Court held that a State under appropriate conditions may tax directly the privilege of conducting interstate business, requires such rejection.","The Acting Decision uses Complete Auto as the basis for overruling the Stevedoring Cases, treating it as controlling precedent that permits direct taxation of interstate commerce privileges under appropriate conditions."
109835,104388,Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co.,Overruled,"To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. stand to the contrary, each is overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Carter & Weekes is overruled to the extent it conflicts with the Court's holding that Washington's business and occupation tax does not violate the Commerce Clause.
109835,104859,Canton Railroad v. Rogan,Mentioned,"In Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511 (1951), the Court upheld a gross-receipts tax on a steam railroad operating exclusively within the Port of Baltimore... The Court rejected that argument primarily on the ground that immunity of services incidental to importing and exporting was not so broad as the immunity of the goods themselves","The Acting Decision relies on Canton R. Co. as supportive precedent for distinguishing between taxes on goods themselves versus taxes on services related to handling those goods, using it to support the validity of the stevedoring tax."
109835,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,Mentioned,"As was recognized in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938), interstate commerce must bear its fair share of the state tax burden.","The Acting Decision cites Western Live Stock as established precedent supporting the principle that interstate commerce should bear its fair share of state tax burdens, using it to support the constitutionality of the Washington tax."
109835,102857,Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Commission,Overruled,"To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. stand to the contrary, each is overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Puget Sound to the extent it conflicts with the Court's holding that Washington's business and occupation tax on stevedoring does not violate the Commerce Clause.
109580,86317,Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan,Mentioned,"Pollard's Lessee held that under the equal-footing doctrine new States, upon their admission to the Union, acquire title to the lands underlying navigable waters within their boundaries.","The Acting Decision references Pollard's Lessee as establishing the foundational equal-footing doctrine without criticizing or questioning its validity, using it as support for the Court's analysis."
109580,108897,Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona,Overruled,"Our analysis today leads us to conclude that our decision to apply federal common law in Bonelli was incorrect... Upon full reconsideration of our decision in Bonelli, we conclude that it was wrong in treating the equal-footing doctrine as a source of federal common law after that doctrine had vested title to the riverbed in the State of Arizona as of the time of its admission to the Union... For all of these reasons, we have now decided that Bonelli's application of federal common law to cases such as this must be overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Bonelli was incorrect and must be overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value regarding the application of federal common law to state riverbed ownership disputes."
109580,93804,Shively v. Bowlby,Mentioned,"And in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1 (1894), the Court recounted in extenso the many cases which had followed the doctrine of Pollard's Lessee.","The Acting Decision cites Shively v. Bowlby as supporting precedent that followed the doctrine of Pollard's Lessee, without any negative treatment or criticism of the decision."
109580,102485,"Borax Consolidated, Ltd. v. Los Angeles",Distinguished,"In Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296 U. S. 10 (1935), this Court also found a basis to apply federal law, but its rationale does not dictate a different result in this case... But that determination is solely for the purpose of fixing the boundaries of the riverbed acquired by the State at the time of its admission to the Union; thereafter the role of the equal-footing doctrine is ended, and the land is subject to the laws of the State.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Borax by limiting its application to initial boundary determinations only, rather than allowing it to support ongoing federal common law application as was done in Bonelli."
109580,89473,Barney v. Keokuk,Mentioned,"In Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 338 (1877), the Court extended the doctrine to waters which were nontidal but nonetheless navigable, consistent with its earlier extension of admiralty jurisdiction to such waters","The Acting Decision references Barney v. Keokuk as extending established doctrine to nontidal navigable waters, citing it as supportive precedent without any negative treatment."
109580,89097,County of St. Clair v. Lovingston,Mentioned,"This statement of the law was quoted by the Court in County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 68 (1874).","The Acting Decision references County of St. Clair v. Lovingston as having quoted established common law principles, treating it as supportive precedent without criticism."
109580,107555,Hughes v. Washington,Overruled,"In addition, as the Court is certain to announce when the occasion arises, today's holding also overrules Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290 (1967), a nine-year-old decision also joined by all but one of the participating Justices.","While the majority opinion does not formally overrule Hughes, the dissenting opinion explicitly states that the majority's holding overrules Hughes v. Washington, and the majority's reasoning necessarily undermines Hughes' federal common law approach."
109580,96443,Joy v. City of St. Louis,Mentioned,"This doctrine was squarely applied to the case of a riparian proprietor in Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332 (1906)... Central to this result was the holding: 'As this land in controversy is not the land described in the letters patent or the [A]cts of Congress, but, as is stated in the petition, is formed by accretions or gradual deposits from the river, whether such land belongs to the plaintiff is, under the cases just cited, a matter of local or state law, and not one arising under the laws of the United States.'","The Acting Decision cites Joy v. St. Louis as supporting the principle that state law governs property disputes involving accretions to federally patented land, using it as supportive precedent."
109580,86113,Wilcox v. Jackson,Mentioned,"Indeed, the rule that lands once having passed from the Federal Government are subject to the laws of the State in which they lie antedates Pollard's Lessee. As long ago as 1839, the Court said: 'We hold the true principle to be this, that whenever the question in any Court, state or federal, is, whether a title to land which had once been the property of the United States has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws of the United States; but that whenever, according to those laws, the title shall have passed, then that property, like all other property in the state, is subject to state legislation; so far as that legislation is consistent with the admission that the title passed and vested according to the laws of the United States.'","The Acting Decision cites Wilcox v. Jackson as establishing the principle that once federal land passes to private ownership, it becomes subject to state law, using it as supportive precedent for the Court's reasoning."
109881,106170,Monroe v. Pape,Overruled,"we now overrule Monroe v. Pape, supra, insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under § 1983","The Acting Decision explicitly states that it overrules Monroe v. Pape to the extent it held local governments immune from § 1983 suits, directly nullifying this aspect of the precedent."
109881,86231,Prigg v. Pennsylvania,Mentioned,"Building on Prigg, Shellabarger argued that a remedy against municipalities and counties was an appropriate — and hence constitutional — method for ensuring the protection which the Fourteenth Amendment made every citizen's federal right","The Acting Decision references Prigg as part of the historical analysis of constitutional arguments made during the 1871 debates, without criticizing or questioning its precedential value."
109881,108782,Moor v. County of Alameda,Mentioned,we have reaffirmed Monroe without further examination on three occasions,"The Acting Decision mentions Moor as one of the cases that reaffirmed Monroe, but does not provide any negative treatment of the decision itself."
109881,334135,"12 Fair empl.prac.cas. 836, 11 Empl. Prac. Dec. P 10,755 Jane Monell v. Department of Social Services of the City of New York, Defendants",Reversed,"For the reasons stated above, therefore, we hold that stare decisis does not bar our overruling of Monroe insofar as it is inconsistent with Parts I and II of this opinion... For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed","The Acting Decision directly overturns the Court of Appeals judgment in this same case, which is the typical treatment when an appellate court reverses a lower court's decision."
109881,88174,Supervisors v. Durant,Mentioned,Compare this statement with Representative Poland's remark upon which our holding in Monroe was based,"The Acting Decision references Supervisors v. Durant as part of the historical analysis of Contract Clause cases that were cited during the 1871 congressional debates, without any negative treatment."
109881,88308,Collector v. Day,Mentioned,"Collector v. Day, cited by Blair, was the clearest and, at the time of the debates, the most recent pronouncement of a doctrine of coordinate sovereignty","The Acting Decision discusses Collector v. Day as part of the historical constitutional doctrine that influenced the 1871 congressional debates, noting it as precedent that 'has not survived' but not directly criticizing it."
109881,108813,City of Kenosha v. Bruno,Mentioned,we have reaffirmed Monroe without further examination on three occasions,"The Acting Decision mentions City of Kenosha v. Bruno as one of the cases that reaffirmed Monroe, but does not provide any negative treatment of the decision itself."
109881,108375,Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics,Mentioned,"municipal bodies sued under § 1983 cannot be entitled to an absolute immunity, lest our decision that such bodies are subject to suit under § 1983 'be drained of meaning'","The Acting Decision cites Bivens in a string citation to support the principle that absolute immunity would drain the right to sue of meaning, without any negative treatment."
109881,108913,Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur,Mentioned,The gravamen of the complaint was that the Board and the Department had as a matter of official policy compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were required for medical reasons. Cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur,"The Acting Decision references LaFleur as a comparison case regarding the constitutional issues with mandatory maternity leave policies, without any negative treatment."
109881,109574,Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle,Mentioned,"we indicated in Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 279 (1977), last Term that the question presented here was open and would be decided 'another day.'","The Acting Decision references Mt. Healthy as having left open the question of municipal liability under § 1983, without any negative treatment of that decision."
109881,90041,Ex Parte Virginia,Mentioned,"Cf., e. g., Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 346-347 (1880)","The Acting Decision cites Ex parte Virginia in support of the principle that municipalities could be included within the scope of § 1983, without any negative treatment."
109881,109503,Aldinger v. Howard,Mentioned,we have reaffirmed Monroe without further examination on three occasions,"The Acting Decision mentions Aldinger as one of the cases that reaffirmed Monroe, but does not provide any negative treatment of the decision itself."
109895,109631,United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.,Mentioned,"Only last Term, this Court relied upon these precedents in United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564 (1977), and held that the Government could not appeal the granting of a motion to acquit pursuant to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29 where a second trial would be required upon remand.","The Acting Decision references Martin Linen Supply Co. as supporting precedent for the principle that judgments of acquittal may not be appealed when a second trial would be required, without criticizing or questioning its validity."
109895,109688,Lee v. United States,Distinguished,"However, only last Term, in Lee, supra, the Government was permitted to institute a second prosecution after a midtrial dismissal of an indictment. The Court found the circumstances presented by that case 'functionally indistinguishable from a declaration of mistrial.'","The Acting Decision distinguishes Lee by noting that it involved circumstances that were functionally equivalent to a mistrial, unlike the present case involving a dismissal based on preindictment delay."
109895,109200,United States v. Wilson,Mentioned,"In our first encounter with the new statute, we concluded that 'Congress intended to remove all statutory, barriers to Government appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit.' United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 337 (1975).","The Acting Decision cites Wilson as establishing the principle that Congress intended to allow Government appeals whenever constitutionally permitted, using it as foundational precedent without criticism."
109895,109201,United States v. Jenkins,Overruled,"Yet, though our assessment of the history and meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause in Wilson, Jenkins, and Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377 (1975), occurred only three Terms ago, our vastly increased exposure to the various facets of the Double Jeopardy Clause has now convinced us that Jenkins was wrongly decided... We have therefore decided to overrule Jenkins, and thus to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Jenkins was wrongly decided and formally overrules it, finding that it placed unwarranted emphasis on the defendant's right to have guilt decided by the first jury."
109895,105594,Green v. United States,Mentioned,"As this Court has described the purpose underlying the prohibition against double jeopardy: 'The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense...' Green, supra, at 187-188.","The Acting Decision quotes Green to explain the underlying purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, using it as authoritative precedent to establish foundational principles."
109895,94515,United States v. Ball,Mentioned,"And, in the very first case presenting the issues, United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896), the Court established principles that have been adhered to ever since... Although Ball firmly established that a successful appeal of a conviction precludes a subsequent plea of double jeopardy, the opinion shed no light on whether a judgment of acquittal could be reversed on appeal consistently with the Double Jeopardy Clause.","The Acting Decision cites Ball as establishing enduring principles regarding double jeopardy and successful appeals of convictions, treating it as foundational precedent without criticism."
109895,109773,Arizona v. Washington,Mentioned,"In our recent decision in Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 (1978), we reviewed this Court's attempts to give content to the term 'manifest necessity.'","The Acting Decision references Arizona v. Washington as providing guidance on the concept of 'manifest necessity' in mistrial contexts, using it as supportive precedent."
109895,96129,Kepner v. United States,Mentioned,"Because of the statutory restrictions upon Government appeals in criminal cases, this Court in the years after Ball was faced with that question only in unusual circumstances, such as were present in Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100 (1904).","The Acting Decision cites Kepner as an example of unusual circumstances where the Court addressed whether acquittals could be reversed on appeal, using it as historical precedent."
109895,109204,Serfass v. United States,Mentioned,"Yet, though our assessment of the history and meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause in Wilson, Jenkins, and Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377 (1975), occurred only three Terms ago, our vastly increased exposure to the various facets of the Double Jeopardy Clause has now convinced us that Jenkins was wrongly decided.","The Acting Decision mentions Serfass as part of the Court's previous assessment of Double Jeopardy Clause principles, grouping it with other cases in the Court's evolving understanding."
109895,108233,United States v. Jorn,Mentioned,"'[A] motion by the defendant for mistrial is ordinarily assumed to remove any barrier to reprosecution, even if the defendant's motion is necessitated by a prosecutorial or judicial error.' United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S. 470, 485 (1971) (opinion of Harlan, J.).","The Acting Decision cites Jorn to support the principle that defendant-initiated mistrials generally do not bar reprosecution, using it as supportive precedent for established doctrine."
109895,106359,Fong Foo v. United States,Mentioned,"More than 50 years later, in Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141 (1962), this Court reviewed the issuance of a writ of mandamus by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit instructing a District Court to vacate certain judgments of acquittal. Although indicating its agreement with the Court of Appeals that the judgments had been entered erroneously, this Court nonetheless held that a second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.","The Acting Decision cites Fong Foo as precedent establishing that even erroneous acquittals cannot be appealed when a second trial would be required, using it as supportive authority for double jeopardy principles."
110325,106022,Jones v. United States (1960),Overruled,"The automatic standing, rule of Jones v. United States, supra, is therefore overruled.","The Court explicitly states that the automatic standing rule established in Jones v. United States is overruled, directly nullifying this precedent."
110325,107636,Simmons v. United States (1968),Mentioned,"This Court's ruling in Simmons thus not only extends protection against this risk of self-incrimination in all of the cases covered by Jones, but also grants a form of 'use immunity' to those defendants charged with nonpossessory crimes.","The Court discusses Simmons favorably as providing broader protection than Jones and uses it to support the elimination of one of Jones's original rationales, without criticizing or questioning Simmons itself."
110325,108760,Brown v. United States (1973),Mentioned,"Thus, as we stated in Brown v. United States, 411 U. S., at 228, '[t]he self-incrimination dilemma, so central to the Jones decision, can no longer occur under the prevailing interpretation of the Constitution [in Simmons].'","The Court cites Brown v. United States to support its analysis that the self-incrimination rationale underlying Jones has been eliminated, using it as supportive authority without any negative treatment."
110325,107872,Alderman v. United States (1969),Mentioned,"The same argument has been rejected by this Court as a sufficient basis for allowing persons whose Fourth Amendment rights were not violated to nevertheless claim the benefits of the exclusionary rule. In Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S., at 174-175, we explicitly stated...","The Court cites Alderman approvingly to support its rejection of the deterrence argument for retaining automatic standing, using it as established precedent to bolster its reasoning."
110212,105789,Hawkins v. United States,Overruled,"Our consideration of the foundations for the privilege and its history satisfy us that reason and experience no longer justify so sweeping a rule as that found acceptable by the Court in Hawkins. Accordingly, we conclude that the existing rule should be modified so that the witness-spouse alone has a privilege to refuse to testify adversely; the witness may be neither compelled to testify nor foreclosed from testifying.","The Court explicitly states that the Hawkins rule is no longer justified and concludes that the existing rule should be modified, effectively overruling the precedent established in Hawkins."
110212,102164,Funk v. United States,Mentioned,"Indeed, it was not until 1933, in Funk v. United States, 290 U.S. 371, that this Court abolished the testimonial disqualification in the federal courts, so as to permit the spouse of a defendant to testify in the defendant's behalf. Funk, however, left undisturbed the rule that either spouse could prevent the other from giving adverse testimony.","The Court references Funk to provide historical context about the evolution of spousal testimony rules, describing what Funk accomplished without criticizing or questioning its validity."
110212,106048,Wyatt v. United States,Mentioned,"Hawkins, then, left the federal privilege for adverse spousal testimony where it found it, continuing 'a rule which bars the testimony of one spouse against the other unless both consent.' Id., at 78. Accord, Wyatt v. United States, 362 U.S. 525, 528 (1960).","The Court cites Wyatt merely to show that it was in accord with the Hawkins rule, using it as supporting authority for the historical description of the law without any negative treatment."
110212,102181,Wolfle v. United States,Mentioned,"The Federal Rules of Evidence acknowledge the authority of the federal courts to continue the evolutionary development of testimonial privileges in federal criminal trials 'governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted ... in the light of reason and experience.' Fed. Rule Evid. 501. Cf. Wolfle v. United States, 291 U.S. 7, 12 (1934).","The Court references Wolfle in a comparative citation to support the principle that courts have authority to develop privilege law, without any criticism or negative treatment of the decision."
110212,86090,Stein v. Bowman,Mentioned,"It was applied by this Court in Stein v. Bowman, 13 Pet. 209, 220-223 (1839), in Graves v. United States, 150 U.S. 118 (1893), and again in Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, 254 U.S. 189, 195 (1920), where it was deemed so well established a proposition as to 'hardly requir[e] mention.'","The Court cites Stein as a historical example of when the spousal disqualification rule was applied, providing factual background without criticizing the decision itself."
110212,104845,Blau v. United States,Mentioned,"This Court recognized just such a confidential marital communications privilege in Wolfle v. United States, 291 U.S. 7 (1934), and in Blau v. United States, 340 U.S. 332 (1951). In neither case, however, did the Court adopt the Wigmore view that the communications privilege be substituted in place of the privilege against adverse spousal testimony.","The Court references Blau to acknowledge its recognition of the confidential marital communications privilege and clarifies that today's holding does not disturb Blau, indicating neutral treatment."
110063,94405,Geer v. Connecticut,Overruled,"Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 (1896), on which the Court of Criminal Appeals relied, is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Geer v. Connecticut is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value."
110063,100325,Lacoste v. Department of Conservation of Louisiana,Distinguished,"Thus, despite its citation of Geer, Lacoste is actually more compatible with the cases following the views of the Justices dissenting in Geer.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Lacoste from Geer, noting that despite citing Geer, Lacoste's approach was actually more aligned with the dissenting views in Geer and compatible with later cases."
110063,101328,Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel,Mentioned,"Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928), undermined Geer even more directly. A Louisiana statute forbade the transportation beyond the State of shrimp taken in Louisiana waters until the heads and shells had been removed.","The Acting Decision references Foster-Fountain Packing as part of the historical evolution that undermined Geer, providing additional analysis without questioning its precedential value."
110063,104652,"H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond",Mentioned,"See H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 533-534 (1949). The Commerce Clause has accordingly been interpreted by this Court not only as an authorization for congressional action, but also, even in the absence of a conflicting federal statute, as a restriction on permissible state regulation.",The Acting Decision cites H. P. Hood & Sons as supportive authority for Commerce Clause interpretation without any negative treatment or criticism.
110063,97421,West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.,Mentioned,"The erosion of Geer began only 15 years after it was decided. A Commerce Clause challenge was addressed to an Oklahoma statute designed to prohibit the transportation beyond the State of natural gas produced by wells within the State. West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911).","The Acting Decision references West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. as part of the historical progression that eroded Geer, providing factual background without challenging its validity."
110063,108085,"Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.",Mentioned,"Today's principle is that stated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970): 'Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.'","The Acting Decision cites Pike v. Bruce Church as establishing the current principle for Commerce Clause analysis, treating it as authoritative precedent."
110063,109662,"Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc.",Mentioned,"Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 (1977), dispelled any doubts on that score. In rejecting the argument that Virginia's 'ownership' of fish swimming in its territorial waters empowered the State to forbid fishing by federally licensed ships owned by nonresidents while permitting residents to fish, Seacoast Products explicitly embraced the analysis of the Geer dissenters","The Acting Decision references Douglas v. Seacoast Products as supportive authority that further undermined Geer's rationale, without any negative treatment."
110063,109868,Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm'n of Mont.,Mentioned,"For less than one year ago we unreservedly reaffirmed the principles announced in Geer. Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, 436 U. S. 371, 386 (1978). Today, the Court overrules that decision.","The Acting Decision mentions Baldwin in the dissenting opinion as having recently reaffirmed Geer principles, providing context for the disagreement with the majority's overruling of Geer."
110063,109916,City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey,Mentioned,"This formulation was employed only last Term to strike down New Jersey's attempt to 'conserve' the natural resource of landfill areas within the State for the disposal of waste generated within the State. Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978).","The Acting Decision cites Philadelphia v. New Jersey as an example of applying the Pike test to strike down discriminatory state regulations, treating it as supportive precedent."
110063,104563,Toomer v. Witsell,Mentioned,"Foster-Fountain Packing's implicit shift away from Geer's formalistic 'ownership' analysis became explicit in Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 402 (1948), which struck down as violations of the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause certain South Carolina laws discriminating against out-of-state commercial fishermen","The Acting Decision references Toomer v. Witsell as part of the historical progression that explicitly rejected Geer's ownership theory, providing supportive analysis without negative treatment."
110799,2226827,State Ex Rel. Douglas v. Sporhase (1981),Reversed,"The judgment of the Nebraska Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.","The Acting Decision directly overturns the outcome of the Cited Decision, which is the Nebraska Supreme Court ruling in the same case that upheld the statute's constitutionality."
110799,1818257,"City of Altus, Oklahoma v. Carr (1966)",Mentioned,"In summarily affirming the District Court in City of Altus, we did not necessarily adopt the court's reasoning. Our affirmance indicates only our agreement with the result reached by the District Court.",The Acting Decision references the Cited Decision to clarify the scope of its prior summary affirmance without criticizing or questioning its precedential value.
110799,96834,Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter (1908),Distinguished,"City of Altus, however, is inconsistent with Hudson County. For in the latter case the Court found Geer v. Connecticut, supra, to be controlling on the Commerce Clause issue.",The Acting Decision distinguishes the Cited Decision by noting its reliance on the now-overruled Geer doctrine and explaining how different state property law regimes lead to different Commerce Clause outcomes.
110799,97421,West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. (1911),Mentioned,"The city relied upon West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State","The Acting Decision references the Cited Decision as precedent relied upon by a party in another case, without any criticism or analysis of its continuing validity."
110799,94405,Geer v. Connecticut (1896),Mentioned,"In expressly overruling Geer three years ago, this Court traced the demise of the public ownership theory and definitively recast it as 'but a fiction expressive in legal shorthand of the importance to its people that a State have power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of an important resource.'","The Acting Decision merely notes that Geer was previously overruled by Hughes v. Oklahoma, without itself overruling or criticizing the decision."
110719,110119,Arkansas v. Sanders,Limited,"Our decision today is inconsistent with the disposition in Robbins v. California and with the portion of the opinion in Arkansas v. Sanders on which the plurality in Robbins relied. Nevertheless, the doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude this action. Although we have rejected some of the reasoning in Sanders, we adhere to our holding in that case","The Court explicitly states it rejects some of the reasoning in Sanders while adhering to its holding, indicating a limitation of Sanders' scope and applicability rather than complete overruling."
110719,100567,Carroll v. United States,Mentioned,"In Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, the Court held that a warrantless search of an automobile stopped by police officers who had probable cause to believe the vehicle contained contraband was not unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.","The Court relies on and builds upon Carroll as foundational precedent for the automobile exception, using it as the basis for extending the warrantless search doctrine to containers within vehicles."
110719,109714,United States v. Chadwick,Distinguished,"Unlike Chadwick and Sanders, in this case police officers had probable cause to search respondent's entire vehicle.","The Court distinguishes Chadwick by noting that unlike in Chadwick, where police had probable cause only to search a specific container, here police had probable cause to search the entire vehicle, making the automobile exception applicable."
110719,110558,Robbins v. California,Overruled,Our decision today is inconsistent with the disposition in Robbins v. California... And the Court unambiguously overrules 'the disposition' of Robbins,"The Court explicitly states that its decision is inconsistent with Robbins and unambiguously overrules the disposition in that case, directly nullifying its precedential value."
110719,108184,Chambers v. Maroney,Mentioned,"In Chambers v. Maroney the police found weapons and stolen property 'concealed in a compartment under the dashboard.' 399 U. S., at 44. No suggestion was made that the scope of the search was impermissible.","The Court cites Chambers as supportive precedent for warrantless automobile searches, using it to support the proposition that searching compartments within vehicles is permissible under the automobile exception."
110719,392944,"United States v. Albert Ross, Jr.",Reversed,The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed. The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.,"This is the lower court decision in the same case, and the Supreme Court explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals judgment, directly overturning the outcome of the cited decision."
110719,108377,Coolidge v. New Hampshire,Mentioned,"We have soundly rejected attempts to create such an exception in the past, see Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971), and we should do so again today.","The Court references Coolidge in the dissenting opinion as precedent that rejected a broad probable cause exception to the warrant requirement, using it to argue against the majority's approach."
109252,,,,,
111103,102987,Helvering v. Mitchell,Mentioned,"In Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391 (1938), the Court considered the preclusive effect of a prior criminal acquittal on a subsequent action for a monetary penalty... The disposition of the instant case follows readily from the principles articulated in Mitchell and One Lot Emerald Cut Stones.","The Acting Decision relies on and follows the principles established in Mitchell without criticizing or questioning its precedential value, using it as supportive authority for the court's analysis."
111103,110331,United States v. Ward,Mentioned,"As the Court noted in United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980): 'Our inquiry in this regard has traditionally proceeded on two levels. First, we have set out to determine whether Congress, in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.'","The Acting Decision cites Ward as established precedent and applies its two-prong test for determining whether a statutory scheme is civil or criminal in nature, treating it as authoritative guidance."
111103,106534,Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,Mentioned,"In Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), we set forth a list of considerations that has proved helpful in the past in making such determinations.","The Acting Decision references the Mendoza-Martinez factors as established precedent and applies them to analyze whether the forfeiture statute is punitive, treating the decision as authoritative without criticism."
111103,407595,"United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, National Rifle Association of America, Amicus Curiae",Reversed,"A divided United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed... We granted certiorari, 459 U. S. 1199 (1983), and we reverse.","This is the lower court decision in the same case that the Acting Decision directly overturns, as indicated by the Supreme Court's statement that it reverses the Fourth Circuit's judgment."
111103,108643,One Lot Emerald Cut Stones and One Ring v. United States,Mentioned,"Most recently, in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972) (per curiam), the Court held that a civil action for forfeiture of a ring and stones was not barred by the owner's prior acquittal... The disposition of the instant case follows readily from the principles articulated in Mitchell and One Lot Emerald Cut Stones.","The Acting Decision relies on and follows the principles established in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones as supportive precedent for its holding, treating it as authoritative without criticism."
111103,106087,Flemming v. Nestor,Mentioned,"'Only the clearest proof' that the purpose and effect of the forfeiture are punitive will suffice to override Congress' manifest preference for a civil sanction. Id., at 249 (quoting Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960)).","The Acting Decision cites Flemming v. Nestor as established precedent for the standard requiring 'clearest proof' to override Congress' intent, using it as authoritative support without criticism."
111103,8178595,Coffey v. United States,Overruled,"To the extent that Coffey v. United States suggests otherwise, it is hereby disapproved... we reject today the contrary rationale of Coffey v. United States, 116 U. S. 436 (1886).","The Acting Decision explicitly disapproves and rejects the rationale of Coffey, stating that its analytical underpinnings have been recognized as inadequate and formally overruling its holding to the extent it conflicts with the current decision."
111218,104463,United States v. Yellow Cab Co.,Limited,"The Yellow Cab passage is most fairly read in light of this settled rule. In Yellow Cab, the affiliation of the defendants was irrelevant because the original acquisitions were themselves illegal. An affiliation 'flowing from an illegal conspiracy' would not avert sanctions. Common ownership and control were irrelevant because restraint of trade was 'the primary object of the combination,' which was created in a 'deliberate, calculated' manner.","The Acting Decision narrows the scope of Yellow Cab by interpreting it as applying only to cases where the original acquisitions were themselves illegal, rather than establishing a broad intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine."
111218,104915,Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States,Distinguished,"The American defendant in Timken did not own a majority interest in either of the foreign corporate conspirators and, as the District Court found, it did not control them. Moreover, as in Yellow Cab, there was evidence that the stock acquisitions were themselves designed to effectuate restrictive practices. The Court's reliance on the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine was in no way necessary to the result.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Timken by noting that it involved corporations where the defendant did not have majority ownership or control, making it factually different from the parent-wholly owned subsidiary relationship at issue."
111218,104839,"Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc.",Overruled,"To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Kiefer-Stewart along with other prior decisions that supported the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, as it directly contradicts the Court's new holding that parent corporations and wholly owned subsidiaries cannot conspire."
111218,107732,"Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp.",Limited,"But the Court noted immediately thereafter that '[i]n any event' each plaintiff could 'clearly' charge a combination between itself and the defendants or between the defendants and other franchise dealers. Thus, for the same reason that a finding of liability in Kiefer-Stewart could today be justified without reference to the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, the doctrine was at most only an alternative holding in Perma Life Mufflers.","The Acting Decision limits Perma Life Mufflers by characterizing the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine as merely an alternative holding that was unnecessary to the result, thereby reducing its precedential value."
111218,102041,"Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States",Distinguished,"However, examination of that case reveals that it gives very little support for the broad doctrine Yellow Cab has been thought to announce. On the contrary, the language of Chief Justice Hughes speaking for the Court in Appalachian Coals supports a contrary conclusion.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Appalachian Coals by arguing that it actually supports the opposite conclusion from what Yellow Cab suggested, thereby undermining the foundation for the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine."
111218,104037,United States v. Crescent Amusement Co.,Limited,"The Crescent Amusement Court, however, in affirming an order of divestiture, noted that such a remedy was appropriate when 'creation of the combination is itself the violation.' This suggests that both Crescent Amusement and Yellow Cab, which cited the very page on which this passage appears, stand for a narrow rule based on the original illegality of the affiliation.","The Acting Decision limits Crescent Amusement by interpreting it as standing only for a narrow rule applicable when the original creation of the corporate combination was itself illegal, rather than supporting a broad intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine."
111218,1292673,United States v. American Tobacco Co.,Mentioned,"A § 1 agreement may be found when 'the conspirators had a unity of purpose or a common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds in an unlawful arrangement.' American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U.S. 781, 810 (1946).","The Acting Decision merely cites American Tobacco Co. for the definition of what constitutes a § 1 agreement, without any negative treatment or criticism of the decision itself."
111218,106009,"United States v. Parke, Davis & Co.",Mentioned,"A theory of combination between the subsidiaries and the wholesalers could now support § 1 relief, whether or not it could have when Kiefer-Stewart was decided. See Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U.S. 145, 149-150, and n. 6 (1968); United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U.S. 29 (1960).","The Acting Decision simply cites Parke Davis as support for the proposition that certain theories of combination could support § 1 relief, without any criticism or negative treatment of the decision."
111218,409686,Independence Tube Corporation v. Copperweld Corporation,Reversed,"Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.","The Acting Decision directly reverses the Court of Appeals decision, which had affirmed liability based on the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine that the Supreme Court now rejects."

111308,109499,National League of Cities v. Usery,Overruled,"National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), is overruled.","The Court explicitly states that National League of Cities is overruled, finding its 'traditional governmental function' standard unworkable and inconsistent with federalism principles."
111308,110881,Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Wyoming,Mentioned,"See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 248 (1983) (concurring opinion).",The decision is cited for reference without significant discussion or analysis that would affect its precedential value.
111308,110516,"Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc.",Mentioned,"The prerequisites for governmental immunity under National League of Cities were summarized by this Court in Hodel, supra.","The decision is referenced to explain the four-part test for governmental immunity under National League of Cities, without criticism or negative treatment."
111308,110673,United Transportation Union v. Long Island Rail Road,Mentioned,The only other case in which the Court has had occasion to address the problem is Long Island.,"The decision is discussed as an example of the Court's difficulty in applying the 'traditional governmental function' standard, but without negative treatment of the decision itself."
111308,104222,New York v. United States,Mentioned,"It was this uncertainty and instability that led the Court shortly thereafter, in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), unanimously to conclude that the distinction between 'governmental' and 'proprietary' functions was 'untenable' and must be abandoned.","The decision is cited approvingly as support for abandoning the governmental/proprietary distinction in tax immunity cases, which parallels the Court's reasoning for overruling National League of Cities."
111308,110718,Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Mississippi,Mentioned,"See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742 (1982).","The decision is cited as an example of federal encroachment on state activities, but without any negative treatment of the decision itself."

S. 542, 558 (1975) (dissenting opinion).","The decision is cited for the general proposition that constitutional standards often involve gray areas, without any treatment affecting its precedential value."
111308,107734,Maryland v. Wirtz,Mentioned,"The application of the FLSA to public schools and hospitals was ruled to be within Congress' power under the Commerce Clause. Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968).","The decision is mentioned factually as having been overruled by National League of Cities, but the Acting Decision does not itself treat Maryland v. Wirtz negatively."
111308,2239255,San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority v. Donovan,Reversed,The judgment of the District Court therefore must be reversed.,"This is the lower court decision in the same case, and the Supreme Court explicitly reverses the District Court's judgment that granted summary judgment to SAMTA."
111308,102330,Helvering v. Powers,Mentioned,"In Powers, the Court upheld the application of the federal income tax to the income of trustees of a state-operated commuter railroad.","The decision is cited as an example in the discussion of the governmental/proprietary distinction in tax immunity cases, without any negative treatment."
111308,96357,South Carolina v. United States,Mentioned,"In South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437 (1905), the Court held for the first time that the state tax immunity recognized in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871), extended only to the 'ordinary' and 'strictly governmental' instrumentalities of state governments.","The decision is discussed as part of the historical development of the governmental/proprietary distinction in tax immunity cases, without negative treatment."
111404,91894,Ex Parte Bain,Limited,"To the extent Bain stands for the proposition that it constitutes an unconstitutional amendment to drop from an indictment those allegations that are unnecessary to an offense that is clearly contained within it, that case has simply not survived. To avoid further confusion, we now explicitly reject that proposition.","The Court explicitly rejects one aspect of Bain while preserving its general proposition about impermissible additions to indictments, thus limiting the scope and applicability of the Bain decision."
111404,105978,Stirone v. United States,Distinguished,"Stirone, however, stands for a very different proposition. In Stirone the offense proved at trial was not fully contained in the indictment, for trial evidence had 'amended' the indictment by broadening the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment. Stirone was thus wholly unlike the cases discussed in Part II, supra, and unlike respondent's case, all of which involve trial evidence that narrowed the indictment's charges without adding any new offenses.","The Court distinguishes Stirone by explaining that it involved broadening an indictment with new offenses, whereas the current case involves narrowing without adding new offenses, making the factual situations materially different."
111404,423986,United States v. James Rual Miller,Reversed,"The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and vacated the judgment of conviction. 715 F. 2d 1360 (1983), modified, 728 F. 2d 1269 (1984).

S. 78, 83 (1935).","The Court merely cites Berger as supporting authority without significant discussion or analysis, using it as a reference point for established legal principles."
111404,106407,Russell v. United States,Mentioned,"See Russell v. United States, 369 U. S. 749, 763-764 (1962).",The Court cites Russell as supporting authority for notice-related concerns underlying indictment requirements without extensive discussion or analysis of the case.
111404,103976,United States v. Ballard,Mentioned,"That our holding today is fully consistent with prior legal understanding is apparent from an examination of the state of the law, as seen by Chief Justice Stone, more than 40 years ago: 'An indictment is amended when it is so altered as to charge a different offense from that found by the grand jury. Ex parte Bain, 121 U. S. 1 . But here there was no alteration of the indictment, Salinger v. United States, 272 U. S. 542, 549...' United States v. Ballard, 322 U. S., at 90-91 (dissenting).","The Court quotes Chief Justice Stone's dissenting opinion in Ballard to support its holding, using it as historical authority for the legal principle being applied."
111404,100951,Salinger v. United States,Mentioned,"In Salinger v. United States, supra, for example, the Court was presented with facts quite similar to the instant case... This Court unanimously rejected Salinger's argument on the ground that the offense proved was fully contained within the indictment.","The Court discusses Salinger as precedential support for its holding, explaining how the facts are similar and how Salinger supports the current decision without questioning its validity."
110563,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady",Mentioned,"We agree with appellants that the Montana tax must be evaluated under Complete Auto Transit's four-part test. Under that test, a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it 'is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.'","The Acting Decision applies the Complete Auto Transit test as the established framework for evaluating Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes, without criticizing or questioning its validity."
110563,109835,Department of Revenue v. Ass'n of Washington Stevedoring Companies,Mentioned,"As the Court has stated, ''[e]ven interstate business must pay its way.'' Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938), quoting Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252, 259 (1919). Consequently, the Heisler Court's concern that a loss of state taxing authority would be an inevitable result of subjecting taxes on 'local' activities to Commerce Clause scrutiny is no longer tenable.","The Acting Decision cites this case as support for the principle that interstate commerce must pay its fair share of state tax burden, using it to reinforce established precedent."
110563,877181,Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State,Mentioned,"On appeal, the Montana Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. -Mont.-, 615 P. 2d 847 (1980). The Supreme Court held that the tax is not subject to scrutiny under the Commerce Clause because it is imposed on the severance of coal, which the court characterized as an intrastate activity preceding entry of the coal into interstate commerce.","The Acting Decision references the lower court decision being reviewed, describing its holding without expressing agreement or disagreement with its reasoning."
110563,104253,Nippert v. City of Richmond,Mentioned,"When a tax is assessed in proportion to a taxpayer's activities or presence in a State, the taxpayer is shouldering its fair share of supporting the State's provision of 'police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and the advantages of a civilized society.' Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S., at 228, quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S., at 445. Cf. Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S., at 427.",The Acting Decision cites Nippert as supporting authority for the principle that proportional taxes allow taxpayers to shoulder their fair share of governmental costs.
110563,110488,Maryland v. Louisiana,Mentioned,"But the Montana tax is computed at the same rate regardless of the final destination of the coal, and there is no suggestion here that the tax is administered in a manner that departs from this evenhanded formula. We are not, therefore, confronted here with the type of differential tax treatment of interstate and intrastate commerce that the Court has found in other 'discrimination' cases. See, e. g., Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725 (1981).","The Acting Decision references Maryland v. Louisiana as an example of a discrimination case, distinguishing the present case from situations involving differential tax treatment."
110563,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,Mentioned,"As the Court has stated, ''[e]ven interstate business must pay its way.'' Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938), quoting Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252, 259 (1919).",The Acting Decision cites Western Live Stock as established precedent supporting the principle that interstate commerce must bear its fair share of state tax burden.
110563,106846,General Motors Corp. v. Washington,Mentioned,"As we explained in General Motors Corp. v. Washington, supra, at 440-441: '[T]he validity of the tax rests upon whether the State is exacting a constitutionally fair demand for that aspect of interstate commerce to which it bears a special relation.'",The Acting Decision cites General Motors as supporting precedent for the principle that tax validity depends on whether the state's demand is constitutionally fair in relation to the interstate commerce activity.
110563,103186,"Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc.",Mentioned,"Consequently, in reviewing appellants' contentions, we put to one side those cases in which the Court reviewed challenges to 'user' fees or 'taxes' that were designed and defended as a specific charge imposed by the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportation or other facilities and services. See, e. g., Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972); Clark v. Paul Cray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939).","The Acting Decision distinguishes Clark v. Paul Gray as involving user fees rather than general revenue taxes, setting it aside as not applicable to the present case."
110563,100063,Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co.,Criticized,We agree that Heisler's reasoning has been undermined by more recent cases. The Heisler analysis evolved at a time when the Commerce Clause was thought to prohibit the States from imposing any direct taxes on interstate commerce... We therefore hold that a state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce. Any contrary statements in Heisler and its progeny are disapproved.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that Heisler's reasoning has been undermined and disapproves contrary statements in Heisler, indicating criticism of its approach while acknowledging it was not necessarily wrongly decided at the time."
110563,105195,Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert,Mentioned,"Correspondingly, when the measure of a tax bears no relationship to the taxpayers' presence or activities in a State, a court may properly conclude under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test that the State is imposing an undue burden on interstate commerce. See Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S., at 427; cf. Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157 (1954).",The Acting Decision cites Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert as an example of when a court may find an undue burden on interstate commerce when tax measures bear no relationship to taxpayer activities in the state.
110563,102777,Ingels v. Morf,Mentioned,"Consequently, in reviewing appellants' contentions, we put to one side those cases in which the Court reviewed challenges to 'user' fees or 'taxes' that were designed and defended as a specific charge imposed by the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportation or other facilities and services. See, e. g., Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972); Clark v. Paul Cray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939); Ingels v. Morf, 300 U. S. 290 (1937).","The Acting Decision distinguishes Ingels v. Morf as involving user fees rather than general revenue taxes, setting it aside as not applicable to the present case involving a general revenue tax."
111555,110478,Parratt v. Taylor,Limited,"Upon reflection, we agree and overrule Parratt to the extent that it states that mere lack of due care by a state official may 'deprive' an individual of life, liberty, or property under the Fourteenth Amendment.","The Court explicitly overrules part of Parratt while maintaining other aspects, thereby limiting its scope and applicability regarding negligent conduct constituting a constitutional deprivation."
111555,111252,Hudson v. Palmer,Mentioned,"Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984) (intentional destruction of inmate's property)","The decision is cited as an example of deliberate government action that constitutes a deprivation under the Due Process Clause, without any negative treatment or criticism."
111555,109635,Ingraham v. Wright,Mentioned,"Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S. 651 (1977) (paddling student)","The decision is cited as an example of deliberate government action that constitutes a deprivation under the Due Process Clause, and also referenced regarding historical protections, without any negative treatment."
111555,109561,Estelle v. Gamble,Mentioned,Medical malpractice does not become a constitutional violation merely because the victim is a prisoner,"The decision is cited approvingly to support the principle that not all injuries to prisoners constitute constitutional violations, reinforcing the Court's reasoning."
111555,109097,Wolff v. McDonnell,Mentioned,The touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government,"The decision is cited to support the Court's understanding of the fundamental purpose of due process protection, without any criticism or limitation."
111555,110132,Baker v. McCollan,Mentioned,false imprisonment does not become a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment merely because the defendant is a state official,The decision is cited approvingly to support the principle that state official status alone does not transform ordinary torts into constitutional violations.
111555,87021,South v. Maryland Ex Rel. Pottle,Distinguished,"We read South v. Maryland, supra, an action brought under federal diversity jurisdiction on a Maryland sheriff's bond, as stating no more than what this Court thought to be the principles of common law and Maryland law applicable to that case; it is not cast at all in terms of constitutional law","The Court distinguishes this case by explaining it was decided on common law grounds rather than constitutional principles, rejecting petitioner's attempt to use it as constitutional authority."
111555,106170,Monroe v. Pape,Mentioned,"As explained in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961), this conclusion derives from the fact that the statute — the Ku Klux Act of 1871 — was intended to provide a federal remedy for the violation of a federal constitutional right.","The decision is cited in Justice Stevens' concurrence to explain the purpose and scope of § 1983, without any negative treatment or criticism."
111555,108430,Groppi v. Leslie,Mentioned,"See, e. g., Groppi v. Leslie, 404 U. S. 496 (1972); In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257 (1948).","The decision is cited as an example of procedural due process requirements in Justice Stevens' concurrence, without any negative treatment."
111555,110169,Martinez v. California,Mentioned,"In Martinez v. California, 444 U. S. 277 (1980), we held that California's immunity statute did not violate the Due Process Clause simply because it operated to defeat a tort claim arising under state law.",The decision is cited in Justice Stevens' concurrence to support the principle that sovereign immunity defenses do not necessarily render state procedures constitutionally inadequate.
112276,1098406,Ex Parte Smith (1988),Reversed,"The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.","The Acting Decision directly overturns the outcome of the Alabama Supreme Court's decision in Ex Parte Smith, which had held that a presumption of vindictiveness applied when a sentence was increased after trial following a guilty plea."
112276,107978,North Carolina v. Pearce (1969),Limited,"While the Pearce opinion appeared on its face to announce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent cases have made clear that its presumption of vindictiveness 'do[es] not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.'",The Acting Decision narrows the scope and applicability of Pearce by holding that its presumption of vindictiveness does not apply when the first sentence was based on a guilty plea and the second follows a trial.
112276,108569,Colten v. Kentucky (1972),Mentioned,"In Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104 (1972), for example, we refused to apply the presumption when the increased sentence was imposed by the second court in a two-tiered system which gave a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor in an inferior court the right to trial de novo in a superior court.","The Acting Decision references Colten as supportive precedent for limiting the Pearce presumption, using it to illustrate circumstances where the presumption does not apply without criticizing or questioning its validity."
112276,111602,Texas v. McCullough (1986),Mentioned,"As we explained in Texas v. McCullough, 'the evil the [Pearce] Court sought to prevent' was not the imposition of 'enlarged sentences after a new trial' but 'vindictiveness of a sentencing judge.'","The Acting Decision cites McCullough as authority for the principle that the Pearce presumption is designed to prevent vindictiveness rather than all increased sentences, using it to support the court's reasoning without any negative treatment."
112276,110748,United States v. Goodwin (1982),Mentioned,"Because the Pearce presumption 'may operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus . . . block a legitimate response to criminal conduct,' United States v. Goodwin, supra, at 373, we have limited its application","The Acting Decision references Goodwin to support its reasoning about limiting the application of the Pearce presumption, citing it as authority without any criticism or negative treatment."
111948,107953,O'Callahan v. Parker,Overruled,"On reexamination of O'Callahan, we have decided that the service connection test announced in that decision should be abandoned... Our conclusion is that the case of Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra, should be, and it is, overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that it has decided to abandon the service connection test from O'Callahan and directly overrules the precedent, nullifying its precedential value."
111948,105326,United States Ex Rel. Toth v. Quarles,Distinguished,"One pre-1969 decision of this Court suggests that the constitutional power of Congress to authorize trial by court-martial must be limited to 'the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.' United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 23 (1955)... Yet the Court in Toth v. Quarles was addressing only the question whether an ex-serviceman may be tried by court-martial for crimes committed while serving in the Air Force. Thus, the dictum may be also interpreted as limited to that context.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Toth v. Quarles by noting that it addressed a different factual situation (ex-servicemen) and interprets the cited language as limited to that specific context rather than applying broadly.
111948,8982256,"Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks",Overruled,"Since O'Callahan and Relford, military courts have identified numerous categories of offenses requiring specialized analysis of the service connection requirement... The confusion created by the complexity of the service connection requirement, however, is perhaps best illustrated in the area of off-base drug offenses... When considered together with the doubtful foundations of O'Callahan, the confusion wrought by the decision leads us to conclude that we should read Clause 14 in accord with the plain meaning of its language as we did in the many years before O'Callahan was decided.","The Acting Decision overrules Relford along with O'Callahan, criticizing the confusion and complexity created by the service connection requirement established in both cases and abandoning their approach entirely."
111948,105525,Reid v. Covert,Mentioned,"This view was premised on what the Court described as the 'natural meaning' of Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, as well as the Fifth Amendment's exception for 'cases arising in the land or naval forces.' Reid v. Covert, supra, at 19; United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, supra, at 15.","The Acting Decision references Reid v. Covert to support its historical analysis of court-martial jurisdiction based on military status, using it as authority for the constitutional interpretation without criticizing or questioning its precedential value."
111948,105981,Kinsella v. United States Ex Rel. Singleton,Mentioned,"As explained in Kinsella v. Singleton, supra: 'The test for jurisdiction ... is one of status, namely, whether the accused in the court-martial proceeding is a person who can be regarded as falling within the term 'land and naval Forces.'... 'Without contradiction, the materials ... show that military jurisdiction has always been based on the 'status' of the accused, rather than on the nature of the offense.'","The Acting Decision cites Kinsella favorably to support its argument that military jurisdiction should be based on status rather than service connection, using it as precedential authority without any negative treatment."
111948,89821,Coleman v. Tennessee,Mentioned,"Implicit in the military status test was the principle that determinations concerning the scope of court-martial jurisdiction over offenses committed by servicemen was a matter reserved for Congress... See also Coleman v. Tennessee, supra, at 514; Warren, The Bill of Rights and the Military, 37 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 181, 187 (1962).","The Acting Decision references Coleman v. Tennessee as supporting authority for the principle that Congress has primary responsibility for determining court-martial jurisdiction, citing it without any criticism or limitation of its precedential value."
112040,111308,Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,Mentioned,"The Tenth Amendment limits on Congress' authority to regulate state activities are set out in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985). Garcia holds that the limits are structural, not substantive— i. e., that States must find their protection from congressional regulation through the national political process, not through judicially defined spheres of unregulable state activity.","The Acting Decision cites Garcia as establishing the controlling framework for Tenth Amendment analysis without criticizing or questioning its validity, using it as the foundation for its constitutional analysis."
112040,104222,New York v. United States,Mentioned,"All federal activities are immune from direct state taxation, see Graves, 306 U. S., at 477 , but at least some state activities have always been subject to direct federal taxation. For a time, only the States' governmental, as opposed to proprietary, activities enjoyed tax immunity, see e. g., Helvering v. Powers, 293 U. S. 214, 227 (1934); South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 454-463 (1905), but this distinction was subsequently abandoned as untenable by all eight Justices participating in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946).","The Acting Decision references New York v. United States as part of the historical development of tax immunity doctrine, noting how it abandoned the governmental/proprietary distinction without any negative treatment."
112040,103172,Graves v. New York Ex Rel. O'Keefe,Mentioned,"In Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 (1939), the Court announced: 'The theory . . . that a tax on income is legally or economically a tax on its source, is no longer tenable.' Id., at 480.","The Acting Decision cites Graves as establishing important precedent that rejected the burden theory underlying earlier tax immunity cases, using it to support the Court's reasoning without any negative treatment."
112040,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt,Mentioned,"Prior to that the Court had already confined Collector v. Day to its facts in Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405 (1938), which upheld the constitutionality of a federal tax on the salaries of state employees involved in state construction projects.","The Acting Decision references Helvering v. Gerhardt as part of the historical progression of intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, noting how it limited earlier precedent without any criticism of the decision itself."
112040,110718,Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Mississippi,Distinguished,"Because, by hypothesis, § 310 effectively prohibits issuing unregistered bonds, it presents the very situation FERC distinguished from a commandeering of state regulatory machinery: the extent to which the Tenth Amendment 'shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations.' 456 U. S., at 759 . Section 310 regulates state activities; it does not, as did the statute in FERC , seek to control or influence the manner in which States regulate private parties.",The Acting Decision distinguishes FERC by explaining that the current case involves different facts and legal principles - direct regulation of state activities rather than commandeering of state regulatory machinery.
112040,101762,Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States,Mentioned,"The commonality of the rationale underlying all these immunities for government contracts was highlighted by Indian Motocycle, 283 U. S. 570 (1931). In that case, the Court reviewed the then current status of intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, observing that a tax on interest earned on a state or federal bond was unconstitutional because it would burden the exercise of the government's power to borrow money","The Acting Decision cites Indian Motocycle as part of the historical development of tax immunity doctrine, explaining how it applied the burden theory that was later rejected, without any negative treatment of the decision itself."
112040,94174,Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.,Overruled,We thus confirm that subsequent case law has overruled the holding in Pollock that state bond interest is immune from a nondiscriminatory federal tax.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that it is overruling Pollock's holding that state bond interest is immune from federal taxation, directly nullifying the precedential value of that aspect of the Cited Decision."
112301,111683,Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority,Mentioned,"This Court agreed, reaffirming and elaborating on our established view that a state law that has the 'practical effect' of regulating commerce occurring wholly outside that State's borders is invalid under the Commerce Clause.",The Acting Decision relies on Brown-Forman as established precedent to support its analysis and applies its principles without criticism or limitation.
112301,107217,"Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter",Overruled,"In the interest of removing any lingering uncertainty about the constitutional validity of affirmation statutes and of avoiding further litigation on the subject of liquor-price affirmation, we recognize today what was all but determined in Brown-Forman: to the extent that Seagram holds that retrospective affirmation statutes do not facially violate the Commerce Clause, it is no longer good law.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Seagram is 'no longer good law' to the extent it held that retrospective affirmation statutes do not violate the Commerce Clause, thereby overruling that portion of the decision."
112301,102402,"Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.",Mentioned,"We began by reviewing past decisions, starting with Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511 (1935). The Court in Seelig struck down a New York statute that set minimum prices for milk purchased from producers in New York and other States and banned the resale within New York of milk that had been purchased for a lower price.","The Acting Decision cites Baldwin as established precedent and applies its principles favorably without any negative treatment, using it to support the constitutional analysis."
112301,110758,Edgar v. Mite Corp.,Mentioned,"First, the 'Commerce Clause . . . precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the State's borders, whether or not the commerce has effects within the State,' Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U. S. 624, 642-643 (1982) (plurality opinion)","The Acting Decision cites Edgar v. MITE Corp. as supporting authority for the principle that the Commerce Clause precludes application of state statutes to wholly out-of-state commerce, without any negative treatment."
112301,507765,In re Beer Institute,Mentioned,"As in Healy I, the Court of Appeals reversed. It held that the 1984 law (even as interpreted by the declaratory ruling), like its predecessor, violated the Commerce Clause by controlling the prices at which out-of-state shippers could sell beer in other States.","The Acting Decision references the Court of Appeals decision (Healy II) as part of the procedural history and factual background, affirming its judgment without criticism."
112301,2370562,United States Brewers Ass'n v. Healy,Mentioned,"On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court upheld the statute as modified by the legislature and construed in the Department of Liquor Control's declaratory ruling, resting its decision on Seagram, supra, and distinguishing this Court's subsequent decision in Brown-Forman","The Acting Decision references this District Court decision as part of the procedural history, noting its ruling without expressing agreement or disagreement with its analysis."
112471,94866,Thompson v. Utah,Overruled,"To the extent that Thompson v. Utah rested on the Ex Post Facto Clause and not the Sixth Amendment, we overrule it.","The Court explicitly states that it overrules Thompson v. Utah to the extent it relied on the Ex Post Facto Clause, finding that the right to jury trial is not related to the definition of crimes, defenses, or punishments which is the concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause."
112471,100734,Beazell v. Ohio,Mentioned,"So well accepted were these principles that the Court in Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925), was able to confidently summarize the meaning of the Clause as follows: 'It is settled, by decisions of this Court so well known that their citation may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited as ex post facto.'",The Court cites Beazell favorably as providing an authoritative summary of the Ex Post Facto Clause's meaning and uses it as support for the traditional understanding of the clause without criticizing or questioning its precedential value.
112471,90760,Kring v. Missouri,Overruled,We accordingly overrule Kring.,"The Court explicitly overrules Kring v. Missouri, finding that its departure from Calder's explanation of the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause was unjustified and that its broad reading of the clause departs from the meaning as understood at the time of the Constitution's adoption."
112471,1787505,Bogany v. State,Mentioned,"In April 1985, the District Court, feeling bound by Bogany, recommended that the writ be granted.","The Court references Bogany v. State as factual background to explain the procedural history of the case and the legal context that led to the Texas legislature's enactment of the new statute, without expressing any criticism or disagreement with the decision itself."
112471,98427,Malloy v. South Carolina,Limited,The references in Duncan and Malloy to 'substantial protections' and 'personal rights' should not be read to adopt without explanation an undefined enlargement of the Ex Post Facto Clause.,The Court limits the scope and applicability of Malloy v. South Carolina by clarifying that its references to 'substantial protections' and 'personal rights' should not be interpreted as expanding the Ex Post Facto Clause beyond the traditional Calder categories.
112258,109016,Procunier v. Martinez,Limited,"In light of these same concerns, we now hold that regulations affecting the sending of a 'publication' (see the regulations' specific definition of this word, n. 4, supra) to a prisoner must be analyzed under the Turner reasonableness standard... Furthermore, we acknowledge today that the logic of our analyses in Martinez and Turner requires that Martinez be limited to regulations concerning outgoing correspondence... To the extent that Martinez itself suggests such a distinction, we today overrule that case; the Court accomplished much of this step when it decided Turner.","The Acting Decision explicitly limits Martinez to outgoing correspondence only and overrules it to the extent it would apply to incoming publications, thus narrowing the scope and applicability of the Cited Decision."
112258,111904,Turner v. Safley,Mentioned,"We now hold that the District Court correctly anticipated that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the regulations are 'reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,' Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987), and we conclude that under this standard the regulations are facially valid.","The Acting Decision adopts and applies the Turner standard as the appropriate test for reviewing prison regulations, providing additional analysis and elaboration without questioning its precedential value."
112258,109718,"Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc.",Mentioned,"The Court's subsequent decisions regarding First Amendment rights in the prison context, however, laid down a different standard of review from that articulated in Martinez. As recently explained in Turner, these later decisions, which we characterized as involving 'prisoners' rights,' adopted a standard of review that focuses on the reasonableness of prison regulations","The Acting Decision references Jones as one of the cases that established the reasonableness standard for prisoners' rights cases, using it to support the development of constitutional doctrine without criticism."
112258,109079,Pell v. Procunier,Mentioned,"The Court set forth in Turner the development of this reasonableness standard in the respective decisions in Pell and Jones and in Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576 (1984), and we need not repeat that discussion here.",The Acting Decision references Pell as part of the historical development of the reasonableness standard without significant discussion or criticism of its holding.
112258,492021,"Jack Abbott v. Edwin Meese, Iii, Attorney General of the United States",Reversed,"We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals on the issue of facial validity, but we agree with that court's remand of the case to the District Court for a determination of the validity of the regulations as applied to each of the 46 publications... The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.","The Acting Decision directly overturns the Court of Appeals' finding that the regulations were facially invalid, vacating the judgment and remanding with different instructions."
112258,110075,Bell v. Wolfish,Mentioned,"nor do they bar free citizens from exercising their own constitutional rights by reaching out to those on the 'inside,' id., at 94-99; Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S. 119 (1977); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817 (1974).","The Acting Decision cites Bell v. Wolfish as supporting precedent for the principle that citizens retain constitutional rights when communicating with prisoners, without significant analysis or criticism."
112609,1573917,"Exxon Corp. v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc. (1989)",Mentioned,"The District Court noted that '[a] prerequisite to the existence of a maritime lien based on a breach of contract is that the subject matter of the contract must fall within the admiralty jurisdiction.' 707 F. Supp. 155, 158 (SDNY 1989).","The Acting Decision references the District Court's opinion as part of the procedural history and factual background, without any criticism or negative treatment of its reasoning."
112609,88300,Insurance Co. v. Dunham (1871),Mentioned,"In determining the boundaries of admiralty jurisdiction, we look to the purpose of the grant. See Insurance Co. v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1, 24 (1871).","The Acting Decision cites Dunham positively as authority for the principle that courts should look to the purpose of admiralty jurisdiction grants, and uses it to support the current approach to determining admiralty jurisdiction."
112609,105375,Archawski v. Hanioti (1956),Mentioned,"In Archawski, supra, the Court held that an action cognizable as assumpsit would no longer be automatically excluded from admiralty. Rather, 'admiralty has jurisdiction, even where the libel reads like indebitatus assumpsit at common law, provided that the unjust enrichment arose as a result of the breach of a maritime contract.' 350 U. S., at 536.","The Acting Decision cites Archawski positively to show how one of Minturn's rationales has been discredited, using it as support for overruling Minturn."
112609,86949,Minturn v. Maynard (1855),Overruled,We conclude that Minturn is incompatible with current principles of admiralty jurisdiction over contracts and therefore should be overruled.,The Acting Decision explicitly states that Minturn should be overruled because its theoretical underpinnings are no longer valid law and its approach is inconsistent with modern admiralty principles.
112608,110719,United States v. Ross,Mentioned,"In United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, decided in 1982, we held that a warrantless search of an automobile under the Carroll doctrine could include a search of a container or package found inside the car when such a search was supported by probable cause.","The Court extensively discusses Ross as establishing precedent for automobile searches including containers, using it as foundational authority without criticizing or limiting its holding."
112608,109714,United States v. Chadwick,Limited,We conclude that it is better to adopt one clear-cut rule to govern automobile searches and eliminate the warrant requirement for closed containers set forth in Sanders.,"The Court narrows the scope and applicability of Chadwick by eliminating the warrant requirement it established for closed containers, choosing not to comply with Chadwick's rule in the automobile context."
112608,110119,Arkansas v. Sanders,Overruled,"Sanders was explicitly undermined in Ross, 456 U. S., at 824, and the existence of the dual regimes for automobile searches that uncover containers has proved as confusing as the Chadwick and Sanders dissenters predicted. We conclude that it is better to adopt one clear-cut rule to govern automobile searches and eliminate the warrant requirement for closed containers set forth in Sanders.","The Court expressly nullifies Sanders by eliminating the warrant requirement it established for closed containers, explicitly stating that Sanders has been undermined and adopting a rule that directly contradicts Sanders' holding."
112608,111305,United States v. Johns,Mentioned,"In United States v. Johns, 469 U. S. 478 (1985), Customs agents saw two trucks drive to a private airstrip and approach two small planes. The agents drew near the trucks, smelled marijuana, and then saw in the backs of the trucks packages wrapped in a manner that marijuana smugglers customarily employed.","The Court references Johns as an example supporting its position without criticizing or questioning its precedential value, using it to illustrate the application of existing doctrine."
112608,100567,Carroll v. United States,Mentioned,"In Carroll, this Court established an exception to the warrant requirement for moving vehicles, for it recognized 'a necessary difference between a search of a store, dwelling house or other structure in respect of which a proper official warrant readily may be obtained, and a search of a ship, motor boat, wagon or automobile, for contraband goods, where it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.'","The Court cites Carroll as foundational precedent for the automobile exception without any negative treatment, relying on it as established authority for warrantless vehicle searches."
112608,104504,Johnson v. United States,Mentioned,"In his opinion for the Court in Johnson v. United States, id., at 13-14, Justice Jackson explained: 'The point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.'","The Court references Johnson in the dissenting opinion to explain the warrant requirement without any negative treatment, using it as authority for the principle of neutral magistrate review."
112608,108184,Chambers v. Maroney,Mentioned,"The Court refined the exigency requirement in Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 (1970), when it held that the existence of exigent circumstances was to be determined at the time the automobile is seized.","The Court cites Chambers as precedent that refined the automobile exception doctrine without any criticism, treating it as established authority for determining exigent circumstances."
112608,110979,United States v. Place,Distinguished,"The first case cited by the dissent, United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983), however, did not involve an automobile at all. We considered in Place the temporary detention of luggage in an airport. Not only was no automobile involved, but the defendant, Place, was waiting at the airport to board his plane rather than preparing to leave the airport in a car.","The Court distinguishes Place by noting it involved different facts (airport luggage detention rather than automobile searches) and therefore requires different legal analysis, making it inapposite to the current case."
112608,110558,Robbins v. California,Mentioned,"See also Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420, 425-426 (1981) (listing cases decided by Federal Courts of Appeals since Chadwick had been announced).","The Court briefly references Robbins as an example of cases showing confusion in the lower courts following Chadwick, without any significant analysis or criticism of Robbins itself."
112728,112640,Coleman v. Thompson,Mentioned,"Again addressing the issue of state procedural default in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), we described Fay as based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules, 501 U. S., at 750, and went on to hold that the cause-and-prejudice standard applicable to failure to raise a particular claim should apply as well to failure to appeal at all.","The Acting Decision cites Coleman v. Thompson as support for applying the cause-and-prejudice standard uniformly to state procedural defaults, using it to build the foundation for the Court's reasoning without criticizing or questioning its precedential value."
112728,106544,Townsend v. Sain,Overruled,"However, in light of more recent decisions of this Court, Townsend's holding in this respect must be overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Townsend's holding regarding the deliberate bypass standard must be overruled, directly nullifying that part of the precedent."
112728,112573,McCleskey v. Zant,Mentioned,"In McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), we held that the same standard used to excuse state procedural defaults should be applied in habeas corpus cases where abuse of the writ is claimed by the government.","The Acting Decision cites McCleskey v. Zant as precedential support for applying the cause-and-prejudice standard consistently across different habeas corpus contexts, without any negative treatment."
112728,105074,Brown v. Allen,Mentioned,This was necessary because Brown was inconsistent with the holding of Townsend regarding habeas petitioners who failed to adequately develop federal claims in state-court proceedings.,"The Acting Decision references Brown v. Allen to explain the historical development of habeas corpus law and its relationship to Townsend, without directly treating Brown itself negatively."
112728,109717,Wainwright v. Sykes,Mentioned,"In Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), we rejected the application of Fay's standard of 'knowing waiver' or 'deliberate bypass' to excuse a petitioner's failure to comply with a state contemporaneous-objection rule, stating that the state rule deserved more respect than the Fay standard accorded it.","The Acting Decision cites Wainwright v. Sykes as precedential support for rejecting the deliberate bypass standard and adopting the cause-and-prejudice standard, using it as foundational authority for the Court's reasoning."
112728,111727,Murray v. Carrier,Mentioned,"We agree with Justice O'Connor that under our holding a claim invoking the fifth circumstance of Townsend will be unavailing where the cause asserted is attorney error. Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478 (1986), and Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), dictate as much.","The Acting Decision cites Murray v. Carrier as controlling precedent that dictates the result regarding attorney error as cause, treating it as binding authority without any negative commentary."
112728,556624,Jose Tamayo-Reyes v. J.C. Keeney,Reversed,"Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.","The Acting Decision directly overturns the Court of Appeals decision in this case, which is the same case involving Tamayo-Reyes, making this a reversal of the lower court's ruling."
112728,111235,Reed v. Ross,Mentioned,"We have consistently reaffirmed that the 'cause-and-prejudice' standard embodies the correct accommodation between the competing concerns implicated in a federal court's habeas power. Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 11 (1984); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129 (1982).","The Acting Decision cites Reed v. Ross as support for the cause-and-prejudice standard, treating it as precedential authority that confirms the Court's approach without any negative treatment."
112728,109439,Francis v. Henderson,Mentioned,"In Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), we acknowledged a federal court's power to entertain an application for habeas even where the claim has been procedurally waived in state proceedings, but nonetheless examined the appropriateness of the exercise of that power and recognized, as we had in Fay, that considerations of comity and concerns for the orderly administration of criminal justice may in some circumstances require a federal court to forgo the exercise of its habeas corpus power.","The Acting Decision cites Francis v. Henderson as part of the historical development of habeas corpus law and as precedential support for the cause-and-prejudice standard, without any negative treatment."
112640,111020,Michigan v. Long,Limited,"We decline to so expand the Harris presumption. The Harris presumption does not apply here. Coleman does not argue, nor could he, that it 'fairly appears' that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision rested primarily on federal law or was interwoven with such law.","The Acting Decision limits the scope of the Long presumption by refusing to expand it beyond cases where state court decisions fairly appear to rest primarily on federal law, thus narrowing its applicability."
112640,112205,Harris v. Reed,Limited,Coleman reads Harris too broadly. A predicate to the application of the Harris presumption is that the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner presented his federal claims must fairly appear to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with federal law.,"The Acting Decision explicitly limits Harris by clarifying that its presumption only applies when state court decisions fairly appear to rest primarily on federal law, rejecting Coleman's broader interpretation."
112640,109717,Wainwright v. Sykes,Mentioned,"Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), applied the cause and prejudice, standard more broadly. Sykes did not object at trial to the introduction of certain inculpatory statements he had earlier made to the police.","The Acting Decision references Sykes as establishing the cause and prejudice standard for procedural defaults, providing background context without challenging its precedential value."
112640,106548,Fay v. Noia,Overruled,"We now make it explicit: In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Fay's deliberate bypass standard, replacing it with the cause and prejudice standard for all procedural defaults in federal habeas cases."
112640,105074,Brown v. Allen,Mentioned,"In Daniels v. Allen , the companion case to Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953), we confronted a situation nearly identical to that here.","The Acting Decision references Brown v. Allen as background context for discussing the companion case Daniels v. Allen, without any negative treatment of Brown itself."
112640,110692,Engle v. Isaac,Mentioned,"Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107 (1982), held that the standard applies even in cases in which the alleged constitutional error impaired the truthfinding function of the trial.","The Acting Decision cites Engle as supporting precedent for applying the cause and prejudice standard broadly, affirming its continued validity without criticism."
112640,111880,Pennsylvania v. Finley,Mentioned,"There is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings. Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551 (1987); Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989) (applying the rule to capital cases).",The Acting Decision relies on Finley as established precedent for the principle that there is no constitutional right to counsel in state post-conviction proceedings.
112640,111727,Murray v. Carrier,Mentioned,Murray v. Carrier considered the circumstances under which attorney error constitutes cause. Carrier argued that his attorney's inadvertence in failing to raise certain claims in his state appeal constituted cause for the default sufficient to allow federal habeas review.,"The Acting Decision applies Carrier's holding about attorney error and cause without criticism, using it as controlling precedent for the current case."
112640,1280169,O'Brien v. Socony Mobil Oil Co.,Distinguished,"Coleman cites also O'Brien v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., 207 Va. 707 , 152 S. E. 2d 278 (1967). In that case, O'Brien, a civil litigant making a constitutional property rights claim, filed her notice of appeal several years late... The court then addressed O'Brien's constitutional claim on the merits and ruled against her.",The Acting Decision distinguishes O'Brien by noting it involved different circumstances and that the Virginia Supreme Court explicitly declined to announce a rule about constitutional exceptions to time requirements.
112640,106591,Sanders v. United States,Mentioned,"As Justice Harlan once observed, '[b]oth the individual criminal defendant and society have an interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation, and that attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community.' Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1963) (dissenting opinion).","The Acting Decision quotes Sanders approvingly to support the principle of finality in criminal litigation, using it as supportive authority without any negative treatment."
112640,536051,"Roger K. Coleman v. Charles Thompson, Warden",Mentioned,The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 895 F. 2d 139 (1990). The court held that Coleman had defaulted all of the claims that he had presented for the first time in state habeas.,"The Acting Decision references the Fourth Circuit's decision as the lower court ruling being reviewed, providing procedural background without expressing any view on its correctness."
112640,109439,Francis v. Henderson,Mentioned,"Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), involved a Louisiana prisoner challenging in federal habeas the composition of the grand jury that had indicted him... We held that Francis' claim was barred in federal habeas unless he could establish cause and prejudice.","The Acting Decision cites Francis as establishing precedent for the cause and prejudice standard in federal habeas cases, treating it as authoritative without criticism."
112739,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady",Mentioned,"Complete Auto rejected Freeman and Spector's formal distinction between 'direct' and 'indirect' taxes on interstate commerce because that formalism allowed the validity of statutes to hinge on 'legal terminology,' 'draftsmanship and phraseology.' Bellas Hess did not rely on any such labeling of taxes and therefore did not automatically fall with Freeman and its progeny.","The Acting Decision references Complete Auto to explain its four-part test and to distinguish it from the Bellas Hess rule, but does not criticize or overrule Complete Auto itself."
112739,1591860,State Ex Rel. Heitkamp v. Quill Corp.,Reversed,"The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Dakota is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.","The Acting Decision directly overturns the outcome of the North Dakota Supreme Court's decision in this same case, which is the classic definition of a reversal."
112739,107425,"National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue",Limited,"Thus, to the extent that our decisions have indicated that the Due Process Clause requires physical presence in a State for the imposition of duty to collect a use tax, we overrule those holdings as superseded by developments in the law of due process... For these reasons, we disagree with the North Dakota Supreme Court's conclusion that the time has come to renounce the bright-line test of Bellas Hess.","The Acting Decision overrules the due process aspect of Bellas Hess but maintains its Commerce Clause holding, thereby limiting the scope and applicability of the Cited Decision."
112739,109630,National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization,Mentioned,"Thus, three weeks after Complete Auto was handed down, we cited Bellas Hess for this proposition and discussed the case at some length. In National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551, 559 (1977), we affirmed the continuing vitality of Bellas Hess' 'sharp distinction . . . between mail-order sellers with [a physical presence in the taxing] State and those ... who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business.'",The Acting Decision cites National Geographic Society as support for the continuing validity of the Bellas Hess rule without any negative treatment.
112739,110563,Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana,Mentioned,"We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval ever since. For example, in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 263 (1989), we expressed 'doubt that termination of an interstate telephone call, by itself, provides a substantial enough nexus for a State to tax a call. See National Bellas Hess . . . (receipt of mail provides insufficient nexus).' See also D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988); Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981).","The Acting Decision merely cites Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana as one of several cases that have cited Bellas Hess with approval, without any substantive discussion or treatment."
112739,112066,"D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara",Mentioned,"We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval ever since. For example, in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 263 (1989), we expressed 'doubt that termination of an interstate telephone call, by itself, provides a substantial enough nexus for a State to tax a call. See National Bellas Hess . . . (receipt of mail provides insufficient nexus).' See also D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988).","The Acting Decision merely cites D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara as one of several cases that have cited Bellas Hess with approval, without any substantive discussion or treatment."
112739,105829,Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota,Mentioned,"Moreover, a bright-line rule in the area of sales and use taxes also encourages settled expectations and, in doing so, fosters investment by businesses and individuals... our law in this area is something of a 'quagmire' and the 'application of constitutional principles to specific state statutes leaves much room for controversy and confusion and little in the way of precise guides to the States in the exercise of their indispensable power of taxation.' Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 457-458 (1959).","The Acting Decision quotes Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota to support the argument for maintaining bright-line rules in tax law, without any negative treatment."
112739,110927,Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Public Service Commission,Distinguished,"None of those factors obtains in this case. First, the Attleboro rule was 'anachronistic' because it relied on formal distinctions between 'direct' and 'indirect' regulation (and on the regulatory counterparts of our Freeman line of cases); as discussed above, Bellas Hess turned on a different logic and thus remained sound after the Court repudiated an analogous distinction in Complete Auto.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. by explaining that the factors that led to overruling the bright-line test in that case do not apply to the Bellas Hess situation, thereby showing the cases involve different circumstances."
117931,105287,United States v. Bramblett,Overruled,Bramblett is hereby overruled. We hold that a federal court is neither a 'department' nor an 'agency' within the meaning of § 1001.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that Bramblett is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value and casting doubt on its authority."
117931,112296,Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,Mentioned,"Although such a reconsideration is appropriate only in the rarest circumstances, we believe this case permits it because of a highly unusual 'intervening development of the law,' see Patterson, 491 U. S., at 173","The Acting Decision references Patterson to support its analysis of when reconsideration of precedent is appropriate, without criticizing or questioning its authority."
117931,258536,Daniel Jackson Oliver Wendel Holmes Morgan v. United States,Mentioned,"The seeds of the exception were planted by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit only seven years after Bramblett was decided. In Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d 234 (1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), the defendant, who had falsely held himself out to be a bona fide member of the bar, was prosecuted on three counts of violating § 1001","The Acting Decision discusses Morgan as the origin of the judicial function exception without criticizing its reasoning, merely providing historical context for the development of the exception."
117931,276778,United States v. James Ralph Erhardt,Mentioned,"Relying on Morgan, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a conviction several years later 'because § 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents as evidence in a criminal proceeding.' United States v. Erhardt, 381 F. 2d 173, 175 (1967) (per curiam).",The Acting Decision references Erhardt as part of the historical development of the judicial function exception without expressing disagreement with its reasoning or outcome.
117931,109680,Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,Mentioned,"Respect for precedent is strongest 'in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation.' Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977).","The Acting Decision cites Illinois Brick Co. to support the principle that stare decisis has special force in statutory interpretation, without questioning or criticizing the decision."
117931,101894,Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.,Mentioned,"'Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation.' Id., at 406 (citations omitted).","The Acting Decision quotes Burnet approvingly to explain the general principle of stare decisis, using it to support the discussion of when precedent should be followed despite potential errors."
117958,101414,Sinclair v. United States,Overruled,"But the reasoning of Sinclair has already been repudiated in a number of respects... Other reasoning in Sinclair, not yet repudiated, we repudiate now... we think stare decisis cannot possibly be controlling when, in addition to those factors, the decision in question has been proved manifestly erroneous, and its underpinnings eroded, by subsequent decisions of this Court.","The Court explicitly repudiates the reasoning in Sinclair that had not already been repudiated by other decisions, finding it manifestly erroneous and its underpinnings eroded by subsequent Court decisions."
117958,112848,United States v. Olano,Mentioned,"in United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993), the Court noted the limitations on 'plain error' review by the courts of appeals under Rule 52(b).","The Court references Olano to explain the standards for plain error review without criticizing or questioning its precedential value, merely using it to clarify the applicable legal framework."
117958,673512,United States v. Michael E. Gaudin,Mentioned,"A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed these convictions because Circuit precedent dictated that materiality in a §1001 prosecution be decided by the jury. 997 F. 2d 1267 (1993). On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals stood by this precedent. It held that taking the question of materiality from the jury denied respondent a right guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution. 28 F. 3d 943 (1994).","The Court simply describes the procedural history and the lower court's holding without any criticism or analysis of the decision's reasoning, ultimately affirming the Court of Appeals' judgment."
117958,112868,Sullivan v. Louisiana,Mentioned,"We have held that these provisions require criminal convictions to rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt. Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 277-278 (1993).","The Court cites Sullivan favorably as support for the principle that criminal convictions must rest upon jury determination of every element, using it as precedential authority without any negative treatment."
117958,109698,Patterson v. New York,Mentioned,"Within broad constitutional bounds, legislatures have flexibility in defining the elements of a criminal offense. See Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 210 (1977).","The Court cites Patterson as authority for the principle that legislatures have flexibility in defining criminal offense elements, using it supportively without any criticism or limitation of its precedential value."
117958,94082,Sparf v. United States,Distinguished,"Sparf, supra, the case on which the Government relies, had nothing to do with the issue before us here. The question there was whether the jury could be deprived of the power to determine, not only historical facts, not only mixed questions of fact and law, but pure questions of law in a criminal case... But our decision in no way undermined the historical and constitutionally guaranteed right of criminal defendants to demand that the jury decide guilt or innocence on every issue, which includes application of the law to the facts.",The Court distinguishes Sparf by explaining that it dealt with a different issue (pure questions of law rather than mixed questions of law and fact) and clarifies that Sparf does not undermine the defendant's right to jury determination on mixed questions.
117958,112052,Kungys v. United States,Distinguished,"It is hard to imagine questions more diverse than, on the one hand, whether an appellate court must remand to a district court for a determination of materiality in a denaturalization proceeding (Kungys) and, on the other hand, whether the Constitution requires the finding of the element of materiality in a criminal prosecution to be made by the jury (the present case)... Kungys assuredly did not involve an adjudication to which the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial attaches... Whatever support it gave to the validity of those decisions was obiter dicta, and may properly be disregarded.","The Court distinguishes Kungys by explaining that it involved a fundamentally different question (appellate remand in denaturalization proceedings) that did not implicate Sixth Amendment jury trial rights, and dismisses any contrary support as obiter dicta."
112906,92534,Nielsen (1889),Mentioned,"The fountainhead of the same-conduct rule, he asserts, is In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176 (1889). That is demonstrably wrong. Nielsen simply applies the common proposition, entirely in accord with Blockburger, that prosecution for a greater offense (cohabitation, defined to require proof of adultery) bars prosecution for a lesser included offense (adultery).","The Acting Decision discusses Nielsen extensively but does not criticize or overrule it. Instead, it clarifies Nielsen's holding as being consistent with established precedent rather than creating new law."
112906,112432,Grady v. Corbin (1990),Overruled,"We have concluded, however, that Grady must be overruled. Unlike Blockburger analysis, whose definition of what prevents two crimes from being the same offence, U. S. Const., Amdt. 5, has deep historical roots and has been accepted in numerous precedents of this Court, Grady lacks constitutional roots.","The Acting Decision expressly overrules Grady v. Corbin, finding it inconsistent with earlier precedent and lacking constitutional foundation."
112906,109695,Brown v. Ohio (1977),Mentioned,"In both the multiple punishment and multiple prosecution contexts, this Court has concluded that where the two offenses for which the defendant is punished or tried cannot survive the same-elements test, the double jeopardy bar applies. See, e. g., Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 168-169 (1977).",The Acting Decision cites Brown v. Ohio as supporting authority for the same-elements test without any negative treatment or criticism.
112906,96689,Grafton v. United States (1907),Mentioned,"Both the Government, Brief for United States 15-17, and Justice Blackmun, post, at 743, contend that the legal obligation in Dixons case may serve interests . . . fundamentally different from the substantive criminal law, because it derives in part from the determination of a court rather than a determination of the legislature. That distinction seems questionable, since the courts power to establish conditions of release, and to punish their violation, was conferred by statute; the legislature was the ultimate source of both the criminal and the contempt prohibition.","The Acting Decision references Grafton in various contexts but does not subject it to negative treatment, using it primarily for analytical comparison."
112906,109736,Harris v. Oklahoma (1977),Mentioned,"In this situation, in which the contempt sanction is imposed for violating the order through commission of the incorporated drug offense, the later attempt to prosecute Dixon for the drug offense resembles the situation that produced our judgment of double jeopardy in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977) (per curiam).","The Acting Decision relies on Harris v. Oklahoma as supporting precedent for its analysis, applying its reasoning to the case at hand without criticism."
112906,110307,Illinois v. Vitale (1980),Mentioned,"We have described our terse per curiam in Harris as standing for the proposition that, for double jeopardy purposes, the crime generally described as felony murder is not a separate offense distinct from its various elements. Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410, 420-421 (1980).","The Acting Decision cites Vitale as explanatory authority for understanding Harris, without any negative treatment or disagreement with its holding."
112906,111893,Young v. United States Ex Rel. Vuitton Et Fils S. A. (1987),Mentioned,"Indeed, we recognized in Young, supra, that contempt proceedings are not intended to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws. Rather, they are designed to serve the limited purpose of vindicating the authority of the court.","The Acting Decision references Young as supporting authority for understanding the purpose of contempt proceedings, without any criticism or negative treatment."
112906,97395,Gavieres v. United States (1911),Mentioned,"In contrast to the above-discussed dicta relied upon by Justice Souter, there are two pre-Grady (and post Nielsen) cases that are directly on point. In both Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S., at 343, and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), the Court upheld subsequent prosecutions after concluding that the Blockburger test (and only the Blockburger test) was satisfied.","The Acting Decision cites Gavieres as supporting precedent for the Blockburger test being the exclusive standard, using it to support its position without negative treatment."
112906,96480,Burton v. United States (1906),Mentioned,"In contrast to the above-discussed dicta relied upon by Justice Souter, there are two pre-Grady (and post Nielsen) cases that are directly on point. In both Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S., at 343, and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), the Court upheld subsequent prosecutions after concluding that the Blockburger test (and only the Blockburger test) was satisfied.","The Acting Decision cites Burton alongside Gavieres as supporting precedent for the Blockburger test, without any criticism or negative treatment."
112906,107686,Bloom v. Illinois (1968),Mentioned,"It is well established that criminal contempt, at least the sort enforced through nonsummary proceedings, is a crime in the ordinary sense. Bloom, supra, at 201.","The Acting Decision cites Bloom as established authority for the proposition that criminal contempt is a crime in the ordinary sense, without any disagreement or criticism."
112906,105594,Green v. United States (1957),Mentioned,"The Double Jeopardy Clause prevents the government from mak[ing] repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity. Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187 (1957).","The Acting Decision cites Green as authority for explaining the purposes behind the Double Jeopardy Clause protection, without any negative treatment."
117947,110338,Fullilove v. Klutznick,Limited,"Of course, it follows that to the extent (if any) that Fullilove held federal racial classifications to be subject to a less rigorous standard, it is no longer controlling. But we need not decide today whether the program upheld in Fullilove would survive strict scrutiny as our more recent cases have defined it.","The Court explicitly states that Fullilove is no longer controlling to the extent it applied a less rigorous standard than strict scrutiny, thereby limiting its precedential scope and applicability."
117947,112176,City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co.,Mentioned,"With Croson, the Court finally agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict scrutiny of all race-based action by state and local governments.","The Court references Croson positively as establishing the principle of strict scrutiny for state and local racial classifications, using it as support for extending the same standard to federal classifications."
117947,112484,"Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission",Overruled,"Accordingly, we hold today that all racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. In other words, such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests. To the extent that Metro Broadcasting is inconsistent with that holding, it is overruled.","The Court explicitly overrules Metro Broadcasting to the extent it is inconsistent with the holding that all racial classifications must be subject to strict scrutiny, rejecting its intermediate scrutiny standard for federal racial classifications."
117947,111669,Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education,Mentioned,"Justice Powell's plurality opinion observed that 'the level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification operates against a group that historically has not been subject to governmental discrimination,' id., at 273, and stated the two-part inquiry as 'whether the layoff provision is supported by a compelling state purpose and whether the means chosen to accomplish that purpose are narrowly tailored.'",The Court cites Wygant approvingly as support for the principle that strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications regardless of which group is burdened or benefited.
117947,109930,Regents of the University of California v. Bakke,Mentioned,"Justice Powell's defense of this conclusion bears repeating here: 'If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather than the individual only because of his membership in a particular group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently.'","The Court favorably cites Justice Powell's opinion in Bakke as supporting the principle that constitutional standards should be applied consistently to all racial classifications, regardless of the race of those affected."
117947,103875,Hirabayashi v. United States,Criticized,"When the Court first faced a Fifth Amendment equal protection challenge to a federal racial classification, it adopted a similar approach, with most unfortunate results. In Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81 (1943), the Court considered a curfew applicable only to persons of Japanese ancestry.",The Court characterizes Hirabayashi as having 'most unfortunate results' and uses it as an example of the problematic approach of applying different standards to federal versus state racial classifications.
117947,105222,Bolling v. Sharpe,Mentioned,"In Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497 (1954), the Court for the first time explicitly questioned the existence of any difference between the obligations of the Federal Government and the States to avoid racial classifications.","The Court cites Bolling approvingly as establishing the principle that the Federal Government and States have equivalent obligations under equal protection, supporting the Court's holding that the same strict scrutiny standard should apply to both."
117947,1879640,"Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner",Mentioned,"The District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner, 790 F. Supp. 240 (1992).",The Court merely references the lower court decision as part of the procedural history without any substantive analysis or treatment of its reasoning.
117947,109469,Washington v. Davis,Mentioned,"(We note, incidentally, that this case concerns only classifications based explicitly on race, and presents none of the additional difficulties posed by laws that, although facially race neutral, result in racially disproportionate impact and are motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose. See generally Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976).)","The Court references Washington v. Davis only to distinguish the current case, noting that it deals with explicit racial classifications rather than facially neutral laws with discriminatory impact."
117947,104040,Korematsu v. United States,Criticized,"Korematsu demonstrates vividly that even 'the most rigid scrutiny' can sometimes fail to detect an illegitimate racial classification, compare Korematsu, 323 U. S., at 223 ('To cast this case into outlines of racial prejudice, without reference to the real military dangers which were presented, merely confuses the issue. Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race'), with Pub. L. 100-383, § 2 (a), 102 Stat. 903 -904 ('[Tjhese actions [of relocating and interning civilians of Japanese ancestry] were carried out without adequate security reasons .. . and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership').","The Court criticizes Korematsu as an example of how even purportedly strict scrutiny failed to prevent an illegitimate racial classification, noting that Congress later acknowledged the decision was motivated by racial prejudice rather than legitimate security concerns."
117947,111827,United States v. Paradise,Mentioned,"As recently as 1987, for example, every Justice of this Court agreed that the Alabama Department of Public Safety's 'pervasive, systematic, and obstinate discriminatory conduct' justified a narrowly tailored race-based remedy. See United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S., at 167 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 190 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 196 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).","The Court cites Paradise as an example of when race-based remedial action can be constitutional under strict scrutiny, demonstrating that strict scrutiny is not necessarily fatal to all racial classifications."
118023,110312,Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission,Mentioned,"In Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980), we took stock of our developing commercial speech jurisprudence.","The Acting Decision references Central Hudson as establishing the framework for commercial speech analysis and applies its test, without criticizing or limiting its precedential value."
118023,109450,"Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.",Mentioned,"In Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976), we expanded on our holding in Bigelow and held that the State's blanket ban on advertising the price of prescription drugs violated the First Amendment.","The Acting Decision cites Virginia Board of Pharmacy favorably as foundational precedent for commercial speech protection, providing additional analysis without questioning its validity."
118023,111744,Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico,Criticized,"The reasoning in Posadas does support the State's argument, but, on reflection, we are now persuaded that Posadas erroneously performed the First Amendment analysis.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Posadas 'erroneously performed the First Amendment analysis' and rejects its reasoning, though it does not have authority to formally overrule it."
118023,117924,Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.,Mentioned,"Last Term we held that a federal law abridging a brewer's right to provide the public with accurate information about the alcoholic content of malt beverages is unconstitutional. Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 491 (1995).","The Acting Decision cites Rubin favorably as recent precedent supporting its analysis, using it to reinforce the constitutional protection of commercial speech."
118023,1877168,"44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine",Mentioned,"The parties stipulated that the price advertising ban is vigorously enforced, that Rhode Island permits 'all advertising of alcoholic beverages excepting references to price outside the licensed premises,' and that petitioners' proposed ads do not concern an illegal activity and presumably would not be false or misleading. 44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine, 829 F. Supp. 543, 545 (RI 1993).","The Acting Decision references the lower court decision factually to establish the procedural history and factual findings, without any negative treatment."
118023,112836,"City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc.",Mentioned,"It is the State's interest in protecting consumers from 'commercial harms' that provides 'the typical reason why commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial speech.' Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 426 (1993).","The Acting Decision cites Discovery Network to support its analysis of when commercial speech regulations are appropriate, using it as authoritative precedent."
118023,112899,United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co.,Distinguished,"In Edge, we upheld a federal statute that permitted only those broadcasters located in States that had legalized lotteries to air lottery advertising. The statute was designed to regulate advertising about an activity that had been deemed illegal in the jurisdiction in which the broadcaster was located. 509 U. S., at 433-434 . Here, by contrast, the commercial speech ban targets information about entirely lawful behavior.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Edge Broadcasting by noting that it involved advertising about illegal activity, whereas the current case involves advertising about lawful behavior, making Edge inapplicable."
118023,109649,"Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Township of Willingboro",Mentioned,"For example, in Linmark, 431 U. S., at 92-94 , we concluded that a ban on 'For Sale' signs was 'content based' and failed to leave open 'satisfactory' alternative channels of communication.",The Acting Decision cites Linmark favorably as precedent supporting the principle that complete speech bans are particularly dangerous and must leave open alternative channels of communication.
118023,117963,"Florida Bar v. Went for It, Inc.",Mentioned,"Moreover, last Term we upheld a 30-day prohibition against a certain form of legal solicitation largely because it left so many channels of communication open to Florida lawyers. Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 633-634 (1995).",The Acting Decision references Went for It to illustrate the principle that speech restrictions are more likely to be upheld when they leave alternative channels of communication open.
118023,2040250,Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Ass'n v. Attorney General,Mentioned,"Moreover, it agreed with the reasoning of the Rhode Island Supreme Court that the Twenty-first Amendment gave the statutes an added presumption of validity. Id., at 8 . Alternatively, it concluded that reversal was compelled by this Court's summary action in Queensgate Investment Co. v. Liquor Control Comm'n of Ohio, 459 U. S. 807 (1982). See 39 F. 3d, at 8 . In that case the Court dismissed the appeal from a decision of the Ohio Supreme Court upholding a prohibition against off-premises advertising of the prices of alcoholic beverages sold by the drink. See Queensgate Investment Co. v. Liquor Control Comm'n of Ohio, 69 Ohio St. 2d 361 , 433 N. E. 2d 138 (1982). Queensgate has been both followed and distinguished in subsequent cases reviewing the validity of similar advertising bans.","The Acting Decision mentions the Michigan case in a footnote as one of the cases that distinguished Queensgate, providing factual background without any treatment of the Michigan decision itself."
118023,108636,California v. LaRue,Limited,"We are now persuaded that the Court's analysis in LaRue would have led to precisely the same result if it had placed no reliance on the Twenty-first Amendment... Without questioning the holding in LaRue , we now disavow its reasoning insofar as it relied on the Twenty-first Amendment.","The Acting Decision explicitly limits LaRue by disavowing its reasoning regarding the Twenty-first Amendment, while preserving its holding, thus narrowing the scope and applicability of the decision."
118155,112259,United States v. Halper,Criticized,"We believe that Halper's deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered. As subsequent cases have demonstrated, Halper's test for determining whether a particular sanction is 'punitive,' and thus subject to the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause, has proved unworkable.","The Acting Decision explicitly criticizes Halper's approach as 'ill considered' and 'unworkable,' disagreeing with its reasoning and methodology for determining punitive sanctions."
118155,106534,Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,Mentioned,"In making this latter determination, the factors listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), provide useful guideposts",The Acting Decision references Kennedy favorably as providing useful factors for analysis without criticizing or questioning its precedential value.
118155,1087946,Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch,Mentioned,"We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect. See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14 (1994)","The Acting Decision cites Kurth Ranch as support for the proposition that all civil penalties have deterrent effect, using it as authority without negative treatment."
118155,110331,United States v. Ward,Mentioned,"Our reasons for so holding in large part disavow the method of analysis used in United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448 (1989), and reaffirm the previously established rule exemplified in United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980).","The Acting Decision explicitly reaffirms Ward as the proper approach and uses it as the foundation for its analysis, treating it favorably as established precedent."
118155,118052,United States v. Ursery,Mentioned,"We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect. See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14 (1994); United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 284-285, n. 2 (1996).","The Acting Decision cites Ursery as supporting authority for the principle that civil penalties have deterrent effects, using it without negative treatment."
118155,102987,Helvering v. Mitchell,Mentioned,"The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense, Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938)","The Acting Decision cites Helvering as authority for the principle that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects only against multiple criminal punishments, using it as supportive precedent."
118155,106087,Flemming v. Nestor,Mentioned,"While petitioners have been prohibited from further participating in the banking industry, this is 'certainly nothing approaching the infamous punishment' of imprisonment.' Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960).","The Acting Decision cites Flemming as authority for distinguishing between different types of sanctions, using it supportively in its analysis."
118155,112906,United States v. Dixon,Mentioned,"This fact is insufficient to render the money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, 518 U. S., at 292, particularly in the double jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704 (1993) (rejecting 'same-conduct' test for double jeopardy purposes).","The Acting Decision cites Dixon as supporting authority for rejecting the 'same-conduct' test in double jeopardy analysis, using it favorably without negative treatment."
118149,107615,Albrecht v. Herald Co.,Overruled,"In this ease, we are asked to reconsider that decision in light of subsequent decisions of this Court. We conclude that Albrecht should be overruled.","The Court explicitly states that Albrecht should be overruled, directly nullifying the precedential value of the decision that established vertical maximum price fixing as a per se violation."
118149,109716,"Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.",Mentioned,"Nine years later, in Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 438 U. S. 36 (1977), the Court overruled Schwinn, thereby rejecting application of a per se rule in the context of vertical nonprice restrictions.","The Court references GTE Sylvania as supportive precedent that weakened Albrecht's analytical underpinnings, but does not criticize or question the decision itself."
118149,725024,"Barkat U. Khan and Khan & Associates, Inc. v. State Oil Company",Reversed,We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the ease for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.,"The Supreme Court vacated and remanded the Court of Appeals decision, directly overturning the lower court's ruling that was based on the now-overruled Albrecht precedent."
118149,112425,Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co.,Mentioned,"Most recently, in ARCO, 495 U. S. 328 (1990), although Al-brecht's continuing validity was not squarely before the Court, some disfavor with that decision was signaled by our statement that we would 'assume, arguendo, that Albrecht correctly held that vertical, maximum price fixing is subject to the per se rule.'","The Court cites ARCO as evidence that previous decisions had already signaled disfavor with Albrecht, using it to support the overruling without criticizing ARCO itself."
118149,110747,Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society,Mentioned,"As a consequence, most antitrust claims are analyzed under a 'rule of reason,' according to which the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition, taking into account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, and the restraint's history, nature, and effect. 457 U. S., at 343",The Court references Maricopa County as established precedent explaining the rule of reason analysis without any negative treatment or criticism of the decision.
118149,107491,"United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co.",Mentioned,"Four years later, in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967), the Court reconsidered the status of exclusive dealer territories and held that, upon the transfer of title to goods to a distributor, a supplier's imposition of territorial restrictions on the distributor was 'so obviously destructive of competition' as to constitute a per se violation of the Sherman Act.","The Court mentions Schwinn as historical context for understanding the development of antitrust law leading to Albrecht, noting that Schwinn was later overruled by GTE Sylvania, but does not itself treat Schwinn negatively."
118133,112887,Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District,Mentioned,"In Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993), we examined whether the IDEA, 20 U. S. C. § 1400 et seq., was constitutional as applied to a deaf student who sought to bring his state-employed sign-language interpreter with him to his Roman Catholic high school. We held that this was permissible, expressly disavowing the notion that 'the Establishment Clause [laid] down [an] absolute bar to the placing of a public employee in a sectarian school.'","The Acting Decision cites Zobrest favorably as precedent that supports its reasoning, using it to justify overruling Aguilar without criticizing or questioning its validity."
118133,111506,Aguilar v. Felton,Overruled,"We therefore hold that a federally funded program providing supplemental, remedial instruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis is not invalid under the Establishment Clause when such instruction is given on the premises of sectarian schools by government employees pursuant to a program containing safeguards such as those present here... Accordingly, we must acknowledge that Aguilar, as well as the portion of Ball addressing Grand Rapids' Shared Time program, are no longer good law.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Aguilar is 'no longer good law' and overrules it, directly nullifying its precedential value."
118133,111561,Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind,Mentioned,"In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from issuing a vocational tuition grant to a blind person who wished to use the grant to attend a Christian college and become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.","The Acting Decision cites Witters favorably as supporting precedent for its analysis, using it to demonstrate changes in Establishment Clause jurisprudence without questioning its validity."
118133,111505,School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball,Overruled,"Accordingly, we must acknowledge that Aguilar, as well as the portion of Ball addressing Grand Rapids' Shared Time program, are no longer good law... We therefore overrule Ball and Aguilar to the extent those decisions are inconsistent with our current understanding of the Establishment Clause.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Ball, stating that portions of it are 'no longer good law' and expressly overruling it to the extent it is inconsistent with current Establishment Clause understanding."
118133,108380,Lemon v. Kurtzman,Mentioned,"The Court conducted its analysis by applying the three-part test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602 (1971): 'First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.'","The Acting Decision references Lemon as the established test framework without criticizing or questioning its validity, treating it as established precedent."
118133,438842,"Felton v. Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed.",Mentioned,"Recognizing that more than 90% of the private schools within the Board's jurisdiction are sectarian, Felton v. Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed., 739 F. 2d 48, 51 (CA2 1984), the Board initially arranged to transport children to public schools for after-school Title I instruction.","The Acting Decision cites this case merely for factual background information about the percentage of sectarian schools, without any substantive legal analysis or treatment."
118133,117870,Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet,Mentioned,"Five Justices joined opinions calling for reconsideration of Aguilar. See 512 U. S., at 718 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 731 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 750 (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Thomas, J., dissenting). But the question of Aguilar's propriety was not before us.","The Acting Decision references Kiryas Joel to note that five Justices called for reconsidering Aguilar, but clarifies this did not constitute a change in law, treating it as factual background."
118133,109251,Meek v. Pittenger,Mentioned,"First, drawing upon the analysis in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975), the Court observed that 'the teachers participating in the programs may become involved in intentionally or inadvertently inculcating particular religious tenets or beliefs.'","The Acting Decision cites Meek as part of its analysis of prior precedent that supported the reasoning in Ball and Aguilar, without directly criticizing Meek itself."
118133,112679,Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,Mentioned,"In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, supra, at 384, we held that it is appropriate to grant a Rule 60(b)(5) motion when the party seeking relief from an injunction or consent decree can show 'a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.'","The Acting Decision cites Rufo favorably as establishing the standard for Rule 60(b)(5) motions, using it as supportive precedent without any negative treatment."
118133,117967,Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of University of Virginia,Mentioned,"Petitioners also argue that there have been two significant legal developments since Aguilar was decided: a majority of Justices have expressed their views that Aguilar should be reconsidered or overruled, see supra, at 214; and Aguilar has in any event been undermined by subsequent Establishment Clause decisions, including Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993), and Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995).","The Acting Decision mentions Rosenberger as one of the subsequent decisions that undermined Aguilar, treating it as supportive precedent for the changed legal landscape."
118133,112138,Bowen v. Kendrick,Mentioned,"See Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 602-604 (1988) (concluding that Adolescent Family Life Act had a secular purpose); Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 248-249 (1990) (concluding that Equal Access Act has a secular purpose)","The Acting Decision cites Bowen as an example of cases that continue to apply established Establishment Clause principles, treating it as supportive precedent without any negative treatment."
118230,104079,House v. Mayo,Overruled,"Our decision, we must acknowledge, is in direct conflict with the portion of our decision in House v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42, 44 (1945) (per curiam), holding that we lack statutory certiorari jurisdiction to review refusals to issue certificates of probable cause. Given the number and frequency of the cases, and the difficulty of reconciling our practice with a requirement that only an extraordinary writ can be used to address them, we do not think stare decisis concerns require us to adhere to that decision. Its conclusion was erroneous, and it should not be followed.","The Court explicitly states that its decision is in direct conflict with House v. Mayo and declares that the conclusion was erroneous and should not be followed, which constitutes an express overruling of the precedent."
118230,103707,Ex Parte Quirin,Mentioned,"In Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), we confronted the analogous question whether a request for leave to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was a case in a district court for the purposes of the then-extant statute governing court of appeals review of district court decisions. We held the request for leave constituted a case in the district court over which the court of appeals could assert jurisdiction, even though the district court had denied the request.","The Court cites Ex Parte Quirin as supportive precedent for its position that threshold jurisdictional inquiries can constitute cases for review purposes, without criticizing or questioning the decision's validity."
118230,112643,Payne v. Tennessee,Mentioned,"Stare decisis is 'the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.' Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).","The Court quotes Payne v. Tennessee to explain the general principle of stare decisis without any criticism or negative treatment, using it as authority for the importance of precedent."
118230,111885,Gray v. Mississippi,Mentioned,"For example, we have felt less constrained to follow precedent where, as here, the opinion was rendered without full briefing or argument. Gray v. Mississippi, 481 U. S. 648, 651, n. 1 (1987) (questioning the precedential value of Davis v. Georgia, 429 U. S. 122 (1976) (per curiam)).","The Court cites Gray v. Mississippi as support for the proposition that opinions rendered without full briefing have reduced precedential value, using it as authority without any negative treatment."
118428,99610,Evans v. Gore,Overruled,"We now overrule Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before enactment of the tax.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that it overrules Evans v. Gore regarding its holding that the Compensation Clause forbids nondiscriminatory taxes on federal judges' salaries.
118428,103214,O'Malley v. Woodrough,Mentioned,"In 1939, 14 years after Miles extended Evans' tax immunity to judges appointed after enactment of the tax, this Court retreated from that extension. See O'Malley, 307 U.S., at 283 (overruling Miles). And in so doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans dissent.","The Acting Decision references O'Malley favorably as precedent that supports its reasoning, without criticizing or questioning its validity, and uses it to support overruling Evans."
118428,110365,United States v. Will,Distinguished,"The Will Year One example, however, shows only that, in the circumstances, and unlike the case before us, the later salary increase was related to the earlier salary diminishment.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Will by noting that the circumstances in Will were different from the present case, specifically regarding whether later salary increases cured constitutional violations."
118428,702629,Hatter v. United States,Mentioned,"The Federal Circuit reversed, ordering summary judgment for the judges as to liability. 64 F. 3d 647 (1995).",The Acting Decision merely references this lower court decision as part of the procedural history without any substantive analysis or treatment of its reasoning.
111940,,,,,
118317,118011,Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida,Mentioned,"Our decision three Terms ago in Seminole Tribe, supra, held that the power 'to regulate Commerce' conferred by Article I of the Constitution gives Congress no authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity.","The Acting Decision cites Seminole Tribe as established precedent that supports its holding, without criticizing or questioning its validity."
118317,108763,Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health,Mentioned,"Only nine years later, in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279 (1973), we began to retreat from Parden.","The Acting Decision references Employees as part of the historical development of sovereign immunity jurisprudence, noting how it began the retreat from Parden without criticizing the decision itself."
118317,106821,Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama State Docks Department,Overruled,"Today, we drop the other shoe: Whatever may remain of our decision in Parden is expressly overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly and completely overrules Parden, stating that it was 'ill conceived' and describing it as an 'anomaly' that should not be salvaged."
118317,111949,Welch v. Texas Department of Highways & Public Transportation,Mentioned,"Several Terms later, in Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468 (1987), although we expressly avoided addressing the constitutionality of Congress's conditioning a State's engaging in Commerce Clause activity upon the State's waiver of sovereign immunity, we said there was 'no doubt that Parden's discussion of congressional intent to negate Eleventh Amendment immunity is no longer good law,' and overruled Parden 'to the extent [it] is inconsistent with the requirement that an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity by Congress must be expressed in unmistakably clear language.'","The Acting Decision cites Welch as part of the historical progression that limited Parden, without criticizing Welch itself but rather using it to support the current overruling of Parden."
118317,111503,Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,Mentioned,"Accordingly, our 'test for determining whether a State has waived its immunity from federal-court jurisdiction is a stringent one.' Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 478 U. S. 234, 241 (1985).","The Acting Decision cites Atascadero as established precedent supporting the stringent test for waiver of sovereign immunity, without any negative treatment."
118317,112291,Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.,Mentioned,"'All congressional creations of private rights of action attach recovery to the defendant's commission of some act, or possession of some status, in a field where Congress has authority to regulate conduct. Thus, all federal prescriptions are, insofar as their prospective application is concerned, in a sense conditional, and — to the extent that the objects of the prescriptions consciously engage in the activity or hold the status that produces liability — can be redescribed as invitations to 'waiver.'' Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 43 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting).","The Acting Decision quotes from Justice Scalia's dissent in Union Gas to support its argument about the similarity between forced waiver and abrogation, using it as supportive authority."
118317,110880,"White v. Massachusetts Council of Construction Employers, Inc.",Distinguished,"The 'market participant' cases from our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, relied upon by the United States, are inapposite. See, e.g., White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204 (1983).","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the market participant cases, including White, are 'inapposite' to the sovereign immunity context, distinguishing them as involving different legal principles."
118317,105513,California v. Taylor,Mentioned,"These considerations make Congress' need to possess the power to condition entry into the market upon a waiver of sovereign immunity (as 'necessary and proper' to the exercise of its commerce power) unusually strong, for to deny Congress that power would deny Congress the power effectively to regulate private conduct. Cf. California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553, 566 (1957).","The Acting Decision references Taylor in the dissenting opinion as supportive authority for the argument that Congress needs flexibility to regulate commerce effectively, without any negative treatment."
118317,109520,Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,Mentioned,"As authority for the abrogation in the present case, petitioner relies upon §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which we held in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, supra, and reaffirmed in Seminole Tribe, see 517 U. S., at 72-73, could be used for that purpose.","The Acting Decision cites Fitzpatrick as established precedent regarding Congress's power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to abrogate state sovereign immunity, without any criticism."
118386,118133,Agostini v. Felton,Mentioned,"In Agostini, however, we brought some clarity to our case law, by overruling two anomalous precedents (one in whole, the other in part) and by consolidating some of our previously disparate considerations under a revised test.","The Acting Decision relies heavily on Agostini as controlling precedent and uses its framework for analysis, treating it as authoritative guidance without criticism or limitation."
118386,112887,Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District,Mentioned,"The heart of our reasoning in Zobrest, upholding governmental provision of a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at his Catholic high school, was as follows: 'The service at issue in this case is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as 'disabled' under the [statute], without regard to the 'sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature' of the school the child attends.'","The Acting Decision cites Zobrest approvingly as support for the principle of neutrality and private choice in government aid programs, using it to bolster the constitutional analysis."
118386,111561,Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind,Mentioned,"In Witters, we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from including within a neutral program providing tuition payments for vocational rehabilitation a blind person studying at a Christian college to become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.","The Acting Decision uses Witters as supportive precedent for the principle that neutral aid programs involving private choice do not violate the Establishment Clause, even when aid flows to religious institutions."
118386,107737,Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,Mentioned,"The Ninth Circuit also relied, id., at 1467, on our observation in Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687 (1994), that 'we have frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of any benefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges,' id., at 704. The Ninth Circuit purported to distinguish Meek and Wolman based on the percentage of schools receiving aid that were parochial (a large percentage in those cases and a moderate percentage in Walker), 46 F. 3d, at 1468, but that court undermined this distinction when it observed that Meek also upheld 'the massive provision of textbooks to parochial schools.'","The Acting Decision references Allen as part of the historical development of Establishment Clause jurisprudence and as precedent that supports textbook lending programs, treating it as established authority."
118386,104373,Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,Mentioned,"In the over 50 years since Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), we have consistently struggled to apply these simple words in the context of governmental aid to religious schools.","The Acting Decision treats Everson as the foundational case in Establishment Clause jurisprudence regarding aid to religious schools, referencing it as the starting point for constitutional analysis in this area."
118386,109722,Wolman v. Walter,Overruled,"To the extent that Meek and Wolman conflict with this holding, we overrule them.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Wolman, finding that its distinction between textbooks and other instructional materials is no longer good law and conflicts with the Court's current constitutional analysis."
118386,109251,Meek v. Pittenger,Overruled,"To the extent that Meek and Wolman conflict with this holding, we overrule them.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Meek, determining that its reasoning regarding instructional materials and equipment lending programs is inconsistent with current Establishment Clause doctrine."
118386,111003,Mueller v. Allen,Mentioned,"The tax deduction for educational expenses that we upheld in Mueller was, in these respects, the same as the tuition grant in Witters. We upheld it chiefly because it 'neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens,' 463 U. S., at 398-399, and because 'numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children,' id., at 399, determined which schools would benefit from the deductions.","The Acting Decision cites Mueller approvingly as precedent supporting the principles of neutrality and private choice in government aid programs, using it to strengthen the constitutional framework."
118386,108380,Lemon v. Kurtzman,Limited,"Whereas in Lemon we had considered whether a statute (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or (3) creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion, see 403 U. S., at 612-613, in Agostini we modified Lemon for purposes of evaluating aid to schools and examined only the first and second factors, see 521 U. S., at 222-223.","The Acting Decision limits the application of Lemon by adopting Agostini's modification of the Lemon test, reducing its three-part analysis to a more streamlined approach for school aid cases."
118386,117967,Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of University of Virginia,Mentioned,"Finally, in addition to relying on our decision in Zobrest and the Ninth Circuit's decision in Walker, Judge Livaudais invoked Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 615 U. S. 819 (1995), in which, a few months after Walker, we held that the Establishment Clause does not require a public university to exclude a student-run religious publication from assistance available to numerous other student-run publications.","The Acting Decision references Rosenberger as supportive precedent for the principle that neutral aid programs do not violate the Establishment Clause, using it as part of the broader constitutional framework."
118273,111516,Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife v. Klamath Indian Tribe,Distinguished,"This case does not bear the weight the State places on it, however, because it has been qualified by later decisions of this Court... More importantly, however, the State's argument that similar language in two Treaties involving different parties has precisely the same meaning reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of basic principles of treaty construction.","The Court distinguishes Klamath by explaining that the facts and treaty language are materially different, and criticizes the State's attempt to apply Klamath's holding to different treaty language and circumstances."
118273,96304,United States v. Winans,Mentioned,"we interpret Indian treaties to give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood them. See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 675-676 (1979); United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 380-381 (1905).","The Court cites Winans as supporting authority for the principle that Indian treaties should be interpreted as the Indians would have understood them, without any negative treatment."
118273,746267,Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v. Minnesota (Court of Appeals),Mentioned,The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 124 F. 3d 904 (1997). Three parts of the Eighth Circuit's decision are relevant here.,"The Court simply references the Court of Appeals decision that it is reviewing, describing its holdings without criticism or negative treatment."
118273,94506,Ward v. Race Horse,Limited,"This case does not bear the weight the State places on it, however, because it has been qualified by later decisions of this Court... But Race Horse rested on a false premise. As subsequent cases have made clear, an Indian tribe's treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on state land are not irreconcilable with a State's sovereignty over the natural resources in the State.","The Court explicitly limits Race Horse by explaining that its foundational premise has been rejected by subsequent decisions, thereby narrowing its scope and applicability."
118273,110146,Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn.,Mentioned,"we interpret Indian treaties to give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood them. See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 675-676 (1979)",The Court cites this decision as supporting authority for treaty interpretation principles without any negative treatment or criticism.
118273,2261846,Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v. Minnesota (District Court),Mentioned,"After a bench trial on the Phase I issues, the District Court concluded that the Mille Lacs Band retained its usufructuary rights as guaranteed by the 1837 Treaty. 861 F. Supp. 784 (1994).",The Court simply references the District Court's decision as part of the procedural history without any criticism or negative treatment.
118273,105018,Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,Mentioned,"The Court of Appeals began its analysis of this question with a statement of black letter law: ' 'The President's power, if any, to issue the order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.' ' 124 F. 3d, at 915 (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U. S. 579, 585 (1952)).","The Court references Youngstown as establishing the basic principle regarding presidential power, citing it approvingly through the Court of Appeals' quotation."
118273,98773,New York Ex Rel. Kennedy v. Becker,Mentioned,"In New York ex rel. Kennedy v. (1916), the Court considered significantly different language. The Big Tree Treaty of 1797, as the agreement was known, provided that the Seneca were to retain 'the privilege of fishing and hunting on the said tract of land' conveyed by the agreement.","The Court references Kennedy in Justice Thomas's dissent as an example of different treaty language, without any negative treatment of the decision itself."
118273,103642,Tulee v. Washington,Mentioned,"The conservation necessity standard appears to have its origin in Tulee v. Washington, 315 U. S. 681 (1942). In the 1859 Treaty with the Yakima Indians, the Yakima reserved 'The right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory.'","The Court references Tulee in Justice Thomas's dissent as the origin of the conservation necessity standard, without any criticism or negative treatment."
118273,96748,Winters v. United States,Mentioned,"We have held that Indian treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the Indians... and that any ambiguities are to be resolved in their favor, Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564, 576-577 (1908).","The Court cites Winters as supporting authority for the principle that ambiguities in Indian treaties should be resolved in favor of the Indians, without any negative treatment."
