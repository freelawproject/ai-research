 After the picketing had continued for approximately 30 minutes, the shopping center manager again informed the pickets that if they did not leave they would be arrested for trespassing.  The pickets departed.  The union subsequently filed with the Board an unfair labor practice charge against Hudgens, alleging interference.  with rights protected by § 7 of the Act, 29 *510 U. S. C. § 157 .  2 Relying on this Court’s decision in Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 , the Board entered a cease-and-desist order against Hudgens, reasoning that because the warehouse employees enjoyed a First Amendment right to picket on the shopping center property, the owner’s threat of arrest violated § 8 (a)(1) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (a)(1).  3 Hudgens filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  Soon thereafter this Court decided Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 551</citedDecision> , and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 , and the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of those two decisions.  The Board, in turn, remanded to an Administrative Law Judge, who made findings of fact, recommendations, and conclusions to the effect that Hudgens had committed an unfair labor practice by excluding the pickets.  *511 This result was ostensibly reached under the statutory criteria set forth in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105 , a case which held that union organizers who seek to solicit for union membership may intrude on an employer’s private property if no alternative means exist for communicating with the employees.  But the Administrative Law Judge’s opinion also relied on this Court’s constitutional decision in Logan Valley for a “realistic view of the facts.” The Board agreed with the findings and recommendations of the Administrative Law Judge, but departed somewhat from his reasoning.  It concluded that the pickets were within the scope of Hudgens’ invitation to members of the public to do business at the shopping center, and that it was, therefore, immaterial whether or not there existed an alternative means of communicating with the customers and employees of the Butler store.  4 Hudgens again petitioned for review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and there the Board changed its tack and urged that the case was controlled not by Babcock & Wilcox, but by Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 , a case which held that an employer commits an unfair labor practice if he enforces a no-solicitation rule against employees on his premises who are also union organizers, unless he can prove that the rule is necessitated by special circumstances.  The Court of Appeals enforced the Board’s cease-and-desist order but on the basis of yet another theory.  While acknowledging that the source of the pickets’ rights was § 7 of the Act, the Court of Appeals held that the competing constitutional and property .right considerations discussed in Lloyd Corp. v. <citedDecision>Tanner, supra,</citedDecision> “burde[n] the General Counsel with the duty to *512 prove that other locations less intrusive upon Hudgens’ property rights than picketing inside the mall were either unavailable or ineffective,” 501 F. 2d, at 169 , and that the Board’s General Counsel had met that burden in this case. In this Court the petitioner Hudgens continues to urge that Babcock & Wilcox Co. is the controlling precedent, and that under the criteria of that case the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.  The respondent union agrees that a statutory standard governs, but insists that, since the § 7 activity here was not organizational as in Babcock but picketing in support of a lawful economic strike, an appropriate accommodation of the competing interests must lead to an affirmance of the Court of Appeals’ judgment.  The respondent Board now contends that the conflict between employee picketing rights and employer property rights in a case like this must be measured in accord with the commands of the First Amendment, pursuant to the Board’s asserted understanding of Lloyd Corp. v. <citedDecision>Tanner, supra,</citedDecision> and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed on the basis of that standard.  II As the above recital discloses, the history of this litigation has been a history of shifting positions on the part of the litigants, the Board, and the Court of Appeals.  It has been a history, in short, of considerable confusion, engendered at least in part by decisions of this Court that intervened during the course of the litigation.  In the present posture of the case the most basic question is whether the respective rights and liabilities of the parties are to be decided under the criteria of the National Labor Relations Act alone, under a First Amendment standard, or under some combination of the two.  It is to that question, accordingly, that we now turn.  *513 It is, of course, a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state.  See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Comm., 412 U. S. 94 .

 e., ‘residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a “business block” on which business places are situated.’ 326 U. S., at 502 .  I *517 can find nothing in Marsh which indicates that if one of these features is present, e. g., a business district, this is sufficient for the Court to confiscate a part of an owner’s private property and give its use to people who want to picket on it.” Id., at 332.  “To hold that store owners are compelled by law to supply picketing areas for pickets to drive store customers away is to create a court-made law wholly disregarding the constitutional basis on which private ownership of property rests in this country.  .  .  .” Id., at 332-333.  Four years later the Court had occasion to reconsider the Logan Valley doctrine in Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 551</citedDecision> .  That case involved a shopping center covering some 50 acres in downtown Portland, Ore. On a November day in 1968 five young people entered the mall of the shopping center and distributed handbills protesting the then ongoing American military operations in Vietnam.  Security guards told them to leave, and they did so, “to avoid arrest.” <citedDecision>Id., at 556</citedDecision> .  They subsequently brought suit in a Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The trial court ruled’ in their favor, holding that the distribution of handbills on the shopping center’s property was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment, 446 F. 2d 545 , expressly relying on this Court’s Marsh and Logan Valley decisions.  This Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The Court in its Lloyd opinion did not say that it was overruling the Logan Valley decision.  Indeed, a substantial portion of the Court’s opinion in Lloyd was devoted to pointing out the differences between the two cases, noting particularly that, in contrast to the hand-billing in Lloyd, the picketing in Logan Valley had been *518 specifically directed to a store in the shopping center and the pickets had had no other reasonable opportunity to reach their intended audience.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice White, concurring in the result.  While I concur in the result reached by the Court, I find it unnecessary to inter Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 (1968), and therefore do not join the Court’s opinion.  I agree that “the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no part to play in a case such as this,” ante, at 521; but Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1972), did not overrule Logan Valley, either expressly or implicitly, and I would not, somewhat after the fact, say that it did.  One need go no further than Logan Valley itself, for the First Amendment protection established by Logan Valley was expressly limited to the picketing of a specific store for the purpose of conveying information with respect to the operation in the shopping center of that store: “The picketing carried on by petitioners was *525 directed specifically at patrons of the Weis Market located within the shopping center and the message sought to be conveyed to the public concerned the manner in which that particular market was being operated.  We are, therefore, not called upon to consider whether respondents’ property rights could, consistently with the First Amendment, justify a bar on picketing which was not thus directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put.” 391 U. S., at 320 n. 9.  On its face, Logan Valley does not cover the facts of this case. The pickets of the Butler Shoe Co. store in the North DeKalb Shopping Center were not purporting to convey information about the “manner in which that particular [store] was being operated” but rather about the operation of a warehouse not located on the center’s premises.  The picketing was thus not “directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put.” The First Amendment question in this case was left open in Logan Valley.  I dissented in Logan Valley, 391 U. S., p. 337, and I see no reason to extend it further.  Without such extension, the First Amendment provides no protection for the picketing here in issue and the Court need say no more.  Lloyd v. <citedDecision>Tanner</citedDecision> is wholly consistent with this view.  There is no need belatedly to overrule Logan Valley, only to follow it as it is.

 On my reading, the Court of Appeals’ decision and, even more clearly, the Board’s decision here for review, were based solely on § 7, not on the First Amendment; and this Court ought initially consider the statutory question without reference to the First Amendment — the question on which the Court remands.  But even under the Court’s reading of the opinions of the Board and the Court of Appeals, the statutory question on which it remands is now before the Court. By bypassing that question and reaching out to overrule a constitutionally based decision, the Court surely departs from traditional modes of adjudication.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on purely statutory grounds.  And on the merits of the only question that the Court decides, I dissent from the overruling of Logan Valley.  I The Court views the history of this litigation as one of “shifting positions” and “considerable confusion.” To be sure, the Board’s position has not been constant.  But the ultimate decisions by the Administrative Law Judge *527 and by the Board rested solely on § 7 of the NLRA, not on the First Amendment.  As the Court indicates, the Board’s initial determination that petitioner violated §8 (a)(1) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (a)(1), was based on its reading of Logan Valley, a First Amendment case. But before the Court of Appeals reviewed this initial determination, this Court decided Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1972), and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 (1972), and the Board moved to have the case remanded for reconsideration in light of these two decisions.  The Court of Appeals granted the motion.  Lloyd and Central Hardware demonstrated, each in its own way, that Logan Valley could not be read as broadly as some Courts of Appeals had read it.  And together they gave a signal to the Board and to the Court of Appeals that it would be wise to pass upon statutory contentions in cases of this sort before turning to broad constitutional questions, the answers to which could no longer be predicted with certainty.  See Central Hardware, supra, at 548, 549 (Maeshall, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>Lloyd, supra, at 584</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Taking heed of this signal, the Administrative Law Judge and the Board proceeded on remand to assess the conflicting rights of the employees and the shopping center owner within the framework of the NLRA.  The Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation that petitioner be found guilty of a § 8 (a)(1) violation rested explicitly on the statutory test enunciated by this Court in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105 (1956).  That the Administrative Law Judge supported his “realistic view of the facts” by referring to this Court’s “factual view” of the Logan Valley case surely cannot be said to alter the judge’s explicitly stated legal theory, which was a statutory one.  *528 Even more clearly, the Board’s rationale in agreeing with the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation was exclusively a statutory one.  Nowhere in the Board’s decision, Hudgens v. Local SIS, Retail, Wholesale & Dept. Store Union, 205 N. L. R. B. 628 (1973), is there any reference to the First Amendment or any' constitutionally based decision.  The Board reached its result “for the reasons specifically set forth in Frank Vis-ceglia and Vincent Visceglia, t/a Peddie Buildings,” 1 ibid., a case decided solely on § 7 grounds.

 Given that concern, the crucial fact in Marsh was that the company owned the traditional forums essential for effective communication; it was immaterial that the company also owned a sewer system and that its property in other respects resembled a town.  In Logan Valley we recognized what the Court today refuses to recognize — that the owner of the modern shopping center complex, by dedicating his property to public use as a business district, to some extent displaces ■the “State” from control of historical First Amendment forums, and may acquire a virtual monopoly of places suitable for effective communication.  The roadways, parking lots, and walkways of the modern shopping cen *540 ter may be as essential for effective speech as the streets and sidewalks in the municipal or company-owned town.  7 I simply cannot reconcile the Court’s denial of any role for the First Amendment in the shopping center with Marsh’s recognition of a full role for the First Amendment on the streets and sidewalks of the company-owned town.  My reading of Marsh admittedly carried me farther than the Court in Lloyd, but the Lloyd Court remained responsive in its own way to the concerns underlying Marsh. Lloyd retained the availability of First Amendment protection when the picketing is related to the function of the shopping center, and when there is no other reasonable opportunity to convey the message to the intended audience.  Preserving Logan Valley subject to Lloyd’s two related criteria guaranteed that the First Amendment would have application in those situations in which the shopping center owner had most clearly monopolized the forums essential for effective communication.  This result, although not the optimal one in my view, Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, <citedDecision>407 U. S., at 579-583</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., dissenting), is nonetheless defensible.  In Marsh , the private entity had displaced the “state” from control of all the places to which the public had historically enjoyed access for First Amendment purposes, and the First Amendment was accordingly held fully applicable to the private entity’s conduct.  The shopping center owner, on the other hand, controls only *541 a portion of such places, leaving other traditional public forums available to the citizen.  But the shopping center owner may nevertheless control all places essential for the effective undertaking of some speech-related activities — namely, those related to the activities of the shopping center.  As for those activities, then, the First Amendment ought to have application under the reasoning of Marsh , and that was precisely the state of the law after Lloyd.  The Court’s only apparent objection to this analysis is that it makes the applicability of the First Amendment turn to some degree on the subject matter of the speech.  But that in itself is no objection, and the cases cited by the Court to the effect that government may not “restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content,” Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 (1972), are simply inapposite.

 Indeed, the Court of Appeals quite clearly viewed the Administrative Law Judge’s recommendation and the Board’s decision as statutorily based.  And the court did not even make the factual finding of functional equivalence to a business district that it recognized as a prerequisite to the application of the First Amendment.  501 F. 2d, at 164 .  It is irrelevant, in my view, that the property in this case was owned by the shopping center owner rather than by the employer.  The nature of the property interest is the same in either case. The only alternative means of communication referred to in Babcock & Wilcox were “personal contacts on streets or at home, telephones, letters or advertised meetings to get in touch with the employees.” 351 U. S., at 111 .  No point would be served by adding to the observations in Logan Valley and my dissent in Lloyd with respect to the growth of suburban shopping centers and the proliferation of activities taking place in such centers.
