 Moreover, it is consistent with our legal system that we give at least as much protection to these rights as is given in the jurisdictions described.  We deal in our country with rights grounded in a specific requirement of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, *490 whereas other jurisdictions arrived at their conclusions on the basis of principles of justice not so specifically defined.  [64] It is also urged upon us that we withhold decision on this issue until state legislative bodies and advisory groups have had an opportunity to deal with these problems by rule making.  [65] We have already pointed out that the Constitution does not require any specific code of procedures for protecting the privilege against self-incrimination during custodial interrogation.  Congress and the States are free to develop their own safeguards for the privilege, so long as they are fully as effective as those described above in informing accused persons of their right of silence and in affording a continuous opportunity to exercise it.  In any event, however, the issues presented are of constitutional dimensions and must be determined by the courts.  The admissibility of a statement in the face of a claim that it was obtained in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights is an issue the resolution of which has long since been undertaken by this Court. See Hopt v. Utah, <citedDecision>110 U. S. 574</citedDecision> (1884).  Judicial solutions to problems of constitutional dimension have evolved decade by decade.  As courts have been presented with the need to enforce constitutional rights, they have found means of doing so. That was our responsibility when Escobedo was before us and it is our *491 responsibility today.  Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.  V. Because of the nature of the problem and because of its recurrent significance in numerous cases, we have to this point discussed the relationship of the Fifth Amendment privilege to police interrogation without specific concentration on the facts of the cases before us.  We turn now to these facts to consider the application to these cases of the constitutional principles discussed above.  In each instance, we have concluded that statements were obtained from the defendant under circumstances that did not meet constitutional standards for protection of the privilege.

 Such a strict constitutional specific inserted at the nerve center of crime detection may well kill the patient.  [3] *501 Since there is at this time a paucity of information and an almost total lack of empirical knowledge on the practical operation of requirements truly comparable to those announced by the majority, I would be more restrained lest we go too far too fast.  II.  Custodial interrogation has long been recognized as "undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement." Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 515 (1963).  Recognition of this fact should put us on guard against the promulgation of doctrinaire rules.  Especially is this true where the Court finds that "the Constitution has prescribed" its holding and where the light of our past cases, from Hopt v. Utah, <citedDecision>110 U. S. 574</citedDecision> , (1884), down to Haynes v. Washington, supra , is to *502 the contrary.  Indeed, even in Escobedo the Court never hinted that an affirmative "waiver" was a prerequisite to questioning; that the burden of proof as to waiver was on the prosecution; that the presence of counsel혰 absent a waiver혰during interrogation was required; that a waiver can be withdrawn at the will of the accused; that counsel must be furnished during an accusatory stage to those unable to pay; nor that admissions and exculpatory statements are "confessions." To require all those things at one gulp should cause the Court to choke over more cases than Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958), and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 (1958), which it expressly overrules today.  The rule prior to today혰as Mr. Justice Goldberg, the author of the Court's opinion in Escobedo, stated it in Haynes v. Washington 혰depended upon "a totality of circumstances evidencing an involuntary .  .  .  admission of guilt."

 Viewed as a choice based on pure policy, these new rules prove to be a highly debatable, if not one-sided, appraisal of the competing interests, imposed over widespread objection, at the very time when judicial restraint is most called for by the circumstances.  *506 II.  CONSTITUTIONAL PREMISES.  It is most fitting to begin an inquiry into the constitutional precedents by surveying the limits on confessions the Court has evolved under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  This is so because these cases show that there exists a workable and effective means of dealing with confessions in a judicial manner; because the cases are the baseline from which the Court now departs and so serve to measure the actual as opposed to the professed distance it travels; and because examination of them helps reveal how the Court has coasted into its present position.  The earliest confession cases in this Court emerged from federal prosecutions and were settled on a nonconstitutional basis, the Court adopting the common-law rule that the absence of inducements, promises, and threats made a confession voluntary and admissible.  Hopt v. Utah, <citedDecision>110 U. S. 574</citedDecision> ; Pierce v. United States, 160 U. S. 355 .  While a later case said the Fifth Amendment privilege controlled admissibility, this proposition was not itself developed in subsequent decisions.  [2] The Court did, however, heighten the test of admissibility in federal trials to one of voluntariness "in fact," Wan v. *507 United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14 (quoted, ante, p. 462), and then by and large left federal judges to apply the same standards the Court began to derive in a string of state court cases. This new line of decisions, testing admissibility by the Due Process Clause, began in 1936 with Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 , and must now embrace somewhat more than 30 full opinions of the Court. [3] While the voluntariness rubric was repeated in many instances, e. g., Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U. S. 596 , the Court never pinned it down to a single meaning but on the contrary infused it with a number of different values.  To travel quickly over the main themes, there was an initial emphasis on reliability, e. g., Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S. 547 , supplemented by concern over the legality and fairness of the police practices, e. g., Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 , in an "accusatorial" system of law enforcement, Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 54 , and eventually by close attention to the individual's state of mind and capacity for effective choice, e. g., Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49 .  The outcome was a continuing re-evaluation on the facts of each case of how much pressure on the suspect was permissible.  [4] *508 Among the criteria often taken into account were threats or imminent danger, e. g., Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560 , physical deprivations such as lack of sleep or food, e. g., Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433 , repeated or extended interrogation, e. g., Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227 , limits on access to counsel or friends, Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 ; Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , length and illegality of detention under state law, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 , and individual weakness or incapacities, Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 .  Apart from direct physical coercion, however, no single default or fixed combination of defaults guaranteed exclusion, and synopses of the cases would serve little use because the overall gauge has been steadily changing, usually in the direction of restricting admissibility.
**Combined Opinion**
 Whatever the source of the rule excluding coerced confessions, it is clear that prior to the application of the privilege itself to state courts, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 , the admissibility of a confession in a state criminal prosecution was tested by the same standards as were applied in federal prosecutions.  Id., at 6-7, 10 .  Bram, however, itself rejected the proposition which the Court now espouses.  The question in Bram was whether a confession, obtained during custodial interrogation, had been compelled, and if such interrogation was to be deemed inherently vulnerable the Court's inquiry could have ended there.  After examining the English and American authorities, however, the Court declared that: "In this court also it has been settled that the mere fact that the confession is made to a police officer, while the accused was under arrest in or out of prison, or was drawn out by his questions, does not necessarily render the confession involuntary, but, as one of the circumstances, such imprisonment or interrogation may be taken into account in determining whether or not the statements of the prisoner were voluntary." 168 U. S., at 558 .  In this respect the Court was wholly consistent with prior and subsequent pronouncements in this Court. Thus prior to Bram the Court, in Hopt v. Utah, <citedDecision>110 U. S. 574, 583-587</citedDecision> , had upheld the admissibility of a *529 confession made to police officers following arrest, the record being silent concerning what conversation had occurred between the officers and the defendant in the short period preceding the confession.  Relying on <citedDecision>Hopt</citedDecision> , the Court ruled squarely on the issue in Sparf and Hansen v. United States, 156 U. S. 51 , 55: "Counsel for the accused insist that there cannot be a voluntary statement, a free open confession, while a defendant is confined and in irons under an accusation of having committed a capital offence.  We have not been referred to any authority in support of that position.  It is true that the fact of a prisoner being in custody at the time he makes a confession is a circumstance not to be overlooked, because it bears upon the inquiry whether the confession was voluntarily made or was extorted by threats or violence or made under the influence of fear.  But confinement or imprisonment is not in itself sufficient to justify the exclusion of a confession, if it appears to have been voluntary, and was not obtained by putting the prisoner in fear or by promises.  Wharton's Cr. Ev. 9th ed. 짠짠 661, 663, and authorities cited." Accord, Pierce v. United States, 160 U. S. 355, 357 .  And in Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 623 , the Court had considered the significance of custodial interrogation without any antecedent warnings regarding the right to remain silent or the right to counsel.
**Combined Opinion**
 The obvious underpinning of the Court's decision is a deep-seated distrust of all confessions.  As the Court declares that the accused may not be interrogated without counsel present, absent a waiver of the right to counsel, and as the Court all but admonishes the lawyer to *538 advise the accused to remain silent, the result adds up to a judicial judgment that evidence from the accused should not be used against him in any way, whether compelled or not.  This is the not so subtle overtone of the opinion혰that it is inherently wrong for the police to gather evidence from the accused himself.  And this is precisely the nub of this dissent.  I see nothing wrong or immoral, and certainly nothing unconstitutional, in the police's asking a suspect whom they have reasonable cause to arrest whether or not he killed his wife or in confronting him with the evidence on which the arrest was based, at least where he has been plainly advised that he may remain completely silent, see Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 499 (dissenting opinion).  Until today, "the admissions or confessions of the prisoner, when voluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence." Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 596 ; see also Hopt v. Utah, <citedDecision>110 U. S. 574, 584-585</citedDecision> .  Particularly when corroborated, as where the police have confirmed the accused's disclosure of the hiding place of implements or fruits of the crime, such confessions have the highest reliability and significantly contribute to the certitude with which we may believe the accused is guilty.  Moreover, it is by no means certain that the process of confessing is injurious to the accused.  To the contrary it may provide psychological relief and enhance the prospects for rehabilitation.  This is not to say that the value of respect for the inviolability of the accused's individual personality should be accorded no weight or that all confessions should be indiscriminately admitted.  This Court has long read the Constitution to proscribe compelled confessions, a salutary rule from which there should be no retreat.  But I see no sound basis, factual or otherwise, and the Court gives none, for concluding that the present rule against the receipt of coerced confessions is inadequate for the *539 task of sorting out inadmissible evidence and must be replaced by the per se rule which is now imposed.
