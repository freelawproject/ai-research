 The Court today holds that even when the reliability of state factfinding is doubtful because crucial evidence was not presented to the state trier of fact, a habeas petitioner is ordinarily not entitled to an opportunity to prove the facts necessary to his claim.  This holding, of course, directly overrules a portion of Townsend , but more than that, I think it departs significantly from the pre-Townsend law of habeas corpus.  Even before Townsend , when a habeas petitioner’s claim was properly before a federal court, and when the accurate resolution of that claim depended on proof of facts that had been resolved against the petitioner in an unreliable state proceeding, the petitioner was entitled to his day in federal court. As Justice Holmes wrote for the Court, in a case where the state courts had rejected — under somewhat suspicious circumstances — the petitioner’s allegation that his trial had been dominated by an angry mob: “[I]t does not seem to us sufficient to allow a Judge of the United States to escape the duty of examining the facts for himself when if true as alleged they make the trial absolutely void.” Moore, 261 U. S., at 92 .  The class of petitioners eligible to present claims on habeas may have been narrower in days gone by, and the class of claims one might present may have *19 been smaller, but once the claim was properly before the court, the right to a hearing was not construed as narrowly as the Court construes it today.  B Instead of looking to the history of the right to an eviden-tiary hearing, the Court simply borrows the cause and prejudice standard from a series of our recent habeas corpus cases. Ante, at 5-8.  All but one of these cases address the question of when a habeas claim is properly before a federal court despite the petitioner’s procedural default.  See Coleman v. Thompson, supra; Murray v. <citedDecision>Carrier, 477 U. S. 478</citedDecision> (1986); Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1 (1984); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107 (1982); Wainwright v. Sykes, supra; Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976).  The remaining case addresses the issue of a petitioner’s abuse of the writ.  See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991).  These cases all concern the question whether the federal court will consider the merits of the claim, that is, whether the court has the authority to upset a judgment affirmed on direct appeal.  So far as this threshold inquiry is concerned, our respect for state procedural rules and the need to discourage abuse of the writ provide the justification for the cause and prejudice standard.  As we have said in the former context: “[T]he Great Writ imposes special costs on our federal system.  The States possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law. In criminal trials they also hold the initial responsibility for vindicating constitutional rights.

 In enacting a statute that so closely parallels Townsend , Congress established a procedural framework that relies upon Townsend’s continuing validity.  In general, therefore, overruling Townsend would frustrate the evident intent of Congress that the question of when a hearing is to be held should be governed by the same standards as the question of when a federal court should defer to state court factfind-ing.  In particular, the Court’s adoption of a “cause and prejudice” standard for determining whether the material facts were adequately developed in state proceedings will frustrate Congress’ intent with respect to that Townsend circumstance’s statutory analog, § 2254(d)(3).  For a case to fit within this Townsend circumstance but none of Townsend’s other circumstances, the case will very likely be like this one, where the material facts were not *22 developed because of attorney error.  Any other reason the material facts might not have been developed, such as that they were unknown at the time or that the State denied a full and fair opportunity to develop them, will almost certainly be covered by one of Townsend’s, other circumstances.  See Townsend, 372 U. S., at 313 .  We have already held that attorney error short of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel does not amount to “cause.” See <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Carrier, 477 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> .  As a result, the practical effect of the Court’s ruling today will be that for a case to fall within Townsend’s fifth circumstance but no other — for a petitioner to be entitled to a hearing on the ground that the material facts were not adequately developed in state court but on no other ground — the petitioner’s attorney must have rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance in presenting facts to the state factfinder.  This effect is more than a little ironic.  Where the state factfinding occurs at the trial itself, counsel’s ineffectiveness will not just entitle the petitioner to a hearing — it will entitle the petitioner to a new trial. Where, as in this case, the state factfinding occurs at a postconviction proceeding, the petitioner has no constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, so counsel’s poor performance can never constitute “cause” under the cause and prejudice standard.  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S., at 752 .  After today’s decision, the only petitioners entitled to a hearing under Townsend’s fifth circumstance are the very people who do not need one, because they will have already obtained a new trial or because they will already be entitled to a hearing under one of the other circumstances.  The Court has thus rendered unusable the portion of Townsend requiring hearings where the material facts were not adequately developed in state court. As noted above, the fact that § 2254(d)(3) uses language identical to the language we used in Townsend strongly suggests that Congress presumed the continued existence of this *23 portion of Townsend .
