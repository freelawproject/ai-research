<p id="b711-8">I join the Court’s opinion but in any event would reverse on a ground not addressed by the Court, namely, that the State did not prosecute the two informations in one proceeding. I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, requires the prosecution in one proceeding, except in extremely limited circumstances not present here, of “all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction.” <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>397 U. S. 436, 453-454 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring). See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>429 U. S. 1053 (1977) (Brennan, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), and cases collected therein.</p>
