 Named as defendants in the action were the Department and its Commissioner, the Board and its Chancellor, and the city of New York and its Mayor.  In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.  3 On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held moot petitioners’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief since the city of New York and the Board, after the filing of the complaint, had changed their policies relating to maternity leaves so that no pregnant employee would have to take leave unless she was medically unable to continue to perform her job.  394 F. Supp. 853, 855 (1975).  No one now challenges this conelu *662 sion.  The court did conclude, however, that the acts complained of were unconstitutional under LaFleur, supra. 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  Nonetheless plaintiffs’ prayers for backpay were denied because any such damages would come ultimately from the city of New York and, therefore, to hold otherwise would be to “circumvenft]” the immunity conferred on municipalities by Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 167</citedDecision> (1961).  See 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  On appeal, petitioners renewed their arguments that the Board of Education 4 was not a “municipality” within the meaning of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape, supra,</citedDecision> and that, in any event, the District Court had erred in barring a damages award against the individual defendants.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions.  The court first held that the Board of Education was not a “person” under § 1983 because “it performs a vital governmental function .  .  ., and, significantly, while it has the right to determine how the funds appropriated to it shall be spent ... , it has no final say in deciding what its appropriations shall be.” 532 F. 2d 259, 263 (1976).  The individual defendants, however, were “persons” under § 1983, even when sued solely in their official capacities.  532 F. 2d, at 264 .  Yet, because a damages award would “have to be paid by a city that was held not to be amenable to such an action in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. Pape," a damages action against officials sued in their official capacities could not proceed.  <citedDecision>Id., at 265</citedDecision> .  We granted certiorari in this case, 429 U. S. 1071 , to consider “Whether local governmental officials and/or local independent school boards are 'persons’ within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. § 1983 when equitable relief in the nature of back pay is sought against them in their official capacities?” Pet. for Cert. 8.  *663 Although, after plenary consideration, we have decided the merits of over a score of cases brought under § 1983 in which the principal defendant was a school board 5 — and, indeed, in some of which § 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U. S. C. § 1343 , provided the only basis for jurisdiction 6 — we indicated in Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 279 (1977), last Term that the question presented here was open and would be decided “another day.” That other day has come and we now overrule <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape, supra,</citedDecision> insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under § 1983.  7 *664 I In <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> , we held that “Congress did not undertake to bring municipal corporations within the ambit of [§ 1983].” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 187</citedDecision> .  The sole basis for this conclusion was an inference drawn from Congress’ rejection of the “Sherman amendment” to the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13 , the precursor of § 1983.  The amendment would have held a municipal corporation liable for damage done to the person or property of its inhabitants by private persons “riotously and tumultuously assembled.” 8 Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 749 (1871) (hereinafter Globe).  Although the Sherman amendment did not seek to amend § 1 of the Act, which is now § 1983, and although the nature of the obligation created by that amendment was vastly different from that created by § 1, the Court nonetheless concluded in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> that Congress must have meant to exclude municipal corporations from the coverage of § 1 because “ 'the House [in voting against the Sherman amendment] had solemnly decided that in their judgment Congress had no constitutional power to impose any obligation upon county and town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the administration of state law.’ ” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 190</citedDecision> (emphasis added), quoting Globe 804 (Rep. Poland).  This statement, we thought, showed that Congress doubted its “constitutional power .  .  .  to impose civil liability on municipalities,” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 190</citedDecision> (emphasis added), and that such doubt would have extended to any type of civil liability.  9 *665 A fresh analysis of the debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and particularly of the case law which each side mustered in its support, shows, however, that <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> incorrectly equated the “obligation” of which Representative Poland spoke with “civil liability.” A. An Overview There are three distinct stages in the legislative consideration of the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  On March 28, 1871, Representative Shellabarger, acting for a House select committee, reported H. R. 320, a bill “to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes.” H. R. 320 contained four sections.  Section 1, now codified as 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , was the subject of only limited debate and was passed without amendment.  10 Sections 2 through 4 dealt primarily with the “other purpose” of suppressing Ku Klux Klan violence in the Southern States.  11 The wisdom and constitutionality of these sections — not § 1, now § 1983 — were the subject of almost all congressional debate and each of these sections was amended.  The House finished its initial debates on H. R. 320 on April 7, 1871, and one week later the Senate also voted out a bill.  12 Again, debate on § 1 of the bill was limited and that section was passed as introduced.

 If a municipality were liable, the judgment against it could be collected “by execution, attachment, mandamus, garnishment, or any other proceeding in aid of execution or applicable to the enforcement of judgments against municipal corporations; and such judgment [would become] a lien as well upon all moneys in the treasury of such county, city, or parish, as upon the other property thereof.” In the ensuing debate on the first conference report, which was the first debate of any kind on the Sherman amendment, Senator Sherman explained that the purpose of his amendment was to enlist the aid of persons of property in the enforcement of the civil rights laws by making their property “responsible” for Ku Klux Klan damage.  16 Statutes drafted on a similar theory, he stated, had long been in force in England and were in force in 1871 in a number of States.  17 *668 Nonetheless there were critical differences between the conference substitute and extant state and English statutes: The conference substitute, unlike most state riot statutes, lacked a short statute of limitations and imposed liability on the government defendant whether or not it had notice of the impending riot, whether or not the municipality was authorized to exercise a police power, whether or not it exerted all reasonable efforts to stop the riot, and whether or not the rioters were caught and punished.  18 The first conference substitute passed the Senate but was rejected by the House.  House opponents, within whose ranks were some who had supported § 1, thought the Federal Government could not, consistent with the Constitution, obligate municipal corporations to keep the peace if those corporations were neither so obligated nor so authorized by their state charters.  And, because of this constitutional objection, opponents of the Sherman amendment were unwilling to impose damages liability for nonperformance of a duty which Congress could not require municipalities to perform.  This position is reflected in Representative Poland's statement that is quoted in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> .  19 Because the House rejected the first conference report a second conference was called and it duly issued its report.  The second conference substitute for the Sherman amendment abandoned municipal liability and, instead, made “any per *669 son or persons having knowledge [that a conspiracy to violate civil rights was afoot], and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the same,” who did not attempt to stop the same, liable to any person injured by the conspiracy.  20 The amendment in this form was adopted by both Houses of Congress and is now codified as 42 U. S. C. § 1986 .  The meaning of the legislative history sketched above can most readily be developed by first considering the debate on the report of the first conference committee.  This debate shows conclusively that the constitutional objections raised against the Sherman amendment — on which our holding in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> was based, see supra, at 664 — would not have prohibited congressional creation of a civil remedy against state municipal corporations that infringed federal rights.  Because § 1 of the Civil Rights Act does not state expressly that municipal corporations come within its ambit, it is finally necessary to interpret § 1 to confirm that such corporations were indeed intended to be included within the “persons” to whom that section applies.  B. Debate on the First Conference Report The style of argument adopted by both proponents and opponents of the Sherman amendment in both Houses of Congress was largely legal, with frequent references to cases decided by this Court and the Supreme Courts of the several States.  Proponents of the Sherman amendment did not, however, discuss in detail the argument in favor of its constitutionality.  Nonetheless, it is possible to piece together such an argument from the debates on the first conference report and those on § 2 of the civil rights bill, which, because it allowed the Federal Government to prosecute crimes “in the States,” had also raised questions of federal power.  The account of Representative Shellabarger, the House sponsor of H. R. 320, is the most complete.  *670 Shellabarger began his discussion of H. R. 320 by stating that “there is a domain of constitutional law involved in the right consideration of this measure which is wholly unexplored.” Globe App. 67.

 Simply because the power to tax involves the power to destroy, and it was not the intent to give the Government of the United States power to destroy the government of the States in any respect.  It was held also in the case of Prigg vs. Pennsylvania [ 16 Pet. 539 (1842)] that it is not within the power of the Congress of the United States to lay duties upon a State officer; that we cannot command a State officer to do any duty whatever, as such; and I ask .  .  .  the difference between that and commanding a municipality, which is equally the creature of the State, to perform a duty.” Globe 795.  Any attempt to impute a unitary constitutional theory to opponents of the Sherman amendment is, of course, fraught *676 with difficulties, not the least of which is that most Members of Congress did not speak to the issue of the constitutionality of the amendment.  Nonetheless, two considerations lead us to conclude that opponents of the Sherman amendment found it unconstitutional substantially because of the reasons stated by Representative Blair: First, Blair’s analysis is precisely that of Poland, whose views were quoted as authoritative in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , see supra, at 664, and that analysis was shared in large part by all House opponents who addressed the constitutionality of the Sherman amendment.  31 Second, Blair’s exegesis of the reigning constitutional theory of his day, as we shall explain, was clearly supported by precedent — albeit precedent that has not survived, see Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 347-348 (1880); Graves v. New York ex rel. O’Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 486 (1939) — and no other constitutional formula was advanced by participants in the House debates.  Collector v. Day , cited by Blair, was the clearest and, at the time of the debates, the most recent pronouncement of a doctrine of coordinate sovereignty that, as Blair stated, placed limits on even the enumerated powers of the National Government in favor of protecting state prerogatives.  There, the Court held that the United States could not tax the income of Day, a Massachusetts state judge, because the independence of the States within their legitimate spheres would be imperiled if the instrumentalities through which States executed their powers were "subject to the control of another and distinct government.” 11 Wall., at 127 .  Although the Court in Day apparently rested this holding in part on the proposition that the taxing "power acknowledges no limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the tax,” id., at 125-126 ; cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), the Court had in other cases limited other national powers in order to avoid interference with the States.  32 *677 In Prigg v. Pennsylvania , for example, Mr. Justice Story, in addition to confirming a broad national power to legislate under the Fugitive Slave Clause, see supra, at 672, held that Congress could not “insist that states .  .

 Mr. Chief Justice Taney, writing for a unanimous Court, refused to enforce that section of the Act: “[W]e think it clear, that the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it; for if it possessed this power, it might overload the officer with duties which would fill up' all his time, and disable him from performing his obligations to the State, and might impose on him duties of a character incompatible with the rank and dignity to which he was elevated by the State.” 24 How., at 107-108.  The rationale of Dennison — that the Nation could not impose duties on state officers since that might impede States in their legitimate activities — is obviously identical to that which animated the decision in Collector v. Day .  See supra, at 676.  And, as Blair indicated, municipalities as instrumen-talities through which States executed their policies could be equally disabled from carrying out state policies if they were also obligated to carry out federally imposed duties.  Although no one cited Dennison by name, the principle for which it *679 stands was well known to Members of Congress, 36 many of whom discussed Day 37 as well as a series of State Supreme Court cases 38 in the mid-1860’s which had invalidated a federal tax on the process of state courts on the ground that the tax threatened the independence of a vital state function.  39 Thus, there was ample support for Blair’s view that the Sherman amendment, by putting municipalities to the Hobson’s choice of keeping the peace or paying civil damages, attempted to impose obligations on municipalities by indirection that could not be imposed directly, thereby threatening to “destroy the government of the States.” Globe 795.  If municipal liability under § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 created a similar Hobson’s choice, we might conclude, as <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> did, that Congress could not have intended municipalities to be among the “persons” to which that section applied.  But this is not the case. Hirst, opponents expressly distinguished between imposing an obligation to keep the peace and merely imposing civil liability for damages on a municipality that was obligated by state law to keep the peace, but which had not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Representative Poland, for example, reasoning from Contract Clause precedents, indicated that Congress could constitutionally confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to entertain suits seeking to hold municipalities *680 liable for using their authorized powers in violation of the Constitution — which is as far as § 1 of the Civil Nights Act went: “I presume .  .  .  that where a State had imposed a duty [to keep the peace] upon [a] municipality ... an action would be allowed to be maintained against them in the courts of the United States under the ordinary restrictions as to jurisdiction.  But the enforcing a liability, existing by their own contract, or by a State law, in the courts, is a very widely different thing from devolving a new duty or liability upon them by the national Government, which has no power either to create or destroy them, and no power or control over them whatever.” Globe 794.

 government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.  Since this case unquestionably involves official policy as the moving force of the constitutional violation found by the District Court, see supra, at *695 660-662, and n. 2, we must reverse the judgment below.  In so doing, we have no occasion to address, and do not address, what the full contours of municipal liability under § 1983 may be.  We have attempted only to sketch so much of the § 1983 cause of action against a local government as is apparent from the history of the 1871 Act and our prior cases, and we expressly leave further development of this action to another day. Ill Although we have stated that stare decisis has more force in statutory analysis than in constitutional adjudication because, in the former situation, Congress can correct our mistakes through legislation, see, e. g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 671 , and n. 14 (1974), we have never applied stare decisis mechanically to prohibit overruling our earlier decisions determining the meaning of statutes.  See, e. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47-49 (1977); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 , 406 n. 1 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  Nor is this a case where we should “place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court’s own error.” Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).  First, <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> , insofar as it completely immunizes municipalities from suit under § 1983, was a departure from prior practice.  See, e. g., Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, 18 F. Cas. 393 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873); City of Manchester v. Leiby, 117 F. 2d 661 (CA1 1941); Hannan v. City of Haverhill, 120 F. 2d 87 (CA1 1941); Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157 (1943); Holmes v. Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 (1955), in each of which municipalities were defendants in § 1983 suits.  59 Moreover, the constitutional de- *696 feet that led to the rejection of the Sherman amendment would not have distinguished between municipalities and school boards, each of which is an instrumentality of state administration.  See supra, at 673-682.  For this reason, our cases — decided both before and after <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , see n. 5, supra— holding school boards liable in § 1983 actions are inconsistent with <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , especially as Monroe’s, immunizing principle was extended to suits for injunctive relief in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507 (1973).  60 And although in many of these cases jurisdiction was not questioned, we ought not “disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years.” Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962); see Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, at 88 (Marshall, C. J.) (“Those decisions are not cited as authority .  .  .  but they have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench”).  Thus, while we have reaffirmed <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> without further examination on three occasions, 61 it can scarcely be said that <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> is so consistent with the warp and woof of civil rights law as to be beyond question.  Second, the principle of blanket immunity established in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> cannot be cabined short of school boards.  Yet such an extension would itself be inconsistent with recent expressions of congressional intent.  In the wake of our decisions, Congress not only has shown no hostility to federal-court decisions against school boards, but it has indeed rejected efforts to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over school boards.  62 Moreover, recognizing that school boards are often *697 defendants in school desegregation suits, which have almost without exception been § 1983 suits, Congress has twice passed legislation authorizing grants to school boards to assist them in complying with federal-court decrees.  63 Finally, in *698 regard to the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641 , 42 U. S. C. § 1988 (1976 ed.), which allows prevailing parties (in the discretion of the court) in § 1983 suits *699 to obtain attorney’s fees from the losing parties, the Senate stated: “[Defendants in these cases are often State or local bodies or State or local officials.  In such cases it is intended that the attorneys’ fees, like other items of costs, will be collected either directly from the official, in his official capacity, from funds of his agency or under his control, or from the State or local government (whether or not the agency or government is a named party).” S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).  Far from showing that Congress has relied on <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , therefore, events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> to school boards and has attempted to allow awards of attorney’s fees against local governments even though Monroe, City of Kenosha v. Bruno , and Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible.  64 Third, municipalities can assert no reliance claim which can *700 support an absolute immunity.  As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , “[t]his is not an area of commercial law in which, presumably, individuals may have arranged their affairs in reliance on the expected stability of decision.” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 221-222</citedDecision> (dissenting in part).  Indeed, municipalities simply cannot “arrange their affairs” on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely since injunctive suits against local officials under § 1983 would prohibit any such arrangement.  And it scarcely need be mentioned that nothing in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> encourages municipalities to violate constitutional rights or even suggests that such violations are anything other than completely wrong.  Finally, even under the most stringent test for the propriety of overruling a statutory decision proposed by Mr. Justice Harlan in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> 65 — “that it appear beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [Monroe] misapprehended the meaning of the [section],” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> (concurring opinion) — the overruling of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> insofar as it holds that local governments are not “persons” who may be defendants in § 1983 suits is clearly proper.  It is simply beyond doubt that, under the 1871 Congress’ view of the law, were § 1983 liability unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state officers.  Yet everyone — proponents and opponents alike — knew § 1983 would be applied to state officers and nonetheless stated that § 1983 was constitutional.  See supra, at 680-682.  And, moreover, there can be no doubt that § 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected *701 rights.  Therefore, absent a clear statement in the legislative history supporting the conclusion that § 1 was not to apply to the official acts of a municipal corporation — which simply is not present — there is no justification for excluding municipalities from the “persons” covered by § 1.  For the reasons stated above, therefore, we hold that stare decisis does not bar our overruling of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> insofar as it is inconsistent with Parts I and II of this opinion.  66 IV Since the question whether local government bodies should be afforded some form of official immunity was not presented as a question to be decided on this petition and was not briefed by the parties or addressed by the courts below, we express no views on the scope of any municipal immunity beyond holding that municipal bodies sued under § 1983 cannot be entitled to an absolute immunity, lest our decision that such bodies are subject to suit under § 1983 “be drained of meaning,” Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 248 (1974).  Cf. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 397-398 (1971).  *702 y For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT As proposed, the Sherman amendment was as follows: “That if any house, tenement, cabin, shop, building, barn, or granary shall be unlawfully or feloniously demolished, pulled down, burned, or destroyed, wholly or in part, by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together; or if any person shall unlawfully and with force and violence be whipped, scourged, wounded, or killed by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together; and if such offense was committed to deprive any person of any right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude, in every such case the inhabitants of the county, city, or parish in which any of the said offenses shall be committed shall be liable to pay full compensation to the person or persons damnified by such offense if living, or to his widow or legal representative if dead; and such compensation may be recovered by such person or his representative by a suit in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in the district in which the offense was committed, to be in the name of the person injured, or his legal representative, and against said county, city, or parish.  And execution may be issued on a judgment rendered in such suit and may be levied upon any property, real or personal, of any person in said county, city, or parish, and the said county, city, or parish may recover the full amount of such judgment, costs and interest, *703 from any person or persons engaged as principal or accessory in such, riot in an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.” Globe 663.  The complete text of the first conference substitute for the Sherman amendment is: “That if any house, tenement, cabin, shop, building, barn, or granary shall be unlawfully or feloniously demolished, pulled down, burned, or destroyed, wholly or in part, by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together; or if any person shall unlawfully and with force and violence be whipped, scourged, wounded, or killed by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together, with intent to deprive any person of any right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude, in every such case the county, city, or parish in which any of the said offenses shall be committed shall be liable to pay full compensation to the person or persons damnified by such offense, if living, or to his widow or legal representative if dead; and such compensation may be recovered in an action on the case by such person or his representative in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in the district in which the offense was committed, such action to be in the name of the person injured, or his legal representative, and against said county, city, or parish, and in which action any of the parties committing such acts may be joined as defendants.

However, we do uphold Monroe v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> insofar as it holds that the doctrine of respondeat superior is not a basis for rendering municipalities *664 liable under § 1983 for the constitutional torts of their employees.  See Part II, infra.  We expressly declined to consider “policy considerations” for or against municipal liability.  See 365 U. S., at 191.  Mr. Justice Douglas, the author of Monroe, has suggested that the municipal exclusion might more properly rest on a theory that Congress sought to prevent the financial ruin that civil rights liability might impose on municipalities.  See City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507, 517-520 *665 (1973).  However, this view has never been shared by the Court, see Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 190</citedDecision> ; Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 708 (1973), and the debates do not support this position.  Globe 522.  Briefly, § 2 created certain federal crimes in addition to those defined in § 2 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, 14 Stat. 27 , each aimed primarily at the Ku Klux Klan.  Section 3 provided that the President could send the militia into any State wracked with Klan violence.  Finally, § 4 provided for suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in enumerated circumstances, again primarily those thought to obtain where Klan violence was rampant.  See Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 335-336 (1871) (hereinafter Globe App.).  Globe 709.

Other supporters were quite clear that § 1 of the Act extended a remedy not only where a State had passed an unconstitutional statute, but also *686 where officers of the State were deliberately indifferent to the rights of black citizens: “But the chief complaint is .  .  .  [that] by a systematic maladministration of [state law], or a neglect or refusal to enforce their provisions, a portion of the people are denied equal protection under them.  Whenever such a state of facts is clearly made out, I believe [§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment] empowers Congress to step in and provide for doing justice to those persons who are thus denied equal protection.” Id., at 153 (Rep. Garfield).  See also Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 171-187</citedDecision> .  Importantly for our inquiry, even the opponents of § 1 agreed that it was constitutional and, further, that it swept very broadly.  Thus, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of § 1, said: “This section relates wholly to civil suits.  ... Its whole effect is to give to the Federal Judiciary that which now does not belong to it — a jurisdiction that may be constitutionally conferred upon it, I grant, but that has never yet been conferred upon it.  It authorizes any person who is deprived of any right, privilege, or immunity secured to him by the Constitution of the United States, to bring an action against the wrong-doer in the Federal courts, and that without any limit whatsoever as to the amount in controversy.  .  .
