 .  .  together." It is entirely free to bring them separately, and can win convictions in both.  Of course the collateralestoppel issue is not raised in this case. Justice Souter relies upon four cases to establish the existence of some minimal antecedents to Grady.  Post, at 749-758.  The fountainhead of the "same-conduct" rule, he asserts, is In re Nielsen, <citedDecision>131 U. S. 176</citedDecision> (1889).  That is demonstrably wrong.  <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> simply applies the common proposition, entirely in accord with Blockburger , that prosecution for a greater offense (cohabitation, defined to require proof of adultery) bars prosecution for a lesser included offense (adultery).  That is clear from the <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> Court's framing of the question ("Being of opinion, therefore, that habeas corpus was a proper remedy for the petitioner, if the crime of adultery with which he was charged was included in the crime of unlawful cohabitation for which he was convicted and punished, that question is now to be considered," <citedDecision>131 U. S., at 185</citedDecision> (emphasis added)), from its legal analysis, <citedDecision>id., at 186-189</citedDecision> , and from its repeated observations that cohabitation required proof of adultery, <citedDecision>id., at 187, 189</citedDecision> .  [10] *706 His second case comes almost a century later.  Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161 (1977), contains no support for his position except a footnote that cites <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> for the proposition that "[t]he Blockburger test is not the only standard for determining whether successive prosecutions impermissibly involve the same offense." Brown, supra, at 166-167, n. 6 .  Not only is this footnote the purest dictum, but it flatly contradicts the text of the opinion which, on the very next page, describes <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> as the first Supreme Court case to endorse the Blockburger rule.  Brown, supra, at 168 .  Quoting that suspect dictum multiple times, see post, at 748, 754, cannot convert it into case law. See United States Nat. Bank of Ore. v. Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc., 508 U. S. 439, 463, n. 11 (1993) (emphasizing "the need to distinguish an opinion's holding from its dicta").  The holding of Brown , like that of <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> , rests squarely upon the existence of a lesser included offense.  432 U. S., at 162 (setting out question presented).  The third case is Harris , which Justice Souter asserts was a reaffirmation of what he contends was the earlier holding in <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> , that the Blockburger test is "insufficien[t] for determining when a successive prosecution [is] barred," and that conduct, and not merely elements of the offense, must be the object of inquiry.  Post, at 755.  Surely not.  Harris never uses the word "conduct," and its entire discussion focuses on the elements of the two offenses.  See, e. g., 433 U. S., at 682-683 , n. (to prove felony murder, "it was necessary for all the ingredients of the underlying felony" to be proved).  Far from validating Justice Souter's extraordinarily implausible reading of Nielsen, Harris plainly rejects that reading, treating the earlier case as having focused (like Blockburger ) upon the elements of the offense.  Immediately *707 after stating that conviction for felony murder, a "greater crime," "cannot be had without conviction of the lesser crime," the Harris Court quotes <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> `s statement that "`a person [who] has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it, .  .  .  cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents.' " 433 U. S., at 682-683 , quoting from <citedDecision>131 U. S., at 188</citedDecision> .  It is clear from that context that Harris regarded "incidents included" to mean "offenses included"a reference to defined crimes rather than to conduct.  Finally, Justice Souter misdescribes Vitale .  Despite his bold assertion to the contrary, see post, at 757, Vitale unquestionably reads Harris as merely an application of the double jeopardy bar to lesser and greater included offenses.  [11] Justice Souter instead elevates the statement in Vitale that, on certain hypothetical facts, the petitioner would have a "substantial" "claim" of double jeopardy on a Grady -type theory, see post, at 756-757, into a holding that the petitioner would win on that theory.  Post, at 757, 763.  No Justice, the Vitale dissenters included, has ever construed this passage as answering, rather than simply raising, the question on which we later granted certiorari in Grady .  See 447 U. S., at 426 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (in addition to finding the same-conduct claim "substantial," dissent would find it "dispositive").  See also Grady, 495 U. S., at 510 ( Vitale "suggested" same-conduct test adopted in Grady ).  In contrast to the above-discussed dicta relied upon by Justice Souter, there are two pre- Grady ( and post <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> ) cases that are directly on point.  In both Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S., at 343 , and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), the Court upheld subsequent *708 prosecutions after concluding that the Blockburger test (and only the Blockburger test) was satisfied.  [12] These cases are incompatible with the belief that <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> had created an additional requirement beyond the "elements" standard.  [13] Totally ignored by Justice Souter are the *709 many early American cases construing the Double Jeopardy Clause, which support only an "elements" test.  See Grady, supra, at 533-535 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  [14] But Grady was not only wrong in principle; it has already proved unstable in application.  Less than two years after it came down, in United States v. Felix, 503 U. S. 378 (1992), we were forced to recognize a large exception to it.  There we concluded that a subsequent prosecution for conspiracy to manufacture, possess, and distribute methamphetamine was not barred by a previous conviction for attempt to manufacture the same substance.  We offered as a justification for avoiding a "literal" ( i.
**Combined Opinion**
 If a person committed a robbery in a dwelling with a firearm and was prosecuted for simple robbery, all agree he could not be prosecuted subsequently for either of the greater offenses of robbery with a firearm or robbery in a dwelling.  Under the lens of Blockburger , however, if that same person were prosecuted first for robbery with a firearm, he could be prosecuted subsequently for robbery in a dwelling, even though he could not subsequently be prosecuted on the basis of that same robbery for simple robbery.  [3] This is true simply because neither of the crimes, robbery *749 with a firearm and robbery in a dwelling, is either identical to or a lesser included offense of the other.  But since the purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause's protection against successive prosecutions is to prevent repeated trials in which a defendant will be forced to defend against the same charge again and again, and in which the government may perfect its presentation with dress rehearsal after dress rehearsal, it should be irrelevant that the second prosecution would require the defendant to defend himself not only from the charge that he committed the robbery, but also from the charge of some additional fact, in this case, that the scene of the crime was a dwelling.  [4] If,instead, protection against successive prosecutions were as limited as it would be by Blockburger alone, the doctrine would be as striking for its anomalies as for the limited protection it would provide.  Thus, in the relatively few successive prosecution cases we have had over the years, we have not held that the Blockburger test is the only hurdle the government must clear (with one exception, see infra, at 758-759).  IV The recognition that a Blockburger rule is insufficient protection against successive prosecution can be seen as long ago as In re Nielsen, <citedDecision>131 U. S. 176</citedDecision> (1889), where we held that conviction for one statutory offense precluded later prosecution for another, even though each required proof of a fact the other did not.  There, appellant Nielsen had been convicted after indictment and a guilty plea in what was then the Territory of Utah for "cohabit[ing] with more than one woman," based upon his cohabitation with Anna Lavinia *750 Nielsen and Caroline Nielsen during the period from October 15, 1885, to May 13, 1888, in violation of a federal antipolygamy law. See Act ofMar.  22, 1882, ch. 47,§ 3, 22 Stat. 31 .  Nielsen served his sentence of three months' imprisonment and paid a $100 fine.  He then came to trial on a second indictment charging him under another federal antipolygamy law with committing adultery with Caroline Nielsen on the day following the period described in the first indictment, May 14, 1888, based on the fact that he was married and had a lawful wife, and was not married to Caroline Nielsen.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 397, § 3, 24 Stat. 635 .  Nielsen pleaded former jeopardy to the second indictment, arguing first that the true period of the cohabitation charged in the first indictment extended well beyond May 13 until the day of the indictments, September 27, 1888, and that "the offence charged in both indictments was one and the same offence and not divisible." <citedDecision>131 U. S., at 178</citedDecision> .  The Government argued that the two crimes were not the same because the elements of the two offenses differed.  The <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> Court first considered the question whether the offense of unlawful cohabitation included, in a temporal sense, the single act of adultery subsequently prosecuted.  On this question, the Court first noted, following In re Snow, 120 U. S. 274 (1887), that although the indictment for cohabitation listed May 13, 1888, as the end of that offense, cohabitation is a "`continuing offence .  .  .  [that] canbe committed but once, for the purposes of indictment or prosecution, prior to the time the prosecution is instituted.' " <citedDecision>131 U. S., at 186</citedDecision> (quoting Snow, supra, at 282 ).  Thus, the <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> Court interpreted the indictment for cohabitation as covering a single continuing offense that ended on the day the indictment was handed up.  See <citedDecision>131 U. S., at 187</citedDecision> .  Having concluded that the offense of cohabitation was a "continuous" one, "extending over the whole period, including the time when the adultery was alleged to have been committed," <citedDecision>id., at 187</citedDecision> , the Court then considered the question *751 whether double jeopardy applies where a defendant is first convicted of a continuing offense and then indicted for some single act that the continuing offense includes.  The Court answered this question by quoting with approval an observation found in Morey v. Commonwealth, 108 Mass. 433 (1871), that "[a] conviction of being a common seller of intoxicating liquors has been held to bar a prosecution for a single sale of such liquors within the same time." Id., at 435 .  The Court then conceded that quoting this observation from the Morey opinion would not alone suffice to decide the case before it, since the Government was relying on a further statement from Morey , this one expressing the Morey court's reason for holding that a prior conviction on a charge of "lewdly and lasciviously associating" with an unmarried woman was no bar to a subsequent prosecution for adultery: "[A]lthough proof of the same acts of unlawful intercourse was introduced on both trials[,] .  .  .  the evidence required to support the two indictments was not the same." <citedDecision>131 U. S., at 188</citedDecision> .  The Morey court's reasoning behind this holding was that "[a] single act may be an offence against two statutes; and if each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the other." 108 Mass., at 434 , quoted in <citedDecision>Nielsen, supra, at 188</citedDecision> .  Morey `s rule governing subsequent prosecution, in other words, was what we know today as the Blockburger elements test.  The <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> Court held the Blockburger test inapplicable for two reasons.  First, it distinguished Morey by noting that "[t]he crime of loose and lascivious association .  .  .  did not necessarily imply sexual intercourse," <citedDecision>131 U. S., at 188</citedDecision> , while the continuous offense involved in <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> , cohabitation under the polygamy statute, required proof of "[l]iving together as man and wife," which "[o]f course" implies "sexual intercourse," even though intercourse need not have been pleaded or proven under a cohabitation indictment, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at *752 187.  (The second offense charged in both Morey and the case before the Court in <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> was adultery, which, of course, did require an act of sexual intercourse.) But even on the assumption that the continuous crime in Morey necessarily did imply sexual intercourse, rendering the cases indistinguishable on their facts, the <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> Court indicated that it would not follow the holding in Morey .  To the <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> Court, it was "very clear that where, as in this case, a person has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it, he cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents without being twice put in jeopardy for the same offence." <citedDecision>131 U. S., at 188</citedDecision> .  By this last statement, the Court rejected, in a successive prosecution case, the double jeopardy test set out in Morey , which we later adopted in Blockburger ; instead of agreeing with Morey that "`[t]he test is not, whether the defendant has already been tried for the same act,' " the Court concluded that a defendant "cannot be a second time tried" for a single act included as one of the "various incidents" of a continuous crime for which he has already been convicted.  [5] <citedDecision>131 U. S., at 188</citedDecision> .  The Court then went on to address the contention that adultery, as opposed to sexual intercourse, is not an act included in the continuing offense of cohabitation, because *753 adultery requires proof that one of the parties is married, while cohabitation does not require such proof.  Although the Court agreed that adultery contains such an element, the Court found that this element was irrelevant under its successive prosecution rule, because sexual intercourse is the "essential and principal ingredient of adultery." <citedDecision>Id., at 189</citedDecision> .  In other words, what may not be successively prosecuted is the act constituting the "principal ingredient" of the second offense, if that act has already been the subject of the prior prosecution.  It is beside the point that the subsequent offense is defined to include, in addition to that act, some further element uncommon to the first offense (where the first offense also includes an element not shared by the second).  Thus, as the Court states its holding, the cohabitation conviction "was a good bar" because "the material part of the adultery charged [ i.  e., intercourse] was comprised within the unlawful cohabitation of which the petitioner was already convicted." <citedDecision>Id., at 187</citedDecision> (emphasis supplied); see also <citedDecision>ibid.</citedDecision> (sexual intercourse "was the integral part of the adultery charged in the second indictment") (emphasis supplied).  One final aspect of the <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> opinion deserves attention.  After rejecting a Blockburger test for successive prosecutions, the Court then proceeded to discuss the familiar rule that conviction of a greater offense bars subsequent prosecution for a lesser included offense.  This discussion misleads the majority into thinking that <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> does nothing more than apply that familiar rule, which is, of course, a corollary to the Blockburger test.  See ante, at 705.  But <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> `s discussion did not proceed on the ground that the Court believed adultery to be a lesser included offense of cohabitation (and thus its later prosecution barred for that reason); on the contrary, the Court had just finished explaining that marriage must be proven for adultery, but not for cohabitation, which precluded finding adultery to be a lesser included offense of cohabitation.  The discussion of the lesser included offense rule is apposite for the different reason that once the *754 element of marriage was disregarded (as the Court had just done, considering instead only adultery's "principal ingredient" of intercourse), the act of intercourse stood to cohabitation as a lesser included offense stands to the greater offense.  By treating intercourse as though it were a lesser included offense, <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> barred subsequent prosecution for that act under an adultery charge.  Indeed, on any other reading we would have to conclude that the <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> Court did not know what it was doing, for if it had been holding only that a subsequent prosecution for a lesser included offense was barred, the adultery prosecution would not have been.  There can be no question that the Court was adopting the very different rule that subsequent prosecution is barred for any charge comprising an act that has been the subject of prior conviction.  [6] V Our modern cases reflect the concerns that resulted in <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> `s holding.  We have already quoted the observation that "[t]he Blockburger test is not the only standard for determining whether successive prosecutions impermissibly involve the same offense.  Even if two offenses are sufficiently different to permit the imposition of consecutive sentences, successive prosecutions will be barred in some circumstances where the second prosecution requires the relitigation of factual issues already resolved by the first." Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S., at 166-167, n. 6 .  The Brown Court, indeed, relied on <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> for this proposition.  "[I]n In re Nielsen, <citedDecision>131 U. S. 176</citedDecision> (1889), the Court held that a conviction of a Mormon on a charge of cohabiting with his two wives over a 2 12-year period barred a subsequent prosecution for adultery with one of them on the day following the end of that period .  .  .  .  [S]trict application of the Blockburger test would have permitted *755 imposition of consecutive sentences had the charges been consolidated in a single proceeding.  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 held the separate offenses to be the `same.' " Ibid. In the past 20 years the Court has addressed just this problem of successive prosecution on three occasions.  In Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977) (per curiam) , we held that prosecution for a robbery with firearms was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause when the defendant had already been convicted of felony murder comprising the same robbery with firearms as the underlying felony.  Of course the elements of the two offenses were different enough to permit more than one punishment under the Blockburger test: felony murder required the killing of a person by one engaged in the commission of a felony, see 21 Okla. Stat., Tit. 21, § 701 (1971); robbery with firearms required the use of a firearm in the commission of a robbery, see §§ 801, 791.  Harris v. State, 555 P. 2d 76, 80 (Okla. Crim. App. 1976), rev'd, 433 U. S. 682 (1977).  In Harris, however, we held that "[w]hen, as here, conviction of a greater crime, murder, cannot be had without conviction of the lesser crime, robbery with firearms, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for the lesser crime after conviction of the greater one." We justified that conclusion in the circumstances of the case by quoting <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> `s explanation of the Blockburger test's insufficiency for determining when a successive prosecution was barred.  "`[A] person [who] has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it .  .  .  cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents without being twice put in jeopardy for the same offence.' In re Nielsen, *756 [131 U. S.,] at 188." 433 U. S., at 682-683 (citations and footnote omitted).  [7] Just as in <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> , the analysis in Harris turned on considering the prior conviction in terms of the conduct actually charged.  While that process might be viewed as a misapplication of a Blockburger lesser included offense analysis, the crucial point is that the Blockburger elements test would have produced a different result.  The case thus follows the holding in <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> and conforms to the statement already quoted from Brown , that the Blockburger test is not the exclusive standard for determining whether the rule against successive prosecutions applies in a given case. Subsequently, in Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410 (1980), the Court again indicated that a valid claim of double jeopardy would not necessarily be defeated by the fact that the two offenses are not the "same" under the Blockburger test.  In that case, we were confronted with a prosecution for failure to reduce speed and a subsequent prosecution for involuntary manslaughter.  The opinion of the Illinois Supreme Court below had not made it clear whether the elements of failure to slow were always necessarily included within the elements of involuntary manslaughter by automobile, and we remanded for clarification of this point, among other things.  We held that "[i]f, as a matter of Illinois law, a careless failure to slow is always a necessary element of manslaughter by automobile, then the two offenses are the `same' under Blockburger and Vitale's trial on the latter charge would constitute double jeopardy .  .  .  ."
**Combined Opinion**
 .  In that case, because Vitale has already been convicted for conduct that is a necessary element of the more serious crime for which he has been charged, his claim of double jeopardy would be substantial under Brown and our later decision in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977)." Id., at 420.  Over a decade ago, then, we clearly understood Harris to stand for the proposition that when one has already been tried for a crime comprising certain conduct, a subsequent prosecution seeking to prove the same conduct is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  [8] This is in no way inconsistent with Vitale `s description of Harris as "treat[ing] a killing in the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense, and the robbery as a species of lesser-included offense." 447 U. S., at 420 .  The very act of "treating" it that way was a departure from straight Blockburger analysis; it was the same departure taken by the <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> Court. Vitale read Harris (which itself quoted <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> ) to hold that even if the Blockburger test were satisfied, a second prosecution would not be permitted for conduct comprising the criminal act charged in the first.  <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> and Harris used the word "incident," while Vitale used the word "conduct," but no matter which word is used to describe the unlawful activity for which one cannot again be forced to stand trial, the import of this successive-prosecution strand of our double jeopardy jurisprudence is clear.  Even if this had not been clear since the time of In re Nielsen, any debate should have been settled by our decision three Terms ago in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), *758 that "the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted." Id., at 510 (footnote omitted).  Grady did nothing more than apply a version of the <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> rule.  As against this sequence of consistent reasoning from <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> to Grady , the Court's citation to two cases, Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S. 338, 343 (1911), and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), cannot validate its insistence that, prior to Grady , our exclusive standard for barring successive prosecutions under the Double Jeopardy Clause was the Blockburger test.  See ante, at 707-708.  Burton came before the Court on a demurrer.  The Court there was not presented with the factual basis for the charges, and simply held that two offenses, accepting a bribe from a company and accepting the same bribe from an officer of that company, were "not identical, in law." 202 U. S., at 381 ; see also id., at 379 ("[T]he question presented is whether, upon the face of the record, as matter of law simply, the offense charged in the third and seventh counts of the present indictment is the same as that charged in the third count of the former indictment") (emphasis in original); Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 198, n. 2 (1959) (opinion of Brennan, J.).  Rather than proving that the Blockburger same-elements test was always the Court's exclusive guide to evaluation of successive prosecutions prior to Grady, Burton stands only for the proposition that a claim of double jeopardy resting exclusively on pleadings cannot be adjudicated on any basis except the elements pleaded.  Gavieres is in fact the only case that may even be read to suggest that the Court ever treated a Blockburger analysis as the exclusive successive prosecution test under the Double Jeopardy Clause, and its precedential force is weak.  Gavieres was an interpretation not of the Constitution, but *759 of an Act of Congress applicable to the Philippines, providing that "no person for the same offense shall be twice put in jeopardy of punishment."
**Combined Opinion**
 Nor do Burton and Gavieres have the strength to justify the Court's reading of Harris solely for the narrow proposition that, in a case where a statute refers to other offenses, the elements of those offenses are incorporated by reference in the statute.  [9] While reading the case this way might suffice for purposes of avoiding multiple punishment, this reading would work an unprecedented truncation of the protection afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause against successive prosecutions, by transferring the government's leeway in determining how many offenses to create to the assessment of how many times a person may be prosecuted for the same conduct.  The Double Jeopardy Clause then would provide no more protection against successive prosecutions than it provides against multiple punishments, and instead of expressing some principle underlying the protection against double jeopardy, Harris would be an anomaly, an "exceptio[n]" to Blockburger without principled justification.  Grady, 495 U. S., at 528 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  By relying on that anomaly and by defining its offenses with care, the government could not merely add punishment to *761 punishment (within Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment limits), but could bring a person to trial again and again for that same conduct, violating the principle of finality, subjecting him repeatedly to all the burdens of trial, rehearsing its prosecution, and increasing the risk of erroneous conviction, all in contravention of the principles behind the protection from successive prosecutions included in the Fifth Amendment.  The protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause against successive prosecutions is not so fragile that it can be avoided by finely drafted statutes and carefully planned prosecutions.  VII I would not invite any such consequences and would here apply our successive prosecution decisions (from <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> to Grady ) to conclude that the prosecutions below were barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Dixon was prosecuted for violating a court order to "[r]efrain from committing any criminal offense." App. 8.  The contempt prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had possessed cocaine with intent to distribute it.  His prosecution, therefore, for possession with intent to distribute cocaine based on the same incident is barred.  It is of course true that the elements of the two offenses can be treated as different.  In the contempt conviction, the Government had to prove knowledge of the court order as well as Dixon's commission of some criminal offense.
**Combined Opinion**
 App. 43-44.  The Court concludes that the later prosecutions are not barred, because in its view the offenses charged in the indictment each contained an element not contained in the contempt charge (with respect to the threats, that they be threats to kidnap, to inflict bodily injury, or to damage property; with respect to the assault, that it be undertaken with an intent to kill); and *763 because the contempt charge contained an element not specified by the criminal code sections that formed the basis for the indictment (violation of the CPO).  See ante, at 700-703.  [11] In each instance, however, the second prosecution is barred under Nielsen, Harris as we construed it in Vitale , and Grady .  The conduct at issue constituted the conduct in the contempts first charged as well as in the crimes subsequently prosecuted, and the Government's prosecution of Foster twice for the conduct common to both would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  VIII Grady simply applied a rule with roots in our cases going back well over 100 years.  <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> held that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars successive prosecutions for more than one statutory offense where the charges comprise the same act, and Harris, as understood in Vitale , is properly read as standing for the same rule.  Overruling Grady alone cannot remove this principle from our constitutional jurisprudence.  Only by uprooting the entire sequence of cases, Grady, Vitale, Harris, and <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> , could this constitutional principle be undone.  Because I would not do that, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I concur in the judgment of the Court in Dixon and with respect to Count I in Foster, but respectfully dissent from the disposition of the case with respect to Counts IIV in Foster.  NOTES [*] Clifton S. Elgarten, Susan M. Hoffman, Susan Deller Ross, Naomi Cahn, Laura Foggan, and Catherine F. Klein filed a brief for Ayuda et al. as amici curiae urging reversal.

**Combined Opinion**
 Of course, these differences are pure facts, apparent on the face of the CPO and the indictment.  They do not alter the question presented, which assumes only that the prosecuted conduct was the same, see supra, at 694, not that the terms of the CPO and the statute were.  Further, although the Government did not argue that the different counts in Foster should come out differently, it did argue (as we do) that they all should be evaluated under Blockburger and not Grady , see, e. g., Brief for United States 14-15, 42; and we are not aware of any principle that prevents us from accepting a litigant's legal theory unless we agree with the litigant on all the applications of the theory.  The standard to be applied in determining the double jeopardy effect of criminal charges based on the same conduct ( Blockburger vs. Grady ) assuredly is included within the question presented.  That makes Justice White's citation of cases declining to consider legal issues not raised below wholly beside the point.  Nor can we see any abuse of what Justice White himself regards as a prudential limitation, when the evident factual difference between the charges and the CPO order is central to proper constitutional analysis.  [11]  Justice Souter has apparently been led astray by his misinterpretation of the word "incidents" in the following passage of <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> : "[W]here, as in this case, a person has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it, he cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents without being twice put in jeopardy for the same offence." <citedDecision>131 U. S., at 188</citedDecision> .  He apparently takes "incident" to mean "event" or "conduct." See post, at 752, and n. 5, 757-758.  What it obviously means, however, is "element." See Black's Law Dictionary 762 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "incidents of ownership"); J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 783-784 (1883) (defining "incident" and giving examples of "incident to a reversion," and "incidents" to a contract).  That is perfectly clear from the very next sentence of <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> (which Justice Souter does not quote): "It may be contended that adultery is not an incident of unlawful cohabitation .  .  .  . "131 U. S.,at 189.  [12]  There is, for example, no other way to read the following passage in Illinois v. Vitale , quoted by Justice Souter, post, at 757: "[In Harris ] we treated a killing in the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense, and the robbery as a species of lesser-included offense." 447 U. S. 410, 420 (1980).
**Combined Opinion**
 For the same reason that the court concluded that the word "assault" referred to the District's criminal provisions, it decided that the CPO's reference to "threats" was to "legal" threats i.  e., threats as defined by the law. Moreover, I note that the Government's presentation of this case coincides with this view.  See Brief for United States 26 (describing the order not to "assault or in any manner threaten" as "direct[ing] Foster .  .  .  to refrain from engaging in criminal conduct").  In any event, even assuming that the prohibition in the court order referred to threats other than those already outlawed, that should not change the outcome of this case. The offense prohibited in the CPOto threaten "in any manner"at the very least is "an incident and part of," In re Nielsen, <citedDecision>131 U. S. 176, 187</citedDecision> (1889),the offense of criminal threat defined in § 22-2307.  Therefore, for reasons explained below, prosecution for one should preclude subsequent prosecution for the other.  [9]  Therefore, I obviously disagree with The Chief Justice's Blockburger analysis which would require overruling not only Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), but, as Justice Scalia explains, Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), as well.  See ante, at 698.  At the very least, where conviction of the crime of contempt cannot be had without conviction of a statutory crime forbidden by court order, the Double Jeopardy Clause bars prosecution for the latter after acquittal or conviction of the former.  [10]  Similar results follow, of course, from The Chief Justice's interpretation of the Clause.  [1]  Justice Scalia's dismissal of this concern is difficult to follow.

 [4]  Our cases have long made clear that the order in which one is prosecuted for two crimes alleged to be the same matters not in demonstrating a violation of double jeopardy.  See Brown v. Ohio, 432 U. S. 161, 168 (1977) ("[T]he sequence is immaterial").  [5]  The irrelevance of additional elements can be seen in the fact that, as every Member of the Court agrees, the Double Jeopardy Clause does provide protection not merely against prosecution a second time for literally the same offense, but also against prosecution for greater offenses in which the first crime was lesser included, offenses that by definition require proof of one or more additional elements.  [6]  Citing dictionary definitions, the majority claims that "incident," as used in this passage, "obviously" means "element." Ante, at 705, n. 10.  This explanation does not make sense, for a defendant is not "tried for" an "element"; a defendant may be "tried for" a crime, such as adultery, that contains certain elements, or may be "tried for" certain acts.  The immediate context of this passage from <citedDecision>Nielsen</citedDecision> indicates that these latter definitions of "incident" are intended.  See, e. g., 131 U. S., at 188 ("`tried for the same act' ").  The point is nailed down by the Court's discussion of intercourse as an "incident" of cohabitation, id., at 189, after having indicated that intercourse need not be pleaded or proven under a cohabitation indictment, id., at 187; if "incident" did mean "element," pleading and proof of intercourse would, of course, have been required.  "Incident" here clearly means "act." [7]  Our cases, of course, hold that the same protection inheres after an acquittal.  See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969).  [8]  In Brown we recognized that "[a]n exception may exist where the State is unable to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset because the additional facts necessary to sustain that charge have not occurred or have not been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence."
