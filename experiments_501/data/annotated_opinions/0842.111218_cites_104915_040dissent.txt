**Dissenting Opinion**
 Thus the Kiefer-Stewart Court considered and rejected exactly the same argument embraced by today’s majority.  “The fact that there is common ownership or control of the contracting corporations does not liberate them from the impact of the antitrust laws.  E. g., Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, [340 U. S.,] at 215.  Nor do we find any support in reason or authority for the proposition that agreements between legally separate persons and companies to suppress competition among themselves and others can be justified by labeling the project a ‘joint venture.’ Perhaps every agreement and combination to restrain trade could be so labeled.” 341 U. S., at 598.  “There remains for consideration only the Court of Appeals’ alternative holding that the Sherman Act claim should be dismissed because respondents were all part of a single business entity and were therefore entitled to cooperate without creating an illegal conspiracy.  But since respondents Midas and International availed themselves of the privilege of doing business through separate corporations, the fact of common ownership could not save them from any of the obligations that the law imposes on separate entities.  See Timken Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 593, 598</citedDecision> (1951); United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218, 227 (1947).” 392 U. S., at 141-142 .  Also pertinent is United, States v. Citizens & Southern National Bank, 422 U. S. 86 (1975), in which the Court wrote: “The central message of the Sherman Act is that a business entity must find new customers and higher profits through internal expansion — that is, by competing successfully rather than by arranging treaties with its competitors.  This Court has held that even commonly owned firms must compete against each other, if they hold themselves out as distinct entities.  ‘The corporate interrelationships of the conspirators .  .  .  are not determinative of the applicability of the Sherman Act.’ United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218, 227 .  See also Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211, 215 ; Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 593, 598</citedDecision> ; Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U. S. 134, 141-142 .” Id., at 116-117.  See, e. g., William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v.
