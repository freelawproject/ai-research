 The program in Illinois is administered by the Department of Public Aid.  Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 23, §§3-1 to 3-12 (1973).  The former program was funded in part by the State and in part by the Federal Government.  42 U. S. C. §§ 303 , 304, 306, 1201-1204, 1206, 1351-1355, 1381-1385.  The Eleventh Amendment provides: “The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” As the Court, speaking through MR. Justice Brennan, said in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 , 186: “Although the Eleventh Amendment is not in terms applicable here, since petitioners are citizens of Alabama, this Court has recognized that an unconsenting State is immune from federal-court suits brought by its own citizens as well as by citizens of another State.  Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 ; Duhne v. New Jersey, 251 U. S. 311 ; Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 ; *680 Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U. S. 516, 524 .  See also Monaco v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 313</citedDecision> .” The Social Security Act states what a "state plan” must provide.  At the time this suit was brought, 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (a) provided: “A State plan for aid to the aged, blind, or disabled, or for aid to the aged, blind, or disabled and medical assistance for the aged, must .... “(5) provide (A) such methods of administration ... as are found by the Secretary to be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan .  .  .  ; “(8) provide that all individuals wishing to make application for aid or assistance under the plan shall have opportunity to do so, and that such aid or assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals; “(13) include reasonable standards, consistent with the objectives of this subchapter, for determining eligibility for and the extent of aid or assistance under the plan.” Nearly identical provisions are now found in 42 U. S. C. § 802 (a) (1970 ed., Supp. II).  The Secretary of HEW issued mandatory federal time standard regulations.  Handbook, Public Assistance Administration, pt. IV, §§2200 (b)(3), 2300 (b)(5); 45 CFR § 206.10 (a) (3).
