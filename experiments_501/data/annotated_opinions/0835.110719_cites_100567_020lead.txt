Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court. In Carroll v. United States, <citedDecision>267 U. S. 132</citedDecision> , the Court held that a warrantless search of an automobile stopped by police officers who had probable cause to believe the vehicle contained contraband was not unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  The Court in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> did not ex *800 plicitly address the scope of the search that is permissible.  In this case, we consider the extent to which police officers— who have legitimately stopped an automobile and who have probable cause to believe that contraband is concealed somewhere within it — may conduct a probing search of compartments and containers within the vehicle whose contents are not in plain view.  We hold that they may conduct a search of the vehicle that is as thorough as a magistrate could authorize in a warrant “particularly describing the place to be searched.” 1 I In the evening of November 27, 1978, an informant who had previously proved to be reliable telephoned Detective Marcum of the District of Columbia Police Department and told him that an individual known as “Bandit” was selling narcotics kept in the trunk of a car parked at 439 Ridge Street.  The informant stated that he had just observed “Bandit” complete a sale and that “Bandit” had told him that additional narcotics were in the trunk.  The informant gave Marcum a detailed description of “Bandit” and stated that the car was a “purplish maroon” Chevrolet Malibu with District of Columbia license plates.  Accompanied by Detective Cassidy and Sergeant Gonzales, Marcum immediately drove to the area and found a maroon Malibu parked in front of 439 Ridge Street.  A license check disclosed that the car was registered to Albert Ross; a computer check on Ross revealed that he fit the informant’s description and used the alias “Bandit.” In two passes through the neighborhood the officers did not observe anyone matching the informant’s description.

 No warrant was obtained.  Ross was charged with possession of heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U. S. C. § 841 (a).  Prior to trial, he moved to suppress the heroin found in the paper bag and the currency found in the leather pouch.  After an eviden-tiary hearing, the District Court denied the motion to suppress.  The heroin and currency were introduced in evidence at trial and Ross was convicted.  A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.  It held that the police had probable cause to stop and search Ross’ car and that, under <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> v. United <citedDecision>States, supra,</citedDecision> and Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 , the officers lawfully could search the automobile — including its trunk — without a warrant.  The court considered separately, however, the warrantless search of the two containers found in the trunk.  On the basis of Arkansas v. Sanders, *802 442 U. S. 753 , the court concluded that the constitutionality of a warrantless search of a container found in an automobile depends on whether the owner possesses a reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents.  Applying that test, the court held that the warrantless search of the paper bag was valid but the search of the leather pouch was not.  The court remanded for a new trial at which the items taken from the paper bag, but not those from the leather pouch, could be admitted.  2 The entire Court of Appeals then voted to rehear the case en banc.  A majority of the court rejected the panel’s conclusion that a distinction of constitutional significance existed between the two containers found in respondent’s trunk; it held that the police should not have opened either container without first obtaining a warrant.

 3 Other courts also have read the Sanders opinion in different ways.  4 Moreover, disagreement concerning the proper interpretation of Sanders was at least partially responsible for the fact that Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 , was decided last Term without a Court opinion.  There is, however, no dispute among judges about the importance of striving for clarification in this area of the law. For countless vehicles are stopped on highways and public *804 streets every day, and our cases demonstrate that it is not uncommon for police officers to have probable cause to believe that contraband may be found in a stopped vehicle.  In every such case a conflict is presented between the individual’s constitutionally protected interest in privacy and the public interest in effective law enforcement.  No single rule of law can resolve every conflict, but our conviction that clarification is feasible led us to grant the Government’s petition for certiorari in this case and to invite the parties to address the question whether the decision in Robbins should be reconsidered.  454 U. S. 891 .  II We begin with a review of the decision m <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> itself.  In the fall of 1921, federal prohibition agents obtained evidence that George Carroll and John Kiro were “bootleggers” who frequently traveled between Grand Rapids and Detroit in an Oldsmobile Roadster.  5 On December 15, 1921, the agents unexpectedly encountered Carroll and Kiro driving west on that route in that car. The officers gave pursuit, stopped the roadster on the highway, and directed Carroll and Kiro to get out of the car. No contraband was visible in the front seat of the Oldsmobile and the rear portion of the roadster was closed.  One of the agents raised the rumble seat but found no liquor.  He raised the seat cushion and again found nothing.  The officer then struck at the “lazyback” of the seat and noticed that it was “harder than upholstery ordinarily is in those backs.” *805 <citedDecision>267 U. S., at 174</citedDecision> .  He tore open the seat cushion and discovered 68 bottles of gin and whiskey concealed inside.  No warrant had been obtained for the search.  Carroll and Kiro were convicted of transporting intoxicating liquor in violation of the National Prohibition Act.  On review of those convictions, this Court ruled that the war-rantless search of the roadster was reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  In an extensive opinion written by Chief Justice Taft, the Court held: “On reason and authority the true rule is that if the search and seizure without a warrant are made upon probable cause, that is, upon a belief, reasonably arising out of circumstances known to the seizing officer, that an automobile or other vehicle contains that which by law is subject to seizure and destruction, the search and seizure are valid.  The Fourth Amendment is to be construed in the light of what was deemed an unreasonable search and seizure when it was adopted, and in a manner which will conserve public interests as well as the interests and rights of individual citizens.” <citedDecision>Id., at 149</citedDecision> .  The Court explained at length the basis for this rule.  The Court noted that historically warrantless searches of vessels, wagons, and carriages — as opposed to fixed premises such as a home or other building — had been considered reasonable by Congress.  After reviewing legislation enacted by Congress between 1789 and 1799, 6 the Court stated: “Thus contemporaneously with the adoption of the Fourth Amendment we find in the first Congress, and in the following Second and Fourth Congresses, a difference made as to the necessity for a search warrant be *806 tween goods subject to forfeiture, when concealed in a dwelling house or similar place, and like goods in course of transportation and concealed in a movable vessel where they readily could be put out of reach of a search warrant.” <citedDecision>Id., at 151</citedDecision> .  The Court reviewed additional legislation passed by Congress 7 and again noted that “the guaranty of freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures by the Fourth Amendment has been construed, practically since the beginning of the Government, as recognizing a necessary difference between a search of a store, dwelling house or other structure in respect of which a proper official warrant readily may be obtained, and a search of a ship, motor boat, wagon or automobile, for contraband goods, where it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.” <citedDecision>Id., at 153</citedDecision> .  Thus, since its earliest days Congress had recognized the impracticability of securing a warrant in cases involving the transportation of contraband goods.  8 It is this impracticability, viewed in historical perspective, that provided the basis for the <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> decision.  Given the nature of an automobile in transit, the Court recognized that an immediate intrusion is necessary if police officers are to secure the illicit *807 substance.  In this class of cases, the Court held that a war-rantless search of an automobile is not unreasonable.  9 In defining the nature of this “exception” to the general rule that “[i]n cases where the securing of a warrant is reasonably practicable, it must be used,” <citedDecision>id., at 156</citedDecision> , the Court in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> emphasized the importance of the requirement that *808 officers have probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains contraband.  “Having thus established that contraband goods concealed and illegally transported in an automobile or other vehicle may be searched for without a warrant, we come now to consider under what circumstances such search may be made.  It would be intolerable and unreasonable if a prohibition agent were authorized to stop every automobile on the chance of finding liquor and thus subject all persons lawfully using the highways to the inconvenience and indignity of such a search.  Travellers may be so stopped in crossing an international boundary because of national self protection reasonably requiring one entering the country to identify himself as entitled to come in, and his belongings as effects which may be lawfully brought in. But those lawfully within the country, entitled to use the public highways, have a right to free passage without interruption or search unless there is known to a competent official authorized to search, probable cause for believing that their vehicles are carrying contraband or illegal merchandise.” <citedDecision>Id., at 158-154</citedDecision> .  Moreover, the probable-cause determination must be based on objective facts that could justify the issuance of a warrant by a magistrate and not merely on the subjective good faith of the police officers.  “ ‘[A]s we have seen, good faith is not enough to constitute probable cause.  That faith must be grounded on facts within knowledge of the [officer], which in the judgment of the court would make his faith reasonable.’ ” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 161-162 (quoting Director General of Railroads v. Kastenbaum, 263 U. S. 25, 28 ).  10 *809 In short, the exception to the warrant requirement established in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> — the scope of which we consider in this case — applies only to searches of vehicles that are supported by probable cause.  11 In this class of cases, a search is not unreasonable if based on facts that would justify the issuance of a warrant, even though a warrant has not actually been obtained.  12 Ill The rationale justifying a warrantless search of an automobile that is believed to be transporting contraband arguably applies with equal force to any movable container that is believed to be carrying an illicit substance.  That argument, *810 however, was squarely rejected in United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 .  Chadwick involved the warrantless search of a 200-pound footlocker secured with two padlocks.  Federal railroad officials in San Diego became suspicious when they noticed that a brown footlocker loaded onto a train bound for Boston was unusually heavy and leaking talcum powder, a substance often used to mask the odor of marihuana.  Narcotics agents met the train in Boston and a trained police dog signaled the presence of a controlled substance inside the footlocker.  The agents did not seize the footlocker, however, at this time; they waited until respondent Chadwick arrived and the footlocker was placed in the trunk of Chadwick’s automobile.  Before the engine was started, the officers arrested Chadwick and his two companions.  The agents then removed the footlocker to a secured place, opened it without a warrant, and discovered a large quantity of marihuana.  In a subsequent criminal proceeding, Chadwick claimed that the warrantless search of the footlocker violated the Fourth Amendment.  In the District Court, the Government argued that as soon as the footlocker was placed in the automobile a warrantless search was permissible under <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> .  The District Court rejected that argument, 13 and the Government did not pursue it on appeal.  14 Rather, the Government contended in this Court that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment applied only to searches of homes and *811 other “core” areas of privacy.  The Court unanimously rejected that contention.  15 Writing for the Court, The Chief Justice stated: “[I]f there is little evidence that the Framers intended the Warrant Clause to operate outside the home, there is no evidence at all that they intended to exclude from protection of the Clause all searches occurring outside the home.  The absence of a contemporary outcry against warrantless searches in public places was because, aside from searches incident to arrest, such warrantless searches were not a large issue in colonial America.  Thus, silence in the historical record tells us little about the Framers’ attitude toward application of the Warrant Clause to the search of respondents’ footlocker.

 Sanders arrived on schedule and retrieved a green suitcase from the airline baggage service.  Sanders gave the suitcase to a waiting companion, who placed it in the trunk of a taxi.  Sanders and his companion drove off in the cab; police officers followed and stopped the taxi several blocks from the airport.  The officers opened the trunk, seized the suitcase, and searched it on the scene without a warrant.  As predicted, the suitcase contained marihuana.  The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that the warrantless search of the suitcase was impermissible under the Fourth Amendment, and this Court affirmed.  As in Chadwick , the mere fact that the suitcase had been placed in the trunk of the vehicle did not render the automobile exception of <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> applicable; the police had probable cause to seize the suitcase before it was placed in the trunk of the cab and did not *813 have probable cause to search the taxi itself.  17 Since the suitcase had been placed in the trunk, no danger existed that its contents could have been secreted elsewhere in the vehicle.  18 As The Chief Justice noted in his opinion concurring in the judgment: “Because the police officers had probable cause to believe that respondent’s green suitcase contained marihuana before it was placed in the trunk of the taxicab, their duty to obtain a search warrant before opening it is clear under United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977).  .  .  .  “.

 This analysis is entirely consistent with the holdings in Chadwick and Sanders , neither of which is an ‘automobile case,’ because the police there had probable cause to search the double-locked footlocker and the suitcase respectively before either came near an automobile.” Ibid. The parties in Robbins had not pressed that argument, how *817 ever, and Justice Powell concluded that institutional constraints made it inappropriate to reexamine basic doctrine without full adversary presentation.  He concurred in the judgment, since it was supported — although not compelled— by the Court’s opinion in Sanders , and stated that a future case might present a better opportunity for thorough consideration of the basic principles in this troubled area.  That case has arrived.  Unlike Chadwick and Sanders , in this case police officers had probable cause to search respondent’s entire vehicle.  22 Unlike Robbins, in this case the parties have squarely addressed the question whether, in the course of a legitimate warrantless search of an automobile, police are entitled to open containers found within the vehicle.  We now address that question.  Its answer is determined by the scope of the search that is authorized by the exception to the warrant requirement set forth in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> .  IV In <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> itself, the whiskey that the prohibition agents seized was not in plain view.  It was discovered only after an officer opened the rumble seat and tore open the upholstery of the lazyback.  The Court did not find the scope of the search unreasonable.  Having stopped Carroll and Kiro on a public road and subjected them to the indignity of a ve- *818 hide search — which the Court found to be a reasonable intrusion on their privacy because it was based on probable cause that their vehicle was transporting contraband — prohibition agents were entitled to tear open a portion of the roadster itself.  The scope of the search was no greater than a magistrate could have authorized by issuing a warrant based on the probable cause that justified the search.  Since such a warrant could have authorized the agents to open the rear portion of the roadster and to rip the upholstery in their search for concealed whiskey, the search was constitutionally permissible.  In Chambers v. Maroney the police found weapons and stolen property “concealed in a compartment under the dashboard.” 399 U. S., at 44 .  No suggestion was made that the scope of the search was impermissible.  It would be illogical to assume that the outcome of Chambers — or the outcome of <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> itself — would have been different if the police had found the secreted contraband enclosed within a secondary container and had opened that container without a warrant.  If it was reasonable for prohibition agents to rip open the upholstery in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> , it certainly would have been reasonable for them to look into a burlap sack stashed inside; if it was reasonable to open the concealed compartment in Chambers , it would have been equally reasonable to open a paper bag crumpled within it.  A contrary rule could produce absurd results inconsistent with the decision in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> itself.  In its application of <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> , this Court in fact has sustained warrantless searches of containers found during a lawful search of an automobile.  In Husty v. United States, 282 U. S. 694 , the Court upheld a warrantless seizure of whiskey found during a search of an automobile, some of which was discovered in “whiskey bags” that could have contained other goods.  23 In Scher v. United States, 305 U. S. 251 , federal of- *819 fleers seized and searched packages of unstamped liquor found in the trunk of an automobile searched without a warrant.  As described by a police officer who participated in the search: “I turned the handle and opened the trunk and found the trunk completely filled with packages wrapped in brown paper, and tied with twine; I think somewhere around thirty packages, each one containing six bottles.” 24 In these cases it was not contended that police officers needed a warrant to open the whiskey bags or to unwrap the brown paper packages.  These decisions nevertheless “have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench.” Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (Marshall, C. J.).  The fact that no such argument was even made illuminates the profession’s understanding of the scope of the search permitted under <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> .  Indeed, prior to the decisions in Chadwick and Sanders , courts routinely had held that containers and packages found during a legitimate warrantless search of an automobile also could be searched without a warrant.  25 *820 As we have stated, the decision in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> was based on the Court’s appraisal of practical considerations viewed in the perspective of history.  It is therefore significant that the practical consequences of the <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> decision would be largely nullified if the permissible scope of a warrantless search of an automobile did not include containers and packages found inside the vehicle.  Contraband goods rarely are strewn across the trunk or floor of a car; since by their very nature such goods must be withheld from public view, they rarely can be placed in an automobile unless they are enclosed within some form of container.  26 The Court in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> held that “contraband goods concealed and illegally transported in an automobile or other vehicle may be searched for without a warrant.” <citedDecision>267 U. S., at 153</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  As we noted in Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98, 104 , the decision in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> “merely relaxed the requirements for a warrant on grounds of practicability.” It neither broadened nor limited the scope of a lawful search based on probable cause.  A lawful search of fixed premises generally extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found and is not limited by the possibility that separate acts of en *821 try or opening may be required to complete the search.  27 Thus, a warrant that authorizes an officer to search a home for illegal weapons also provides authority to open closets, chests, drawers, and containers in which the weapon might be found. A warrant to open a footlocker to search for marihuana would also authorize the opening of packages found inside.  A warrant to search a vehicle would support a search of every part of the vehicle that might contain the object of the search.  When a legitimate search is under way, and when its purpose and its limits have been precisely defined, nice distinctions between closets, drawers, and containers, in the case of a home, or between glove compartments, upholstered seats, trunks, and wrapped packages, in the case of a vehicle, must give way to the interest in the prompt and efficient completion of the task at hand. 28 *822 This rule applies equally to all containers, as indeed we believe it must.  One point on which the Court was in virtually unanimous agreement in Robbins was that a constitutional distinction between “worthy” and “unworthy” containers would be improper.  29 Even though such a distinction perhaps could evolve in a series of cases in which paper bags, locked trunks, lunch buckets, and orange crates were placed on one side of the line or the other, 30 the central purpose of the Fourth Amendment forecloses such a distinction.

 The luggage carried by a traveler entering the country may be searched at random by a customs officer; the luggage may be searched no matter how great the traveler’s desire to conceal the contents may be.  A container carried at the time of arrest often may be searched without a warrant and even without any specific suspicion concerning its contents.  A container that may conceal the object of a search authorized by a warrant may be opened immediately; the individual’s interest in privacy must give way to the magistrate’s official determination of probable cause.  In the same manner, an individual’s expectation of privacy in a vehicle and its contents may not survive if probable cause is given to believe that the vehicle is transporting contraband.  Certainly the privacy interests in a car’s trunk or glove compartment may be no less than those in a movable container.  An individual undoubtedly has a significant interest that the upholstery of his automobile will not be ripped or a hidden compartment within it opened.  These interests must yield to the authority of a search, however, which — in light of <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> — does not itself require the prior approval of a magistrate.  The scope of a warrantless search based on probable cause is no narrower — and no broader — than the scope of a search authorized by a warrant supported by probable cause.  Only the prior approval of the magistrate is waived; the search otherwise is as the magistrate could authorize.  32 *824 The scope of a warrantless search of an automobile thus is not defined by the nature of the container in which the contraband is secreted.  Rather, it is defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found. Just as probable cause to believe that a stolen lawnmower may be found in a garage will not support a warrant to search an upstairs bedroom, probable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not justify a warrantless search of a suitcase.  Probable cause to believe that a container placed in the trunk of a taxi contains contraband or evidence does not justify a search of the entire cab.  V Our decision today is inconsistent with the disposition in Robbins v. California and with the portion of the opinion in Arkansas v. Sanders on which the plurality in Robbins relied.  Nevertheless, the doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude this action.  Although we have rejected some of the reasoning in Sanders , we adhere to our holding in that case; although we reject the precise holding in Robbins, there was no Court opinion supporting a single rationale for its judgment, and the reasoning we adopt today was not presented by the parties in that case. Moreover, it is clear that no legitimate reliance interest can be frustrated by our decision today.  33 Of greatest importance, we are convinced that the rule we apply in this case is faithful to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that the Court has followed with substantial consistency throughout our history.  We reaffirm the basic rule of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence stated by Justice Stewart for a unanimous Court in Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 , 390: *825 “The Fourth Amendment proscribes all unreasonable searches and seizures, and it is a cardinal principle that ‘searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment — subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.’ Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 357 (footnotes omitted).” The exception recognized in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> is unquestionably one that is “specifically established and well delineated.” We hold that the scope of the warrantless search authorized by that exception is no broader and no narrower than a magistrate could legitimately authorize by warrant.  If probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.  The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.  The court rejected the Government’s argument that the warrantless search of the leather pouch was justified as incident to respondent’s arrest.

 Cf. State v. Bible, 389 So. 2d 42 (La. 1980), vacated and remanded, 453 U. S. 918 ; State v. Hernandez, 408 So. 2d 911 (La. 1981); see also 210 U. S. App. D. C., at 363, 655 F. 2d, at 1180 (Robb, J., dissenting).  On September 29, 1921, Carroll and Kiro met the agents in Grand Rapids and agreed to sell them three cases of whiskey.  The sale was not consummated, however, possibly because Carroll learned the agents’ true identity.  In October, the agents discovered Carroll and Kiro driving the Oldsmobile Roadster on the road to Detroit, which was known as an active center for the introduction of illegal liquor into this country.  The agents followed the roadster as far as East Lansing, but there abandoned the chase. The legislation authorized customs officials to search any ship or vessel without a warrant if they had probable cause to believe that it concealed goods subject to duty.  The same legislation required a warrant for searches of dwelling places.  <citedDecision>267 U. S., at 150-151</citedDecision> .  In particular, the Court noted an 1815 statute that permitted customs officers not only to board and search vessels without a warrant “but also to stop, search and examine any vehicle, beast or person on which or whom they should suspect there was merchandise which was subject to duty or had been introduced into the United States in any manner contrary to law.” <citedDecision>Id., at 151</citedDecision> .  In light of this established history, individuals always had been on notice that movable vessels may be stopped and searched on facts giving rise to probable cause that the vehicle contains contraband, without the protection afforded by a magistrate’s prior evaluation of those facts.  Subsequent cases make clear that the decision in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> was not based on the fact that the only course available to the police was an immediate search.  As Justice Harlan later recognized, although a failure to seize a moving automobile believed to contain contraband might deprive officers of the illicit goods, once a vehicle itself has been stopped the exigency does not necessarily justify a warrantless search.  Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42, 62-64 (opinion of Harlan, J.).  The Court in Chambers , however — with only Justice Harlan dissenting — refused to adopt a rule that would permit a warrantless seizure but prohibit a warrantless search.  The Court held that if police officers have probable cause to justify a war-rantless seizure of an automobile on a public roadway, they may conduct an immediate search of the contents of that vehicle.  “For constitutional purposes, we see no difference between on the one hand seizing and holding a car before presenting the probable cause issue to a magistrate and on the other hand carrying out an immediate search without a warrant.  Given probable cause to search, either course is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.” Id., at 52 .

 These decisions are based on the practicalities of the situations presented and a realistic appraisal of the relatively minor protection that a contrary rule would provide for privacy interests.  Given the scope of the initial intrusion caused by a seizure of an automobile — which often could leave the occupants stranded on the highway — the Court rejected an inflexible rule that would force police officers in every case either to post guard at the vehicle while a warrant is obtained or to tow the vehicle itself to the station.  Similarly, if an immediate search on the scene could be conducted, but not one at the station if the vehicle is impounded, police often simply would search the vehicle on the street — at no advantage to the occupants, yet possibly at certain cost to the police.  The rules as applied in particular cases may appear unsatisfactory.  They reflect, however, a reasoned application of the more general rule that if an individual gives the police probable cause to believe a vehicle is transporting contraband, he loses the right to proceed on his way without official interference.  After reviewing the relevant authorities at some length, the Court concluded that the probable-cause requirement was satisfied in the case before it.  The Court held that “the facts and circumstances within [the officers’] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief *809 that intoxicating liquor was being transported in the automobile which they stopped and searched.” <citedDecision>267 U. S., at 162</citedDecision> .  Cf. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176-177 ; Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98, 102 .  See Husty v. United States, 282 U. S. 694 ; Scher v. United States, 305 U. S. 251 ; Brinegar v. United States, supra; Henry v. United States, supra; Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U. S. 216 ; Chambers v. Maroney, supra; Texas v. White, supra; Colorado v. Bannister, 449 U. S. 1 .  Warrantless searches of automobiles have been upheld in a variety of factual contexts quite different from that presented in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> .  Cf. Cooper v. California, 386 U. S. 58 ; Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U. S. 433 ; South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364 .  Many of these searches do not require a showing of probable cause that the vehicle contains contraband.  We are not called upon to — and do not — consider in this case the scope of the war-rantless search that is permitted in those cases. As the Court in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> concluded: “We here find the line of distinction between legal and illegal seizures of liquor in transport in vehicles.  It is certainly a reasonable distinction.  It gives the owner of an automobile or other vehicle seized under Section 26, in absence of probable cause, a right to have restored to him the automobile, it protects him under the Weeks [Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 ] and Amos [Amos v. United States, 255 U. S. 313 ] cases from use of the liquor as evidence against him, and it subjects the officer making the seizures to damages.  On the other hand, in a case showing probable cause, the Government and its officials are given the opportunity which they should have, to make the investigation necessary to trace reasonably suspected contraband goods and to seize them.” <citedDecision>267 U. S., at 156</citedDecision> .  The District Court noted: “In this case, there was no nexus between the search and the automobile, merely a coincidence.  The challenged search in this case was one of a footlocker, not an automobile.  The search took place not in an automobile, but in [the federal building].  The only connection that the automobile had to this search was that, prior to its seizure, the footlocker was placed on the floor of an automobile’s open trunk.” United States v. Chadwick, 393 F. Supp. 763, 772 (Mass. 1975).  This Court specifically noted: “The Government does not contend that the footlocker’s brief contact with Chadwick’s car makes this an automobile search, but it is argued that the rationale of our automobile search cases *811 demonstrates the reasonableness of permitting warrantless searches of luggage; the Government views such luggage as analagous to motor vehicles for Fourth Amendment purposes.” 433 U. S., at 11-12 .  See id., at 17 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  The Court concluded that there is a significant difference between the seizure of a sealed package and a subsequent search of its contents; the search of the container in that case was “a far greater intrusion into Fourth Amendment values than the impoundment of the footlocker.” Id., at 14, n. 8 .  A temporary seizure of a package or piece of luggage often may be accomplished without as significant an intrusion upon the individual — and without as great a burden on the police — as in the case of the seizure of an automobile.  See n. 9, supra. The Arkansas Supreme Court carefully reviewed the facts of the case and concluded: “The information supplied to the police by the confidential informant is adequate to support the State’s claim that the police had probable cause to believe that appellant’s green suitcase contained a controlled substance when the police confiscated the suitcase and opened it.” Sanders v. State, 262 Ark. 595, 599 , 559 S. W. 2d 704, 706 (1977).  The court also noted: “The evidence in this case supports the conclusion that the relationship between the suitcase and the taxicab is coincidental.” Id., at 600, n. 2 , 559 S. W. 2d, at 706, n. 2 .  Moreover, none of the practical difficulties associated with the detention of a vehicle on a public highway that made the immediate search in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> reasonable could justify an immediate search of the suitcase, since the officers had no interest in detaining the taxi or its driver.  The Court stated that “the extent to which the Fourth Amendment applies to containers and other parcels depends not at all upon whether they are seized from an automobile.” 442 U. S., at 764, n. 13 .  This general rule was limited only by the observation that “[n]ot all containers and packages found by police during the course of a search will deserve the full protection of the Fourth Amendment.  Thus, some containers (for example a kit of burglar tools or a gun case) by their very nature cannot support any reasonable expectation of privacy because their contents can be inferred from their outward appearance.  Similarly, in some cases the contents of a package will be open to ‘plain view,’ thereby obviating the need for a warrant.” Ibid. People v. Robbins, 103 Cal. App. 3d 34, 39 , 162 Cal. Rptr. 780, 782 (1980).  “While the plurality’s blanket warrant requirement does not even purport to protect any privacy interest, it would impose substantial new burdens on law enforcement.  Confronted with a cigar box or a Dixie cup in the course of a probable-cause search of an automobile for narcotics, the conscientious policeman would be required to take the object to a magistrate, fill out the appropriate forms, await the decision, and finally obtain the warrant.

 I knew it was whiskey, I was sure it was.” App., O. T. 1930, No. 477, p. 27.  App., O. T. 1938, No. 49, p. 33.  The brief of then Solicitor General Robert Jackson noted that the items searched “were wrapped in very heavy brown wrapping paper with at least two wrappings and with a heavy cord around them cross-wise so that they could readily be lifted.” Brief for United States, O. T. 1938, No. 49, p. 6.  See, e. g., United States v. Soriano, 497 F. 2d 147, 149-150 (CA5 1974) (en banc); United States v. Vento, 533 F. 2d 838, 867, n. 101 (CA3 1976); United States v. Tramunti, 513 F. 2d 1087, 1104 (CA2 1975); United States v. Issod, 508 F. 2d 990, 993 (CA7 1974); United States v. Evans, 481 F. 2d 990, 994 (CA9 1973); United States v. Bowman, 487 F. 2d 1229 (CA10 1973).  Many courts continued to apply this rule following the decision in Chadwick.  Cf. United States v. Milhollan, 599 F. 2d 518, 526-527 (CA3 1979); United States v. Gaultney, 581 F. 2d 1137, 1144-1145 (CA5 1978); United States v. Finnegan, 568 F. 2d 637, 640-641 (CA9 1977).  In ruling that police could search luggage and other containers found during a legitimate warrantless search of an automobile, courts often assumed that the “automobile exception” of <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> applied whenever a container in an automobile was believed to contain contraband.  That view, of course, has since been qualified by Chadwick and Sanders.  It is noteworthy that the early legislation on which the Court relied in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> concerned the enforcement of laws imposing duties on imported merchandise.  See nn. 6 and 7, supra. Presumably such merchandise was shipped then in containers of various kinds, just as it is today.  Since Congress had authorized warrantless searches of vessels and beasts for imported merchandise, it is inconceivable that it intended a customs officer to obtain a warrant for every package discovered during the search; certainly Congress intended customs officers to open shipping containers when necessary and not merely to examine the exterior of cartons or boxes in which smuggled goods might be concealed.  During virtually the entire history of our country — whether contraband was transported in a horse-drawn carriage, a 1921 roadster, or a modern automobile — it has been assumed that a lawful search of a vehicle would include a search of any container that might conceal the object of the search.  In describing the permissible scope of a search of a home pursuant to a warrant, Professor LaFave notes: “Places within the described premises are not excluded merely because some additional act of entry or opening may be required.  ‘In countless cases in which warrants described only the land and the buildings, a search of desks, cabinets, closets and similar items has been permitted.”’ 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 152 (1978) (quoting Massey v. Commonwealth, 305 S. W. 2d 755, 756 (Ky. 1957)).  The practical considerations that justify a warrantless search of an automobile continue to apply until the entire search of the automobile and its contents has been completed.  Arguably, the entire vehicle itself (including its upholstery) could be searched without a warrant, with all wrapped articles and containers found during that search then taken to a magistrate.  But prohibiting police from opening immediately a container in which the object of the search is most likely to be found and instead forcing them first to comb the entire vehicle would actually exacerbate the intrusion on privacy interests.  Moreover, until the container itself was opened the police could never be certain that the contraband was not secreted in a yet undiscovered portion of the vehicle; thus in every case in which a container was found, the vehicle would need to be secured while a warrant was obtained.  Such a requirement would be directly inconsistent with the rationale supporting the decisions in <citedDecision>Carroll</citedDecision> and Chambers .  Cf. nn. 19 and 22, supra. Cf. 453 U. S., at 426-427 (plurality opinion); id., at 436 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); id., at 443 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); id., at 447 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  If the distinction is based on the proposition that the Fourth Amendment protects only those containers that objectively manifest an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy, however, the propriety of a war-rantless search necessarily would turn on much more than the fabric of the container.  A paper bag stapled shut and marked “private” might be found to manifest a reasonable expectation of privacy, as could a cardboard box stacked on top of two pieces of heavy luggage.  The propriety of the war-rantless search seemingly would turn on an objective appraisal of all the surrounding circumstances.

It may be frail; its roof may shake; the wind may blow through it; the storm may enter; the rain may enter; but the King of England cannot enter — all his force dares not cross the threshold of the ruined tenement!’ ” Miller v. United States, 357 U. S. 301, 307 (quoting remarks attributed to William Pitt); cf. Payton v. New York, 445 U. S. 573, 601, n. 54 .
