**Dissenting Opinion**
For the Court insists upon assuming, contrary to the plain import of the statute, that Congress wanted petitioner’s § 2255 action to proceed “in the ordinary course of the judicial process” and to follow the “general rule” that permits an appeal from a final district court order, ibid. If this were Congress’s wish, there would have been no need for § 102 of AEDPA. The whole point of that provision is to diverge from the ordinary course of the judicial process and to keep petitioner’s case against respondent out of the Court of Appeals unless petitioner obtains a COA. “The certificate is a screening device, helping to conserve judicial (and prosecuto-rial) resources.” Young v. United States, 124 F. 3d 794, 799 *258 (CA7 1997). It is this unique screening function that distinguishes a COA from the jurisdictional issues discussed by the Court: Section 102 of AEDPA prevents petitioner’s ease from entering the Court of Appeals at all in the absence of a COA, whereas other jurisdictional determinations are made after a case is in the Court of Appeals (even if the ease is later dismissed because of jurisdictional defects), ante, at 246-249. See Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397, 403, n. 3 (1970) (a court always has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction). The Court’s only response to these arguments is that they are foreclosed by our precedent, since we decided an analogous issue in Ex parte Quirin, <targetCase>317 U. S. 1</targetCase> (1942). Ante, at 246. (The Court displays no appreciation of the delicious irony involved in its insistence upon hewing to an allegedly analogous decision while overruling the case directly in point, House.) Quirin held that a petition for habeas corpus constituted the institution of a suit, and that it was not necessary for the writ to issue for the matter to be considered a case or controversy. <targetCase>317 U. S., at 24</targetCase>. <targetCase>Quirin</targetCase> relied upon our decision in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 110-113 (1866), which reasoned that a petition for habeas corpus is a suit because the petitioner seeks “That remedy which the law affords him’” to recover his liberty. Id., at 113 (quoting Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449, 464 (1829)). Petitioner’s request for §2255 relief is analogous to a petition for habeas corpus, but his request for a COA is of a wholly different nature. That is no “remedy” for any harm, but a threshold procedural requirement that petitioner must meet in order to carry his §2255 suit to the appellate stage. That is why the Court in House, decided less than three years after <targetCase>Quirin</targetCase>, did not treat the application for a certificate as a separate case but did recognize the petition for habeas corpus as a ease even though it was decided without a hearing or a call for a return. 324 U. S., at 43. I have described above why House was entirely correct, but a few words are in order concerning the inappropriate *259 ness of overruling House, regardless of its virtue as an original matter. “[T]he "burden borne by the party advocating abandonment of an established precedent is greater where the Court is asked to overrule a point of statutory construction.” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989); see also Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The Court acknowledges this principle, but invokes cases of ours that say that stare decisis concerns are “ ‘somewhat reduced’ ” in the ease of a procedural rule. Ante, at 251. The basis for that principle, of course, is that procedural rules do not ordinarily engender detrimental reliance — and in this ease, as I shall discuss, detrimental reliance by the Congress of the United States is self-evident.
