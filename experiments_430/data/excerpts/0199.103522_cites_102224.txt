 In the fol-lpwing year this Court held that Tennessee had no power to fix prices at which gasoline might be sold in the state.  Williams v. Standard Oil Co., 278 U. S. 235 .  Save for that decision and Morehead v. Tipaldo, 298 U. S. 587 , holding unconstitutional a New York statute authorizing the fixing of women’s wages, the subsequent cases in this Court haye given increasingly wider scope to the price-fixing powers of the states and of Congress.  5 Tagg Bros. v. United States, 280 U. S. 420 , decidedv,in 1930, upheld the power of the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act to determine the just and reasonable charges of persons engaged in the business of buying and selling in interstate commerce livestock at a stockyard on a commission basis.  In 1931 a New Jersey statute limiting commissions of agents- of fire insurance companies was sustained by O’Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U. S. 251 .  A New York statute authorizing the fixing of minimum and maximum retail prices for milk was upheld in 1934.  Nebbia v. New York, <citedDecision>291 U. S. 502</citedDecision> .

 Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U. S. 381 .  And 'at this term we upheld the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.  United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 .  These cases represent more than scattered examples of constitutionally permissible price-fixing schemes.  They represent in large measure a basic departure from the philosophy and approach of the majority in the Ribnik case. The standard there Employed, following that used in Tyson & Brother v. Banton, 273 U. S. 418 , 430 et seq., was that the constitutional validity of price-fixing legislation, at least in absence of a so-called emergency, 6 was dependent on whether or not the business in question was “affected with a.public interest.” Cf. Brazee v. Michigan, 241 U. S. 340 .  It was said to be so affected if it had been “devoted to the public .use” and if “an interest in effect” had been granted “to the public in that use.” Ribnik v. McBride, supra, p. 355 .  That test, labelled by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent in the Tyson case (273 U. S. at p. 446) as “little more than a fiction,” was discarded in <citedDecision>Nebbia</citedDecision> v. New York, supra, pp. 531-539.  It was there stated that such criteria “are not susceptible of definition and form an unsatisfactory test of the constitutionality of legislation directed at business practices or prices,” and that the phrase “affected with a public interest” can mean “no more than *246 that an industry, for adequate reason, is subject to control for the public good.” Id., p. 536.  And see the dissenting opinion in Ribnik v. McBride, supra, at p. 359 .  The Bibnik case, freed from'.the test which it employed, can no longer survive.  But respondents maintain that the statute here in question is invalid for other reasons.  They insist that special circumstances must be shown to support the validity of such drastic legislation as price-fixing, that the executive, technical and professional workers which respondents serve have not been shown to be in need of special protection from exploitation, that legislative limitation of maximum fees for employment agencies is certain to react unfavorably upon those members- of the community for whom it is most difficult, to obtain jobs, that the increasing competition of public employment agencies and of charitable, labor union and employer association employment agencies have curbed excessive fees by private agencies, and that there is nothing in thisi record to overcome the presumption as to the résult of the operation of such competitive, economic forces.  And in the latter connéction respondents urge that, since no circumstances are shown which curb competition between the, private agencies and the other types of agencies, there are no conditions which the legislature might reasonably believe would redound to the public injury unless corrected by such legislation.
