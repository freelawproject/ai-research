**Dissenting Opinion**
Mb.  Chief Justice Burger, dissenting.  I am in general agreement with Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s dissent, but even at the risk of compounding the obvious confusion created by those voting to reverse the District Court, I will add a few words.  At the outset I cannot agree that appellant Whitener has standing arising from her status as a saloonkeeper to assert the constitutional rights of her customers.  In this Court “a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities.” United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 22 (1960).  There are a few, but strictly limited exceptions to that rule; despite the most creative efforts, this case fits within none of them.  *216 This is not Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U. S. 229 (1969), or Barrows v. Jackson, <citedDecision>346 U. S. 249</citedDecision> (1953), for there is here no barrier whatever to Oklahoma males 18-20 years of age asserting, in an appropriate forum, any constitutional rights they may claim to purchase 3.2% beer.  Craig’s successful litigation of this very issue was prevented only by the advent of his 21st birthday.  There is thus no danger of interminable dilution of those rights if appellant Whitener is not permitted to litigate them here.  Cf. Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 445-446 (1972).  Nor is this controlled by Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965).  It borders on the ludicrous to draw a parallel between a vendor of beer and the intimate professional physician-patient relationship which undergirded relaxation of standing rules in that case. Even in Eisenstadt , the Court carefully limited its recognition of third-party standing to cases in which the relationship between the claimant and the relevant third party “was not simply the fortuitous connection between a vendor and potential vendees, but the relationship between one who acted to protect the rights of a minority and the minority itself.” 405 U. S., at 445 .  This is plainly not the case here.
