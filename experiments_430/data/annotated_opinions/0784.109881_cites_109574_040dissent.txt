**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting.  Seventeen years ago, in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961), this Court held that the 42d Congress did not intend to subject a municipal corporation to liability as a “person” within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. § 1983 .  Since then, the Congress has remained silent, but this Court has reaffirmed that holding on at least three separate occasions.  Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976); City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507 (1973); Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973).  See also Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, <citedDecision>429 U. S. 274, 277-279</citedDecision> (1977).  Today, the Court abandons this long and consistent line of precedents, offering in justification only an elaborate canvass of the same legislative history which was before the Court in 1961.  Because I cannot agree that this Court is “free to disregard these precedents,” which have been “considered maturely and recently” by this Court, Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 186 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring), I am compelled to dissent.  I As this Court has repeatedly recognized, id., at 175 n. 12; Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 , 671 n. 14 (1974), considerations of stare decisis are at their strongest when this Court confronts its previous constructions of legislation.  In all cases, private parties shape their conduct according to this Court’s settled construction of the law, but the Congress is at *715 liberty to correct our mistakes of statutory construction, unlike our constitutional interpretations, whenever it sees fit.  The controlling principles were best stated by Mr. Justice Brandéis: “Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.  .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Ill The decision in Monroe v. Pape was the fountainhead of the torrent of civil rights litigation of the last 17 years.  Using § 1983 as a vehicle, the courts have articulated new and previously unforeseeable interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment.  At the same time, the doctrine of municipal immunity enunciated in Monroe has protected municipalities and their limited treasuries from the consequences of their officials’ failure to predict the course of this Court’s constitutional jurisprudence.  None of the Members of this Court can foresee the practical consequences of today’s removal of that protection.  Only the Congress, which has the benefit of the advice of every segment of this diverse Nation, is equipped to consider the results of such a drastic change in the law. It seems all but inevitable that it will find it necessary to do so after today’s decision.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  As we pointed out in Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, <citedDecision>429 U. S. 274, 278-279</citedDecision> (1977), the existence of a claim for relief under § 1983 is “jurisdictional” for purposes of invoking 28 U. S. C. § 1343 , even though the existence of a meritorious constitutional claim is not similarly required in order to invoke jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1331 .  See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946).  The other statutes cited by the Court, ante, at 697-699, n. 63, make no mention of § 1983, but refer generally to suits against “a local educational agency.” As noted by the Court of Appeals, 532 F. 2d 259, 264-266 , such suits may be maintained against board members in their official capacities *717 for injunctive relief under either § 1983 or Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908).  Congress did not stop to consider the technically proper avenue of relief, but merely responded to the fact that relief was being granted.  The practical result of choosing the avenue suggested by petitioners would be the subjection of school corporations to liability in damages.  Nothing in recent congressional history even remotely supports such a result.  I find it somewhat ironic that, in abandoning the supposedly ill-considered holding of Monroe , my Brother Powell relies heavily upon cases involving school boards, although he admits that “the exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction .
