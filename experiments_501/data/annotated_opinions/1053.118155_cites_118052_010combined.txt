 But as we emphasized in Kennedy itself, no one factor should be considered controlling as they "may often point in differing directions." 372 U. S., at 169 .  The second significant departure in Halper was the Court's decision to "asses[s] the character of the actual sanctions imposed," 490 U. S., at 447 , rather than, as Kennedy demanded, evaluating the "statute on its face" to determine whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction, 372 U. S., at 169 .  We believe that Halper `s deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered.  [5] As subsequent *102 cases have demonstrated, Halper `s test for determining whether a particular sanction is "punitive," and thus subject to the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause, has proved unworkable.  We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect.  See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14 (1994); United States v. Ursery, <citedDecision>518 U. S. 267, 284-285, n. 2</citedDecision> (1996).  [6] If a sanction must be "solely" remedial ( i.  e. , entirely nondeterrent) to avoid implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause, then no civil penalties are beyond the scope of the Clause.  Under Halper `s method of analysis, a court must also look at the "sanction actually imposed" to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated.  Thus, it will not be possible to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is violated until a defendant has proceeded through a trial to judgment.  But in those cases where the civil proceeding follows the criminal proceeding, this approach flies in the face of the notion that the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the government from even " attempting a second time to punish criminally." Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399 (emphasis added).

 As for the money penalties, both §§ 93(b)(1) and 504(a), which authorize the imposition of monetary penalties for violations of §§ 84 and 375b respectively, expressly provide that such penalties are "civil." While the provision authorizing debarment contains no language explicitly denominating the sanction as civil, we think it significant that the authority to issue debarment orders is conferred upon the "appropriate Federal banking agenc[ies]." §§ 1818(e)(1)(3).  That such authority was conferred upon administrative agencies is prima facie evidence that Congress intended to provide for a civil sanction.  See Helvering, supra, at 402 ; United States v. Spector, 343 U. S. 169, 178 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting) ("Administrative determinations of liability to deportation have been sustained as constitutional only by considering them to be exclusively civil in nature, with no criminal consequences or connotations"); Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 235 (1896) (holding that quintessential criminal punishments may be imposed only "by a judicial trial").  *104 Turning to the second stage of the Ward test, we find that there is little evidence, much less the clearest proof that we require, suggesting that either OCC money penalties or debarment sanctions are "so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal despite Congress' intent to the contrary." <citedDecision>Ursery, supra, at 290</citedDecision> .  First, neither money penalties nor debarment has historically been viewed as punishment.  We have long recognized that "revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted," such as a debarment, "is characteristically free of the punitive criminal element." Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399 , and n. 2.  Similarly, "the payment of fixed or variable sums of money [is a] sanction which ha[s] been recognized as enforcible by civil proceedings since the original revenue law of 1789." Id., at 400 .  Second, the sanctions imposed do not involve an "affirmative disability or restraint," as that term is normally understood.
**Combined Opinion**
 "Good faith" is considered by OCC in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed, § 93(b)(2), but a penalty can be imposed even in the absence of bad faith.  The fact that petitioners' "good faith" was considered in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed in this case is irrelevant, as we look only to "the statute on its face" to determine whether a penalty is criminal in nature.  Kennedy, 372 U. S., at 169 .  Similarly, while debarment may be imposed for a "willful" disregard "for the safety or soundness of [an] insured depository institution," *105 willfulness is not a prerequisite to debarment; it is sufficient that the disregard for the safety and soundness of the institution was "continuing." § 1818(e)(1)(C)(ii).  Fourth, the conduct for which OCC sanctions are imposed may also be criminal (and in this case formed the basis for petitioners' indictments).  This fact is insufficient to render the money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, <citedDecision>518 U. S., at 292</citedDecision> , particularly in the double jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704 (1993) (rejecting "same-conduct" test for double jeopardy purposes).  Finally, we recognize that the imposition of both money penalties and debarment sanctions will deter others from emulating petitioners' conduct, a traditional goal of criminal punishment.  But the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence "may serve civil as well as criminal goals." <citedDecision>Ursery, supra, at 292</citedDecision> ; see also Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 452 (1996) ("[F]orfeiture .  .  .  serves a deterrent purpose distinct from any punitive purpose").  For example, the sanctions at issue here, while intended to deter future wrongdoing, also serve to promote the stability of the banking industry.  To hold that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions "criminal" for double jeopardy purposes would severely undermine the Government's ability to engage in effective regulation of institutions such as banks.  In sum, there simply is very little showing, to say nothing of the "clearest proof " required by Ward , that OCC money penalties and debarment sanctions are criminal.

 The Court also claims that two practical flaws in the Halper opinion warrant a prompt adjustment in our double jeopardy jurisprudence.  First, the Court asserts that Halper `s test is unworkable because it permits only successive sanctions that are "solely" remedial.  Ante, at 102.  Though portions of Halper were consistent with such a reading, the express statement of its holding was much narrower.  [3] Of greater importance, the Court has since clarified this very point: "Whether a particular sanction `cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose' is an inquiry radically different from that we have traditionally employed in order to determine whether, as a categorical matter, a civil sanction is subject to the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Yet nowhere in Halper does the Court purport to make such a sweeping change in the law, instead emphasizing repeatedly the narrow scope of its decision." United States v. Ursery, <citedDecision>518 U. S. 267, 285, n. 2</citedDecision> (1996).  Having just recently emphasized Halper `s narrow rule in <citedDecision>Ursery</citedDecision> , it is quite odd for the Court now to suggest that its over breadth has created some sort of judicial emergency.  Second, the Court expresses the concern that when a civil proceeding follows a criminal punishment, Halper would require a court to wait until judgment is imposed in the successive proceeding before deciding whether the latter sanction violates double jeopardy.  Ante, at 102.  That concern is *110 wholly absent in this case, however, because the criminal indictment followed administrative sanctions.  There can be no doubt that any fine or sentence imposed on the criminal counts would be "punishment." If the indictment charged the same offense for which punishment had already been imposed, the prosecution itself would be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause no matter how minor the criminal sanction sought in the second proceeding.  Thus, the concerns that the Court identifies merely emphasize the accuracy of the comment in Halper itself that it announced "a rule for the rare case .
**Combined Opinion**
 It is, of course, entirely appropriate for the Court to perform a lawmaking function as a necessary incident to its Article III responsibility for the decision of "Cases" and "Controversies." In my judgment, however, a desire to reshape the law does not provide a legitimate basis for issuing what amounts to little more than an advisory opinion that, at best, will have the precedential value of pure dictum and may in time unduly restrict the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  "It is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case." Burton v. United States, 196 U. S. 283, 295 (1905); see also Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288 , 345 348 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  Accordingly, while I concur in the judgment of affirmance, I do not join the Court's opinion.  Justice Souter, concurring in the judgment.  I concur in the Court's judgment and with much of its opinion.  As the Court notes, ante, at 102, we have already recognized that Halper `s statements of standards for identifying what is criminally punitive under the Fifth Amendment needed revision, United States v. Ursery, <citedDecision>518 U. S. 267</citedDecision> , 284 285, n. 2 (1996), and there is obvious sense in employing common criteria to point up the criminal nature of a statute for purposes of both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  See United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 362-366 (1984); United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980); Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963); see also Ward, supra, at 254 ("[I]t would be quite anomalous to hold that [the statute] created a criminal penalty for the purposes of the Self-Incrimination Clause but a civil penalty for all other purposes").  Applying the Court's Kennedy-Ward criteria leads me directly to the conclusion of Justice Stevens's opinion concurring *113 in the judgment.  The fifth criterion calls for a court to determine whether "the behavior to which [the penalty] applies is already a crime." Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, supra, at 168-169 .  The efficient starting point for identifying constitutionally relevant "behavior," when considering an objection to a successive prosecution, is simply to apply the same-elements test as originally stated in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932).  See United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688 (1993).

 Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956), cited as secondary authority, required a defendant to show that a "measure of recovery" was "unreasonable or excessive" before "what was *114 clearly intended as a civil remedy [would be treated as] a criminal penalty." One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232, 237 (1972) (per curiam) , cited Rex Trailer for that standard and relied on the case as exemplifying a provision for liquidated damages as distinct from criminal penalty.  I read the requisite "clearest proof" of criminal character, then, to be a function of the strength of the countervailing indications of civil nature (including the presumption of constitutionality enjoyed by an ostensibly civil statute making no provision for the safeguards guaranteed to criminal defendants.  See Flemming, supra, at 617 ).  I add the further caution, to be wary of reading the "clearest proof" requirement as a guarantee that such a demonstration is likely to be as rare in the future as it has been in the past.  See United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 449 (1989) ("What we announce now is a rule for the rare case").  We have noted elsewhere the expanding use of ostensibly civil forfeitures and penalties under the exigencies of the current drug problems, see <citedDecision>Ursery, supra, at 300</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) ("In recent years, both Congress and the state legislatures have armed their law enforcement authorities with new powers to forfeit property that vastly exceed their traditional tools"); United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U. S. 43, 81-82 (1993) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), a development doubtless spurred by the increasingly inviting prospect of its profit to the Government.  See id., at 56, n. 2 (opinion of the Court) (describing the Government's financial stake in drug forfeiture); see also id., at 56 (citing Harmelin v. Michigan, 501 U. S. 957, 979, n. 9 (1991) (opinion of Scalia, J.) for the proposition that "it makes sense to scrutinize governmental action more closely when the State stands to benefit").  Hence, on the infrequency of "clearest proof," history may not be repetitive.  *115 Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring in the judgment.  I agree with the majority and with Justice Souter that United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), does not provide proper guidance for distinguishing between criminal and noncriminal sanctions and proceedings.  I also agree that United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980), and Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), set forth the proper approach.  I do not join the Court's opinion, however, because I disagree with its reasoning in two respects.

Pet. for Cert. i.  It is this question, and not the Blockburger issue, upon which there is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in this case did not even pass upon the Blockburger question, finding it unnecessary to do so. 92 F. 3d, at 1028, n. 3 .  [6]  In Kurth Ranch , we held that the presence of a deterrent purpose or effect is not dispositive of the double jeopardy question.  511 U. S., at 781 .  Rather, we applied a Kennedy -like test, see 511 U. S., at 780-783 , before concluding that Montana's dangerous drug tax was "the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution," id., at 784 .  Similarly, in <citedDecision>Ursery</citedDecision> , we rejected the notion that civil in rem forfeitures violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  <citedDecision>518 U. S., at 270-271</citedDecision> .  We upheld such forfeitures, relying on the historical support for the notion that such forfeitures are civil and thus do not implicate double jeopardy.  <citedDecision>Id., at 292</citedDecision> .  [1]  Title 12 U. S. C. § 84 (a)(1) prohibits total loans and extensions of credit by a national banking association to any one borrower from exceeding 15 percent of the bank's unimpaired capital and surplus.  Title 12 U. S. C. § 375b and 12 CFR §§ 31.2 (b) and 215.4(b) (1986) impose similar lending limits on loans to bank officers and other insiders.  [2]  Petitioners challenge this conclusion by relying on dicta from Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S.346, 370 (1997).  There, after rejecting a double jeopardy challenge to Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act, the Court added: "The Blockburger test, however, simply does not apply outside of the successive prosecution context." Ibid. This statement, pure dictum, was unsupported by any authority and contradicts the earlier ruling in United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704-705 (1993), that the Blockburger analysis applies to claims of successive punishment as well as successive prosecution.  See also 509 U. S., at 745-746 (Souter, J.,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (explaining why the Blockburger test applies in the multiple punishments context).
**Combined Opinion**
 [3]  "We .  .  .  hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution." United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448-449 (1989).  [4]  Other recent double jeopardy decisions have also recognized that double jeopardy protection is not limited to multiple prosecutions.  See United States v. <citedDecision>Ursery,</citedDecision> 518 U. S.267, 273 (1996); Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S., at 369.  Otherwise, it would have been totally unnecessary to determine whether the civil forfeitures in <citedDecision>Ursery</citedDecision> and the involuntary civil commitment in Hendricks imposed "punishment" for double jeopardy purposes, for neither sanction was implemented via criminal proceedings.
