 .  compliance with imposed federal standards would be essential.” 426 U. S., at 856 (Blackmun, J., concurring).  In reading National League of Cities to embrace a balancing approach, Justice Blackmun quite correctly cited the part of the opinion that reaffirmed Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975).  The Court’s analysis reaffirming Fry explicitly weighed the seriousness of the problem addressed by the federal legislation at issue in that case, against the effects of compliance on state sovereignty.  426 U. S., at 852-853 .  Our subsequent decisions also adopted this approach of weighing the respective interests of the States and Federal *563 Government.  5 In EEOC v. Wyoming, <citedDecision>460 U. S. 226</citedDecision> (1983), for example, the Court stated that “[t]he principle of immunity articulated in National League of Cities is a functional doctrine .  .  .  whose ultimate purpose is not to create a sacred province of state autonomy, but to ensure that the unique benefits of a federal system .  .  .  not be lost through undue federal interference in certain core state functions.” Id., at 236.

 Cf. ante, at 546.  Rather, by usurping functions traditionally performed by the States, federal overreaching under the Commerce Clause undermines the constitutionally mandated balance of power between the States and the Federal Government, a balance designed to protect our fundamental liberties.  C The emasculation of the powers of the States that can result from the Court’s decision is predicated on the Commerce Clause as a power “delegated to the United States” by the Constitution.  The relevant language states: “Congress shall have power... To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” Art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  Section 8 identifies a score of powers, listing the authority to lay taxes, borrow money on the credit of the United States, pay its debts, and provide for the common defense and the general welfare before its brief reference to “Commerce.” It is clear from the debates leading up to the adoption of the Constitution that the commerce to be regulated was that which the States themselves lacked the practical capability to regulate.  See, e. g., 1 M. Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (rev. ed. 1937); The Federalist Nos. 7, 11, 22, 42, 45.  See also EEOC v. Wyoming, <citedDecision>460 U. S. 226, 265</citedDecision> (1983) (Powell, J., dissenting).  Indeed, the language of the Clause itself focuses on activities that only a National Government could regulate: commerce with foreign nations and Indian tribes and “among” the several States.  *573 To be sure, this Court has construed the Commerce Clause to accommodate unanticipated changes over the past two centuries.  As these changes have occurred, the Court has had to decide whether the Federal Government has exceeded its authority by regulating activities beyond the capability of a single State to regulate or beyond legitimate federal interests that outweighed the authority and interests of the States.  In so doing, however, the Court properly has been mindful of the essential role of the States in our federal system.  The opinion for the Court in National League of Cities was faithful to history in its understanding of federalism.  The Court observed that “our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of States as States by means of the commerce power.” 426 U. S., at 842 .

 Similarly, in Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S., at 683, although finding the Railway Labor Act applicable to a state-owned railroad, the *574 unanimous Court was careful to say that the States possess constitutionally preserved sovereign powers.  Again, in FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 752 (1982), in determining the constitutionality of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, the Court explicitly considered whether the Act impinged on state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  These represent only a few of the many cases in which the Court has recognized not only the role, but also the importance, of state sovereignty.  See also, e. g., Fry v. United States, supra; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514 (1926); Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  As Justice Frankfurter noted, the States are not merely a factor in the “shifting economic arrangements” of our country, Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 95 (1949) (concurring), but also constitute a “coordinate element in the system established by the Framers for governing our Federal Union.” National League of Cities, supra, at 849.  D In contrast, the Court today propounds a view of federalism that pays only lipservice to the role of the States.  Although it says that the States “unquestionably do 'retai[n] a significant measure of sovereign authority,’” ante, at 549 (quoting <citedDecision>EEOC</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wyoming, supra, at 269</citedDecision> (Powell, J., dissenting)), it fails to recognize the broad, yet specific areas of sovereignty that the Framers intended the States to retain.  Indeed, the Court barely acknowledges that the Tenth Amendment exists.  16 That Amendment states explicitly that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States .  .  .  are reserved to the States.” The Court recasts this language to say that the States retain their sovereign powers “only to the extent that the Constitution has not divested them of their original powers and transferred those powers to the Federal *575 Government.” Ante, at 549.  This rephrasing is not a distinction without a difference; rather, it reflects the Court’s unprecedented view that Congress is free under the Commerce Clause to assume a State’s traditional sovereign power, and to do so without judicial review of its action.

 Ante, at 538-539.  In the cited cases, however, the courts considered the issue of state immunity on the specific facts at issue; they did not make blanket pronouncements that particular things inherently qualified as traditional governmental functions or did not.  Having thus considered the cases out of context, it was not difficult for the Court to conclude that there is no “organizing principle” among them.  See ante, at 539.  In undertaking such balancing, we have considered, on the one hand, the strength of the federal interest in the challenged legislation and the impact of exempting the States from its reach.  Central to our inquiry into the federal interest is how closely the challenged action implicates the central concerns of the Commerce Clause, viz., the promotion of a national economy and free trade among the States.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, <citedDecision>460 U. S. 226, 244</citedDecision> (1983) (Stevens, J., concurring).  See also, for example, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 688 (1982) (“Congress long ago concluded that federal regulation of railroad labor services is necessary to prevent disruptions in vital rail service essential to the national economy”); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 757 (1982) (“[I]t is difficult to conceive of a more basic element of interstate commerce than electric energy .  .  .  ”).  Similarly, we have considered whether exempting States from federal regulation would undermine the goals of the federal program.  See Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975).
