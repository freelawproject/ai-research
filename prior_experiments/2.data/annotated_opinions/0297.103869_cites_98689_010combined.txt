**Combined Opinion**
2 But apart from these express exemptions, the bulk of the properties in the three estates were restricted against alienation and encumbrance by various acts of Congress. 3 History, as well as statements of Congress itself, 4 leave no doubt that property so restricted is beyond the taxing power of the states, unless and until Congress gives its consent. In other words restriction is tantamount to immunity from state taxation. That was the basis of decision in Choctaw O. & Gulf R. Co. v. Harrison, 235 U.S. 292 , 35 S.Ct. 27 , 59 L.Ed. 234 ; Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, <targetCase>240 U.S. 522</targetCase> , <targetCase>36 S.Ct. 453</targetCase> , 60 L.Ed. 779 ; Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, 271 U.S. 609 , 46 S.Ct. 592 , 70 L.Ed. 1112 ; Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U.S. 503 , 38 S.Ct. 426 , 62 L.Ed. 1239 ; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U.S. 549 , 39 S.Ct. 183 , 63 L.Ed.
**Combined Opinion**
565 , 56 L.Ed. 941 , holding that under certain circumstances the United States could not withdraw a tax exemption once assured, has no bearing on the instant problem since it is conceded that the question here is entirely one of what Congress has in fact directed. 4 Choctaw. O. & Gulf R. v. Harrison, 235 U.S. 292 , 35 S.Ct. 27 , 59 L.Ed. 234 ; Indian Territory Co. v.
