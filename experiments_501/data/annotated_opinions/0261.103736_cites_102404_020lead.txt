 Thus, even though the cause of action could not be entertained in the state of the forum, either because it had been barred by the local statute of limitations or contravened local policy, the judgment thereon obtained in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit.  See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290 ; Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 262 U. S. 411 ; Titus v. Wallick, 306 U. S. 282, 291 .  Some exceptions have been engrafted on the rule laid down by Chief Justice Marshall.  But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandéis in Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642 , “the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one.” So far as judgments are concerned, the decisions, 5 as distinguished from dicta, 6 show that the *295 actual exceptions have been few and far between, apart from Haddock v. Haddock .  For this Court has been reluctant to admit exceptions in case of judgments rendered by the courts of a sister state, since the “very purpose” of Art. IV, § 1 was “to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation.” Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, pp. 276-277.  This Court, to be sure, has recognized that in case of statutes, “the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed,” some “accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states” is necessary.  Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, <citedDecision>294 U. S. 532, 547</citedDecision> .  But that principle would come into play only in case the Nevada decrees were assailed on the ground that Nevada must give full faith and credit in its divorce proceedings to the divorce statutes of North Carolina.  Even then, it would be of no avail here.  For as stated in .the Alaska Packers case, “Prima facie every state is entitled to enforce in its own courts its own statutes, lawfully enacted.  One who challenges that right, because of the force given to a conflicting statute of another state by the full faith and credit clause, assumes the burden of showing, upon some rational basis, that of the conflicting interests involved those of the foreign state are superior to those of the *296 forum.” Id., pp. 547-548.  It is difficult to perceive how North Carolina could be said to have an interest in Nevada’s domiciliaries superior to the interest of Nevada.  Nor is there any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state.

 They seem to rest on tire doctrine that the state where the land is located is “sole mistress” of its rules of real property.  See Hood v. McGehee, supra, p. 615 ; and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in Fall v. Eastin, supra, p. 14 .  That the case of Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., 191 U. S. 373 , is not an exception but only an appropriate application of the doctrine of Jorum non conveniens, see Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642-643 .  It has been repeatedly stated that the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to enforce the penal laws of another.  See, for example, Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657, 666 ; Converse *295 v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243, 260 ; Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145 , 160.  But the question of whether a judgment based on a penalty is entitled to full faith and credit was reserved in Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U. S. 268, 279 .  For other dicta that the application of the full faith and credit clause may be limited by the policy of the law of the forum, see Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, supra, p. 160; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, <citedDecision>294 U. S. 532, 546</citedDecision> ; Broderick v. Rosner, supra, note 5, p. 642 .  Grover & Baker Machine Co. v. Radcliffe, 137 U. S. 287 ; National Exchange Bank v. Wiley, 195 U. S. 257 ; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 U. S. 394 ; Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 U. S. 25, 29 ; Flexner v. Parson, 248 U. S. 289 .  Sec. 9460, Nev. Comp. L. 1929, as amended L. 1931, p. 161, supra, note 3.  The fact that a stay in a state is not for long is not necessarily fatal to the existence of a domicil.  As stated in Williamson v. Osenton, 232 U. S. 619, 624 , the “essential fact that raises a change of abode to a change of domicil is the absence of any intention to live elsewhere.” The intention to stay for a time to which a person “did not then contemplate an end” was held sufficient.  Id., p. 625.  And see District of Columbia v. Murphy, 314 U. S. 441 .
