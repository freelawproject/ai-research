**Lead Opinion**
 The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to depend upon “fair value” when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated.  9 *602 We held in Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., supra, that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of for-mulae in determining rates.  Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of “pragmatic adjustments.” Id., p. 586.  And when the Commission’s order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order “viewed in its entirety” meets the requirements of the Act.  Id., p. 686.  Under the statutory standard of “just and reasonable” it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling.  Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, <citedDecision>289 U. S. 287, 304-305, 314</citedDecision> ; West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 1), 294 U. S. 63, 70 ; West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 295 U. S. 662, 692-693 (dissenting opinion).  It is not theory but the impact of the rate order which counts.  If the total effect of the rate order cannot be said to be unjust and unreasonable., judicial inquiry under the Act is at an end.  The fact that the method employed to reach that result may contain infirmities is not then important.  Moreover, the Commission’s order does not become suspect by reason of the fact that it is challenged.  It is the product of expert judgment which carries a presumption of validity.  And he who would upset the rate order under the Act carries the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences.
