 The same considerations may well have moved the Congress to adopt § 605 as evoked the guaranty against practices and procedures vio-lative of privacy, embodied in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution.” 302 U. S., at 382, 383 .  Fifteen years later, in Schwartz v. Texas, 344 U. S. 199 , the Court considered the question whether, despite § 605, telephone communications intercepted by state officers could lawfully be received in evidence in state criminal trials.  That case was decided in the shadow of Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 , which shortly before had held that “in a prosecution in a State court for a State crime the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure.” 338 U. S., at 33 .  The Court in Schwartz recognized that the problem before it was “somewhat different” from the one that had been presented in Wolf , “because the introduction of the intercepted communications would itself be a violation” of federal law. 344 U. S., at 201 .  But the Court nonetheless concluded that state .trial courts were not required to reject evidence violative of § 605.  For if, as Wolf had held, state courts were free to accept evidence obtained in violation of the Federal Constitution, the *384 Court reasoned that they could not be required to reject evidence obtained and divulged in violation of a federal statute.  That was the thrust of the Schwartz opinion: “Although the intercepted calls would be inadmissible in a federal court, it does not follow that such evidence is inadmissible in a state court. Indeed, evidence obtained by a state officer by means which would constitute an unlawful search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution is nonetheless admissible in a state court, Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 , while such evidence, if obtained by a federal officer, would be clearly inadmissible in a federal court. Weeks v. United States, <citedDecision>232 U. S. 383</citedDecision> .” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> The fact that a state official would be violating the express terms of the federal statute by the very act of divulging the intercepted communications as evidence for the prosecution at the trial, the Court in Schwartz said, was “simply an additional factor for a state to consider in formulating a rule of evidence for use in its own courts.” Ibid. But in Benanti v. United States, 355 U. S. 96 , five years later, the Court returned to the teaching of Nardone in giving emphatic recognition to the language of the statute that itself makes illegal the divulgence of intercepted communications.  In Benanti the Court held inadmissible in a federal trial communications that had been intercepted by state officers.  7 “Section 605,” the Court said, “contains an express, absolute prohibition against the divulgence of intercepted communications.” 355 U. S., at 102.  *385 After the Benanti decision, therefore, the only remaining support for Schwartz v. Texas, supra, was the holding in Wolf v. Colorado, supra, that state courts, unlike federal courts, were free to decide for themselves whether to condone violations of federal law by accepting the products of such violations as evidence.  That doctrinal underpinning of the Schwartz decision was, of course, completely removed by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , which overruled Wolf and squarely held that evidence obtained by state officers in an unreasonable search is inadmissible in a state criminal trial. In view of the Nardone and Benanti decisions, 8 the doctrine of Schwartz v. Texas cannot survive the demise of Wolf v. Colorado, supra. In the Mapp case, the Court in overruling Wolf imposed a judicially devised exclusionary rule in order to insure that a State could not adopt rules of evidence calculated to permit the invasion of rights protected by federal organic law. In the present case the federal law itself explicitly protects intercepted communications from divulgence, in a court or any other place.  But the decision we reach today is not based upon language and doctrinal symmetry alone.  It is buttressed as well by the “imperative of judicial integrity.” Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 222 .
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Harlan, whom Mr. Justice White joins, dissenting.  Congress has ample power to proscribe any particular use of intercepted telephone conversations.  The question here is simply whether § 605 of the Communications Act proscribes basing state criminal convictions on such interceptions.  This statutory question does not involve any constitutional exclusionary rule, cf. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , or the supervisory power of this Court over the lower federal courts, cf. Weeks v. United States, <citedDecision>232 U. S. 383</citedDecision> .  More than 15 years ago, in Schwartz v. Texas, 344 U. S. 199 , this Court decided that § 605 did not render state convictions based on such interceptions invalid.  Although arguments can be made that this decision was incorrect, the matter is hardly without difficulty.  It is not at all obvious that a statute which by its terms prohibits only interception and divulgence of conversations, meant also to prohibit state-court reliance on the perfectly probative evidence gained thereby.  * *389 It disserves the proper relation between this Court and Congress to change the long-standing interpretation of a federal statute in the absence of much more convincing evidence than is here adduced that the Court originally mistook what Congress intended.  The importance of the principle of stare decisis of course varies with the nature of the question.  It is at its highest in a case such as the present: Congress has considered the wiretapping problem many times, each time against what it naturally assumed to be a stable background of statute law. To vary that background with the inclinations of members of this Court is to frustrate orderly congressional consideration of statutory problems.
