**Dissenting Opinion**
 Id., at 284-285 .  This distinction apparently recognizes that if sovereign immunity is to be at all meaningful, the Court must be reluctant to hold a State to have waived its immunity simply by acting in its sovereign capacity — i.  e., by merely performing its “governmental” functions.  On the other hand, in launching a profitmaking enterprise, “a State leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own,” Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S., at 196 , and a voluntary waiver of sovereign immunity can more easily be found. While conducting an assistance program for the needy is surely a “governmental” function, the State here has done far more than operate its own program in its sovereign capacity.  It has voluntarily subordinated its sovereignty in this matter to that of the Federal Government, and agreed to comply with the conditions imposed *696 by Congress upon the expenditure of federal funds.  In entering this federal-state cooperative program, the State again “leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own,” and similarly may more readily be found to have voluntarily waived its immunity.  Indeed, this is the lesson to be drawn from this Court’s decision in Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm’n, <citedDecision>359 U. S. 275</citedDecision> (1959), where the Court found that the States had waived the sovereign immunity of the Commission by joining in an interstate compact subject to the approval of Congress.  The Court in <citedDecision>Petty</citedDecision> emphasized that it was “called on to interpret not unilateral state action but the terms of a consensual agreement” between the States and Congress, <citedDecision>id., at 279</citedDecision> ; and held that the States who join such a consensual agreement, “by accepting it and acting under it assume the conditions that Congress under the Constitution attached.” <citedDecision>Id., at 281-282</citedDecision> .  Although the congressional intent regarding the sue-and-be-sued clause was by no means certain, the Court held that the surrounding conditions made it clear that the States accepting it waived their sovereign immunity, <citedDecision>id., at 280</citedDecision> , especially since this interpretation was necessary to keep the compact “a living interstate agreement which performs high functions in our federalism.” <citedDecision>Id., at 279</citedDecision> .  I find the approach in <citedDecision>Petty</citedDecision> controlling here.  As even the dissent in that case recognized, <citedDecision>id., at 285</citedDecision> (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), Congress undoubtedly has the power to insist upon a waiver of sovereign immunity as a condition of its consent to such a federal-state agreement.  Since I am satisfied that Congress has in fact done so here, at least to the extent that the federal courts may do “complete rather than truncated justice,” Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U. S., at 398 , in § 1983 actions authorized by Congress against state welfare authorities, I respectfully dissent.  In view of my conclusion on this issue, I find it unnecessary to consider whether the Court correctly treats this suit as one against the State, rather than as a suit against a state officer permissible under the rationale of Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908).  It should be noted that there has been no determination in this case that state action is unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Thus, the Court necessarily does not decide whether the States’ Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity may have been limited by the later enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to the extent that such a limitation is necessary to effectuate the purposes of that Amendment, an argument advanced by an ‘amicus in this case. In view of my conclusion that any sovereign immunity which may exist has been waived, I also need not reach this issue.
