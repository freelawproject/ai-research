**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Black, concurring. I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in this case that the “clear and present danger” doctrine should have no place *450 in the interpretation of the First Amendment. I join the Court’s opinion, which, as I understand it, simply cites Dennis v. United States, <targetCase>341 U. S. 494</targetCase> (1951), but does not indicate any agreement on the Court’s part with the “clear and present danger” doctrine on which <targetCase>Dennis</targetCase> purported to rely.
