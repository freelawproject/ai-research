**Combined Opinion**
In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, supra, at 384, we held that it is appropriate to grant a Rule 60(b)(5) motion when the party seeking relief from an injunction or consent decree can show "a significant change either in factual conditions or in law." A court may recognize subsequent changes in either statutory or decisional law. See Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 652-653 (1961) (consent decree should be vacated under Rule 60(b) in light of amendments to the Railway Labor Act); Rufo, supra, at 393 (vacating denial of Rule 60(b)(5) motion and remanding so District Court could consider whether consent decree should be modified in light of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979)); Pasadena City Bd. of Ed. v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424, 437-438 (1976) (injunction should have been vacated in light of Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1 (1971)).  A court errs when it refuses to modify an injunction or consent decree in light of such changes.  See Wright, supra, at 647 ("[T]he court cannot be required to disregard significant changes in law or facts if it is satisfied that what it has been doing has been turned through changed circumstances into an instrument of wrong" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Petitioners point to three changes in the factual and legal landscape that they believe justify their claim for relief under Rule 60(b)(5).  They first contend that the exorbitant costs of complying with the District Court's injunction constitute *216 a significant factual development warranting modification of the injunction.  See Brief for Petitioner Agostini et al. 38-40.  Petitioners also argue that there have been two significant legal developments since Aguilar was decided: a majority of Justices have expressed their views that Aguilar should be reconsidered or overruled, see supra, at 214; and Aguilar has in any event been undermined by subsequent Establishment Clause decisions, including Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., <citedDecision>509 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1993), and Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995).  Respondents counter that, because the costs of providing Title I services off site were known at the time Aguilar was decided, and because the relevant case law has not changed, the District Court did not err in denying petitioners' motions.  Obviously, if neither the law supporting our original decision in this litigation nor the facts have changed, there would be no need to decide the propriety of a Rule 60(b)(5) motion.  Accordingly, we turn to the threshold issue whether the factual or legal landscape has changed since we decided Aguilar .  We agree with respondents that petitioners have failed to establish the significant change in factual conditions required by Rufo .  Both petitioners and this Court were, at the time Aguilar was decided, aware that additional costs would be incurred if Title I services could not be provided in parochial school classrooms.  See App. 66-68 (Defendants' Joint Statement of Material Facts Not In Dispute, filed in 1982, detailing costs of providing off-premises services); Aguilar, 473 U. S., at 430-431 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) (observing that costs of complying with Aguilar decision would likely cause a decline in Title I services for 20,000 New York City students).

 See Witters , 474 U. S., at 485 486; Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 602-604 (1988) (concluding that Adolescent Family Life Act had a secular purpose); Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U. S. 226, 248-249 (1990) (concluding that Equal Access Act has a secular purpose); cf. Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U. S. 578 (1987) (striking down Louisiana law that required creationism to be discussed with evolution in public schools because the law lacked a legitimate secular purpose).  Likewise, we continue to explore whether the aid has the "effect" of advancing or inhibiting religion.  What has changed since we decided Ball and Aguilar is our understanding of the criteria used to assess whether aid to religion has an impermissible effect.  1 As we have repeatedly recognized, government inculcation of religious beliefs has the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  Our cases subsequent to Aguilar have, however, modified in two significant respects the approach we use to assess indoctrination.  First, we have abandoned the presumption erected in Meek and Ball that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion.  In Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., <citedDecision>509 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1993), we examined whether the IDEA, 20 U. S. C. § 1400 et seq., was constitutional as applied to a deaf student who sought to bring his state-employed signlanguage interpreter with him to his Roman Catholic high school.  We held that this was permissible, expressly disavowing the notion that "the Establishment Clause [laid] down [an] absolute bar to the placing of a public employee in a sectarian school." <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 13</citedDecision> .  "Such a flat rule, smacking of antiquated notions of `taint,' would indeed exalt *224 form over substance." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> We refused to presume that a publicly employed interpreter would be pressured by the pervasively sectarian surroundings to inculcate religion by "add[ing] to [or] subtract[ing] from" the lectures translated.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assumed instead that the interpreter would dutifully discharge her responsibilities as a full-time public employee and comply with the ethical guidelines of her profession by accurately translating what was said.  <citedDecision>Id., at 12</citedDecision> .  Because the only government aid in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> was the interpreter, who was herself not inculcating any religious messages, no government indoctrination took place and we were able to conclude that "the provision of such assistance [was] not barred by the Establishment Clause." Id, at 13.  <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> therefore expressly rejected the notionrelied on in Ball and Aguilar  that, solely because of her presence on private school property, a public employee will be presumed to inculcate religion in the students.  <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> also implicitly repudiated another assumption on which Ball and Aguilar turned: that the presence of a public employee on private school property creates an impermissible "symbolic link" between government and religion.  Justice Souter contends that <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> did not undermine the "presumption of inculcation" erected in Ball and Aguilar , and that our conclusion to the contrary rests on a "mistaken reading" of Zobrest.  Post, at 248 (dissenting opinion).  In his view, <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> held that the Establishment Clause tolerates the presence of public employees in sectarian schools "only .  .  .  in .  .. limited circumstances" i.  e., when the employee "simply translates for one student the material presented to the class for the benefit of all students." Post, at 249.  The sign-language interpreter in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> is unlike the remedial instructors in Ball and Aguilar because signing, Justice Souter explains, "[cannot] be understood as an opportunity to inject religious content in what [is] supposed to be secular instruction." Post, at 248-249.  He is thus able to conclude that <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> is distinguishable *225 fromand therefore perfectly consistent with Ball and Aguilar .  In <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , however, we did not expressly or implicitly rely upon the basis Justice Souter now advances for distinguishing Ball and Aguilar .  If we had thought that signers had no "opportunity to inject religious content" into their translations, we would have had no reason to consult the record for evidence of inaccurate translations.  <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 13</citedDecision> .  The signer in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> had the same opportunity to inculcate religion in the performance of her duties as do Title I employees, and there is no genuine basis upon which to confine <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> `s underlying rationalethat public employees will not be presumed to inculcate religionto signlanguage interpreters.  Indeed, even the <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> dissenters acknowledged the shift <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> effected in our Establishment Clause law when they criticized the majority for "stray[ing] .  .  .  from the course set by nearly five decades of Establishment Clause jurisprudence." <citedDecision>Id., at 24</citedDecision> (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Thus, it was <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> and not this litigationthat created "fresh law." Post, at 249.  Our refusal to limit <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> to its facts despite its rationale does not, in our view, amount to a "misreading" of precedent.  Second, we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.  In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from issuing a vocational tuition grant to a blind person who wished to use the grant to attend a Christian college and become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.  Even though the grant recipient clearly would use the money to obtain religious education, we observed that the tuition grants were "`made available generally without regard to the sectariannonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefited.' " Id., at 487 (quoting Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 782-783 , *226 n. 38 (1973)).  The grants were disbursed directly to students, who then used the money to pay for tuition at the educational institution of their choice.  In our view, this transaction was no different from a State's issuing a paycheck to one of its employees, knowing that the employee would donate part or all of the check to a religious institution.  In both situations, any money that ultimately went to religious institutions did so "only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of" individuals.  474 U. S., at 487 .  The same logic applied in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , where we allowed the State to provide an interpreter, even though she would be a mouthpiece for religious instruction, because the IDEA's neutral eligibility criteria ensured that the interpreter's presence in a sectarian school was a "result of the private decision of individual parents" and "[could not] be attributed to state decisionmaking." <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  Because the private school would not have provided an interpreter on its own, we also concluded that the aid in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> did not indirectly finance religious education by "reliev[ing] [the] sectarian schoo[l] of costs [it] otherwise would have borne in educating [its] students." <citedDecision>Id., at 12</citedDecision> .  Zobrest and Witters make clear that, under current law, the Shared Time program in Ball and New York City's Title I program in Aguilar will not, as a matter of law, be deemed to have the effect of advancing religion through indoctrination.  Indeed, each of the premises upon which we relied in Ball to reach a contrary conclusion is no longer valid.  First, there is no reason to presume that, simply because she enters a parochial school classroom, a full-time public employee such as a Title I teacher will depart from her assigned duties and instructions and embark on religious indoctrination, any more than there was a reason in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> to think an interpreter would inculcate religion by altering her translation of classroom lectures.  Certainly, no evidence has ever shown that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students.  *227 National Coalition for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Harris, 489 F. Supp. 1248, 1262, 1267 (SDNY 1980); Felton v. Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed., 739 F. 2d, at 53, aff'd sub nom. Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985).  Thus, both our precedent and our experience require us to reject respondents' remarkable argument that we must presume Title I instructors to be "uncontrollable and sometimes very unprofessional." Tr. of Oral Arg. 39.  As discussed above, <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> also repudiates Ball `s assumption that the presence of Title I teachers in parochial school classrooms will, without more, create the impression of a "symbolic union" between church and state.  Justice Souter maintains that <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> is not dispositive on this point because Aguilar `s implicit conclusion that New York City's Title I program created a "symbolic union" rested on more than the presence of Title I employees on parochial school grounds.  Post, at 250.  To him, Title I continues to foster a "symbolic union" between the Board and sectarian schools because it mandates "the involvement of public teachers in the instruction provided within sectarian schools," ibid., and "fus[es] public and private faculties," post, at 254.  Justice Souter does not disavow the notion, uniformly adopted by lower courts, that Title I services may be provided to sectarian school students in off-campus locations, post, at 246-247, even though that notion necessarily presupposes that the danger of "symbolic union" evaporates once the services are provided off campus.  Taking this view, the only difference between a constitutional program and an unconstitutional one is the location of the classroom, since the degree of cooperation between Title I instructors and parochial school faculty is the same no matter where the services are provided.  We do not see any perceptible (let alone dispositive) difference in the degree of symbolic union between a student receiving remedial instruction in a classroom on his sectarian school's campus and one receiving instruction in a van parked just at the school's curbside.  To draw this line based solely on *228 the location of the public employee is neither "sensible" nor "sound," post, at 247, and the Court in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> rejected it.  Nor under current law can we conclude that a program placing full-time public employees on parochial campuses to provide Title I instruction would impermissibly finance religious indoctrination.  In all relevant respects, the provision of instructional services under Title I is indistinguishable from the provision of sign-language interpreters under the IDEA.  Both programs make aid available only to eligible recipients.  That aid is provided to students at whatever school they choose to attend.  Although Title I instruction is provided to several students at once, whereas an interpreter provides translation to a single student, this distinction is not constitutionally significant.  Moreover, as in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , Title I services are by law supplemental to the regular curricula.  34 CFR § 200.12 (a) (1996).  These services do not, therefore, "reliev[e] sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students." <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 12</citedDecision> .  Justice Souter finds our conclusion that the IDEA and Title I programs are similar to be "puzzling," and points to three differences he perceives between the programs: (i) Title I services are distributed by LEA's "directly to the religious schools" instead of to individual students pursuant to a formal application process; (ii) Title I services "necessarily reliev[e] a religious school of `an expense that it otherwise would have assumed' "; and (iii) Title I provides services to more students than did the programs in Witters and Zobrest.  Post, at 251-252.  None of these distinctions is meaningful.  While it is true that individual students may not directly apply for Title I services, it does not follow from this premise that those services are distributed "directly to the religious schools," post, at 252.  In fact, they are not.  No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, cf. Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646, 657-659 (1980) (involving a program giving "direct cash *229 reimbursement" to religious schools for performing certain state-mandated tasks), and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a schoolwide basis, 34 CFR § 200.12 (b) (1996).
**Combined Opinion**
 Moreover, we fail to see how providing Title I services directly to eligible students results in a greater financing of religious indoctrination simply because those students are not first required to submit a formal application.  We are also not persuaded that Title I services supplant the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already provided in New York City's sectarian schools.  Although Justice Souter maintains that the sectarian schools provide such services and that those schools reduce those services once their students begin to receive Title I instruction, see post, at 244, 246, 251-252, 254, his claims rest on speculation about the impossibility of drawing any line between supplemental and general education, see post, at 246, and not on any evidence in the record that the Board is in fact violating Title I regulations by providing services that supplant those offered in the sectarian schools.  See 34 CFR § 200.12 (a) (1996).  We are unwilling to speculate that all sectarian schools provide remedial instruction and guidance counseling to their students, and are unwilling to presume that the Board would violate Title I regulations by continuing to provide Title I services to students who attend a sectarian school that has curtailed its remedial instruction program in response to Title I.  Nor are we willing to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid.  <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> did not turn on the fact that James Zobrest had, at the time of litigation, been the only child using a publicly funded sign-language interpreter to attend a parochial school.  Accord, Mueller v. Allen, 463 *230 U. S. 388, 401 (1983) ("We would be loath to adopt a rule grounding the constitutionality of a facially neutral law on annual reports reciting the extent to which various classes of private citizens claimed benefits under the law").  What is most fatal to the argument that New York City's Title I program directly subsidizes religion is that it applies with equal force when those services are provided off campus, and Aguilar implied that providing the services off campus is entirely consistent with the Establishment Clause.  Justice Souter resists the impulse to upset this implication, contending that it can be justified on the ground that Title I services are "less likely to supplant some of what would otherwise go on inside [the sectarian schools] and to subsidize what remains" when those services are offered off campus.  Post, at 247.  But Justice Souter does not explain why a sectarian school would not have the same incentive to "make patently significant cutbacks" in its curriculum no matter where Title I services are offered, since the school would ostensibly be excused from having to provide the Title I-type services itself.  See ibid. Because the incentive is the same either way, we find no logical basis upon which to conclude that Title I services are an impermissible subsidy of religion when offered on campus, but not when offered off campus.  Accordingly, contrary to our conclusion in Aguilar , placing full-time employees on parochial school campuses does not as a matter of law have the impermissible effect of advancing religion through indoctrination.  2 Although we examined in Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> the criteria by which an aid program identifies its beneficiaries, we did so solely to assess whether any use of that aid to indoctrinate religion could be attributed to the State.  A number of our Establishment Clause cases have found that the criteria used for identifying beneficiaries are relevant in a second respect, apart from enabling a court to evaluate whether the program *231 subsidizes religion.  Specifically, the criteria might themselves have the effect of advancing religion by creating a financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination.  Cf. Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 (upholding neutrally available program because it did not "creat[e a] financial incentive for students to undertake sectarian education"); <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra,  at 10</citedDecision> (upholding neutrally available IDEA aid because it "creates no financial incentive for parents to choose a sectarian school"); accord, post, at 253 (Souter, J., dissenting) ("[E]venhandedness is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an aid program to satisfy constitutional scrutiny").  This incentive is not present, however, where the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Under such circumstances, the aid is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion.  See Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263, 274 (1981) ("The provision of benefits to so broad a spectrum of groups is an important index of secular effect").  In Ball and Aguilar , the Court gave this consideration no weight.  Before and since those decisions, we have sustained programs that provided aid to all eligible children regardless of where they attended school.  See, e. g., Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1, 16-18 (1947) (sustaining local ordinance authorizing all parents to deduct from their state tax returns the costs of transporting their children to school on public buses); Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236, 243-244 (1968) (sustaining New York law loaning secular textbooks to all children); Mueller v. Allen, supra, at 398-399 (sustaining Minnesota statute allowing all parents to deduct actual costs of tuition, textbooks, and transportation from state tax returns); Witters, supra, at 487-488 (sustaining Washington law granting all eligible blind persons vocational assistance); Zobrest, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> (sustaining section of IDEA providing all "disabled" children with necessary aid).  *232 Applying this reasoning to New York City's Title I program, it is clear that Title I services are allocated on the basis of criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion.  34 CFR § 200.10 (b) (1996); see supra, at 209-210.  The services are available to all children who meet the Act's eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school, 20 U. S. C. § 6312 (c)(1)(F).  The Board's program does not, therefore, give aid recipients any incentive to modify their religious beliefs or practices in order to obtain those services.  3 We turn now to Aguilar `s conclusion that New York City's Title I program resulted in an excessive entanglement between church and state.  Whether a government aid program results in such an entanglement has consistently been an aspect of our Establishment Clause analysis.
**Combined Opinion**
 Under our current understanding of the Establishment Clause, the last two considerations are insufficient by themselves to create an "excessive" *234 entanglement.  They are present no matter where Title I services are offered, and no court has held that Title I services cannot be offered off campus.  Aguilar, supra (limiting holding to on-premises services); Walker v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 46 F. 3d 1449 (CA9 1995) (same); Pulido v. Cavazos, 934 F. 2d 912, 919-920 (CA8 1991); Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed., 942 F. Supp. 842 (EDNY 1996) (same).  Further, the assumption underlying the first consideration has been undermined.  In Aguilar , the Court presumed that full-time public employees on parochial school grounds would be tempted to inculcate religion, despite the ethical standards they were required to uphold.  Because of this risk pervasive monitoring would be required.  But after <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> we no longer presume that public employees will inculcate religion simply because they happen to be in a sectarian environment.  Since we have abandoned the assumption that properly instructed public employees will fail to discharge their duties faithfully, we must also discard the assumption that pervasive monitoring of Title I teachers is required.  There is no suggestion in the record before us that unannounced monthly visits of public supervisors are insufficient to prevent or to detect inculcation of religion by public employees.  Moreover, we have not found excessive entanglement in cases in which States imposed far more onerous burdens on religious institutions than the monitoring system at issue here.  See Bowen, supra, at 615-617 .  To summarize, New York City's Title I program does not run afoul of any of three primary criteria we currently use to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: It does not result in governmental indoctrination; define its recipients by reference to religion; or create an excessive entanglement.  We therefore hold that a federally funded program providing supplemental, remedial instruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis is not invalid under the Establishment Clause when such instruction *235 is given on the premises of sectarian schools by government employees pursuant to a program containing safeguards such as those present here.
**Combined Opinion**
 The ban against state endorsement of religion addresses the same historical lessons.  Governmental approval of religion tends to reinforce the religious message (at least in the short run) and, by the same token, to carry a message of exclusion to those of less favored views.  See, e. g., Ball, supra, at 390 ("[A]n important concern of the effects test is whether the symbolic union of church and state effected by the challenged governmental action is sufficiently *244 likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a disapproval, of their individual religious choices"); Lee, supra, at 606-607 (Blackmun, J., concurring) ("When the government puts its imprimatur on a particular religion, it conveys a message of exclusion to all those who do not adhere to the favored beliefs.  A government cannot be premised on the belief that allpersons are created equal when it asserts that God prefers some"); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 429 (1962) ("[A]nguish, hardship and bitter strife" result "when zealous religious groups struggl[e] with one another to obtain the Government's stamp of approval").  The human tendency, of course, is to forget the hard lessons, and to overlook the history of governmental partnership with religion when a cause is worthy, and bureaucrats have programs.  That tendency to forget is the reason for having the Establishment Clause (along with the Constitution's other structural and libertarian guarantees), in the hope of stopping the corrosion before it starts.  These principles were violated by the programs at issue in Aguilar and Ball , as a consequence of several significant features common to both Title I, as implemented in New York City before Aguilar , and the Grand Rapids Shared Time program: each provided classes on the premises of the religious schools, covering a wide range of subjects including some at the core of primary and secondary education, like reading and mathematics; while their services were termed "supplemental," the programs and their instructors necessarily assumed responsibility for teaching subjects that the religious schools would otherwise have been obligated to provide, cf. Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 243 (1977) (provision of diagnostic tests to religious schools provides only an incidental benefit); the public employees carrying out the programs had broad responsibilities involving the exercise of considerable discretion, cf. Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., <citedDecision>509 U. S. 1, 13</citedDecision> (1993) (sign-language interpreter *245 must transmit exactly what is said); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 616-617 (1971) (distinguishing, for Establishment Clause purposes, books provided by the State to students from teachers paid by the State); while the programs offered aid to nonpublic school students generally (and Title I went to public school students as well), participation by religious school students in each program was extensive, cf. Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 488 (1986) (only one student sought state tuition assistance for religious education); and, finally, aid under Title I and Shared Time flowed directly to the schools in the form of classes and programs, as distinct from indirect aid that reaches schools only as a result of independent private choice, cf. <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 12</citedDecision> ("[A]ny attenuated financial benefit that parochial schools do ultimately receive .  .  .  is attributable to `the private choices of individual parents' ") (quoting Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 400 (1983)); Witters, supra, at 487 (aid issued to students reached religious institution "only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients"); Mueller, supra, at 399-400 (same).  What, therefore, was significant in Aguilar and Ball about the placement of state-paid teachers into the physical and social settings of the religious schools was not only the consequent temptation of some of those teachers to reflect the schools' religious missions in the rhetoric of their instruction, with a resulting need for monitoring and the certainty of entanglement.  See Aguilar, 473 U. S., at 412-414 (monitoring); Ball, 473 U. S., at 388 (risk of indoctrination).  What was so remarkable was that the schemes in issue assumed a teaching responsibility indistinguishable from the responsibility of the schools themselves.
**Combined Opinion**
 When, moreover, the aid goes overwhelmingly to one religious denomination, minimal contact between state and church is less likely to feed the resentment of other religions that would like access to public money for their own worthy projects.  In sum, if a line is to be drawn short of barring all state aid to religious schools for teaching standard subjects, the Aguilar - Ball line was a sensible one capable of principled adherence.  It is no less sound, and no less necessary, today.  II The Court today ignores this doctrine and claims that recent cases rejected the elemental assumptions underlying Aguilar and much of Ball .  But the Court errs.  Its holding *248 that Aguilar and the portion of Ball addressing the Shared Time program are "no longer good law," ante, at 235, rests on mistaken reading.  A Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 13-14</citedDecision> , held that the Establishment Clause does not prevent a school district from providing a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student enrolled in a sectarian school.  The Court today relies solely on <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> to support its contention that we have "abandoned the presumption erected in Meek [v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975),] and Ball that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion." Ante, at 223.  <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , however, is no such sanction for overruling Aguilar or any portion of Ball .  In <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> , the Court did indeed recognize that the Establishment Clause lays down no absolute bar to placing public employees in a sectarian school, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 13</citedDecision> , and n. 10, but the rejection of such a per se rule was hinged expressly on the nature of the employee's job, sign-language interpretation (or signing) and the circumscribed role of the signer.  On this point (and without reference to the facts that the benefited student had received the same aid before enrolling in the religious school and the employee was to be assigned to the student, not to the school) the Court explained itself this way: "[T]he task of a sign-language interpreter seems to us quite different from that of a teacher or guidance counselor.  .  .  .  Nothing in this record suggests that a signlanguage interpreter would do more than accurately interpret whatever material is presented to the class as a whole.  In fact, ethical guidelines require interpreters to `transmit everything that is said in exactly the same way it was intended.' " <citedDecision>Id., at 13</citedDecision> .  The signer could thus be seen as more like a hearing aid than a teacher, and the signing could not be understood as an opportunity to inject religious content *249 in what was supposed to be secular instruction.  <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> accordingly holds only that in these limited circumstances where a public employee simply translates for one student the material presented to the class for the benefit of all students, the employee's presence in the sectarian school does not violate the Establishment Clause.  <citedDecision>Id., at 13-14</citedDecision> .  Cf. Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S., at 617 ("[T]eachers have a substantially different ideological character from books [and] [i]n terms of potential for involving some aspect of faith or morals in secular subjects, a textbook's content is ascertainable, but a teacher's handling of a subject is not").  The Court, however, ignores the careful distinction drawn in <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> and insists that a full-time public employee such as a Title I teacher is just like the signer, asserting that "there is no reason to presume that, simply because she enters a parochial school classroom, [this] teacher will depart from her assigned duties and instructions and embark on religious indoctrination .  .  .  ." Ante, at 226.  Whatever may be the merits of this position (and I find it short on merit), it does not enjoy the authority of <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> .  The Court may disagree with Ball `s assertion that a publicly employed teacher working in a sectarian school is apt to reinforce the pervasive inculcation of religious beliefs, but its disagreement is fresh law. The Court tries to press <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> into performing another service beyond its reach.  The Court says that Ball and Aguilar assumed "that the presence of a public employee on private school property creates an impermissible `symbolic link' between government and religion," ante, at 224, and that <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> repudiated this assumption, <citedDecision>ibid.</citedDecision> First, Ball and Aguilar said nothing about the "mere presence" of public employees at religious schools.  It was Ball that specifically addressed the point and held only that when teachers employed by public schools are placed in religious schools to provide instruction to students during the schoolday a symbolic union of church and state is created and will reasonably *250 be seen by the students as endorsement, see Ball, 473 U. S., at 390-392 ; Aguilar adopted the same conclusion by reference, see 473 U. S., at 409.  <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> did not, implicitly or otherwise, repudiate the view that the involvement of public teachers in the instruction provided within sectarian schools looks like a partnership or union and implies approval of the sectarian aim.  On the subject of symbolic unions and the strength of their implications, the lesson of <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> is merely that less is less.  B The Court next claims that Ball rested on the assumption that "any and all public aid that directly aids the educational function of religious schools impermissibly finances religious indoctrination, even if the aid reaches such schools as a consequence of private decisionmaking." Ante, at 222.  After Ball , the opinion continues, the Court departed from the rule that "all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid." Ante , at 225.  But this mischaracterizes Ball `s discussion on the point, and misreads Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> as repudiating the more modest proposition on which Ball in fact rested.  Ball did not establish that "any and all" such aid to religious schools necessarily violates the Establishment Clause.  It held that the Shared Time program subsidized the religious functions of the parochial schools by taking over a significant portion of their responsibility for teaching secular subjects.  See 473 U. S., at 396-397.  The Court noted that it had "never accepted the mere possibility of subsidization.  .  .  as sufficient to invalidate an aid program," and instead enquired whether the effect of the proffered aid was "`direct and substantial' " (and, so, unconstitutional) or merely "indirect and incidental" (and, so, permissible), emphasizing that the question "`is one of degree.' " Id., at 394 (quoting Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 784-785, n. 39 (1973), and Zorach v. Clauson, 343 *251 U. S. 306, 314 (1952)).  Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> did nothing to repudiate the principle, emphasizing rather the limited nature of the aid at issue in each case as well as the fact that religious institutions did not receive it directly from the State.  In Witters , the Court noted that the State would issue the disputed vocational aid directly to one student who would then transmit it to the school of his choice, and that there was no record evidence that "any significant portion of the aid expended under the Washington program as a whole will end up flowing to religious education." 474 U. S., at 488 .  <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> also presented an instance of a single beneficiary, see <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 4</citedDecision> , and emphasized that the student (who had previously received the interpretive services in a public school) determined where the aid would be used, that the aid at issue was limited, and that the religious school was "not relieved of an expense that it otherwise would have assumed in educating its students," <citedDecision>id., at 12</citedDecision> .  It is, accordingly, puzzling to find the Court insisting that the aid scheme administered under Title I and considered in Aguilar was comparable to the programs in Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> .  Instead of aiding isolated individuals within a school system, New York City's Title I program before Aguilar served about 22,000 private school students, all but 52 of whom attended religious schools.  See App. 313-314.  [2] Instead of serving individual blind or deaf students, as such, Title I as administered in New York City before Aguilar (and as now to be revived) funded instruction in core subjects (remedial reading, reading skills, remedial mathematics, *252 English as a second language) and provided guidance services.  See Aguilar, supra, at 406 .  Instead of providing a service the school would not otherwise furnish, the Title I services necessarily relieved a religious school of "an expense that it otherwise would have assumed," <citedDecision>Zobrest, supra, at 12</citedDecision> , and freed its funds for other, and sectarian, uses.  Finally, instead of aid that comes to the religious school indirectly in the sense that its distribution results from private decisionmaking, a public educational agency distributes Title I aid in the form of programs and services directly to the religious schools.  In <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> and Witters , it was fair to say that individual students were themselves applicants for individual benefits on a scale that could not amount to a systemic supplement.  But under Title I, a local educational agency (which in New York City is the Board of Education) may receive federal funding by proposing programs approved to serve individual students who meet the criteria of need, which it then uses to provide such programs at the religious schools, see App. 28-29, 38, 60, 242-243; students eligible for such programs may not apply directly for Title I funds.  [3] The aid, accordingly, is not even formally aid to the individual students (and even formally individual aid must be seen as aid to a school system when so many individuals receive it that it becomes a significant feature of the system, see Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S., at 264 (opinion of Powell, J.)).  In sum, nothing since Ball and Aguilar and before this litigation has eroded the distinction between "direct and substantial" and "indirect and incidental." That principled line is being breached only here and now.  *253 C The Court notes that aid programs providing benefits solely to religious groups may be constitutionally suspect, while aid allocated under neutral, secular criteria is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion.  Ante, at 230 231.  The opinion then says that Ball and Aguilar "gave this consideration no weight," ante, at 231, and accordingly conflict with a number of decisions.  But what exactly the Court thinks Ball and Aguilar inadequately considered is not clear, given that evenhandedness is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an aid program to satisfy constitutional scrutiny.  Title I services are available to all eligible children regardless of whether they go to religious or public schools, but, as I have explained elsewhere and am not alone in recognizing, see, e. g., Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 846-847 (O'Connor, J., concurring); id. , at 879-885 (Souter, J., dissenting); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 614, 621 (1988), that fact does not define the reach of the Establishment Clause.  If a scheme of government aid results in support for religion in some substantial degree, or in endorsement of its value, the formal neutrality of the scheme does not render the Establishment Clause helpless or the holdings in Aguilar and Ball inapposite.  III Finally, there is the issue of precedent.  Stare decisis is no barrier in the Court's eyes because it reads Aguilar and Ball for exaggerated propositions that Witters and <citedDecision>Zobrest</citedDecision> are supposed to have limited to the point of abandoned doctrine.  Cf. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173-174 (1989).  The Court's dispensation from stare decisis is, accordingly, no more convincing than its reading of those cases. Since Aguilar came down, no case has held that there need be no concern about a risk that publicly paid school teachers may further religious doctrine; no case has repudiated the distinction between direct and substantial aid *254 and aid that is indirect and incidental; no case has held that fusing public and private faculties in one religious school does not create an impermissible union or carry an impermissible endorsement; and no case has held that direct subsidization of religious education is constitutional or that the assumption of a portion of a religious school's teaching responsibility is not direct subsidization.  The continuity of the law, indeed, is matched by the persistence of the facts.  When Aguilar was decided everyone knew that providing Title I services off the premises of the religious schools would come at substantial cost in efficiency, convenience, and money.  Title I had begun off the premises in New York, after all, and dissatisfaction with the arrangement was what led the city to put the public school teachers into the religious schools in the first place.  See Felton v. Secretary, U. S. Dept. of Education, 739 F. 2d, at 51.
**Combined Opinion**
 [*]   Title I has been reenacted, in varying forms, over the years, most recently in the Improving America's Schools Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 3518 .  We will refer to the current Title I provisions, which do not differ meaningfully for our purposes from the Title I program referred to in our previous decision in this litigation.  [1] School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985), also invalidated a separate program called Community Education that is distinct from the Title I program at issue today.  I do not understand the Court's discussion to implicate Ball' s evaluation of the Community Education program.  [2]  The Court's refusal to recognize the extent of student participation as relevant to the constitutionality of an aid program, see ante, at 229-230, ignores the contrary conclusion in Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), on this very point.  See id. , at 488 (noting, among relevant factors, that "[n]o evidence ha[d] been presented indicating that any other person ha[d] ever sought to finance religious education or activity pursuant to the State's program").  [3]  For this reason, the Court's attempted analogy between Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act fails, see ante, at 228; James Zobrest, unlike students receiving Title I services, applied individually for the interpretative services at issue in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., <citedDecision>509 U. S. 1, 4</citedDecision> (1993).
