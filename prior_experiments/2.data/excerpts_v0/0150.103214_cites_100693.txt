Passage 1:
s upon the independence of judges who took office after Congress had thus charged them with the common duties of citizenship, by making them bear their aliquot share of the cost of maintaining the Government, is to trivialize the great historic experience on which the framers based the safeguards of Article III, ยง 1.[9] To subject them to a general tax is merely to recognize that judges are also citizens, and that their particular function in government does not generate an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government whose Constitution and laws they are charged with administering.
After this case came here, Congress, by ยง 3 of the Public Salary Tax Act of 1939, amended ยง 22 (a) so as to make it applicable to "judges of courts of the United States who took office on or before June 6, 1932."[10] That section, however, is not now before us. But to the extent *283 that what the Court now says is inconsistent with what was said in Miles v. Graham, <targetCase>268 U.S. 501</targetCase>, the latter cannot survive.
Judgment reversed.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS did not hear the argument in this cause and took no part in its consideration or decision.
MR. JUSTICE BUTLER, dissenting.
Concretely, the question is whether, by exacting from United States circuit judge Joseph W. Woodrough and his wife $631.60 in the form of income tax on his salary of $12,500 for 1936, the Government diminished the compensation for his services theretofore fixed by Congress. That item excluded, they had no taxable income. The judge's monthly pay was $1041.66. The tax took at the monthly rate of $52.63.
The material details may be given briefly.
April 12, 1933, Judge Woodrough was appointed judge of the United States circuit court of appeals for the eighth circuit. He qualified May 1, 1933. Congress had by the Act of December 13, 1926,[1] enacted that "To each of the circuit judges the sum of $12,500 per year" shall be paid as compensation. Since May 1, 1933, appellee has received the specified pa
Passage 2:
er, in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U.S. 501, writing for the Court, invalidating a state tax upon net income of a lessee from sales of his share of oil and gas received under leases of restricted Indian land, he said (p. 505): "In cases where the principal is absolutely immune from interference an inquiry is allowed into the sources from which net income is derived and if a part of it comes from such a source the tax is pro tanto void; Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429; 158 U.S. 601; a rule lately illustrated by Evans v. Gore . . ." And in that case he relied on the truth, as put by Chief Justice Marshall in M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431, that "the power to tax involves the power to destroy." He quoted (p. 505) with approval from Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U.S. 522, the statement of the opinion (p. 530) that "A tax upon the leases is a tax upon the power to make them, and could be used to destroy the power to make them."[15]
*295 Miles v. Graham (1925), <targetCase>268 U.S. 501</targetCase>, held invalid ยง 213 (a), Revenue Act of 1918, (condemned in Evans v. Gore) when applied to compensation of Judge Graham, *296 appointed after its enactment. Mr. Justice Holmes joined in the decision. Mr. Justice Brandeis merely noted dissent.
In the course of the opinion, we said:
"Does the circumstance that defendant in error's appointment came after the taxing Act require a different view concerning his right to exemption? The answer depends upon the import of the word `compensation' in the constitutional provision.
"The words and history of the clause indicate that the purpose was to impose upon Congress the duty definitely to declare what sum shall be received by each judge out of the public funds and the times for payment. When this duty has been complied with the amount specified becomes the compensation which is protected against diminution during his continuance in office.
". . . The compensation fixed by law when defendant in error assumed his official duties was $7,500 per a
