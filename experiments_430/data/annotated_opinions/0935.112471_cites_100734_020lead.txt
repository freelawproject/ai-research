 3d.  Every law that changes the punishment, and inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when committed.  4th.  Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.” Id., at 390 (emphasis in original).  Early opinions of the Court portrayed this as an exclusive definition of ex post facto laws.  Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138 (1810); Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 325-326 (1867); id., at 391 (Miller, J., dissenting) (“This exposition of the nature of ex post facto laws has never been denied, nor has any court or any commentator on the Constitution added to the classes of laws here set forth, as coming within that clause”); Gut v. State, 9 Wall. 35, 38 (1870).  So well accepted were these principles that the Court in Beazell v. Ohio, <citedDecision>269 U. S. 167</citedDecision> (1925), was able to confidently summarize the meaning of the Clause as follows: “It is settled, by decisions of this Court so well known that their citation may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited as ex post facto.  ” Id., at 169-170.  *43 See also Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U. S. 282, 292 (1977).  3 The <citedDecision>Beazell</citedDecision> formulation is faithful to our best knowledge of the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause: Legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.  Several early State Constitutions employed this definition of the term, and they appear to have been a basis for the Framers’ understanding of the provision.  See The Federalist No. 44, p. 301 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (J. Madison); 2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 376 (1911); Calder, 3 Dall., at 391-392 (opinion of Chase, J.); id., at 396-397 (opinion of Paterson, J.).  The Constitutions of Maryland and North Carolina, for example, declared that “retrospective laws, punishing facts committed before the existence of such laws, and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust, and incompatible with liberty; wherefore no ex post facto law ought to be made.” See Constitution of Maryland, Declaration of Rights, Art. XV (1776); Constitution of North Carolina, Declaration of Rights, Art. XXIV (1776).  Other State Constitutions, though not using the phrase “ex post facto,” included similar articles.  See Declaration of Rights and Fundamental Rules of the Delaware State § 11 (1776); Constitution or Form of Government for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Declaration of Rights, Art. XXIV (1780).  *44 Another historical reference, Blackstone’s Commentaries, which was discussed by the Framers during debates on the Ex Post Facto Clause, see 2 M. Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 448-449 (1911), and deemed an authoritative source of the technical meaning of the term in Calder , see 3 Dall., at 391 (opinion of Chase, J.); id., at 396 (opinion of Paterson, J.), buttresses this understanding.  According to Blackstone, a law is ex post facto “when after an action (indifferent in itself) is committed, the legislator then for the first time declares it to have been a crime, and inflicts a punishment upon the person who has committed it.” 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries * 46.  Although increased punishments are not mentioned explicitly in the historical sources, the Court has never questioned their prohibition, apparently on the theory that “[t]he enhancement of a crime, or penalty, seems to come within the same mischief as the creation of a crime or penalty.” Calder, supra, at 397 (opinion of Paterson, J.).  The <citedDecision>Beazell</citedDecision> definition, then, is faithful to the use of the term “ex post facto law” at the time the Constitution was adopted.  Respondent concedes that Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.10(b) (Vernon Supp. 1990), does not fall within any of the <citedDecision>Beazell</citedDecision> categories and, under that definition, would not constitute an ex post facto law as applied to him.  The new statute is a procedural change that allows reformation of improper verdicts.  It does not alter the definition of the crime of aggravated sexual abuse, of which Youngblood was convicted, nor does it increase the punishment for which he is eligible as a result of that conviction.  Nevertheless, respondent maintains that this Court’s decisions have not limited the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause to the finite <citedDecision>Beazell</citedDecision> categories, but have stated more broadly that retroactive legislation contravenes Art. I, § 10, if it deprives an accused of a “substantial protection” under law existing at the time of the crime.  He argues that the new trial guaranteed him by former Texas law.is such a protection.  *45 Several of our cases have described as “procedural” those changes which, even though they work to the disadvantage of the accused, do not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Dobbert v. Florida, supra, at 292-293, and n. 6; <citedDecision>Beazell</citedDecision> v. Ohio, <citedDecision>269 U. S., at 171</citedDecision> ; Mallett v. North Carolina, 181 U. S. 589, 597 (1901).  While these cases do not explicitly define what they mean by the word “procedural,” it is logical to think that the term refers to changes in the procedures by which a criminal case is adjudicated, as opposed to changes in the substantive law of crimes.  Respondent correctly notes, however, that we have said that a procedural change may constitute an ex post facto violation if it “affect[s] matters of substance,” <citedDecision>Beazell, supra, at 171</citedDecision> , by depriving a defendant of “substantial protections with which the existing law surrounds the person accused of crime,” Duncan v. Missouri, 152 U. S. 377, 382-383 (1894), or arbitrarily infringing upon “substantial personal rights.” Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 183 (1915); <citedDecision>Beazell, supra, at 171</citedDecision> .  We think this language from the cases cited has imported confusion into the interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  The origin of the rather amorphous phrase, “substantial protections,” appears to lie in a 19th-century treatise on constitutional law by Professor Thomas Cooley.  T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations * 272.  According to Cooley, who notably assumed the Calder construction of the Ex Post Facto Clause to be correct, Constitutional Limitations * 265, a legislature “may prescribe altogether different modes of procedure in its discretion, though it cannot lawfully, we think, in so doing, dispense with any of those substantial protections with which the existing law surrounds the person accused of crime.” Id., at *272.  This Court’s decision in Duncan v. Missouri, supra, subsequently adopted that phraseology: “[A]n ex post facto law is one which imposes a punishment for an act which was not punishable at the time it was committed; or an additional punishment to that then *46 prescribed; or changes the rules of evidence by which less or different testimony is sufficient to convict than was then required; or, in short, in relation to the offence or its consequences, alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage; but the prescribing of different modes or procedure and the abolition of courts and creation of new ones, leaving untouched all the substantial protections with which the existing law surrounds the person accused of crime, are not considered within the constitutional inhibition.  Cooley Const. Lim. (5th ed.) 329.” Id., at 382-383 (other citations omitted) (emphasis added).  Later, in Malloy v. South Carolina, supra, we stated that even with regard to procedural changes, the Ex Post Facto Clause was “intended to secure substantial personal rights against arbitrary and oppressive legislative action.” Id., at 183.  We repeated that recognition in <citedDecision>Beazell</citedDecision> itself, while also emphasizing that the provision was “not to limit the legislative control of remedies and modes of procedure which do not affect matters of substance.” <citedDecision>Beazell, supra, at 171</citedDecision> .  We think the best way to make sense out of this discussion in the cases is to say that by simply labeling a law “procedural,” a legislature does not thereby immunize it from scrutiny under the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See Gibson v. Mississippi, 162 U. S. 565, 590 (1896).  Subtle ex post facto violations are no more permissible than overt ones.  In <citedDecision>Beazell, supra,</citedDecision> we said that the constitutional prohibition is addressed to laws, “whatever their form,” which make innocent acts criminal, alter the nature of the offense, or increase the punishment.  <citedDecision>Id., at 170</citedDecision> .  But the prohibition which may not be evaded is the one defined by the Calder categories.  See Duncan, supra, at 382 ; Malloy, supra, at 183-184 .  The references in Duncan and Malloy to “substantial protections” and “personal rights” should not be read to adopt without explanation an undefined enlargement of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  *47 Two decisions of this Court, relied upon by respondent, do not fit into this analytical framework.  In Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221 (1883), the Court said “it is not to be supposed that the opinion in [Calder v. Bull] undertook to define, by way of exclusion, all the cases to which the constitutional provision would be applicable.” Id., at 228 .  It defined an ex post facto law, inter alia, as one which, “ ‘in relation to the offence or its consequences, alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.”’ Id., at 228-229 (quoting United States v. Hall, 26 F. Cas. 84, 86 (No. 15,285) (D Pa. 1809)) (emphasis deleted).

 Applying that test, the Court concluded that because the new Missouri Constitution denied Kring the benefit of an implied acquittal which the previous law provided, it “altered the situation to his disadvantage,” and his conviction for first-degree murder was void.  Kring, supra, at 235-236 .  The Court’s departure from Calder’s explanation of the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause was, we think, unjustified.  The language in the Hall case, heavily relied upon in Kring and repeated in other decisions thereafter, does not support a more expansive definition of ex post facto laws.  In Hall , a vessel owner was sued by the United States for forfeiture of an embargo bond obliging him to deliver certain cargo to Portland, Me. As a legal excuse, the defendant argued that a severe storm had disabled his vessel and forced him to land in Puerto Rico, where he was forced by the Puerto Rican government to sell the cargo.  In dicta, Justice Washington hypothesized that, according to the law in effect at the time Hall forfeited the cargo, an “unavoidable accident” was an affirmative defense to a charge of failing to deliver cargo.  His jury instruction then explained that a subsequent law imposing an additional requirement for the affirmative defense— that the vessel or cargo actually be lost at sea as a result of the unavoidable accident — would deprive Hall of a defense of his actions available at the time he sold the cargo and thus be an invalid ex post facto law. This analysis is consistent with the <citedDecision>Beazell</citedDecision> framework.  A law that abolishes an affirmative defense of justification or excuse contravenes Art. I, § 10, because it expands the scope of a criminal prohibition after the act is done.  It appears, therefore, that Justice Washington’s reference to laws “relating] to the offence or its consequences,” was simply shorthand for legal changes altering the definition of an offense or increasing a punishment.  His jury charge should not be read to mean that the Constitution prohibits retrospective *50 laws, other than those encompassed by the Calder categories, which “alte[r] the situation of a party to his disadvantage.” Nothing in the Hall case supports the broad construction of the ex post facto provision given by the Court in Kring .  It is possible to reconcile Kring with the numerous cases which have held that “procedural” changes do not result in ex post facto violations by saying that the change in Missouri law did take away a “defense” available to the defendant under the old procedure.  But this use of the word “defense” carries a meaning quite different from that which appears in the quoted language from <citedDecision>Beazell</citedDecision> , where the term was linked to the prohibition on alterations in “the legal definition of the offense” or “the nature or amount of the punishment imposed for its commission.” Beazell, <citedDecision>269 U. S., at 169-170</citedDecision> .  The “defense” available to Kring under earlier Missouri law was not one related to the definition of the crime, but was based on the law regulating the effect of guilty pleas.  Missouri had not changed any of the elements of the crime of murder, or the matters which might be pleaded as an excuse or justification for the conduct underlying such a charge; it had changed its law respecting the effect of a guilty plea to a lesser included offense.  The holding in Kring can only be justified if the Ex Post Facto Clause is thought to include not merely the Calder categories, but any change which “alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.” We think such a reading of the Clause departs from the meaning of the Clause as it was understood at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, and is not supported by later cases. We accordingly overrule Kring .  The second case, Thompson v. Utah , must be viewed in historical context.  Thompson was initially charged with his crime — grand larceny committed by stealing a calf — in 1895, when Utah was a Territory.  He was tried by a jury of 12 persons and convicted.

 4 The Texas statute allowing reformation of improper verdicts does not punish as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; nor make more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission; nor deprive one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed.  Its application to respondent therefore is not prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. I, § 10.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.  In Bogany , the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a jury verdict which included a punishment unauthorized by law was void at its inception and had to be set aside.  It concluded that Texas law at that time did not give appellate courts authority to reform such verdicts.  Although there has been some debate within the Court about the accuracy of the historical discussion in Calder v. Bull , see Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380, 381 (1829) (note by Johnson, J.), the Court has consistently adhered to the view expressed by Justices Chase, Paterson, and Iredell in Calder that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies only to penal statutes.  The <citedDecision>Beazell</citedDecision> definition omits the reference by Justice Chase in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798), to alterations in the “legal rules of evidence.” See also Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 590 (1884) (approving procedural changes “leaving untouched the nature of the crime and the amount or degree of proof essential to conviction”).  As cases subsequent to Calder make clear, this language was not intended to prohibit the application of new evidentiary rules in trials for crimes committed before the changes.  Thompson v. Missouri, 171 U. S. 380, 386-387 (1898) (rejecting e.r post facto challenge to retroactive application of statute making admissible handwritten documents as handwriting exemplars): Hopt, supra, at 588-590 (upholding retroactive application of statute making felons competent to testify).  The Court’s holding in Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898), that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury panel of 12 persons is also obsolete.  Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970).
