Compare Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 .  The State petitioned for, and the court granted, rehearing.  The court then affirmed the conviction.  It said: "[T]he *484 officer denied making the promise and the trier of fact believed him.  We find no reason for disturbing the trial court's finding that the confession was voluntary." [4] 28 Ill. 2d 41, 45-46 , 190 N. E. 2d 825, 827 .  The court also held, on the authority of this Court's decisions in Crooker v. California, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 433</citedDecision> , and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , that the confession was admissible even though "it was obtained after he had requested the assistance of counsel, which request was denied." 28 Ill. 2d, at 46 , 190 N. E. 2d, at 827 .  We granted a writ of certiorari to consider whether the petitioner's statement was constitutionally admissible at his trial. 375 U. S. 902 .  We conclude, for the reasons stated below, that it was not and, accordingly, we reverse the judgment of conviction.  In Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 , this Court observed that "a Constitution which guarantees a defendant the aid of counsel at .  .  .

 .  ." Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 519 .  We have also learned the companion lesson of history that no system of criminal justice can, or should, survive if it comes to depend for its continued effectiveness on the citizens' abdication through unawareness of their constitutional rights.  No system worth preserving should have to fear that if an accused is permitted to consult with a lawyer, he will become aware of, and exercise, these rights.  [13] If the exercise of constitutional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of law enforcement, then there is something very wrong with that system.  [14] We hold, therefore, that where, as here, the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the suspect *491 has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied "the Assistance of Counsel" in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as "made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment," Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S., at 342 , and that no statement elicited by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial. Crooker v. California, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 433</citedDecision> , does not compel a contrary result.  In that case the Court merely rejected the absolute rule sought by petitioner, that "every state denial of a request to contact counsel [is] an infringement of the constitutional right without regard to the circumstances of the case. " <citedDecision>Id., at 440</citedDecision> .  (Emphasis in original.) In its place, the following rule was announced: "[S]tate refusal of a request to engage counsel violates due process not only if the accused is deprived of counsel at trial on the merits, .  .  .  but also if he is deprived of counsel for any part of the pretrial proceedings, provided that he is so prejudiced thereby as to infect his subsequent trial with an absence of `that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice.  .  .  .' The latter determination necessarily depends upon all the circumstances of the case." 357 U. S., at 439-440.  (Emphasis added.) The Court, applying "these principles" to "the sum total of the circumstances [there] during the time petitioner was without counsel," id., at 440, concluded that he had not been fundamentally prejudiced by the denial of his request for counsel.  Among the critical circumstances which distinguish that case from this one are that the petitioner there, but not here, was explicitly advised by the police of his constitutional right to remain silent and *492 not to "say anything" in response to the questions, id., at 437, and that petitioner there, but not here, was a well-educated man who had studied criminal law while attending law school for a year.  The Court's opinion in Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , decided the same day, merely said that the "contention that petitioner had a constitutional right to confer with counsel is disposed of by <citedDecision>Crooker</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> .  .  .  ." That case adds nothing, therefore, to <citedDecision>Crooker</citedDecision> .  In any event, to the extent that Cicenia or <citedDecision>Crooker</citedDecision> may be inconsistent with the principles announced today, they are not to be regarded as controlling.  [15] Nothing we have said today affects the powers of the police to investigate "an unsolved crime," Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 327 (STEWART, J., concurring), by gathering information from witnesses and by other "proper investigative efforts." Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 519 .  We hold only that when the process shifts from investigatory to accusatorywhen its focus is on the accused and its purpose is to elicit a confession our adversary system begins to operate, and, under the circumstances here, the accused must be permitted to consult with his lawyer.  The judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court is reversed and the case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  Reversed and remanded.  MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting.

 .  Persons [denied access to counsel] are incapable of providing the challenges that are indispensable to satisfactory operation of the system.  The loss to the interests of accused individuals, occasioned by these failures, are great and apparent.  It is also clear that a situation in which persons are required to contest a serious accusation but are denied access to the tools of contest is offensive to fairness and equity.  Beyond these considerations, however, is the fact that [this situation is] detrimental to the proper functioning of the system of justice and that the loss in vitality of the adversary system, thereby occasioned, significantly endangers the basic interests of a free community." [14]  The accused may, of course, intelligently and knowingly waive his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel either at a pretrial stage or at the trial. See Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 .  But no knowing and intelligent waiver of any constitutional right can be said to have occurred under the circumstances of this case. [15]  The authority of Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , and Crooker v. California, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 433</citedDecision> , was weakened by the subsequent decisions of this Court in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 , White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 , and Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 (as the dissenting opinion in the last-cited case recognized).
