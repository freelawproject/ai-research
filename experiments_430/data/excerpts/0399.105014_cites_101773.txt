 But the basic principles of freedom of speech and the press, like the First Amendment’s command, do not vary.  Those principles, as they have frequently been enunciated by this Court, make freedom of expression the rule.  There is no justification in this case for making an exception to that rule.  The statute involved here does not seek to punish, as a past offense, speech or writing falling within the permissible scope of subsequent punishment.  On the contrary, New York requires that permission to communicate ideas be obtained in advance from state officials who judge the content of the words and pictures sought to be communicated.  This Court recognized many years ago that such a previous restraint is a form of infringement upon freedom of expression to be especially condemned.  Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson, <citedDecision>283 U. S. 697</citedDecision> (1931).  The Court there recounted the history which indicates that a major purpose of the First Amendment guaranty of a free press was to prevent prior restraints upon publication, although it was carefully pointed out that the liberty of the press is not limited to that protection.  14 It was further stated that “the protection even as to previous restraint is not absolutely unlimited.  But the limitation has been recognized only *504 in exceptional cases.” <citedDecision>Id., at 716</citedDecision> .  In the light of the First Amendment’s history and of the <citedDecision>Near</citedDecision> decision, the State has a heavy burden to demonstrate that the limitation challenged here presents such an exceptional case. New York’s highest court says there is “nothing mysterious” about the statutory provision applied in this case: “It is simply this: that no religion, as that word is understood by the ordinary, reasonable person, shall be treated with contempt, mockery, scorn and ridicule .  .  .  .” 15 This is far from the kind of narrow exception to freedom of expression which a state may carve out to satisfy the adverse demands of other interests of society.  16 In seeking to apply the broad and all-inclusive definition of “sacrilegious” given by the New York courts, the censor is set adrift upon a boundless sea amid a myriad of conflicting currents of religious views, with no *505 charts but those provided by the most vocal and powerful orthodoxies.  New York cannot vest such unlimited restraining control over motion pictures in a censor.  Cf. Kunz v. New York, 340 U. S. 290 (1951).

At another point the Court of Appeals gave “sacrilegious” the following definition: “the act of violating or profaning anything sacred.” Id., at 255 , 101 N. E. 2d at 670.  The Court of Appeals also approved the Appellate Division’s interpretation: “As the court below said of the statute in question, ‘All it purports to do is to bar a visual caricature of religious beliefs held sacred by one sect or another ....’” Id., at 258, 101 N. E. 2d at 672.  Judge Fuld, dissenting, concluded from all the statements in the majority opinion that “the basic criterion appears to be whether the film treats a religious theme in such a manner as to offend the religious beliefs of any group of persons.  If the film does have that effect, and it is ‘offered as a form of entertainment,’ it apparently falls within the statutory ban regardless of the sincerity and good faith of the producer of the film, no matter how temperate the treatment of the theme, and no matter how unlikely a public disturbance or breach of the peace.  The drastic nature of such a ban is highlighted by the fact that the film in question makes no direct attack on, or criticism of, any religious dogma or principle, and it is not claimed to be obscene, scurrilous, intemperate or abusive.” Id., at 271-272, 101 N. E. 2d at 680.

 See Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296 (1940).  See the following statement by Mr. Justice Roberts, speaking for a unanimous Court in Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 310 (1940): “In the realm of religious faith, and in that of political belief, sharp differences arise.  In both fields the tenets of one man may seem the rankest error to his neighbor.  To persuade others to his own point of view, the pleader, as we know, at times, resorts to exaggeration, to vilification of men who have been, or are, prominent in church or state, and even to false statement.  But the people of *506 this nation have ordained in the light of history, that, in spite of the probability of excesses and abuses, these liberties are, in the long view, essential to enlightened opinion and right conduct on the part of the citizens of a democracy.  “The essential characteristic of these liberties is, that under their shield many types of life, character, opinion and belief can develop unmolested and unobstructed.  Nowhere is this shield more necessary than in our own country for a people composed of many races and of many creeds.” In the <citedDecision>Near</citedDecision> case, this Court stated that “the primary requirements of decency may be enforced against obscene publications.” 283 U. S. 697, 716 .  In Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 571-572 (1942), Mr. Justice Murphy stated for a unanimous Court: “There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem.  These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or ‘fighting’ words — those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.” But see Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 82 (1949): “When ordinances undertake censorship of speech or religious practices before permitting their exercise, the Constitution forbids their enforcement.”
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Reed, concurring in the judgment of the Court. Assuming that a state may establish a system for the licensing of motion pictures, an issue not foreclosed by the Court’s opinion, our duty requires us to examine the facts of the refusal of a license in each case to determine *507 whether the principles of the First Amendment have been honored.- This film does not seem to me to be of a character that the First Amendment permits a state to exclude from public view.
