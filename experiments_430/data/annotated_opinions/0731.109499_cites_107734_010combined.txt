 Appellants in these cases include individual cities and States, the National League of Cities, and the National Governors' Conference; [7] they brought an action in the District *837 Court for the District of Columbia which challenged the validity of the 1974 amendments.  They asserted in effect that when Congress sought to apply the Fair Labor Standards Act provisions virtually across the board to employees of state and municipal governments it "infringed a constitutional prohibition" running in favor of the States as States.  The gist of their complaint was not that the conditions of employment of such public employees were beyond the scope of the commerce power had those employees been employed in the private sector but that the established constitutional doctrine of inter-governmental immunity consistently recognized in a long series of our cases affirmatively prevented the exercise of this authority in the manner which Congress chose in the 1974 amendments.  I In a series of amendments beginning in 1961 Congress began to extend the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to some types of public employees.  The 1961 amendments to the Act [8] extended its coverage to persons who were employed in "enterprises" engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.  [9] And in 1966, with the amendment of the definition of employers under the Act, the exemption heretofore extended to the States and their political subdivisions was *838 removed with respect to employees of state hospitals, institutions, and schools.  [10] We nevertheless sustained the validity of the combined effect of these two amendments in Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968).  In 1974, Congress again broadened the coverage of the Act, 88 Stat. 55 .  The definition of "employer" in the Act now specifically "includes a public agency," 29 U. S. C. § 203 (d) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  In addition, the critical definition of "[e]nterprise[s] engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce" was expanded to encompass "an activity of a public agency," and goes on to specify that "[t]he employees of an enterprise which is a public agency shall for purposes of this subsection be deemed to be employees engaged in commerce, or in the production of goods for commerce, or employees handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce." 29 U. S. C. § 203 (s) (5) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  Under the amendments "[p]ublic agency" is in turn defined as including "the Government of the United States; the government of a State or political subdivision thereof; any agency of the United States (including the United States Postal Service and Postal Rate Commission), a State, or a political subdivision of a State; or any interstate governmental agency." 29 U. S. C. § 203 (x) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).

 These requirements are essentially identical to those imposed upon private employers, although the Act does attempt to make some provision for public employment relationships which are without counterpart in the private sector, such as those presented by fire protection and law enforcement personnel.  See 29 U. S. C. § 207 (k) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  Challenging these 1974 amendments in the District Court, appellants sought both declaratory and injunctive relief against the amendments' application to them, and a three-judge court was accordingly convened pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 2282 .  That court, after hearing argument on the law from the parties, granted appellee Secretary of Labor's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.  The District Court stated it was "troubled" by appellants' contentions that the amendments would intrude upon the States' performance of essential governmental functions.  The court went on to say that it considered their contentions.  "substantial and that it may well be that the Supreme Court will feel it appropriate to draw back from the far-reaching implications of [ <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wirtz, supra</citedDecision> ]; but that is a decision that only the Supreme Court can make, and as a Federal district court we feel obliged to apply the Wirtz opinion as it stands." National League of Cities v. Brennan, 406 F. Supp. 826, 828 (DC 1974).  *840 We noted probable jurisdiction in order to consider the important questions recognized by the District Court. 420 U. S. 906 (1975).  [11] We agree with the District Court that the appellants' contentions are substantial.  Indeed upon full consideration of the question we have decided that the "far-reaching implications" of <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> should be overruled, and that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed.  II It is established beyond peradventure that the Commerce Clause of Art. I of the Constitution is a grant of plenary authority to Congress.  That authority is, in the words of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), "the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed." Id., at 196.  When considering the validity of asserted applications of this power to wholly private activity, the Court has made it clear that "[e]ven activity that is purely intrastate in character may be regulated by Congress, where the activity, combined with like conduct by others similarly situated, affects commerce among the States or with foreign nations." Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 547 (1975).  Congressional power over areas of private endeavor, even when its exercise may pre-empt express state-law determinations contrary to the result which has commended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress, has been held to be limited only by the requirement that "the means chosen by [Congress] must be reasonably adapted to the end permitted by the Constitution." Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 262 (1964).  *841 Appellants in no way challenge these decisions establishing the breadth of authority granted Congress under the commerce power.  Their contention, on the contrary, is that when Congress seeks to regulate directly the activities of States as public employers, it transgresses an affirmative limitation on the exercise of its power akin to other commerce power affirmative limitations contained in the Constitution.  Congressional enactments which may be fully within the grant of legislative authority contained in the Commerce Clause may nonetheless be invalid because found to offend against the right to trial by jury contained in the Sixth Amendment, United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570 (1968), or the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6 (1969).  Appellants' essential contention is that the 1974 amendments to the Act, while undoubtedly within the scope of the Commerce Clause, encounter a similar constitutional barrier because they are to be applied directly to the States and subdivisions of States as employers.  [12] *842 This Court has never doubted that there are limits upon the power of Congress to override state sovereignty, even when exercising its otherwise plenary powers to tax or to regulate commerce which are conferred by Art. I of the Constitution.  In <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , for example, the Court took care to assure the appellants that it had "ample power to prevent .  .  .  `the utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity,' " which they feared.  <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 196</citedDecision> .  Appellee Secretary in this case, both in his brief and upon oral argument, has agreed that our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.  See, e. g., Brief for Appellee 30-41; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-43.  In Fry, supra, the Court recognized that an express declaration of this limitation is found in the Tenth Amendment: "While the Tenth Amendment has been characterized as a `truism,' stating merely that `all is retained which has not been surrendered,' United States v. *843 Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 124 (1941), it is not without significance.  The Amendment expressly declares the constitutional policy that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system." 421 U. S., at 547 n. 7.  In New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), Mr. Chief Justice Stone, speaking for four Members of an eight-Member Court [13] in rejecting the proposition that Congress could impose taxes on the States so long as it did so in a nondiscriminatory manner, observed: "A State may, like a private individual, own real property and receive income.

" Coyle, 221 U. S., at 580 .  Thus, even if appellants may have overestimated the effect which the Act will have upon *852 their current levels and patterns of governmental activity, the dispositive factor is that Congress has attempted to exercise its Commerce Clause authority to prescribe minimum wages and maximum hours to be paid by the States in their capacities as sovereign governments.  In so doing, Congress has sought to wield its power in a fashion that would impair the States' "ability to function effectively in a federal system," Fry, 421 U. S., at 547 n. 7.  This exercise of congressional authority does not comport with the federal system of government embodied in the Constitution.  We hold that insofar as the challenged amendments operate to directly displace the States' freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions, they are not within the authority granted Congress by Art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  [17] III One final matter requires our attention.  Appellee has vigorously urged that we cannot, consistently with the Court's decisions in Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968), and Fry, supra, rule against him here.  It is important to examine this contention so that it will be clear what we hold today, and what we do not.  With regard to Fry , we disagree with appellee.  There the Court held that the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 was constitutional as applied to temporarily freeze the wages of state and local government employees.  The Court expressly noted that the degree of intrusion upon the protected area of state sovereignty was in that case *853 even less than that worked by the amendments to the FLSA which were before the Court in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> .  The Court recognized that the Economic Stabilization Act was "an emergency measure to counter severe inflation that threatened the national economy." 421 U. S., at 548 .  We think our holding today quite consistent with Fry .  The enactment at issue there was occasioned by an extremely serious problem which endangered the well-being of all the component parts of our federal system and which only collective action by the National Government might forestall.  The means selected were carefully drafted so as not to interfere with the States' freedom beyond a very limited, specific period of time.  The effect of the across-the-board freeze authorized by that Act, moreover, displaced no state choices as to how governmental operations should be structured, nor did it force the States to remake such choices themselves.  Instead, it merely required that the wage scales and employment relationships which the States themselves had chosen be maintained during the period of the emergency.  Finally, the Economic Stabilization Act operated to reduce the pressures upon state budgets rather than increase them.  These factors distinguish the statute in Fry from the provisions at issue here.  The limits imposed upon the commerce power when Congress seeks to apply it to the States are not so inflexible as to preclude temporary enactments tailored to combat a national emergency.  "[A]lthough an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived, nevertheless emergency may afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed." Wilson v. New, 243 U. S. 332, 348 (1917).  With respect to the Court's decision in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , we reach a different conclusion.  Both appellee and the District Court thought that decision required rejection of appellants' *854 claims.  Appellants, in turn, advance several arguments by which they seek to distinguish the facts before the Court in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> from those presented by the 1974 amendments to the Act.  There are undoubtedly factual distinctions between the two situations, but in view of the conclusions expressed earlier in this opinion we do not believe the reasoning in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> may any longer be regarded as authoritative.  Wirtz relied heavily on the Court's decision in United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936).  The opinion quotes the following language from that case: " `[We] look to the activities in which the states have traditionally engaged as marking the boundary of the restriction upon the federal taxing power.  But there is no such limitation upon the plenary power to regulate commerce.  The state can no more deny the power if its exercise has been authorized by Congress than can an individual.' 297 U. S., at 185 ." <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 198</citedDecision> .  But we have reaffirmed today that the States as States stand on a quite different footing from an individual or a corporation when challenging the exercise of Congress' power to regulate commerce.  We think the dicta [18] from *855 United States v. California , simply wrong.  [19] Congress may not exercise that power so as to force directly upon the States its choices as to how essential decisions regarding the conduct of integral governmental functions are to be made.  We agree that such assertions of power, if unchecked, would indeed, as Mr. Justice Douglas cautioned in his dissent in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , allow "the National Government [to] devour the essentials of state sovereignty," <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 205</citedDecision> , and would therefore transgress the bounds of the authority granted Congress under the Commerce Clause.  While there are obvious differences between the schools and hospitals involved in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , and the fire and police departments affected here, each provides an integral portion of those governmental services which the States and their political subdivisions have traditionally afforded their citizens.  [20] We are therefore persuaded that <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> must be overruled.  *856 The judgment of the District Court is accordingly reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  So ordered.  MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring.  The Court's opinion and the dissents indicate the importance and significance of this litigation as it bears upon the relationship between the Federal Government and our States.  Although I am not untroubled by certain possible implications of the Court's opinionsome of them suggested by the dissentsI do not read the opinion so despairingly as does my Brother BRENNAN.  In my view, the result with respect to the statute under challenge here is necessarily correct.

Ante, at 847.  See ante, at 845, 854.  Of course, regulations that this Court can say are not regulations of "commerce" cannot stand, Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S. 453, 466 (1938), and in this sense "[t]he Court has ample power to prevent .  .  .  `the utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity.' " Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183, 196</citedDecision> (1968).  [3] But my *861 Brethren make no claim that the 1974 amendments are not regulations of "commerce"; rather they overrule <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> in disagreement with historic principles that United States v. California, supra , reaffirmed: "[W]hile the commerce power has limits, valid general regulations of commerce do not cease to be regulations of commerce because a State is involved.  If a State is engaging in economic activities that are validly regulated by the Federal Government when engaged in by private persons, the State too may be forced to conform its activities to federal regulation." <citedDecision>Wirtz, supra, at 196-197</citedDecision> .  Clearly, therefore, my Brethren are also repudiating the long line of our precedents holding that a judicial finding that Congress has not unreasonably regulated a subject matter of "commerce" brings to an end the judicial role.  "Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional." M`Culloch v. Maryland, supra, at 421.  The reliance of my Brethren upon the Tenth Amendment as "an express declaration of [a state sovereignty] limitation," ante, at 842, [4] not only suggests that they *862 overrule governing decisions of this Court that address this question but must astound scholars of the Constitution.  For not only early decisions, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 196 ; M`Culloch v. Maryland, supra, at 404-407; and Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 324-325 (1816), hold that nothing in the Tenth Amendment constitutes a limitation on congressional exercise of powers delegated by the Constitution to Congress.  See F. Frankfurter, The Commerce Clause Under Marshall, Taney and Waite 39-40 (1937).
**Combined Opinion**
 My Brethren's approach to this case is not far different from the dissenting opinions in the cases that averted the crisis.  See, e. g., Mulford v. Smith, supra, at 51 (Butler, J., dissenting); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, at 76 (McReynolds, J., dissenting).  [9] *869 That no precedent justifies today's result is particularly clear from the awkward extension of the doctrine of state immunity from federal taxationan immunity conclusively distinguished by Mr. Justice Stone in California , and an immunity that is "narrowly limited" because "the people of all the states have created the national government and are represented in Congress," Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 416 (1938) (Stone, J.) [10] to fashion a judicially enforceable restraint on *870 Congress' exercise of the commerce power that the Court has time and again rejected as having no place in our constitutional jurisprudence.  [11] "[W]here [Congress] *871 keeps within its sphere and violates no express constitutional limitation it has been the rule of this Court, going back almost to the founding days of the Republic, not to interfere." Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S., at 305 .  To argue, as do my Brethren, that the 1974 amendments are directed at the "States qua States," and "displac[e] state policies regarding the manner in which they will structure delivery of those governmental services which their citizens require," ante, at 847, and therefore "directly penaliz[e] the States for choosing to hire governmental employees on terms different from those which Congress has sought to impose," ante, at 849, is only to advance precisely the unsuccessful arguments made by the State of Washington in Case v. Bowles and the State of California in United States v. California .  The 1974 amendments are, however, an entirely legitimate exercise of the commerce power, not in the slightest restrained by any doctrine of state sovereignty cognizable in this Court, as Case v. Bowles , United States v. California , Maryland v. <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , and our other pertinent precedents squarely and definitively establish.  Moreover, since Maryland v. <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> is overruled, the Fair Labor Standards Act is invalidated in its application to all state employees "in [any areas] that the States have regarded as integral parts of their governmental activities." Ante, at 854 n. 18.  This standard is a meaningless limitation on the Court's state-sovereignty doctrine, and thus today's holding goes beyond even what the States of Washington and California urged in Case v. Bowles and United States v. California , and by its logic would overrule those cases and with them Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and certain reasoning in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S. 279, 284-285 (1973).  I cannot recall another instance in the Court's history when the reasoning of so many decisions covering so long a span of time has been *872 discarded in such a roughshod manner.  That this is done without any justification not already often advanced and consistently rejected, clearly renders today's decision an ipse dixit reflecting nothing but displeasure with a congressional judgment.  My Brethren's treatment of Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), further illustrates the paucity of legal reasoning or principle justifying today's result.  Although the Economic Stabilization Act "displace[d] the States' freedom," ante, at 852the reason given for invalidating the 1974 amendmentsthe result in Fry is not disturbed since the interference was temporary and only a national program enforced by the Federal Government could have alleviated the country's economic crisis.
**Combined Opinion**
 It is absurd to suggest that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between curbs against increasing wages and curbs against paying wages lower than the federal minimum.  Today's holding patently is in derogation of the sovereign power of the Nation to regulate interstate commerce.  Can the States engage in businesses competing with the private sector and then come to the courts arguing that withdrawing the employees of those businesses from the private sector evades the power of the Federal Government to regulate commerce?  See New York v. *873 United States, 326 U. S., at 582 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  No principle given meaningful content by my Brethren today precludes the States from doing just that.  Our historic decisions rejecting all suggestions that the States stand in a different position from affected private parties when challenging congressional exercise of the commerce power reflect that very concern.  Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936).  Fry only last Term emphasized "that States are not immune from all federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status.  " 421 U. S., at 548 (emphasis added).  For "[b]y empowering Congress to regulate commerce.  .  .  the States necessarily surrendered any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regulation."

 In fiscal 1977 the President's proposed budget recommends $60.5 billion in federal assistance to the States, exclusive of loans.  Office of Management and Budget, Special Analyses: Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1977, p. 255.  Appellants complain of the impact of the amended FLSA on police and fire departments, but the 1977 budget contemplates outlays for law enforcement assistance of $716 million.  Id., at 258.  Concern is also expressed about the diminished ability to hire students in the summer if States must pay them a minimum wage, but the Federal Government's "summer youth program" provides $400 million for 670,000 jobs.  Ibid. Given this demonstrated ability to obtain funds from the Federal Government for needed state services, there is little doubt that the States' influence in the political process is adequate to safeguard their sovereignty.  [14] *879 My Brethren's disregard for precedents recognizing these long-settled constitutional principles is painfully obvious in their cavalier treatment of Maryland v. <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> .  Without even a passing reference to the doctrine of stare decisis, Wirtz regarded as controlling only last Term, Fry v. United States, 421 U. S., at 548 , and as good law in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S., at 283is by exercise of raw judicial power overruled.  No effort is made to distinguish the FLSA amendments sustained in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> from the 1974 amendments.  We are told at the outset that "the `far-reaching implications' of <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> should be overruled," ante, at 840; later it is said that the "reasoning in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> " is no longer "authoritative," ante, at 854.  My Brethren then merely restate their essential-function test and say that <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> must "therefore" be overruled.  Ante, at 855-856.  There is no analysis whether <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> reached the correct result, apart from any flaws in reasoning, even though we are told that "there are obvious differences" between this case and Wirtz.  Ante, at 855.  [15] Are state and federal *880 interests being silently balanced, as in the discussion of Fry, ante, at 853?  The best I can make of it is that the 1966 FLSA amendments are struck down and <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> is overruled on the basis of the conceptually unworkable essential-function test; and that the test is unworkable is demonstrated by my Brethren's inability to articulate any meaningful distinctions among state-operated railroads, see ante, at 854-855, n. 18, state-operated schools and hospitals, and state-operated police and fire departments.  We are left then with a catastrophic judicial body blow at Congress' power under the Commerce Clause.  Even if Congress may nevertheless accomplish its objectives for example, by conditioning grants of federal funds upon compliance with federal minimum wage and overtime standards, cf. Oklahoma v. CSC, 330 U. S. 127, 144 (1947)there is an ominous portent of disruption of our constitutional structure implicit in today's mischievous decision.  I dissent.  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, dissenting.  The Court holds that the Federal Government may not interfere with a sovereign State's inherent right to pay a substandard wage to the janitor at the state capitol.  The principle on which the holding rests is difficult to perceive.

The Federalist No. 31, p. 195 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  [2]  Some decisions reflect the Court's reluctance to interpret legislation to alter the federal-state balance of power.  See, e. g., Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S. 279, 285-287 (1973); United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971).  Rather than state any limit on congressional power, however, these decisions merely rely on our traditional canon of construction in the face of statutory ambiguity that recognizes a presumption that Congress normally considers effects on federalism before taking action displacing state authority.  Stern, The Commerce Clause and the National Economy, 1933-1946, Part Two, 59 Harv. L. Rev. 883 , 946 (1946).  There is no claim that the 1974 amendments are not clearly intended to apply to the States, nor is there any suggestion that Congress was unaware of the federalism issue.  [3]  As support for the creation of a state sovereignty limitation on the commerce power, my Brethren quote this statement in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> out of context.  Ante, at 842.  This statement is at the end of a paragraph in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> recognizing that Congress' commerce power is limited because it reaches only " `commerce with foreign nations and among the several States.' " <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 196</citedDecision> , quoting Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S., at 466 .  The passage that follows the language quoted by the Court is: "But while the commerce power has limits, valid general regulations of commerce do not cease to be regulations of commerce because a State is involved.  If a State is engaging in economic activities that are validly regulated by the Federal Government when engaged in by private persons, the State too may be forced to conform its activities to federal regulation." <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 196-197</citedDecision> .  It is clear, then, that this Court's "ample power" to prevent the destruction of the States was not found in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> to result from some affirmative limit on the exercise of the commerce power, but rather in the Court's function of limiting congressional exercise of its power to regulation of "commerce." [4]  The Court relies on Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 , 547 n. 7 (1975), but I cannot subscribe to reading Fry as departing, without analysis, from a principle that has remained unquestioned for over 150 years.  Although the Tenth Amendment "is not without significance," ibid., its meaning is clear: it declares that our Federal Government is one of delegated powers.  And it is because of this constraint, rather than the state-sovereignty doctrine discovered today by the Court, "that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system." Ibid. Fry did not say that there is a limit in the Tenth Amendment on the exercise of a delegated power, but instead said that "Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that .  .  .

10 Weekly Comp. of Presidential Documents 392 (1974).  [14]  In contrast, my Brethren frequently remand powerless individuals to the political process by invoking doctrines of standing, justiciability, and remedies.  For example, in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490 (1975), the Court suggested that some residents of Rochester, N. Y., "not overlook the availability of the normal democratic process," id., at 508 n. 18, even though they were challenging a suburban zoning ordinance and had no voice in the suburb's political affairs.  In this case, however, those entities with perhaps the greatest representation in the political process have lost a legislative battle, but when they enter the courts and repeat the arguments made in the political branches, the Court welcomes them with open arms, embraces their political cause, and overrides Congress' political decision.  [15]  In contrast, the Court measures the legislation at issue in Fry in light of today's decision, although, as I have noted, that consideration amounts to a repudiation of the Court's holding.  See supra, at 872.  Just as the reasoning of <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> is rejected, however, the reasoning of Fry , decided only last Term, must also be deemed rejected, for it adhered totally to the principles of <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> .  That the Economic Stabilization Act was an emergency measure was not dispositive in Fry ; it merely rendered the Act "even less intrusive" than the "quite limited" legislation sustained in Wirtz.  421 U. S., at 548 .
