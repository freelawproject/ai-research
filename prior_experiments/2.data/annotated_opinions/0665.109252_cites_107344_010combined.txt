Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 300 U. S. 185 , 190; United States v. American Railway Express Co., 265 U. S. 425 , 435. Moreover, even if it could be argued that respondent's challenge of the factual findings could be taken as an argument in support of the judgment, see Stern, When to Cross-Appeal or Cross-PetitionCertainty or Confusion?, 87 Harv. L. Rev. 763 , 774 (1974), the findings of fact with respect to comparative negligence were concurred in by both the District Court and the Court of Appeals, and the respondent could not in this case meet its heavy burden under the "two-court rule." Graver Mfg. Co. v. Linde Co., 336 U. S. 271 , 275. See Berenyi v. Immigration Director, <targetCase>385 U. S. 630</targetCase> , 635. [3] Most commentators have traced the rule back to Article XIV of the Laws of Oleron, promulgated about A. D. 1150, which provided that in cases of collision between a ship under way and another at anchor, the damages would be divided equally between the owners of the two vessels, so long as the captain and crew of the ship under way swore under oath that the collision was accidental. See, e. g., 4 R. Marsden, British Shipping Laws, Collisions at Sea § 119 (11th ed. 1961). See also Staring, Contribution and Division of Damages in Admiralty and Maritime Cases, 45 Calif. L. Rev. 304 (1957). Other maritime nations enacted provisions similar to Article XIV during the same period, with slight variations in the scope of the rule and the principle of division.
