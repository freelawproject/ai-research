 This Court long has recognized that the ownership *342 language of Geer and similar cases is simply a shorthand way of describing a State’s substantial interest in preserving and regulating the exploitation of the fish and game and other natural resources within its boundaries for the benefit of its citizens.  436 U. S., at 386 ; Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 284; Toomer v. Witsell, supra, at 402 .  In recognition of this important state interest, the Court has upheld a variety of regulations designed to conserve and maintain the natural resources of a State.  See, e. g., Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra; Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440 (1960); Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545 (1924); Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 138 (1914); Geer v. Connecticut, supra; Manchester v. Massachusetts, 139 U. S. 240 (1891); McCready v. Virginia, 94 U. S. 391 (1877); Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71 (1855).  To be sure, a State’s power to preserve and regulate wildlife within its borders is not absolute.  6 But the State is accorded wide latitude in fashioning regulations appropriate for protection of its wildlife.  Unless the regulation directly conflicts with a federal statute or treaty, Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 283-285; Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529, 546 (1976); Missouri v. Holland, supra, at 434 ; allocates access in a manner that violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm’n, 334 U. S. 410 (1948); or represents a naked attempt to discriminate against out-of-state enterprises in favor of in-state businesses unrelated to any purpose of conservation, Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, <citedDecision>278 U. S. 1, 13</citedDecision> (1928), the State’s special interest in preserving its wild *343 life should prevail.  And this is true no matter how “Bal-kanized” the resulting pattern of commercial activity.  7 The Oklahoma law at issue in this case serves the special interest of the State, as representative of its citizens, in preserving and regulating exploitation of free-swimming minnows found within its waters.  “[T]he law serve [s] to protect against the depletion of minnows in Oklahoma’s natural streams through commercial exportation.” 572 P. 2d 573, 575 (Okla. Crim. App. 1977).  Oklahoma’s statutory scheme may not be the most artfully designed to accomplish its pur *344 pose.  8 But the range of regulations that a State may adopt under these circumstances is extremely broad, particularly where, as here, the burden on interstate commerce is, at most, minimal.  See Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S., at 288 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, supra, at 552; cf. Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, 436.

 This is not a case where a State’s regulation permits residents to export naturally seined minnows but prohibits nonresidents from so doing.  No person is allowed to export natural minnows for sale outside of Oklahoma; the statute is evenhanded in its application.  See Okla. Stat., Tit. 29, § 4r-115 (B) (Supp. 1978).  The State has not used its power to protect its own citizens from outside competition.  See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333 (1977); H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525 (1949).  Nor is this a *345 case where a State requires a nonresident business, as a condition to exporting minnows, to move a significant portion of its operations to the State or to use certain state resources in pursuit of its business for the benefit of the local economy.  See Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385 (1948); Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, <citedDecision>278 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1928); Johnson v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 16 (1928); cf. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 145 (1970).  And, notwithstanding the Court’s protestations to the contrary, Oklahoma has not blocked the flow of interstate commerce in minnows at the State’s borders.  See ante, at 336-337.  Appellant, or anyone else, may freely export as many minnows as he wishes, so long as the minnows so transported are hatchery minnows and not naturally seined minnows.  On this record, I simply fail to see how interstate commerce in minnows, the commodity at issue here, is impeded in the least by Oklahoma’s regulatory scheme.  9 Oklahoma does regulate the manner in which both residents and nonresidents procure minnows to be sold outside the State.  But there is no showing in this record that requiring appellant to purchase his minnows from hatcheries instead of from persons licensed to seine minnows from the State’s waters in any way increases appellant’s costs of doing business.
