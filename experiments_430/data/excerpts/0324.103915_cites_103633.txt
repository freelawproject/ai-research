 The latter was designed “to indicate what the original cost of the property would have been if 1938 material and labor prices had prevailed throughout the whole period of the piecemeal construction of the company’s property since 1898.” 44 P. IT.  R. (N. S.), pp. 8-9.  Hope estimated by the “per cent condition” method accrued depreciation at about 35% of *597 reproduction cost new.  On that basis Hope contended for a rate base of $66,000,000.  The Commission refused to place any reliance on reproduction cost new, saying that it was “not predicated upon facts” and was “too conjectural and illusory to be given any weight in these proceedings.” Id., p. 8.  It likewise refused to give any “probative value” to trended “original cost” since it was “not founded in fact” but was “basically erroneous” and produced “irrational results.” Id., p. 9.  In determining the amount of accrued depletion and depreciation the Commission, following Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., 292 U. S. 151, 167-169 ; Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., <citedDecision>315 U. S. 575, 592-593</citedDecision> , based its computation on “actual legitimate cost.” It found that Hope during the years when its business was not under regulation did not observe “sound depreciation and depletion practices” but “actually accumulated an excessive reserve” 4 of about $46,000,000.  Id., p. 18.  One member of the Commission thought that the entire amount of the reserve should be deducted from “actual legitimate cost” in determining the rate base.  5 The majority of the *598 Commission concluded, however, that where, as here, a business is brought under regulation for the first time and where incorrect depreciation and depletion practices have prevailed, the deduction of the reserve requirement (actual existing depreciation and depletion) rather than the excessive reserve should be made so as to lay “a sound basis for future regulation and control of rates.” Id., p. 18.  As we have pointed out, it determined accrued depletion and depreciation to be $22,328,016; and it allowed approximately $1,460,000 as the annual operating expense for depletion and depreciation.  6 Hope’s estimate of original cost was about $69,735,-000 — approximately $17,000,000 more than the amount found by the Commission.  The item of $17,000,000 was made up largely of expenditures which prior to December 31, 1938, were charged to operating expenses.

 Munn v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113, 134 .  The fixing of prices, like other applications of the police power, may reduce the value of the property which is being regulated.  But the fact that the value is reduced does not mean that the regulation is invalid.  Block v. Hirsh, 256 U. S. 135, 155-157 ; Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502 , 523-539 and cases cited.  It does, however, indicate that “fair value” is the end product of the process of rate-making not the starting point as the Circuit Court of Appeals held.  The heart of the matter is that rates cannot be made to depend upon “fair value” when the value of the going enterprise depends on earnings under whatever rates may be anticipated.  9 *602 We held in <citedDecision>Federal Power Commission</citedDecision> v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., supra, that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of for-mulae in determining rates.  Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of “pragmatic adjustments.” Id., p. 586.  And when the Commission’s order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order “viewed in its entirety” meets the requirements of the Act.  Id., p. 686.  Under the statutory standard of “just and reasonable” it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling.  Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 289 U. S. 287, 304-305, 314 ; West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (No. 1), 294 U. S. 63, 70 ; West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Tel. Co., 295 U. S. 662, 692-693 (dissenting opinion).  It is not theory but the impact of the rate order which counts.

 Reversed.  Mr. Justice Roberts took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. Opinion of Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Murphy: We agree with the Court’s opinion and would add nothing to what has been said but for what is patently a wholly gratuitous assertion as to Constitutional law in the dissent of Mr. Justice Frankfurter.  We refer to the statement that “Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, supra, may fairly be claimed.” That was the case in which a majority of this Court was finally induced to expand the meaning *620 of “due process” so as to give courts power to block efforts of the state and national governments to regulate economic affairs.  The present case does not afford a proper occasion to discuss the soundness of that doctrine because, as stated in Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s dissent, “that issue is not here in controversy.” The salutary practice whereby courts do not discuss issues in the abstract applies with peculiar force to Constitutional questions.  Since, however, the dissent adverts to a highly controversial due process doctrine and implies its acceptance by Congress, we feel compelled to say that we do not understand that Congress voluntarily has acquiesced in a Constitutional principle of government that courts, rather than legislative bodies, possess final authority over regulation of economic affairs.  Even this Court has not always fully embraced that principle, and we wish to repeat that we have never acquiesced in it, and do not now.  See Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., <citedDecision>315 U. S. 575, 599-601</citedDecision> .  Hope produces about one-third of its annual gas requirements and purchases the rest under some 300 contracts.  These five companies are the East Ohio Gas Co., the Peoples Natural Gas Co., the River Gas Co., the Fayette County Gas Co., and the Manufacturers Light & Heat Co. The first three of these companies are, like Hope, subsidiaries of Standard Oil Co. (N. J.).  East Ohio and River distribute gas in Ohio, the other three in Pennsylvania.  Hope’s approximate sales in m. c. f. for 1940 may be classified as follows: Local West Virginia sales.  11,000,000 East Ohio.  40,000,000 Peoples.

Mr. Justice Reed, dissenting: This case involves the problem of rate making under the Natural Gas Act. Added importance arises from the obvious fact that the principles stated are generally applicable to all federal agencies which are entrusted with the determination of rates for utilities. Because my views differ somewhat from those of my brethren, it may be of some value to set them out in a summary form. The Congress may fix utility rates in situations subject to federal control without regard to any standard except the constitutional standards of due process and for taking private property for public use without just compensation. Wilson v. New, 243 U. S. 332, 350 . A Commission, however, does not have this freedom of action. Its powers are limited not only by the constitutional standards but also by the standards of the delegation. Here the standard added by the Natural Gas Act is that the rate be “just *621 and reasonable." 1 Section 6 2 throws additional light on the meaning of these words. When the phrase was used by Congress to describe allowable rates, it had relation to something ascertainable. The rates were not left to the whim of the Commission. The rates fixed would produce an annual return and that annual return was to be compared with a theoretical just and reasonable return, all risks considered, on the fair value of the property used and useful in the public service at the time of the determination. Such an abstract test is not precise. The agency charged with its determination has a wide range before it could properly be said by a court that the agency had disregarded statutory standards or had confiscated the property of the utility for public use. Cf. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, 134 U. S. 418, 461-66 , dissent. This is as Congress intends. Rates are left to an experienced agency particularly competent by training to appraise the amount required. The decision as to a reasonable return had not been a source of great difficulty, for borrowers and lenders reached such agreements daily in a multitude of situations; and although the determination of fair value had been troublesome, its essentials had been worked out in fairness to investor and consumer by the time of the en *622 actment of this Act. Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 289 U. S. 287 , 304 et seq. The results were well known to Congress and had that body desired to depart from the traditional concepts of fair value and earnings, it would have stated its intention plainly. Helvering v. Griffiths, 318 U. S. 371 . It was already clear that when rates are in dispute, "earnings produced by rates do not afford a standard for decision.” 289 U. S. at 305 . Historical cost, prudent investment and reproduction cost 3 were all relevant factors in determining fair value. Indeed, disregarding the pioneer investor’s risk, if prudent investment and reproduction cost were not distorted by changes in price levels or technology, each of them would produce the same result. The realization from the risk of an investment in a speculative field, such as natural gas utilities, should be reflected in the present fair value. 4 The amount of evidence to be admitted on any point was of course in the agency’s reasonable discretion, and it was free to give its own weight to these or other factors and to determine from all the evidence its own judgment as to the necessary rates. *623 I agree with the Court in not imposing a rule of prudent investment alone in determining the rate base. This leaves the Commission free, as I understand it, to use any available evidence for its finding of fair value, including both prudent investment and the cost of installing at the present time an efficient system for furnishing the needed utility service. My disagreement with the Court arises primarily from its view that it makes no difference how the Commission reached the rate fixed so long as the result is fair and reasonable. For me the statutory command to the Commission is more explicit. Entirely aside from the constitutional problem of whether the Congress could validly delegate its rate-making power to the Commission, in toto and without standards, it did legislate in the light of the relation of fair and reasonable to fair value and reasonable return. The Commission must therefore make its findings in observance of that relationship. The Federal Power Commission did not, as I construe their action, disregard its statutory duty. They heard the evidence relating to historical and reproduction cost and to the reasonable rate of return, and they appraised its weight. The evidence of reproduction cost was rejected as unpersuasive, but from the other evidence they found a rate base, which is to me a determination of fair value. On that base the earnings allowed seem fair and reasonable. So far as the Commission went in appraising the property employed in the service, I find nothing in the result which indicates confiscation, unfairness or unreasonableness. Good administration of rate-making agencies under this method would avoid undue delay and render revaluations unnecessary except after violent fluctuations of price levels. Rate making under this method has been subjected to criticism. But until Congress changes the standards for the agencies, these rate-making bodies should continue the conventional theory of rate *624 making. It will probably be simpler to improve present methods than to devise new ones. But a major error, I think, was committed in the disregard by the Commission of the investment in exploratory operations and other recognized capital costs. These were not considered by the Commission because they were charged to operating expenses by the company at a time when it was .unregulated. Congress did not direct the Commission in rate making to deduct from the rate base capital investment which had been recovered during the unregulated period through excess earnings. In my view this part of the investment should no more have been disregarded in the rate base than any other capital investment which previously had been recovered and paid out in dividends or placed to surplus. Even if prudent investment throughout the life of the property is accepted as the formula for figuring the rate base, it seems to me illogical to throw out the admittedly prudent cost of part of the property because the earnings in the unregulated period had been sufficient to return the prudent cost to the investors over and above a reasonable return. What would the answer be under the theory of the Commission and the Court, if the only prudent investment in this utility had been the seventeen million capital charges which are now disallowed? For the reasons heretofore stated, I should affirm the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in returning the proceeding to the Commission for further consideration and should direct the Commission to accept the disallowed capital investment in determining the fair value for rate-making purposes. Natural Gas Act, § 4 (a), 52 Stat. 821 , 822, 15 U. S. C. § 717 (a). 52 Stat. 821,824,15 Ü. S. C. § 717e: “(a) The Commission may investigate and ascertain the actual legitimate cost of the property of every natural-gas company, the depreciation therein, and, when found necessary for rate-making purposes, other facts which bear on the determination of such cost or depreciation and the fair value of such property. “(b) Every natural-gas company upon request shall file with the Commission an inventory of all or any part of its property and a statement of the original cost thereof, and shall keep the Commission informed regarding the cost of all additions, betterments, extensions, and new construction.” “Reproduction cost” has been variously defined, but for rate-making purposes the most useful sense seems to be, the minimum amount necessary to create at the time of the inquiry a modern plant capable of rendering equivalent service. See I Bonbright, Valuation of Property (1937) 152. Reproduction cost as the cost of building a replica of an obsolescent plant is not of real significance. “Prudent investment” is not defined by the Court. It may mean the sum originally put in the enterprise, either with or without additional amounts from excess earnings reinvested in the business. It is of no more than bookkeeping significance whether the Commission allows a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the original investment or the lower rate based on current risk and a capitalization reflecting the established earning power of a suceessful company and the probable cost of duplicating its services. Cf. A. T. & T. Co. v. United States, 299 U. S. 232 . But the latter is the traditional method.

 Cf. Driscoll v. Edison Co., 307 U.S. 104 .  But it is not to be assumed that it was the design of Congress to make the accommodation of the conflicting interests exposed in MR. JUSTICE JACKSON'S opinion the occasion for a blind clash of forces or a partial assessment of relevant factors, either before the Commission or here.  The objection to the Commission's action is not that the rates it granted were too low but that the range of its vision was too narrow.  And since the issues before the Commission involved no less than the total public interest, the proceedings before it should not be judged by narrow conceptions of common law pleading.  And so I conclude that the case should be returned to the Commission.  In order to enable this Court to discharge its duty of reviewing the Commission's order, the Commission should set forth with explicitness the criteria by which it is guided *628 in determining that rates are "just and reasonable," and it should determine the public interest that is in its keeping in the perspective of the considerations set forth by MR. JUSTICE JACKSON.  BY MR. JUSTICE JACKSON: Certainly the theory of the court below that ties rate-making to the fair-value-reproduction-cost formula should be overruled as in conflict with <citedDecision>Federal Power Commission</citedDecision> v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co .  [1] But the case should, I think, be the occasion for reconsideration of our rate-making doctrine as applied to natural gas and should be returned to the Commission, for further consideration in the light thereof.  The Commission appears to have understood the effect of the two opinions in the Pipeline case to be at least authority and perhaps direction to fix natural gas rates by exclusive application of the "prudent investment" rate base theory.  This has no warrant in the opinion of the Chief Justice for the Court, however, which released the Commission from subservience to "any single formula or combination of formulas" provided its order, "viewed in its entirety, produces no arbitrary result." <citedDecision>315 U.S. at 586</citedDecision> .  The minority opinion I understood to advocate the "prudent investment" theory as a sufficient guide in a natural gas case. The view was expressed in the court below that since this opinion was not expressly controverted it must have been approved.  [2] I disclaim this imputed *629 approval with some particularity, because I attach importance at the very beginning of federal regulation of the natural gas industry to approaching it as the performance of economic functions, not as the performance of legalistic rituals.  I.  Solutions of these cases must consider eccentricities of the industry which gives rise to them and also to the Act of Congress by which they are governed.  The heart of this problem is the elusive, exhaustible, and irreplaceable nature of natural gas itself.  Given sufficient money, we can produce any desired amount of railroad, bus, or steamship transportation, or communications facilities, or capacity for generation of electric energy, or for the manufacture of gas of a kind.
**Combined Opinion**
 If we assume that the reduction in company revenues is warranted we then come to the question of translating the allowed return into rates for consumers or classes of consumers.  Here the Commission fixed a single rate for all gas delivered irrespective of its use despite the fact that Hope has established what amounts to two rates  a high one for domestic use and a lower one for industrial contracts.  [46] The Commission can fix two prices for interstate gas as readily as one  a price for resale to domestic users and another for resale to industrial users.  This is the pattern Hope itself has established in the very contracts over which the Commission is expressly given jurisdiction.  Certainly the Act is broad enough to permit two prices to be fixed instead of one, if the concept of the "public interest" is not unduly narrowed.  The Commission's concept of the public interest in natural gas cases which is carried today into the Court's opinion was first announced in the opinion of the minority in the Pipeline case. It enumerated only two "phases of the public interest: (1) the investor interest; (2) the consumer interest," which it emphasized to the exclusion of all others.  <citedDecision>315 U.S. 575, 606</citedDecision> .  This will do well enough in dealing with railroads or utilities supplying manufactured gas, electric power, a communications service or transportation, where utilization of facilities does not impair their future usefulness.  Limitation of supply, however, brings into a natural gas case another phase of the public interest that to my mind overrides both the owner *657 and the consumer of that interest.  Both producers and industrial consumers have served their immediate private interests at the expense of the long-range public interest.  The public interest, of course, requires stopping unjust enrichment of the owner.  But it also requires stopping unjust impoverishment of future generations.  The public interest in the use by Hope's half million domestic consumers is quite a different one from the public interest in use by a baker's dozen of industries.

[2]  Judge Dobie, dissenting below, pointed out that the majority opinion in the Pipeline case "contains no express discussion of the Prudent Investment Theory" and that the concurring opinion contained a clear one, and said, "It is difficult for me to believe that the majority of the Supreme Court, believing otherwise, would leave such a statement unchallenged." The fact that two other Justices had as matter of record in our books long opposed the reproduction cost theory of rate bases and had commented favorably on the prudent investment theory may have influenced that conclusion.  See opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Driscoll v. Edison Light & Power Co., 307 U.S. 104, 122 , and my brief as Solicitor General in that case. It should be noted, however, that these statements were made, not in a natural gas case, but in an electric power case  a very important distinction, as I shall try to make plain.  [3]  Natural gas from the Appalachian field averages about 1,050 to 1,150 B.T.U.  content, while by-product manufactured gas is about 530 to 540.
