 .  is entitled to greater weight .  .  .") (O'Connor, J., concurring).  For over a century, we have grounded our decisions in the oft-repeated understanding of state sovereign immunity as an essential part of the Eleventh Amendment.  In Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 313</citedDecision> (1934), the Court held that the Eleventh Amendment barred a suit brought against a State by a foreign state.  Chief Justice Hughes wrote for a unanimous Court: "[N]either the literal sweep of the words of Clause one of § 2 of Article III, nor the absence of restriction in the letter of the Eleventh Amendment, permits the conclusion that in all controversies of the sort described in Clause one, and omitted from the words of the Eleventh Amendment, a State may be sued without her consent.  Thus Clause one specifically provides that the judicial Power shall extend `to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.' But, although a case may arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the judicial power does not extend to it if the suit is *68 sought to be prosecuted against a State, without her consent, by one of her own citizens.  .  .  .

 Its undocumented and highly speculative extralegal explanation of *69 the decision in Hans is a disservice to the Court's traditional method of adjudication.  See post, at 120-123.  The dissent mischaracterizes the Hans opinion.  That decision found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental "`jurisprudence in all civilized nations.' " Hans, 134 U. S., at 17 , quoting Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858); see also The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (sovereign immunity "is the general sense and the general practice of mankind").  The dissent's proposition that the common law of England, where adopted by the States, was open to change by the Legislature is wholly unexceptionable and largely beside the point: that common law provided the substantive rules of law rather than jurisdiction.  Cf. <citedDecision>Monaco, supra, at 323</citedDecision> (state sovereign immunity, like the requirement that there be a "justiciable" controversy, is a constitutionally grounded limit on federal jurisdiction).  It also is noteworthy that the principle of state sovereign immunity stands distinct from other principles of the common law in that only the former prompted a specific constitutional amendment.  Hans with a much closer vantage point than the dissentrecognized that the decision in Chisholm was contrary to the well-understood meaning of the Constitution.  The dissent's conclusion that the decision in Chisholm was "reasonable," post, at 106, certainly would have struck the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment as quite odd: That decision created "such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted." <citedDecision>Monaco, supra,  at 325</citedDecision> .  The dissent's lengthy analysis of the text of the Eleventh Amendment is directed at a straw manwe long have recognized that blind reliance upon the text of the Eleventh Amendment is "`to strain the Constitution and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of.' " <citedDecision>Monaco, supra, at 326</citedDecision> , quoting Hans, supra, at 15 .  The text dealt in terms only with the problem presented by the decision in Chisholm ; in light of the fact that the federal courts did not *70 have federal-question jurisdiction at the time the Amendment was passed (and would not have it until 1875), it seems unlikely that much thought was given to the prospect of federal-question jurisdiction over the States.  That same consideration causes the dissent's criticism of the views of Marshall, Madison, and Hamilton to ring hollow.  The dissent cites statements made by those three influential Framers, the most natural reading of which would preclude all federal jurisdiction over an unconsenting State.  [12] Struggling against this reading, however, the dissent finds significant the absence of any contention that sovereign immunity would affect the new federal-question jurisdiction.  Post, at 142-150.  But the lack of any statute vesting general federal-question jurisdiction in the federal courts until much later makes the dissent's demand for greater specificity about a then-dormant jurisdiction overly exacting.

 See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U. S. 511 (1985); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U. S. 800 (1982).  Similarly, our cases recognizing qualified officer immunity in 42 U. S. C. § 1983 actions rest on the conclusion that, in passing that statute, Congress did not intend to displace the common-law immunity that officers would have retained under suits premised solely on the general jurisdictional statute.  See Tower v. Glover, 467 U. S. 914, 920 (1984).  For that reason, the federal common law of officer immunity that Congress meant to incorporate, not a contrary state immunity, applies in § 1983 cases. See Martinez v. California, 444 U. S. 277, 284 (1980).  There is no reason why Congress' undoubted power to displace those common-law immunities should be either greater or lesser than its power to displace the common-law sovereign immunity defense.  Some of our precedents do state that the sovereign immunity doctrine rests on fundamental constitutional "postulates" and partakes of jurisdictional aspects rooted in Article III. See ante, at 67-70.  Most notably, that reasoning underlies this Court's holding in Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 313</citedDecision> (1934).  Monaco is a most inapt precedent for the majority's holding today.  That case barred a foreign sovereign from suing a State in an equitable state-law action to recover payments due on state bonds.  It did not, however, involve a claim based on federal law. Instead, the case concerned a purely state-law question to which the State had interposed a federal defense.  <citedDecision>Id., at 317</citedDecision> .  Thus, Monaco reveals little about the power of Congress to create a private federal cause of action to remedy a State's violation of federal law. Moreover, although Monaco attributes a quasiconstitutional status to sovereign immunity, even in cases not covered by the Eleventh Amendment's plain text, that characterization does not constitute precedent for the proposition that Congress is powerless to displace a State's immunity.  *89 Our abstention doctrines have roots in both the Tenth Amendment and Article III, and thus may be said to rest on constitutional "postulates" or to partake of jurisdictional aspects.  Yet it has not been thought that the Constitution would prohibit Congress from barring federal courts from abstaining.  The majority offers no reason for making the federal common-law rule of sovereign immunity less susceptible to congressional displacement than any other quasijurisdictional common-law rule.  In this regard, I note that Monaco itself analogized sovereign immunity to the prudential doctrine that "controversies" identified in Article III must be "justiciable" in order to be heard by federal courts.  <citedDecision>Id., at 329</citedDecision> .  The justiciability doctrine is a prudential rather than a jurisdictional one, and thus Congress' clearly expressed intention to create federal jurisdiction over a particular Article III controversy necessarily strips federal courts of the authority to decline jurisdiction on justiciability grounds.  See Allen v. Wright, 468 U. S. 737, 791 (1984) (Stevens, J., dissenting); Flast Cohen, v. 392 U. S. 83, 100-101 (1968).  For that reason, Monaco, by its own terms, fails to resolve the question before us.  [11] More generally, it is quite startling to learn that the reasoning of Hans and Monaco (even assuming that it did not undermine the majority's view) should have a stare decisis effect on the question whether Congress possesses the authority to provide a federal forum for the vindication of a federal right by a citizen against its own State.  In light of the Court's development of a "clear-statement" line of jurisprudence, *90 see, e. g., Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 238-239 ; Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 492 U. S. 96 (1989), I would have thought that Hans and Monaco had at least left open the question whether Congress could permit the suit we consider here.  Our clear-statement cases would have been all but unintelligible if Hans and Monaco had already established that Congress lacked the constitutional power to make States suable in federal court by individuals no matter how clear its intention to do so. [12] Finally, the particular nature of the federal question involved in Hans renders the majority's reliance upon its rule even less defensible.
**Combined Opinion**
 This cannot be the "rationale," though, because this Court has repeatedly acknowledged that the Eleventh Amendment standing alone *124 cannot bar a federal-question suit against a State brought by a state citizen.  See, e. g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 662 (1974) (acknowledging that "the Amendment by its terms does not bar suits against a State by its own citizens").  [18] Indeed, as I have noted, Justice Bradley's opinion in Hans conceded that Hans might successfully have pursued his claim "if there were no other reason or ground [other than the Amendment itself] for abating his suit." 134 U. S., at 10 .  The Hans Court, rather, held the suit barred by a nonconstitutional common-law immunity.  See supra, at 116-117.  The "rationale" which the majority seeks to invoke is, I think, more nearly stated in its quotation from Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 313, 321-323</citedDecision> (1934).  There, the Court said that "we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of § 2 of Article III, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against non-consenting States." Id., at 322.  [19] This statement certainly is true to Hans , which *125 clearly recognized a pre-existing principle of sovereign immunity, broader than the Eleventh Amendment itself, that will ordinarily bar federal-question suits against a nonconsenting State.  That was the "rationale" which was sufficient to decide Hans and all of its progeny prior to Union Gas.  But leaving aside the indefensibility of that rationale, which I will address further below, that was as far as it went.  The majority, however, would read the "rationale" of Hans and its line of subsequent cases as answering the further question whether the "postulate" of sovereign immunity that "limit[s] and control[s]" the exercise of Article III jurisdiction, <citedDecision>Monaco, supra, at 322</citedDecision> , is constitutional in stature and therefore unalterable by Congress.  It is true that there are statements in the cases that point toward just this conclusion.  See, e. g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984) ("In short, the principle of sovereign immunity is a constitutional limitation on the federal judicial power established in Art. III"); Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 497 (1921) ("[T]he entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given .  .  . ").  These statements, however, are dicta in the classic sense, that is, sheer speculation about what would happen in cases not before the court. [20] But this *126 is not the only weakness of these statements, which are counterbalanced by many other opinions that have either stated the immunity principle without more, see, e. g., Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 229, n. 2 (1989) (noting that "an unconsenting State is immune from liability for damages in a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens," without suggesting that the immunity was unalterable by Congress), [21] or have suggested that the Hans immunity is not of constitutional stature.  The very language quoted by the majority from Monaco, for example, likens state sovereign immunity to other "essential postulates" such as the rules of justiciability.  <citedDecision>292 U. S., at 322</citedDecision> .  Many of those rules, as Justice Stevens points out, are prudential in nature and therefore not unalterable by Congress.  See ante, at 88-90.  [22] More generally, the proponents of the Court's theory have repeatedly referred to state sovereign immunity as a "background principle," ante, at 72, "postulate," Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 437 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), or "implicit limitation," Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468, 496 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and as resting on the "inherent nature of sovereignty," Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), rather than any explicit constitutional *127 provision.  [23] But whatever set of quotations one may prefer, taking heed of such jurisprudential creations in assessing the contents of federal common law is a very different thing from reading them into the Founding Document itself.  The most damning evidence for the Court's theory that Hans rests on a broad rationale of immunity unalterable by Congress, however, is the Court's proven tendency to disregard the post- Hans dicta in cases where that dicta would have mattered.  [24] If it is indeed true that "private suits against States [are] not permitted under Article III (by virtue of the understanding represented by the Eleventh Amendment)," Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 40 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), then it is hard to see how a State's sovereign immunity may be waived any more than it may be abrogated by Congress.
**Combined Opinion**
 I rely on no such "gossamer distinction" here.  Congress has the authority to withdraw sovereign immunity in cases not covered by the Eleventh Amendment under all of its various powers.  Nothing in Hans is to the contrary.  As the passage quoted above demonstrates, Hans merely concluded that Congress, in enacting the Judiciary Act of 1875, did not manifest a desire to withdraw state sovereign immunity with sufficient clarity to overcome the countervailing presumption.  Therefore, I rely only on the distinction between a statute that clearly directs federal courts to entertain suits against States, such as the one before us here, and a statute that does not, such as the Judiciary Act of 1875.  In light of our repeated application of a clear-statement rule in Eleventh Amendment cases, from Hans onward, I would be surprised to learn that such a distinction is too thin to be acceptable.  [11]  Indeed, to the extent the reasoning of Monaco was premised on the ground that a contrary ruling might permit foreign governments and States indirectly to frustrate Congress' treaty power, <citedDecision>292 U. S., at 331</citedDecision> , the opinion suggests that its outcome would have been quite different had Congress expressly authorized suits by foreign governments against individual States as part of its administration of foreign policy.  [12]  Moreover, they would have most unnecessarily burdened Congress.  For example, after deciding that Congress had not made sufficiently explicit its intention to withdraw the state sovereign immunity defense in certain bankruptcy actions, see Hoffman v. Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, 392 U. S. 96 (1989), Congress understandably concluded that it could correct the confusion by amending the relevant statute to make its intentions to override such a defense unmistakably clear.  See In re Merchants Grain, Inc., 59 F. 3d 630 (CA7 1995).  Congress will no doubt be surprised to learn that its exercise in legislative clarification, which it undertook for our benefit, was for naught because the Constitution makes it so. [13]  Significantly, Chief Justice Marshall understood the Eleventh Amendment's bar to have been designed primarily to protect States from being sued for their debts.  See Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 406 (1821).  [14]  Significantly, many of the cases decided after Hans in which this Court has recognized state sovereign immunity involved claims premised on the breach of rights that were rooted in state law. See Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury of Ind., 323 U. S. 459 (1945); Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47 (1944); Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436 (1900).  In such cases, the Court's application of the state-law immunity appears simply to foreshadow (or follow) the rule of Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64 (1938), not to demark the limits of Article III. [15]  It is significant that Justice Souter's opinion makes it perfectly clear that Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and he did not consider it necessary to rely on the holding in Union Gas to support their conclusion.  I find today's decision particularly unfortunate because of its failure to advance an acceptable reason for refusing to adhere to a precedent upon which the Congress, as well as the courts, should be entitled to rely.  [16]  See Stevens, Is Justice Irrelevant?, 87 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1121 , 11241125 (1993).  [17]  Interestingly, this passage demonstrates that the Court's application of a common-law sovereign immunity defense in Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 313</citedDecision> (1934), was quite probably justified.  There a foreign state sued a State as a substantial creditor, and thus implicated the very purpose of the Eleventh Amendment.  [18]  Because Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), was the first case in which the Court held that a State could not be sued in federal court by one of its citizens, this comment is of interest: "It is not necessary that we should enter upon an examination of the reason or the expediency of the rule which exempts a sovereign State from prosecution in a court of justice at the suit of individuals.  This is fully discussed by writers on public law. It is enough for us to declare its existence." Id., at 21 .  So it is today.  [1]  The two Citizen-State Diversity Clauses provide as follows: "The judicial Power shall extend .

" Jaffe,77 Harv. L. Rev., at 4 (quoting L. Ehrlich, Proceedings Against the Crown (1216-1377), p. 42, in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History (P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921), p. 42); see also 1 Blackstone, supra, at *246 (interpreting the maxim to mean that "the prerogative of the crown extends not to do any injury").  In any event, it is clear that the idea of the sovereign, or any part of it, being above the law in this sense has not survived in American law. See, e. g., Langford v. United States, 101 U. S. 341, 342-343 (1880); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 415 (1979).  [3]  The text reads that "[t]he Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls;to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;to Controversies between two or more States;between a State and Citizens of another State;between Citizens of different States,between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects." [4]  The one statement I have found on the subject of States' immunity in federal-question cases was an opinion that immunity would not be applicable in these cases: James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania ratification debate, stated that the federal-question clause would require States to make good on pre-Revolutionary debt owed to English merchants (the enforcement of which was promised in the Treaty of 1783) and thereby "show the world that we make the faith of treaties a constitutional part of the character of the United States; that we secure its performance no longer nominally, for the judges of the United States will be enabled to carry it into effect, let the legislatures of the different states do what they may." 2 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 490 (2d ed. 1836) (Elliot's Debates).  [5]  This lengthy discussion of the history of the Constitution's ratification, the Court's opinion in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), and the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment is necessary to explain why, in my view, the contentions in some of our earlier opinions that Chisholm created a great "shock of surprise" misread the history.  See Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 313</citedDecision> (1934).  The Court's response to this historical analysis is simply to recite yet again Monaco `s erroneous assertion that Chisholm created "such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted," <citedDecision>292 U. S., at 325</citedDecision> .  See ante, at 69.  This response is, with respect, no response at all. Monaco `s ipse dixit that Chisholm created a "shock of surprise" does not make it so. This Court's opinions frequently make assertions of historical fact, but those assertions are not authoritative as to history in the same way that our interpretations of laws are authoritative as to them.  In Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U. S. 424, 434 (1902), which was, like Monaco, decided a century after the event it purported to recount, the Court baldly stated that "in September 1790, General Washington, on the advice of Mr. Adams, did refuse to permit British troops to march through the territory of the United States from Detroit to the Mississippi, apparently for the reason that the object of such movement was an attack on New Orleans and the Spanish possessions on the Mississippi." Modern historians agree, however, that there was no such request, see J. Daly, The Use of History in the Decisions of the Supreme Court: 1900-1930, pp. 65-66 (1954); W. Manning, The Nootka Sound Controversy, in Annual Report of the American Historical Association, H. R. Doc. No. 429, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 415-423 (1905), and it would of course be absurd for this Court to treat the fact that Tucker asserted the existence of the request as proof that it actually occurred.  Cf. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 72-73 (1938) ("But it was the more recent research of a competent scholar, who examined the original document, which established that the construction given to [the Judiciary Act of 1789] by the Court was erroneous; and that the purpose of the section was merely to make certain that, in all matters except those in which some federal law is controlling, the federal courts exercising jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship cases would apply as their rules of decision the law of the State, unwritten as well as written").  Moreover, in this case, there is ample evidence contradicting the "shock of surprise" thesis.
