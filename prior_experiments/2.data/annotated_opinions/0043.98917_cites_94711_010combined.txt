**Combined Opinion**
It is to the claims of every patent, therefore, that we must turn when we are seeking to determine what the invention is, the exclusive use of which is given to the inventor by the grant provided for by the statute, ย "He can claim nothing beyond them." Keystone Bridge Co. v. Phoenix Iron Co., 95 U.S. 274 ; Railroad Co. v. Mellon, 104 U.S. 112 , 118; Yale Lock Mfg. Co. v. Greenleaf, 117 U.S. 554 , 559; McClain v. Ortmayer, 141 U.S. 419 , 424. 2nd. It has long been settled that the patentee receives nothing from the law which he did not have before, and that the only effect of his patent is to restrain others from manufacturing, using or selling that which he has invented. The patent law simply protects him in the monopoly of that which he has invented and has described in the claims of his patent. United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., <targetCase>167 U.S. 224</targetCase> , 239; Paper Bag Patent Case, 210 U.S. 405 , 424; Bauer v. O'Donnell, 229 U.S. 1 , 10. 3rd. Since Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1 , was decided in *511 1829 this court has consistently held that the primary purpose of our patent laws is not the creation of private fortunes for the owners of patents but is "to promote the progress of science and useful arts" (Constitution, Art. I, ยง 8), an object and purpose authoritatively expressed by Mr. Justice Story, in that decision, saying: "While one great object [of our patent laws] was, by holding out a reasonable reward to inventors, and giving them an exclusive right to their inventions for a limited period, to stimulate the efforts of genius; the main object was `to promote the progress of science and useful arts.'" Thirty years later this court, returning to the subject, in Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322 , again pointedly and significantly says: "It is undeniably true, that the limited and temporary monopoly granted to inventors was never designed for their exclusive profit or advantage; the benefit to the public or community at large was another and doubtless the primary object in granting and securing that monopoly."
