**Lead Opinion**
 She is obliged either to heed the statutory discrimination, thereby incurring a direct economic injury through the constriction of her buyers’ market, or to disobey the statutory command and suffer, in the words of Oklahoma’s Assistant Attorney General, “sanctions and perhaps loss of license.” Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.  This Court repeatedly has recognized that such injuries establish the threshold requirements of a “case or controversy” mandated by Art. III. See, e. g., Singleton v. Wulff, supra, at 113 (doctors who receive payments for their abortion services are “classically adverse” to government as payer); Sullivan v. Little Hunting *195 Park, 396 U. S. 229, 237 (1969); Barrows v. Jackson, supra, at 255-256 .  As a vendor with standing to challenge the lawfulness of § § 241 and 245, appellant Whitener is entitled to assert those concomitant rights of third parties that would be “diluted or adversely affected” should her constitutional challenge fail and the statutes remain in force.  Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 481 (1965); see Note, Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 423 , 432 (1974).  Otherwise, the threatened imposition of governmental sanctions might deter appellant Whitener and other similarly situated vendors from selling 3.2% beer to young males, thereby ensuring that “enforcement of the challenged restriction against the [vendor] would result indirectly in the violation of third parties' rights.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490, 510 (1975).  Accordingly, vendors and those in like positions have been uniformly permitted to resist efforts at restricting their operations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function.  See, e. g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, <citedDecision>405 U. S. 438</citedDecision> (1972); Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, supra; Barrows v. Jackson, supra. 4 *196 Indeed, the jus tertii question raised here is answered by our disposition of a like argument in Eisenstadt v. <citedDecision>Baird, supra.</citedDecision> There, as here, a state statute imposed legal duties and disabilities upon the claimant, who was convicted of distributing a package of contraceptive foam to a third party.  5 Since the statute was directed at Baird and penalized his conduct, the Court did not hesitate — again as here — to conclude that the “case or controversy” requirement of Art. Ill was satisfied.  405 U. S., at 443.  In considering Baird’s constitutional objections, the Court fully recognized his standing to defend the privacy interests of third parties.  Deemed crucial to the decision to permit jus tertii standing was the recognition of “the impact of the litigation on the third-party interests.” Id., at 445.  Just as the defeat of Baird’s suit and the “[enforcement of the Massachusetts statute will materially impair the ability of single persons to obtain contraceptives,” id., at 446, so too the failure of Whitener to prevail in this suit and the continued enforcement of §§ 241 and 245 will “materially impair the ability of” males 18-20 years of age to purchase 3.2% beer despite their classification by an overt gender-based criterion.  Similarly, just as the Massachusetts law in Eisenstadt “prohibit[ed], *197 not use, but distribution,” 405 U. S., at 446, and consequently the least awkward challenger was one in Baird’s position who was subject to that proscription, the law challenged here explicitly regulates the sale rather than use of 3.2% beer, thus leaving a vendor as the obvious claimant.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Powell, concurring. I join the opinion of the Court as I am in general agreement with it. I do have reservations as to some of the discussion concerning the appropriate standard for equal protection analysis and the relevance of the statistical evidence. Accordingly, I add this concurring statement. With respect to the equal protection standard, I agree that Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), is the most relevant precedent. But I find it unnecessary, in deciding this case, to read that decision as broadly as some of the Court’s language may imply. Reed and subsequent cases involving gender-based classifications make clear that the Court subjects such classifications to a more critical examination than is normally applied when “fundamental” constitutional rights and “suspect classes” are not present. * *211 I view this as a relatively easy case. No one questions the legitimacy or importance of the asserted governmental objective: the promotion of highway safety. The decision of the case turns on whether the state legislature, by the classification it has chosen, has adopted a means that bears a “ 'fair and substantial relation' ” to this objective. Id., at 76 , quoting Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, 253 U. S. 412, 415 (1920). It seems to me that the statistics offered by appellees and relied upon by the District Court do tend generally to support the view that young men drive more, possibly are inclined to drink more, and — for various reasons — are involved in more accidents than young women. Even so, I am not persuaded that these facts and the inferences fairly drawn from them justify this classification based on a three-year age differential between the sexes, and especially one that is so easily circumvented as to be virtually meaningless. Putting it differently, this gender-based classification does not bear a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation. As is evident from our opinions, the Court has had difficulty in agreeing upon a standard of equal protection analysis that can be applied consistently to the wide variety of legislative classifications. There are valid reasons for dissatisfaction with the “two-tier” approach that has been prominent in the Court’s decisions in the past decade. Although viewed by many as a result-oriented substitute for more critical analysis, that *211 approach — with its narrowly limited “upper-tier” — now has substantial precedential support. As has been true of Reed and its progeny, our decision today will be viewed by some as a “middle-tier” approach. While I would not endorse that characterization and would not welcome a further subdividing of equal protection analysis, candor compels the recognition that the relatively deferential “rational basis” standard of review normally applied takes on a sharper focus when we address a gender-based classification. So much is clear from our recent cases. For thoughtful discussions of equal protection analysis, see, e. g., Gunther, The Supreme Court, 1971 Term — Foreword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for A Newer Equal Protection, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 1 (1972); Wilkinson, The Supreme Court, the Equal Protection Clause, and the Three Faces of Constitutional Equality, 61 Va. L. Rev. 945 (1975).
**Dissenting Opinion**
 At the outset I cannot agree that appellant Whitener has standing arising from her status as a saloonkeeper to assert the constitutional rights of her customers.  In this Court “a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities.” United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 22 (1960).  There are a few, but strictly limited exceptions to that rule; despite the most creative efforts, this case fits within none of them.  *216 This is not Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U. S. 229 (1969), or Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249 (1953), for there is here no barrier whatever to Oklahoma males 18-20 years of age asserting, in an appropriate forum, any constitutional rights they may claim to purchase 3.2% beer.  Craig’s successful litigation of this very issue was prevented only by the advent of his 21st birthday.  There is thus no danger of interminable dilution of those rights if appellant Whitener is not permitted to litigate them here.  Cf. Eisenstadt v. Baird, <citedDecision>405 U. S. 438, 445-446</citedDecision> (1972).  Nor is this controlled by Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479 (1965).  It borders on the ludicrous to draw a parallel between a vendor of beer and the intimate professional physician-patient relationship which undergirded relaxation of standing rules in that case. Even in <citedDecision>Eisenstadt</citedDecision> , the Court carefully limited its recognition of third-party standing to cases in which the relationship between the claimant and the relevant third party “was not simply the fortuitous connection between a vendor and potential vendees, but the relationship between one who acted to protect the rights of a minority and the minority itself.” <citedDecision>405 U. S., at 445</citedDecision> .  This is plainly not the case here.  See also McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U. S. 420, 429-430 (1961); Brown v. United States, 411 U. S. 223, 230 (1973).  In sum, permitting a vendor to assert the constitutional rights of vendees whenever those rights are arguably infringed introduces a new concept of constitutional standing to which I cannot subscribe.  On the merits, we have only recently recognized that our duty is not “to create substantive constitutional rights in the name of guaranteeing equal protection of the laws.” San Antonio School Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U. S. 1, 33 (1973).  Thus, even interests of such importance in our society as public education and housing do not qualify as “fundamental rights” for equal protection purposes because they have no *217 textually independent constitutional status.  See id., at 29-39 (education); Lindsey v. Normet, 405 U. S. 56 (1972) (bousing).
**Combined Opinion**
 This Court repeatedly has recognized that such injuries establish the threshold requirements of a "case or controversy" mandated by Art. III. See, e. g., Singleton v. Wulff, supra, at 113 (doctors who receive payments for their abortion services are "classically adverse" to government as payer); Sullivan v. Little Hunting *195 Park, 396 U. S. 229, 237 (1969); Barrows v. Jackson, supra, at 255-256 .  As a vendor with standing to challenge the lawfulness of §§ 241 and 245, appellant Whitener is entitled to assert those concomitant rights of third parties that would be "diluted or adversely affected" should her constitutional challenge fail and the statutes remain in force.  Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 481 (1965); see Note, Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 423 , 432 (1974).  Otherwise, the threatened imposition of governmental sanctions might deter appellant Whitener and other similarly situated vendors from selling 3.2% beer to young males, thereby ensuring that "enforcement of the challenged restriction against the [vendor] would result indirectly in the violation of third parties' rights."

[4] *196 Indeed, the jus tertii question raised here is answered by our disposition of a like argument in <citedDecision>Eisenstadt</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Baird, supra</citedDecision> .  There, as here, a state statute imposed legal duties and disabilities upon the claimant, who was convicted of distributing a package of contraceptive foam to a third party.  [5] Since the statute was directed at Baird and penalized his conduct, the Court did not hesitateagain as hereto conclude that the "case or controversy" requirement of Art.

S., at 446, and consequently the least awkward challenger was one in Baird's position who was subject to that proscription, the law challenged here explicitly regulates the sale rather than use of 3.2% beer, thus leaving a vendor as the obvious claimant.  We therefore hold that Whitener has standing to raise relevant equal protection challenges to Oklahoma's gender-based law. We now consider those arguments.  II A Before 1972, Oklahoma defined the commencement of civil majority at age 18 for females and age 21 for males.  Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, § 13 (1972 and Supp. 1976).  In contrast, females were held criminally responsible as adults at age 18 and males at age 16.  Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, § 1101 (a) (Supp. 1976).  After the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held in 1972, on the authority of Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), that the age distinction was unconstitutional for purposes of establishing criminal responsibility as adults, Lamb v. Brown, 456 F. 2d 18 , the Oklahoma Legislature fixed age 18 as applicable to both males and females.
**Combined Opinion**
 But even assuming some such slight benefit, it does not seem to me that an insult to all of the young men of the State can be justified by visiting the sins of the 2% on the 98%.  MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in part.  I join the Court's opinion except Part II-D thereof.  I agree, however, that the Twenty-first Amendment does not save the challenged Oklahoma statute.  MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring in the judgment.  I agree that the appellant Whitener has standing to assert the equal protection claims of males between 18 and 21 years old.  Eisenstadt v. Baird, <citedDecision>405 U. S. 438, 443-446</citedDecision> ; Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 481 ; Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249, 255-260 ; Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 72-73 ; see Note, Standing To Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 423 , 431-436 (1974).  I also concur in the Court's judgment on the merits of the constitutional issue before us.  *215 Every State has broad power under the Twenty-first Amendment to control the dispensation of alcoholic beverages within its borders.  E. g., California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109 ; Joseph E. Seagram & Sons v. Hostetter, 384 U. S. 35 ; Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp., 377 U. S. 324, 330 ; Mahoney v. Joseph Triner Corp., 304 U. S. 401 ; State Board v. Young's Market Co., 299 U. S. 59 .  But "[t]his is not to say that the Twenty-first Amendment empowers a State to act with total irrationality or invidious discrimination in controlling the distribution and dispensation of liquor .  .  .

 In this Court "a litigant may only assert his own constitutional rights or immunities." United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 22 (1960).  There are a few, but strictly limited exceptions to that rule; despite the most creative efforts, this case fits within none of them.  *216 This is not Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.

**Combined Opinion**
Id., at 1306 n. 1.  [4]  The standing question presented here is not answered by the principle stated in United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 21 (1960), that "one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional." In Raines , the Court refused to permit certain public officials of Georgia to defend against application of the Civil Rights Act to their official conduct on the ground that the statute also might be construed to encompass the "purely private actions" of others.  The Raines rule remains germane in such a setting, where the interests of the litigant and the rights of the proposed third parties are in no way mutually interdependent.  Thus, a successful suit against Raines did not threaten to impair or diminish the independent private rights of others, and consequently, consideration of those third-party rights properly was deferred until another day. Of course, the Raines principle has also been relaxed where legal action against the claimant threatens to "chill" the First Amendment rights of third parties.  See, e. g., Lewis v. New Orleans, 415 U. S. 130 (1974).  [5]  The fact that Baird chose to disobey the legal duty imposed upon him by the Massachusetts anticontraception statute, resulting in his criminal conviction, 405 U. S., at 440, does not distinguish the standing inquiry from that pertaining to the anticipatory attack in this case. In both <citedDecision>Eisenstadt</citedDecision> and here, the challenged statutes compel jus tertii claimants either to cease their proscribed activities or to suffer appropriate sanctions.  The existence of Art. III "injury in fact" and the structure of the claimant's relationship to the third parties are not altered by the litigative posture of the suit.  And, certainly, no suggestion will be heard that Whitener's anticipatory challenge offends the normal requirements governing such actions.  See generally Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452 (1974); Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66 (1971); Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971).  [6] Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498 (1975), upholding the use of gender-based classifications, rested upon the Court's perception of the laudatory purposes of those laws as remedying disadvantageous conditions suffered by women in economic and military life. See 416 U. S., at 353-354; 419 U. S., at 508.  Needless to say, in this case Oklahoma does not suggest that the age-sex differential was enacted to ensure the availability of 3.2% beer for women as compensation for previous deprivations.  [7]  That this was the true purpose is not at all self-evident.
