**Combined Opinion**
MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER delivered the opinion of the Court. These cases raise the same question, namely, whether transfers of property inter vivos made in trust, the particulars of which will later appear, are within the provisions of § 302 (c) of the Revenue Act of 1926. [1] They *110 were heard in succession and may be decided together. In each case the Commissioner of Internal Revenue included the trust property in the decedent's gross estate. In Nos. 110, 111 and 112 his determination was reversed by the Board of Tax Appeals, 34 B.T.A. 575 , and the Board was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, <targetCase>102 F.2d 1</targetCase> . In No. 183, the taxpayer paid under protest, successfully sued for recovery in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and his judgment was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 103 F.2d 834 . In No. 399, the Commissioner was in part successful before the Board of Tax Appeals, 36 B.T.A. 669 , and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the Board, 104 F.2d 1011 . Neither here nor below does the issue turn on the unglossed text of § 302 (c).

deliver forthwith to Party of the First Part, the principal of the said trust fund. If and in the event said Party of the First Part shall not be living then and in such event payment and delivery over shall be made to Levitt Hallock and Helen Hallock, respectively son and daughter of the Party of the First Part share and share alike . . ." When the settlor died in 1932, his divorced wife, the life beneficiary, survived him. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the trust instrument had conveyed the "whole interest" of the decedent, subject only to a "condition subsequent," which left him nothing "except a mere possibility of reverter." Commissioner v. Hallock, <targetCase>102 F.2d 1</targetCase> , 3-4. In No. 183 ( Rothensies v. Huston ) the decedent by an ante-nuptial agreement in 1925 conveyed property in trust, the income to be paid to his prospective wife during her life, subject to the following disposition of the principal: "In trust if the said Rae Spektor shall die during the lifetime of said George F. Uber to pay over the principal and all accumulated income thereof unto the said George F. Uber in fee, free and clear of any trust. *116 "In trust if the said Rae Spektor after the marriage shall survive the said George F. Uber to pay over the principal and all accumulated income unto the said Rae Spektor  then Rae Uber  in fee, free and clear of any trust." Mrs. Uber outlived her husband, who died in 1934. The Circuit Court of Appeals deemed Becker v. St. Louis Trust Co. controlling against the inclusion of the trust corpus in the gross estate. Finally, in No.

Any transfer of a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to his death without such consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title."

In both of these cases limitations which would probably have been "contingent" at "common law" were held to be "vested" under the New York statutory rule. Cf. <targetCase>Commissioner</targetCase> v.
