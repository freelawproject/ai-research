We offer this at the risk of some' repetition.</p>
<p id="b1079-5">FACTS</p>
<p id="b1079-6">By 1962, Sylvania’s share of the television market had déclined to approximately one or two percent. It then changed its methods in an effort to obtain a larger share of the market. Under its new policy, Sylvania abandoned distribution through wholesalers and decided to sell only to selected retailers who would promote the Sylvania brand. It is undisputed that title to the television sets passed to these retailers. This plan, by limiting the number of franchises in a given area, would reduce intrabrand competition among retailers and serve as an incentive to carry and promote its product. Sylvania called this the “elbow room policy” and believed that these methods would allow it to improve its competitive position. In fact, under this new policy, it increased its market share to 5% in 1965, and, so it claims, this increase permitted it to remain in the market. Sylvania neither restricted franchised retailers from carrying other brands, nor did it require retailers to sell only to customers who lived within a particular territory. However, it did enforce location restrictions on its retailers and prohibited them from reselling its television sets from unauthorized locations.</p>
<p id="b1079-9">Continental, one of Sylvania’s largest retailers, is composed of a chain of retail stores. In 1965, it opened a new store in Sacramento, shipped sets from another store, and offered them for sale in that city in September, 1965. Sylvania concedes that it had an agreement with Continental under which it was prohibited from moving Sylvania brand merchandise to an unapproved location for resale, without Sylvania’s prior approval. Sylvania refused to franchise the new store and, beyond question, hampered Continental’s resale efforts in Sacramento. In this case, it is clear that Sylvania’s purpose was to prevent more retail intrabrand competition in Sacramento, where most of its sales were by one important retailer.</p>
<p id="b1079-10">As an outgrowth of this dispute, Sylvania set in motion a series of maneuvers which seriously affected Continental’s ability to resell Sylvania’s television sets. To that time, Continental’s credit limitation with Sylvania had been $300,000.00 On September 16th, the credit limit was reduced to $50,000.00, at which time Sylvania cancelled pending orders and severed other friendly ties with Continental. About the same time, Sylvania demanded payment of accounts receivable, which had not been its practice in the past. The following October <page-number citation-index="1" label="1006">*1006</page-number>13th, it cancelled Continental’s franchise. On the same day, the company through which Sylvania previously extended credit to Continental sued the latter to collect accounts which were allegedly due. Sylvania then accelerated the collection of the remaining indebtedness, repossessed all of Continental’s Sylvania sets, attached its bank accounts and caused its main store and warehouse to be locked and closed. At about the same time, Sylvania notified Phil-co, another major supplier of Continental, of what it was doing.</p>
<p id="b1080-4">Sylvania claims it acted for reasons unrelated to its locations policy and not in retaliation. However, it is manifest that some or all of these actions had something to do with the enforcement of the agreement to restrict locations. This follows since the jury was instructed:</p>
<blockquote id="b1080-5">“Therefore, if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that Sylvania entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy with one or more of its dealers pursuant to which Sylvania exercised dominion or control over the products sold to the dealer, <em>after having parted with title and risk to the products, </em>you must find any effort thereafter to restrict outlets or store locations from which its dealers resold the merchandise which they had purchased from Sylvania to be a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, <em>regardless of the reasonableness of the location restrictions.” </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
<p id="b1080-6">On the basis of the evidence and the quoted instruction, the jury answered the following special interrogatory in the affirmative.</p>
<blockquote id="b1080-7">“Did Sylvania Electric Products, Inc., engage in a contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the antitrust laws with respect to location restrictions alone?”</blockquote>
<p id="b1080-11">There is no way of pinpointing the percentage of Sylvania’s subsequent behavior that the jury attributed to enforcement efforts. However, it is obvious the jury concluded that Sylvania attempted to and did restrict Continental’s business location pursuant to a contract, combination, or conspiracy in violation of the Sherman Act and to the damage of Continental.</p>
<p id="b1080-12">Despite what is said on page one of the majority opinion, the district judge <em>did not </em>instruct the jury that Sylvania’s practice of fixing by agreement the locations from which Continental was authorized to sell Sylvania products was illegal <em>per se </em>under § 1 of the Sherman Act. To the contrary, it is clear that the district judge presented to the jury the issue of whether Sylvania entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy with one or more of its dealers pursuant to which it exercised dominion and control over the product sold to the dealer after having parted with title and risk to the products, to restrict the territories in which the dealers may resell the merchandise.</p>
<p id="b1080-13">The paragraph from the instructions quoted above is relied upon by the majority as a statement to the jury that location clauses are <em>per se </em>illegal. This is one of several interrelated paragraphs in the instructions dealing with the subject of territorial or customer restrictions. Standing alone, this paragraph requires proof both of a contract, combination, or conspiracy, and of an exercise of control by Sylvania after title and risk has passed to the dealers. This and related paragraphs read together also clearly informed the jury that Sylvania would be liable only if it exercised its control to restrict the territories in which the dealers resold.<footnotemark>1a</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b1081-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="1007">*1007</page-number>Counsel for both Sylvania and Continental so understood the instructions. In closing arguments Continental’s counsel told the jury that Sylvania had committed a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sherman Act if Sylvania by conspiracy had imposed territorial or price maintenance restrictions on the resale of products purchased from Sylvania.<footnotemark>1b</footnotemark> Sylvania’s counsel agreed, telling the jury that it was only required to decide whether Sylvania had fixed prices or controlled territories, which would be unlawful, or had franchised by location, which would be lawful.<footnotemark>1c</footnotemark></p>

<p id="b1082-4">DISCUSSION</p>
<p id="b1082-5">I.</p>
<p id="b1082-6">Nowhere in its elaborate opinion does the majority come to grips with the fundamental tenet of antitrust law established in <em>Schwinn. </em>The <em>Schwinn </em>Court made it absolutely clear that once a manufacturer has lost all control over the property, parting with title and risk, thereafter any effort on its part to restrict territory or persons to whom the property may be sold, whether by contract or by silent combination or understanding with the vendee, is a <em>per se </em>violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The language of the <em>Schwinn </em>Court in stating the issue is of importance:</p>
<blockquote id="b1082-7">“We are here concerned with a truly vertical arrangement, raising the fundamental question of the degree to which a manufacturer may not only select the customers to whom he will sell, but also, allocate territories for resale and confine access to his product to selected, or franchised retailers. <em>We conclude that the proper application of § 1 of the Sherman Act to this problem requires differentiation between the situation where the manufacturer parts with title, dominion, or risk with respect to the article, and where he completely retains ownership and risk of loss.” </em><span class="citation" data-id="107491"><a href="/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/#378" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">388 U.S. at 378</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="107491"><a href="/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/#1865" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">18 L.Ed.2d at 1260</a></span>. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
<p id="b1082-8">Here, it is conceded that Sylvania parted with title to, dominion over, and risk in connection with the television sets.</p>
<p id="b1082-9">Speaking to the same subject, the <em>Schwinn </em>Court said:</p>
<blockquote id="b1082-10">“Under the Sherman Act, it is unreasonable without more for a manufacturer to seek to restrict and confine areas or persons with whom an article may be traded after the manufacturer has parted with dominion over it. Such restraints are so obviously destructive of competition that their mere existence is enough. <em>If the manufacturer parts with dominion over his product or transfers risk of loss to another, he may not reserve control over its destiny or the conditions of its resale.” Id. </em>at 379, <span class="citation" data-id="107491"><a href="/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/#1865" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">87 S.Ct. at 1865</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="107491"><a href="/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/#1260" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">18 L.Ed.2d at 1260</a></span>. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
<p id="b1082-13">At this point, the Court emphasized that it was not prepared to adopt a <em>per se </em>rule which would prohibit vertical restrictions of territory and all franchising in instances where the <em>manufacturer retained ownership of the goods </em>saying that such a rule might severely hamper small enterprises resorting to reasonable methods of meeting the competition of giants and of merchandising through independent dealers. After this observation, the Court went on to say:</p>
<blockquote id="AqP">“But to allow this freedom where the manufacturer has parted with dominion over the goods — the usual marketing sit<em>uation </em>— would <em>violate the ancient rule against restraints on alienation and open the door to exclusivity of outlets and limitation of territory further than prudence permits.” Id. </em>at 380, <span class="citation" data-id="107491"><a href="/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/#1866" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">87 S.Ct. at 1866</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="107491"><a href="/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/#1261" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">18 L.Ed.2d at 1261</a></span>. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
<p id="b1082-14">Further emphasizing its ban against restraint on alienation of a product once full title had passed, the Court said:</p>
<blockquote id="b1082-15"><em>“Where the manufacturer retains title, dominion, and risk </em>with respect to the product and the position and function of the dealer in question are, in fact, indistinguishable from those of an agent or salesman of the manufacturer, it is only if the impact of the confinement is ‘unreasonably’ restrictive of competition that a violation of § 1 results from such confinements unencumbered by culpable price fixing.” <em>Id. </em>at 380, <span class="citation" data-id="107491"><a href="/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/#1866" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">18 L.Ed.2d at 1261</a></span>. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
<p id="ANeP">It is only in these limited circumstances that the “rule of reason”, so strongly urged by the majority, should be applied.</p>
<p id="b1082-16">The majority suggests “that vertically imposed customer restrictions only” were involved in <em>Schwinn </em>and that the Court’s <page-number citation-index="1" label="1009">*1009</page-number>statements with reference to territorial limitations were dicta. It is clear that the majority in <em>Schwinn </em>thought otherwise. We quote:</p>
<blockquote id="b1083-4">“We come, then, to the legal issues in this case. We are here confronted with challenged <em>vertical restrictions as to territory and dealers. </em>The source of the restrictions is the manufacturer.” <span class="citation" data-id="107491"><a href="/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/#372" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co."><em>Id. </em>at 372</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="107491"><a href="/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/#1862" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">18 L.Ed.2d at 1256</a></span>. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
<p id="b1083-5">Some earlier Supreme Court decisions did not attach a rule of <em>per se </em>illegality to restraints on alienation in the antitrust context. The <em>Schwinn </em>Court has radically changed this position. Again speaking to the prohibition against restraint on alienation in a vertical relationship, the Supreme Court said at page 382, 87 S.Ct. at page 1867, 18 L.Ed.2d at page 1262.</p>
<blockquote id="b1083-6"><em>“Once the manufacturer has parted with title and risk, he has parted with dominion over the product, and his effort thereafter to restrict territory or persons to whom the product may be </em>transferred— <em>whether by explicit agreement or by silent combination or understanding with his vendee </em>— is <em>a per se violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act.” </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
<p id="b1083-7">To further clarify the breadth of the <em>Schwinn </em>decision, we quote from page 378, 87 S.Ct. from page 1865, 18 L.Ed.2d from page 1259:</p>
<blockquote id="b1083-8">“[U]pon remand, the decree should be revised <em>to enjoin any limitation upon the freedom of distributors to dispose of the Schwinn products, which they have bought from Schwinn, where and to whomever they choose. The principle is, of course, equally applicable to sales to retailers, and </em>the decree should similarly enjoin the making of any sales to retailers upon any condition, agreement or understanding <em>limiting the retailer’s freedom as to where and to whom it will resell the products.” </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
<p id="b1083-9">The <em>Schwinn </em>Court assumed jurisdiction and not only spoke on the subject of territorial and personal restraints against alienation, but issued a directive to the district court on the type of injunctive restraints to be placed upon <em>Schwinn.</em></p>
<p id="b1083-12">From the foregoing, we can arrive at no conclusion other than that any type of restraint on alienation by a manufacturer over a distributor <em>or a retailer, </em>be it territorial or personal, after title and dominion have passed, is a <em>per se </em>violation of the Act.</p>
<p id="b1083-13">II.</p>
<p id="b1083-14">The majority urges that the rule of <em>per se </em>illegality established in <em>Schwinn </em>should not be applied to a location restriction as utilized by Sylvania. It is forcefully argued that the location clauses here involved should be judged under what is commonly referred to as the “rule of reason,” rather than a rule of <em>per se </em>illegality. As we see it, the majority’s “critical and very obvious distinctions” between the restrictions in <em>Schwinn </em>and those of Sylvania are insignificant. The district court in the present case did not extend <em>Schwinn </em>to location clauses by “applying a bit of the literal language of <em>Schwinn </em>without reference to its context or the specific facts of that case. . . . ” The court simply took the holding of <em>Schwinn </em>at face value and applied it to a set of facts which it logically encompasses.</p>
<p id="b1083-16">It is argued that in <em>Schwinn </em>a wholesaler-distributor was foreclosed from selling Schwinn products to any purchaser located outside his <em>exclusive territory </em>and it is thus distinguishable. But, essentially the same thing can be said of the retailer in <em>Sylvania. Schwinn </em>defined the territorial boundaries within which each distributor could resell. Sylvania specified the precise location from which its retailer could resell. The Schwinn distributor was prohibited from selling beyond the boundaries of his territory. The Sylvania retailer is prohibited from reselling from any location not designated by the manufacturer. Schwinn had a territorial line fixed geographically. Sylvania has a territorial line fixed by the economic limitations upon an effective marketing area. While it is true that the Sylvania territorial line may not be as clearly defined as that in <em>Schwinn, </em>the overall territorial restriction upon competition is just as effective.</p>
<p id="b1084-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="1010">*1010</page-number>The majority’s contention that <em>Schwinn </em>should not be applied in this case because Sylvania imposed neither territorial nor customer restrictions is impossible to reconcile with the jury verdict and the district court’s findings of fact, which establish that the location clause operated as a territorial restraint. In its findings of fact, the district court quoted the Sylvania sales manual as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b1084-4">The manual states, inter alia, that the “franchise contains a good profitable selling climate by creating ‘elbow room’ in a sensible territory based on market and dealer potential. ‘Same brand’ competition is eliminated.”</blockquote>
<p id="b1084-5">The district court found that “[a]lthough retail sales of Sylvania brand merchandise could be made to anyone, the sales could be made only from the store location approved by Sylvania. ... By reason of the inherent limitations respecting advertising and promotion and delivery and service of sets sold, the territory of a retail dealer for sales was, for all practical purposes, limited to a radius of 25-50 miles from a dealer’s store location.”<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It may be true in theory that, as the majority argues, “Sylvania’s dealers could sell to customers from any area.” But since none of Continental’s dealers were located within 50 miles of Sacramento, as a practical matter Continental could not sell televisions in that city. The district court further found that the conspiracy between Sylvania and Handy Andy, Sylvania’s principal Sacramento distributor, “resulted in the number of Sylvania franchises in Sacramento being reduced from seven in 1963 to three in 1965 with Handy Andy selling all of the Sylvania color TV sets sold in Sacramento and 80 percent of the black and white ones during the first six months of 1966.” The majority does not question the accuracy of any of these findings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court thus examined the impact of the Sylvania locations practice, concluding that it amounted to a territorial restriction that prevented Continental from competing in Sacramento, a market in which there was only one significant Sylvania distributor. More importantly, these findings are implicit in the jury’s verdict.</p>
<p id="b1084-10"><em>Schwinn </em>did not expressly outlaw location clauses by name. It did, however, outlaw any and all territorial restrictions on resale to others. This necessarily includes all devices, the inevitable practical effect of which is to restrict a retailer’s territory. We are convinced that Sylvania-type location clauses and Schwinn-type territorial restrictions are identical in effect and are both <em>per se </em>illegal under the command of <em>Schwinn.</em></p>
<p id="b1084-11">It is a cardinal rule of antitrust law that the purpose and effect of certain conduct— not its form — governs its legality. <em>Simpson v. Union Oil Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="106805"><a href="/opinion/106805/simpson-v-union-oil-co-of-cal/#17" aria-description="Citation for case: Simpson v.

To the same effect is <em>Hobart Brothers Co. v. Malcolm T.

It is sufficient if the restraint is present, in fact, whether the outgrowth of an express or an implied understanding. <em>Hobart Brothers Co., supra, </em>at 900; Beverage <em>Distributors, Inc. v.

<p id="b1085-5"><em>Schwinn, </em>says the majority, involved a restriction on the locations and types of <em>vendees, </em>while Sylvania only imposed restrictions on the permissible locations of <em>vendors. </em>In attempting to limit the effect of <em>Schwinn, </em>the majority completely overlooks the <em>Schwinn </em>language outlawing any type of a restraint on alienation after the passage of title and dominion. Without giving a reason, the majority, in its interpretation of <em>Schwinn, </em>says: “It is clear to us that ‘territory and areas’ refer to the location of vendees, rather than vendors.” There is nothing in <em>Schwinn </em>to suggest such a distinction. Moreover, since Sylvania’s enforcement of its location clause, coupled with hard economic facts, prevented consumers in Sacramento from buying Sylvania televisions from Continental, the present case involves a direct limitation on the location of permissible vendees.</p>
<p id="b1085-6">III.</p>
<p id="b1085-7">The majority’s strained emphasis upon the decree of the district court on the <em>Schwinn </em>remand demonstrates the futility of its search to find a ready answer to the <em>Schwinn </em>directive. First of all, the district court decree could not alter or change the effect of the <em>Schwinn </em>decision. More importantly, that the district court followed through on the <em>Schwinn </em>command is made clear by the following language of its judgment:</p>
<blockquote id="b1085-10">“Defendant Schwinn and the Association are each jointly and severally enjoined and restrained from, directly or indirectly, imposing, inducing, or securing any condition or any agreement or understanding that limits the freedom of any distributor or retailer of Schwinn products as to where and to whom it may resell such products, by oral or written statements or by acts of retaliation.” <span class="citation" data-id="1667836"><a href="/opinion/1667836/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/#565" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">291 F.Supp. 564, 565</a></span> (N.D.Ill.1968).</blockquote>
<p id="b1085-11">It is true that the remand decree allowed Schwinn to designate in its retail franchise agreements the place of business for which a franchise is issued. Obviously this provision must be read in light of the language of the entire decree and of <em>Schwinn </em>itself. So read, it means only that a manufacturer can specify the location at which a retailer is the manufacturer’s authorized representative and assign areas of primary responsibility, but that a manufacturer cannot impose resale restrictions forbidding retailers from selling the manufacturer’s product except where the manufacturer allows.</p>
<p id="b1085-12">We feel that Justice Clark, writing for the Court, properly interpreted the overall effect of the district court judgment on the <em>Schwinn </em>remand in <em>Reed Brothers, Inc. v.

<p id="b1086-16">Upon remand in Topeo,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the district court in the forepart of its decision carefully followed the decision of the Supreme Court by prohibiting the defendant from any type of an arrangement which would restrict the territories within which or persons to whom any member firm might sell products procured from or through Topeo, and then went on to engage in a lot of gobbledygook, introducing what seems to be a meaningless paragraph Y with reference to locations which, in pertinent part, reads;</p>

<p id="b1087-5">That the attorneys for Topeo on the appeal from the judgment on remand placed no such construction on the district court judgment is made evident by the following language taken from pages 5 and 6 of their brief on appeal, to-wit:</p>
<blockquote id="b1087-6">“The district court outlined in Paragraph V the activities in which the defendant could engage without violating the court’s injunction. The government argues that Paragraph V renders the decreed relief inadequate ‘because it fails to protect against and in fact permits continuation or renewal of the collective allocation of territories among competing sellers of Topeo branded products’ (Juris. Statement, p. 5) In fact it does not. <em>By its very terms Paragraph V forbids any of these practices if they are ‘directly or indirectly used to achieve or maintain’ the prohibited territorial restrictions. </em>(App.C, p. XX.) <em>If Topeo were to engage in activity having such an effect, a violation of the decree would result.” </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>

<p id="b1087-13">The majority conveniently confuses and integrates location clauses and exclusive dealerships, claiming them to be so interdependent as to make exclusive dealerships useless without resale-type location clauses as an enforcement option. The two are clearly distinguishable. In an exclusive dealership, the distributor, dealer, or franchisee obtains a manufacturer’s <em>self-imposed promise not to contract with another distributor in the general area. </em>A location clause with a restraint on alienation deals with the manufacturer’s control over the place from which a distributor, dealer, or franchisee may resell a product. <em><span class="citation" data-id="8768088"><a href="/opinion/8784271/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

Bushie and Doris Ann Bushie v. Stenocord...">Bushie</a></span> </em>extend approval to location clauses, such as those under scrutiny. They deal solely with exclusive dealerships. It is one thing for a manufacturer to restrict its own behavior. It is quite another to try to restrict that of an independent business entity.</p>
<p id="b1088-4">It is generally agreed that the utility of exclusive dealerships resides in the ability to manipulate the density of sales outlets. The grant of an exclusive dealership is but a promise by the manufacturer not to sell to other nearby distributors. This serves as the stimulus for active product marketing by dealers. However, under <em><span class="citation" data-id="8768088"><a href="/opinion/8784271/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">Schwinn</a></span>, </em>if a manufacturer uses the grant to prevent the dealer from reselling goods in which the dealer has full title and dominion, he is employing a prohibited restraint on alienation. Just because the courts have approved exclusive dealerships, such as involved in <em>Seagram &amp; Sons </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="303417"><a href="/opinion/303417/hamilton-c-bushie-and-doris-ann-bushie-v-stenocord-corporation/" aria-description="Citation for case: Hamilton C. Bushie and Doris Ann Bushie v. Stenocord...">Bushie</a></span>, </em>does not mean that manufacturers can employ a location clause to place a restraint on alienation in order to limit the territories in which their distributors can resell. We agree with the commentator who described as “fallacious” the “contention that the location clause is lawful as long as the manufacturer lawfully can grant exclusive franchises. These two types of restrictions are vastly different in terms of market impact. By an exclusive franchise agreement, a manufacturer voluntarily restricts itself. However, when the manufacturer imposes resale restrictions it exercises control over one of the most crucial competitive decisions which any truly independent tradesman must make — where and to whom he will sell his wares. To claim that granting an exclusive franchise is a lawful restraint on alienation on the manufacturer’s part and to deny any analytical difference to restraints on alienation imposed on members of the next economic level is legal nonsense.” <em>Schmitt, supra, </em>note 2 at 907-OS.</p>
<p id="b1088-5">The majority argues that applying a rule of <em>per se </em>illegality to location clauses renders the exclusive distributorship tool useless because it turns a dealer franchised somewhere into a dealer franchised everywhere. This argument is similar to the majority’s contention that if a manufacturer has the right to designate the location where a franchise is valid, “then the manufacturer must have the power to enforce these rights if a franchisee violates his location clause agreement.” According to the majority, the distinction between the right to approve locations and the right to limit the freedom of a distributor as to where it may sell is “artificial” or “spurious.”</p>
<p id="b1088-7">The majority commits the same mistakes with respect to both the right to franchise by location and the right to grant exclusive dealerships. Neither device is rendered useless by permitting Continental to sell Sylvania televisions in Sacramento. Sylvania can insure that its products are effectively marketed by granting exclusive distributorships, thereby limiting itself, and by assigning spaced locations and areas of primary responsibility, thereby imposing obligations on its dealers. But <em><span class="citation" data-id="8768088"><a href="/opinion/8784271/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">Schwinn</a></span> </em>bars territorial and customer restrictions on resale. Thus, once Sylvania’s legitimate interest in full distribution of its products is satisfied, it has no right to prevent Continental from selling in Sacramento. An analogous distinction was made in <em>Hobart Brothers Co. v. Malcolm T. Gilliland, Inc., supra. </em>The court stated that the manufacturer, Hobart,</p>
<blockquote id="b1088-8">“. . . could refuse to deal with Gilliland, but that right did not give Hobart immunity so that it could use an illegal territorial restraint.” <em>Id. </em>at 900.</blockquote>
<p id="b1088-10">The court in <em>Fontana Aviation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Beech Aircraft Corp., </em><span class="citation" data-id="292619"><a href="/opinion/292619/fontana-aviation-inc-a-corporation-v-beech-aircraft-corporation-a/#1085" aria-description="Citation for case: Fontana Aviation, Inc., a Corporation v.

Similarly, in the present case, Sylvania’s right to grant exclusive distributorships, to approve locations, and to assign areas of primary responsibility does not give it immunity to impose territorial restraints on resale. Arguments to the contrary amount to nothing more than veiled attacks on <em><span class="citation" data-id="8768088"><a href="/opinion/8784271/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<blockquote id="b1089-7">“The District Court determined that by limiting the freedom of its individual members to compete with each other, <em>Topeo </em>was doing a greater good fostering competition between members and other large supermarket chains. But, the fallacy in this is that <em>Topeo </em>has no authority under the Sherman Act to determine the respective values of competition in various sectors of the economy. On the contrary, the Sherman Act gives to each Topeo member and to each prospective member the right to ascertain for itself whether or not competition with other supermarket chains is more desirable than competition in the sale of Topcobrand products. <em>Without territorial restrictions, Topeo members may indeed ‘[cut] each other’s throats.’</em></blockquote>

<p id="b1089-11">Though a horizontal restraint case, <em>Topeo </em>stands for the rule that restricted intrabrand competition cannot be justified by alleged interbrand competitive gain. This rule not only causes the majority rationale to fail, but it provides an excellent economic justification for the <em>Schwinn per se </em>rule, the preservation and encouragement of intrabrand competition, as a desirable end in itself.

More than that, in <em>General Motors </em>the dealers initiated the restraint, unlike the manufacturers in <em><span class="citation" data-id="8768088"><a href="/opinion/8784271/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b1090-10">A case which is not old and on which the majority heavily relies is <em>Salco Corp. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em><span class="citation" data-id="328098"><a href="/opinion/328098/salco-corporation-formerly-known-and-doing-business-as-denver-buick-inc/" aria-description="Citation for case: Salco Corporation, Formerly Known and Doing Business as...">517 F.2d 567</a></span> (10th Cir. 1975).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although involving a franchise with a location clause, the authority of the decision on our point is fatally weakened by the failure of the court to recognize the <em><span class="citation" data-id="8768088"><a href="/opinion/8784271/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

The only mention of <em><span class="citation" data-id="8768088"><a href="/opinion/8784271/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">Schwinn</a></span> </em>is in connection with the well known tenet that a manufacturer of a product for which equivalent brands are readily available in the market may select his customers and for this purpose may franchise certain dealers to whom, alone, he will sell his goods. No one disputes that rule. <em>Boro Hall Corp. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em><span class="citation" data-id="1506512"><a href="/opinion/1506512/boro-hall-corporation-v-general-motors-corporation/" aria-description="Citation for case: Boro Hall Corporation v. General Motors Corporation">124 F.2d 822</a></span> (2d Cir. 1942), cited in <em>Saleo, </em>is a relatively ancient case decided long before <em><span class="citation" data-id="8768088"><a href="/opinion/8784271/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">Schwinn</a></span>. </em>Additionally, the case is not in point. There the record clearly shows that there was no restriction on the used car dealer preventing the sale of automobiles outside the “zone of influence.” For that matter, the dealer was notified that he could even establish a location outside of his zone of influence as long as it was not “unduly prejudicial to the interests of other dealers.” This is a far cry <page-number citation-index="1" label="1017">*1017</page-number>from the concrete mold in which Sylvania attempted to place Continental.</p>
<p id="b1091-5">The force of <em>Boro Hall </em>and <em>Saleo </em>is further undermined by a recent exhaustive study of distribution practices in the automobile industry. Schmitt, supra, n. 2.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The author of the study concludes that “[i]n the context of automobile dealerships, the location clause constitutes a flat territorial prohibition. Any other conclusion would be a gross distortion of the hard economic facts.” <em>Id. </em>at 904. He further concludes that the location clause is a device through which “the automobile manufacturers effectively have achieved control over intrabrand competition,” which has no economic justification, and which “merely substitutes the manufacturers’ decisions for those which a dealer should make on the basis of the dictates of the market.” <em>Id. </em>at 905-06.</p>
<p id="b1091-6">Finally, some comment should be made on the majority’s quotation from an address by a Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Antitrust Division. The quotation in the majority opinion is: “And only last year, a spokesman for the Antitrust Division stated that locations clauses ‘are not illegal standing by themselves’ since ‘[t]hey reflect the manufacturer’s legitimate interest in having his goods distributed efficiently through a particular area.’ ” The context from which the quotation of Mr. Clear-water was taken is as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b1091-7">“‘Location’ and ‘primary responsibility’ clauses — under which a seller designates the specific location of his purchaser-customer, or the geographic area in which the purchaser-customer is primarily responsible for the sale of the seller’s products — are not illegal standing by themselves. They reflect the manufacturer’s legitimate interest in having his goods distributed efficiently throughout a particular area. The purchaser-customer, however, is not restricted from selling elsewhere once the interests of the manufacturer are satisfied. <em>Reading between the lines, however, in those instances in which such clauses are in fact used as a means to impose a territorial restriction on sales, the Department would, of couse, consider them illegal.” </em>(Clearwater, Franchising and the Antitrust Laws, May 16, 1974). [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>
<p id="b1091-11">Since, as both the jury and the district court found, the location clauses involved in this case were used by Sylvania to impose a territorial restriction on sales, “the Department would, of course, consider them illegal.”</p>
<p id="b1091-12">VII.</p>
<p id="b1091-13">Initially, Sylvania urged that it was entitled to an instruction on the “failing company” rule stated in <em>Citizens Publishing Co. v. United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107870"><a href="/opinion/107870/citizen-publishing-co-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Citizen Publishing Co. v. United States">394 U.S. 131</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="107870"><a href="/opinion/107870/citizen-publishing-co-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Citizen Publishing Co. v. United States">89 S.Ct. 927</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="107870"><a href="/opinion/107870/citizen-publishing-co-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Citizen Publishing Co. v. United States">22 L.Ed.2d 148</a></span> (1969). The majority does not now press for an application of that rule. This is understandable. The evidence offered by Sylvania shows that by 1965 it had made a remarkable recovery from its unstable position in the early sixties. We agree with the trial judge that there was insufficient evidence to submit this issue to the jury.</p>
<p id="b1091-14">CONCLUSION</p>
<p id="b1091-15">A close analysis and study of the majority opinion reveals that it is patterned after and closely follows Justice Stewart’s lengthy and exhaustive dissent in <em><span class="citation" data-id="8768088"><a href="/opinion/8784271/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">Schwinn</a></span>. </em>When viewed in broad perspective, the majority holds that <em><span class="citation" data-id="8768088"><a href="/opinion/8784271/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co.">Schwinn</a></span> </em>is bad law and that we should adopt the Stewart approach. We decline to join in an opinion which, we believe, would <em>sub silentio </em>overrule a decision of the Supreme Court.</p>
<p id="b1091-16">In urging affirmance, we do not go beyond the jury’s verdict that Sylvania enforced its location agreement to create an illegal territorial restraint restricting the locations from which Continental could sell its products. We do not need to decide <page-number citation-index="1" label="1018">*1018</page-number>whether a location clause, without more, creates a <em>per se </em>violation of the Sherman Act.</p>
<p id="b1092-4">WE WOULD AFFIRM.</p>
<footnote label="1">
<p id="b1079-7">. In passing on whether or not to grant an injunction on the appellant’s practices, the district court entered elaborate findings of fact which are in direct contradiction to many of the statements in the majority opinion. For example, footnote 30 of the majority opinion states that “[t]he elbow room policy was never used by Sylvania severely to restrict intrabrand competition or to divide markets. No dealer had a veto power over the entry of other dealers into his area, and locations were authorized by Sylvania solely on the basis of market expandability.” However, in its 16th finding of fact the district court concluded that “the action of Sylvania [reducing Continental’s credit line, cancelling Continental’s orders, and cutting off all communication with Continental, among other things] was taken pursuant to the contract, combination or conspiracy alleged by Continental and was part and parcel thereof and at the instance of Sylvania’s co-conspirator Handy Andy; and as a result thereof Continental was prevented from selling its Sylvania brand products in its store in Sacramento.” The district court also found that on September 7, 1965, Sylvania’s area sales manager advised Continental’s principal operating officer “that due to prior ‘commitments’ which Sylvania had with Handy Andy, it was impossible for Sylvania to franchise Continental in Sacramento.” Needless to say, the findings of the district court are implicit in and grow out of the jury’s general verdict and its affirmative response to the previously maintained special interrogatory-</p>

<blockquote id="b1080-9">“So too, concerted action in the form of dividing territories in which a dealer may resell merchandise purchased from the manufacturer without resale price maintenance constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws. That is to say, where a manufacturer, by means of a contract, combination or conspiracy, restricts the territories within which a dealer may resell merchandise purchased from the manufacturer, such a restriction is unlawful regardless of whether or not that restriction is good business practice from the manufacturer’s point of view and is likely to assure adequate volume of profits. Any agreement, combination or conspiracy by <page-number citation-index="1" label="1007">*1007</page-number>which a manufacturer interferes with the ordinary and usual forces of competition to restrict the territories within which dealers may resell merchandise which they have purchased from the manufacturer or to keep one dealer from competing for customers or sales in a territory or area served by another dealer also constitutes a violation of the antitrust laws, whether or not the territories resulting seem reasonable or unreasonable.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b1081-6">“Therefore, if you find by a preponderance of the evidence that Sylvania entered into a contract, combination or conspiracy with one or more of its dealers pursuant to which Sylvania exercised dominion or control over the products sold to the dealer, after having parted with title and risk to the products, you must find any effort thereafter to restrict outlets or store locations from which its dealers resold the merchandise which they had purchased from Sylvania to be a violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, regardless of the reasonableness of the location restrictions.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b1081-7">“On the other hand, on this question of territorial or customer restrictions, you are instructed that a manufacturer, such as Sylvania, has a right, acting alone and independently for its own business interests, to select its customers, and for this purpose, the manufacturer may grant an exclusive ‘franchise’ to certain dealers to whom, alone, he will sell his products. Also, it is lawful for the manufacturer to designate the location or locations of the place or places of business for which said dealer or dealers are franchised. It is also lawful for the manufacturer to decline or refuse to grant a dealer’s request for a franchise at different or additional locations.” [Tr. 3446-48]</blockquote>

<blockquote id="b1081-9">“Ladies and Gentlemen, there are also types of antitrust cases, which this is, which are so pernicious, the policies are so pernicious to competition, so anti-competitive in their impact on our economy that the law states there is no possible way to justify them. And, ladies and gentlemen, the two restrictions involved in this case are such marketing, distribution restrictions: Territorial restrictions and price maintenance restrictions are what lawyers and courts call per se violations of the act if they are enforced by contract, combination or conspiracy.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b1081-14">“So despite what Mr. Popofsky told you in his opening argument, despite what Prof. Preston testified to on the stand, the facts are that it is only necessary in this case to find, number one, that Sylvania had a policy by which it restricted the territory in which and/or customers to which Continental could sell Sylvania products after it had purchased them from Sylvania.</blockquote>

<blockquote id="b1081-18">“You will be asked only to decide what is the true character of the Sylvania practice. Was it the character that Continental suggests? Did it really involve price-fixing on the one hand and control over territories on the other, or did it, as we suggest, involve no more than a franchise by location practice?</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b1081-19">“If it is the latter we contend the instructions make it lawful. So you will be asked only to identify the character of the practice.” [Tr. 3378]</blockquote>

<p id="b1084-6">. <em>Compare </em>Professor Schmitt’s descriptions of the effects of the location clause employed by automobile manufacturers:</p>
<blockquote id="b1084-7">The location clause inherently limits the dealer’s ability to reach customers outside his marketing segment. The size of this segment varies according to the shopping habits of customers, traffic connections and population density. Even though a dealer is free to sell to customers wherever they may be located, the location clause secured market segmentation which effectively allows the manufacturer to control the degree of intrabrand competition. The location clause factually restricts the dealer’s business activities directly in terms of territorial freedom and indirectly in terms of freedom of customer choice.</blockquote>

<p id="b1084-13">. The only finding of the district court questioned by the majority is the finding that Sylvania requested Maguire to sue Continental on its outstanding notes as a part of Sylvania’s attempt to prevent Continental from selling Sylvania products in Sacramento. We do not agree that this finding is “in conflict with the finding of the jury that Maguire and Sylvania were not involved in any contract, combination, or conspiracy to enforce the location restriction.” Majority Opinion, footnote 7. The jury’s conclusion that Maguire was not part of the conspiracy to impose resale restrictions on Continental is consistent with a finding that Sylvania used Maguire in carrying out the conspiracy between Sylvania and Handy Andy found explicitly by the trial judge and by implication by the jury as well.</p>

<p id="b1085-8">. In <em>Hobart Bros. Co. v. Malcolm T. Gilliland, Inc., supra, </em>the manufacturer, Hobart, used an area of primary responsibility clause to limit the territory in which Gilliland would sell Hobart’s products. Since Hobart not only manufactured but also sold on the same level as its dealers, the effect of the restriction was a horizontal division of markets eliminating competition between Hobart and its dealers. The court concluded that “[s]uch an arrangement must be treated as it operated in practice rather than ‘as arranged by skillful drafting.’ <em>Cf. Simpson v.
