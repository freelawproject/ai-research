**Combined Opinion**
§§ 2241, 2242, 2243, 2244, 2245, 2249, 2252, 2254. [10] See 9 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 108-125 (1926). [11] E. g., Article 39 of the Magna Carta (see 9 W. Holdsworth, at 112-125). The federal habeas corpus statute grants jurisdiction to inquire into violations of the United States Constitution. [12] If there has been, or will be, an unconditional release from custody before inquiry can be made into the legality of detention, it has been held that there is no habeas corpus jurisdiction. See Parker v. Ellis, supra, at 582, n. 8 (WARREN. C. J., dissenting); Ex parte Baez, 177 U.S. 378 (1900); United States ex rel. Rivera v. Reeves, 246 F. Supp. 599 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1965); Burnett v. Gladden, 228 F. Supp. 527 (D. C. D. Ore. 1964). [13] Petitioner was convicted in 1960. He took his case through the state appellate process, and this Court denied a writ of certiorari in March 1963.
