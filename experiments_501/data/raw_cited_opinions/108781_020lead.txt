<p id="b746-9">The question before us concerns the right of a female member of the uniformed services<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to claim her spouse as a “dependent” for the purposes of obtaining increased quarters allowances and medical and dental benefits under 37 U. S. C. §§ 401, 403, and 10 U. S. C. §§ 1072, 1076, on an equal footing with male members. Under these statutes, a serviceman may claim his wife as a “dependent” without regard to whether she is in fact dependent upon him for any part of her support. 37 U. S. C. § 401 (1); 10 U. S. C. § 1072 (2) (A). A servicewoman, on the other hand, may not claim her husband as a “dependent” under these programs unless he is in fact dependent upon her for over one-half of his sup<page-number citation-index="1" label="679">*679</page-number>port. 37 TJ. S. C. §401; 10 U. S. C. § 1072 (2) (C).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the question for decision is whether this difference in treatment constitutes an unconstitutional discrimination against servicewomen in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. A three-judge District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, one judge dissenting, rejected this contention and sustained the constitutionality of the provisions of the statutes making this distinction. 341 F. Supp. 201 (1972). We noted probable jurisdiction. 409 U. S. 840 (1972). We reverse.</p>
<p id="b747-5">I</p>
<p id="b747-6">In an effort to attract career personnel through reenlistment, Congress established, in 37 U. S. C. § 401 <em>et seq., </em>and 10 U. S. C. § 1071 <em>et seq., </em>a scheme for the provision of fringe benefits to members of the uniformed services on a competitive basis with business and industry.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, under 37 U. S. C. §403, a member of the uniformed services with dependents is entitled to an <page-number citation-index="1" label="680">*680</page-number>increased “basic allowance for quarters” and, under 10 U. S. C. § 1076, a member’s dependents are provided comprehensive medical and dental care.</p>
<p id="b748-5">Appellant Sharron Frontiero, a lieutenant in the United States Air Force, sought increased quarters allowances, and housing and medical benefits for her husband, appellant Joseph Frontiero, on the ground that he was her “dependent.” Although such benefits would automatically have been granted with respect to the wife of a male member of the uniformed services, appellant’s application was denied because she failed to demonstrate that her husband was dependent on her for more than one-half of his support.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellants then commenced this suit, contending that, by making this distinction, the statutes unreasonably discriminate on the basis of sex in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In essence, appellants asserted that the discriminatory impact of the statutes is twofold: first, as a procedural matter, a female member is required to demonstrate her spouse’s dependency, while no such burden is imposed upon male members; and, second, as a substantive matter, a male member who does not provide more than one-half of his wife’s support receives benefits, while a similarly situated female member is denied such benefits. Appellants therefore sought a permanent in<page-number citation-index="1" label="681">*681</page-number>junction against the continued enforcement of these statutes and an order directing the appellees to provide Lieutenant Frontiero with the same housing and medical benefits that a similarly situated male member would receive.</p>
<p id="b749-5">Although the legislative history of these statutes sheds virtually no light on the purposes underlying the differential treatment accorded male and female members,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a majority of the three-judge District Court surmised that Congress might reasonably have concluded that, since the husband in our society is generally the “breadwinner” in the family — and the wife typically the “dependent” partner — “it would be more economical to require married female members claiming husbands to prove actual dependency than to extend the presumption of dependency to such members.” 341 F. Supp., at 207. Indeed, given the fact that_ approximately 99% of all members of the uniformed services are male, the District <page-number citation-index="1" label="682">*682</page-number>Court speculated that such differential treatment might conceivably lead to a “considerable saving of administrative expense and manpower.” <em>Ibid.</em></p>
<p id="b750-5">II</p>
<p id="b750-6">At the outset, appellants contend that classifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> alienage,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and national origin,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> are inherently suspect and must therefore be subjected to close judicial scrutiny. We agree and, indeed, find at least implicit support for such an approach in our unanimous decision only last Term in <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>404 U. S. 71 (1971).</p>
<p id="b750-7">In <em>Reed, </em>the Court considered the constitutionality of an Idaho statute providing that, when two individuals are otherwise equally entitled to appointment as administrator of an estate, the male applicant must be preferred to the female. Appellant, the mother of the deceased, and appellee, the father, filed competing petitions for appointment as administrator of their son’s estate. Since the parties, as parents of the deceased, were members of the same entitlement class, the statutory preference was invoked and the father’s petition was therefore granted. Appellant claimed that this statute, by giving a mandatory preference to males over females without regard to their individual qualifications, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
<p id="b750-8">The Court noted that the Idaho statute “provides that different treatment be accorded to the applicants on the basis of their sex; it thus establishes a classification sub<page-number citation-index="1" label="683">*683</page-number>ject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.” 404 U. S., at 75. Under “traditional” equal protection analysis, a legislative classification must be sustained unless it is “patently arbitrary” and bears no rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. See <em>Jefferson </em>v. <em>Hackney, </em>406 U. S. 535, 546 (1972); <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Belcher, </em>404 U. S. 78, 81 (1971); <em>Flemming </em>v. <em>Nestor, </em>363 U. S. 603, 611 (1960); <em>McGowan </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>366 U. S. 420, 426 (1961); <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U. S. 471, 485 (1970).</p>
<p id="b751-5">In an effort to meet this standard, appellee contended that the statutory scheme was a reasonable measure designed to reduce the workload on probate courts by eliminating one class of contests. Moreover, appellee argued that the mandatory preference for male applicants was in itself reasonable since “men [are] as a rule more conversant with business affairs than . . . women.”<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, appellee maintained that “it is a matter of common knowledge, that women still are not engaged in politics, the professions, business or industry to the extent that men are.” <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And the Idaho Supreme Court, in upholding the constitutionality of this statute, suggested that the Idaho Legislature might reasonably have “concluded that in general men are better qualified to act as an administrator than are women.” <footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b751-6">Despite these contentions, however, the Court held the statutory preference for male applicants unconstitutional. In reaching this result, the Court implicitly rejected appellee’s apparently rational explanation of the statutory scheme, and concluded that, by ignoring the individual qualifications of particular applicants, the challenged statute provided “dissimilar treatment for men and women who are . . . similarly situated.” 404 U. S., <page-number citation-index="1" label="684">*684</page-number>at 77. The Court therefore held that, even though the State’s interest in achieving administrative efficiency “is not without some legitimacy,” “[t]o give a mandatory preference to members of either sex over members of the other, merely to accomplish the elimination of hearings on the merits, is to make the very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the [Constitution] . . . .” <em>Id., </em>at 76. This departure from “traditional” rational-basis analysis with respect to sex-based classifications is clearly justified.</p>
<p id="b752-5">There can be no doubt that our Nation has had a long and unfortunate history of sex discrimination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Traditionally, such discrimination was rationalized by an attitude of “romantic paternalism” which, in practical effect, put women, not on a pedestal, but in a cage. Indeed, this paternalistic attitude became so firmly rooted in our national consciousness that, 100 years ago, a distinguished Member of this Court was able to proclaim:</p>
<blockquote id="b752-6">“Man is, or should be, woman’s protector and defender. The natural and proper timidity and delicacy which belongs to the female sex evidently unfits it for many of the occupations of civil life. The constitution of the family organization, which is founded in the divine ordinance, as well as in the nature of things, indicates the domestic sphere as that which properly belongs to the domain and functions of womanhood. The harmony, not to say identity, of interests and views which belong, or should belong, to the family institution is repugnant to the idea of a woman adopting a distinct and <page-number citation-index="1" label="685">*685</page-number>independent career from that of her husband. . . .</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b753-5">“. . . The paramount destiny and mission of woman are to fulfil the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator.” <em>Bradwell </em>v. <em>State, </em>16 Wall. 130, 141 (1873) (Bradley, J., concurring).</blockquote>
<p id="b753-6">As a result of notions such as these, our statute books gradually became laden with gross, stereotyped distinctions between the sexes and, indeed, throughout much of the 19th century the position of women in our society was, in many respects, comparable to that of blacks under the pre-Civil War slave codes. Neither slaves nor women could hold office, serve on juries, or bring suit in their own names, and married women traditionally were denied the legal capacity to hold or convey property or to serve as legal guardians of their own children. See generally L. Kanowitz, Women and the Law: The Unfinished Revolution 5-6 <em>(1969); </em>G. Myrdal, An American Dilemma 1073 (20th anniversary ed. 1962). And although blacks were guaranteed the right to vote in 1870, women were denied even that right — which is itself “preservative of other basic civil and political rights” <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> — until adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment half a century later.</p>
<p id="b753-7">It is true, of course, that the position of women in America has improved markedly in recent decades.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="686">*686</page-number>Nevertheless, it can hardly be doubted that, in part because of the high visibility of the sex characteristic,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> women still face pervasive, although at times more subtle, discrimination in our educational institutions, in the job market and, perhaps most conspicuously, in the political arena.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See generally K. Amundsen, The Silenced Majority: Women and American Democracy (1971); The President’s Task Force on Women’s Rights and Responsibilities, A Matter of Simple Justice (1970).</p>
<p id="b754-5">Moreover, since sex, like race and national origin, is an immutable characteristic determined solely by the accident of birth, the imposition of special disabilities upon the members of a particular sex because of their sex would seem to violate “the basic concept of our system that legal burdens should bear some relationship to individual responsibility . . . .” <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>406 U. S. 164, 175 (1972). And what differentiates sex from such nonsuspect statuses as intelligence or physical disability, and aligns it with the recognized suspect criteria, is that the sex characteristic frequently bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As a result, statutory distinc<page-number citation-index="1" label="687">*687</page-number>tions between the sexes often have the effect of invidiously-relegating the entire class of females to inferior legal status without regard to the actual capabilities of its individual members.</p>
<p id="b755-5">We might also note that, over the past decade, Congress has itself manifested an increasing sensitivity to sex-based classifications. In Tit. VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, for example, Congress expressly declared that no employer, labor union, or other organization subject to the provisions of the Act shall discriminate against any individual on the basis of “race, color, religion, <em>sex, </em>or national origin.” <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Similarly, the Equal Pay Act of 1963 provides that no employer covered by the Act “shall discriminate . . . between employees on the basis of <em>sex.” </em><footnotemark>20</footnotemark> And § 1 of the Equal Rights Amendment, passed by Congress on March 22, 1972, and submitted to the legislatures of the States for ratification, declares that “[e] quality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.” <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus, Congress itself has concluded that classifications based upon sex are inherently invidious, and this conclusion of a coequal <page-number citation-index="1" label="688">*688</page-number>branch of Government is not without significance to the question presently under consideration.' Cf. <em>Oregon </em>v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112, 240, 248-249 (1970) (opinion of Brennan, White, and Marshall, JJ.); <em>Katzenbach </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>384 U. S. 641, 648-649 (1966).</p>
<p id="b756-5">With these considerations in mind, we can only conclude that classifications based upon sex, like classifications based upon race, alienage, or national origin, are inherently suspect, and must therefore be subjected to strict judicial scrutiny. Applying the analysis mandated by that stricter standard of review, it is clear that the statutory scheme now before us is constitutionally invalid.</p>
<p id="b756-6">III</p>
<p id="b756-7">The sole basis of the classification established in the challenged statutes is the sex of the individuals involved. Thus, under 37 U. S. C. §§ 401, 403, and 10 U. S. C. §§ 1072, 1076, a female member of the uniformed services seeking to obtain housing and medical benefits for her spouse must prove his dependency in fact, whereas no such burden is imposed upon male members. In addition, the statutes operate so as to deny benefits to a female member, such as appellant Sharron Frontiero, who provides less than one-half of her spouse’s support, while at the same time granting such benefits to a male member who likewise provides less than one-half of his spouse’s support. Thus, to this extent at least, it may fairly be said that these statutes command “dissimilar treatment for men and women who are . . . similarly situated.” <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>404 U. S., at 77.</p>
<p id="b756-8">Moreover, the Government concedes that the differential treatment accorded men and women under these statutes serves no purpose other than mere “administrative convenience.” In essence, the Government maintains that, as an empirical matter, wives in our society frequently are dependent upon their husbands, while hus<page-number citation-index="1" label="689">*689</page-number>bands rarely are dependent upon their wives. Thus, the Government argues that Congress might reasonably have concluded that it would be both cheaper and easier simply conclusively to presume that wives of male members are financially dependent upon their husbands, while burdening female members with the task of establishing dependency in fact.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b757-5">The Government offers no concrete evidence, however, tending to support its view that such differential treatment in fact saves the Government any money. In order to satisfy the demands of strict judicial scrutiny, the Government must demonstrate, for example, that it is actually cheaper to grant increased benefits with respect to <em>all </em>male members, than it is to determine which male members are in fact entitled to such benefits and to grant increased benefits only to those members whose wives actually meet the dependency requirement. Here, however, there is substantial evidence that, if put to the test, many of the wives of male members would fail to qualify for benefits.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And in light of the fact that the <page-number citation-index="1" label="690">*690</page-number>dependency determination with respect to the husbands of female members is presently made solely on the basis of affidavits, rather than through the more costly hearing process,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the Government’s explanation of the statutory scheme is, to say the least, questionable.</p>
<p id="b758-5">In any case, our prior decisions make clear that, although efficacious administration of governmental programs is not without some importance, “the Constitution recognizes higher values than speed and efficiency.” <em>Stanley </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>405 U. S. 645, 656 (1972). And when we enter the realm of “strict judicial scrutiny,” there can be no doubt that “administrative convenience” is not a shibboleth, the mere recitation of which dictates constitutionality. See <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>394 U. S. 618 (1969); <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bash, </em>380 U. S. 89 (1965). On the contrary, any statutory scheme which draws a sharp line between the sexes, <em>solely </em>for the purpose of achieving administrative convenience, necessarily commands “dissimilar treatment for men and women who are . . . similarly situated,” and therefore involves the “very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the [Constitution] . . . .” <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>404 U. S., at 77, 76. We therefore conclude that, by according differential treatment to male and female members of the uniformed services for the sole purpose of achieving administrative <page-number citation-index="1" label="691">*691</page-number>convenience, the challenged statutes violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment insofar as they require a female member to prove the dependency of her husband.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>

See <em>Gruenwald </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>390 F. 2d 591 (CA2), cert, denied, 393 U. S. 982 (1968); cf. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>392 U. S. 409 (1968); <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Katzenbach, </em>383 U. S. 301 (1966). On the contrary, these statutes seize upon a group — women—who have historically suffered discrimination in employment, and rely on the effects of this past discrimination as a justification for heaping on additional economic disadvantages. Cf. <em>Gaston County </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U. S. 285, 296-297 (1969).</p>

<p id="b757-7"> In 1971, 43% of all women over the age of 16 were in the labor force, and 18% of all women worked full time 12 months per year. See U. S. Women’s Bureau, Dept, of Labor, Highlights of Women’s Employment &amp; Education 1 (W. B. Pub. No. 72-191, Mar. 1972). Moreover, 41.5% of all married women are employed. See U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Dept, of Labor, Work Experience of the Population in 1971, p. 4 (Summary Special Labor Force Report, Aug. 1972). It is also noteworthy that, while the median income of a <page-number citation-index="1" label="690">*690</page-number>male member of the armed forces is approximately $3,686, see The Report of the President’s Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force 51, 181 (1970), the median income for all women over the age of 14, including those who are not employed, is approximately $2,237. See Statistical Abstract of the United States Table No. 535 (1972), Source: U. S. Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, Series P-60, No. 80. Applying the statutory definition of “dependency” to these statistics, it appears that, in the “median” family, the wife of a male member must have personal expenses of approximately $4,474, or about 75% of the total family income, in order to qualify as a “dependent.”</p>

<p id="b759-10"> As noted earlier, the basic purpose of these statutes was to provide fringe benefits to members of the uniformed services in order to establish a compensation pattern which would attract career personnel through re-enlistment. See n. 3, <em>supra, </em>and accompanying text. Our conclusion in no wise invalidates the statutory schemes except insofar as they require a female member to prove the dependency of her spouse. See <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>406 U. S. 164 (1972); <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>391 U. S. 68 (1968); <em>Moritz </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>469 F. 2d 466 (CA10 1972). See also 1 U. S. C. § 1.</p>
