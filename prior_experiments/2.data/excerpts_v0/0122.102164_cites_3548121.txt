Passage 1:
d, 50 Conn. 529, 541-542, after quoting the maxim of the common law, cessante ratione legis, cessat ipsa lex, said:
"This means that no law can survive the reasons on which it is founded. It needs no statute to change it; it abrogates itself. If the reasons on which a law rests are overborne by opposing reasons, which in the progress of society gain a controlling force, the old law, though still good as an abstract principle, and good in its application to some circumstances, must cease to apply as a controlling principle to the new circumstances."

Numerous additional state decisions to the same effect might be cited; but it seems unnecessary to pursue the matter at greater length.
It results from the foregoing that the decision of the court below, in holding the wife incompete
