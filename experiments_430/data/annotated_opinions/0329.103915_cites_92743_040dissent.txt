**Dissenting Opinion**
1 Section 6 2 throws additional light on the meaning of these words.  When the phrase was used by Congress to describe allowable rates, it had relation to something ascertainable.  The rates were not left to the whim of the Commission.  The rates fixed would produce an annual return and that annual return was to be compared with a theoretical just and reasonable return, all risks considered, on the fair value of the property used and useful in the public service at the time of the determination.  Such an abstract test is not precise.  The agency charged with its determination has a wide range before it could properly be said by a court that the agency had disregarded statutory standards or had confiscated the property of the utility for public use.  Cf. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, <citedDecision>134 U. S. 418, 461-66</citedDecision> , dissent.  This is as Congress intends.  Rates are left to an experienced agency particularly competent by training to appraise the amount required.  The decision as to a reasonable return had not been a source of great difficulty, for borrowers and lenders reached such agreements daily in a multitude of situations; and although the determination of fair value had been troublesome, its essentials had been worked out in fairness to investor and consumer by the time of the en *622 actment of this Act.  Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 289 U. S. 287 , 304 et seq. The results were well known to Congress and had that body desired to depart from the traditional concepts of fair value and earnings, it would have stated its intention plainly.  Helvering v. Griffiths, 318 U. S. 371 .  It was already clear that when rates are in dispute, "earnings produced by rates do not afford a standard for decision.‚Äù 289 U. S. at 305 .
