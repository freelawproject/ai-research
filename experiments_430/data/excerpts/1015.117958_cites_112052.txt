 On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals stood by this precedent.  It held that taking the question of materiality from the jury denied respondent a right guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  28 F. 3d 943 (1994).  We granted certiorari.  513 U. S. 1071 (1995).  II Section 1001 of Title 18 provides: “Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.” It is uncontested that conviction under this provision requires that the statements be “material” to the Government inquiry, and that “materiality” is an element of the offense that the Government must prove.  The parties also agree on the definition of “materiality”: The statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, or [be] capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.” Kungys v. United States, <citedDecision>485 U. S. 759, 770</citedDecision> (1988) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The question for our resolution is whether respondent was entitled to have this element of the crime determined by the jury.  The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that no one will be deprived of liberty without *510 “due process of law”; and the Sixth, that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury.” We have held that these provisions require criminal convictions to rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.  1 Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 277-278 (1993).  The right to have a jury make the ultimate determination of guilt has an impressive pedigree.  Blackstone described “trial by jury” as requiring that “the truth of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of [the defendant’s] equals and neighbors ....” 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 343 (1769) (emphasis added).  Justice Story wrote that the “trial by jury” guaranteed by the Constitution was “generally understood to mean ... a trial by a jury of twelve men, impartially selected, who must unanimously concur in the guilt of the accused before a legal conviction can be had” 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 541, n. 2 (4th ed. 1873) (emphasis added and deleted).
**Lead Opinion**
 We do not minimize the role that stare decisis plays in our jurisprudence.  See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989).  That role is somewhat reduced, however, in the case of a procedural rule such as this, which does not serve as a guide to lawful behavior.  See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991).  It is reduced all the more when the rule is not only procedural but rests upon an interpretation of the Constitution.  See ibid. And we think stare decisis cannot possibly be controlling when, in addition to those factors, the decision in question has been proved manifestly erroneous, and its underpinnings eroded, by subsequent decisions of this Court. Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 480-481 (1989); Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320 (1972).  *522 The Government also claims stare decisis benefit from our decision in Kungys v. United States, <citedDecision>485 U. S. 759</citedDecision> (1988), which held that, in appellate review of a District Court (non-jury) denaturalization proceeding, the appellate court’s newly asserted standard of materiality could be applied to the facts by the appellate court itself, rather than requiring remand to the District Court for that application.  <citedDecision>Id., at 772</citedDecision> .  But as we have observed, the characterization of a mixed question of law and fact for one purpose does not govern its characterization for all purposes.  It is hard to imagine questions more diverse than, on the one hand, whether an appellate court must remand to a district court for a determination of materiality in a denaturalization proceeding (Kungys) and, on the other hand, whether the Constitution requires the finding of the element of materiality in a criminal prosecution to be made by the jury (the present case).  It can be argued that <citedDecision>Kungys</citedDecision> itself did not heed this advice, since it relied upon both our prior decision in Sinclair , see <citedDecision>485 U. S., at 772</citedDecision> , and a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that materiality in a § 1001 prosecution is a question of “ ‘law’ ” for the court, ibid. (quoting United States v. Abadi, 706 F. 2d 178, 180 , cert. denied, 464 U. S. 821 (1983)).  But the result in <citedDecision>Kungys</citedDecision> could be thought to follow a fortiori from the quite different cases of Sinclair and Abadi , whereas nonentitlement under the Sixth Amendment to a jury determination cannot possibly be thought to follow a fortiori from <citedDecision>Kungys</citedDecision> .  In any event, <citedDecision>Kungys</citedDecision> assuredly did not involve an adjudication to which the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial attaches, see Luria v. United States, 231 U. S. 9 (1913), and hence had no reason to explore the constitutional ramifications of Sinclair and Abadi , as we do today.  Whatever support it gave to the validity of those decisions was obiter dicta, and may properly be disregarded.  * * * The Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt *523 of every element of the crime with which he is charged.  The trial judge’s refusal to allow the jury to pass on the “materiality” of Gaudin’s false statements infringed that right.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.  It is so ordered.  The “beyond a reasonable doubt” point is not directly at issue in the present case, since it is unclear what standard of proof the District Court applied in making its determination of materiality, and since the Ninth Circuit’s reversal of the District Court’s judgment did not rest upon the standard used but upon the failure to submit the question to the jury.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O’Con-nor and Justice Breyer join, concurring. I join the Court’s opinion. “A person when first charged with a crime is entitled to a presumption of innocence, and may insist that his guilt be established beyond a reasonable doubt. In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358 (1970).” Herrera v. Collins, 506 U. S. 390, 398 (1993). As a result, “[t]he prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of the offense charged and must persuade the factfinder ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ of the facts necessary to establish each of those elements.” Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275, 277-278 (1993) (citations omitted); see also Estelle v. McGuire, 502 U. S. 62, 69 (1991) (“[T]he prosecution must prove all the elements of a criminal offense beyond a reasonable doubt”). The Government has conceded that 18 U. S. C. § 1001 requires that the false statements made by respondent be “material” to the Government inquiry, and that “materiality” is an element of the offense that the Government must prove in order to sustain a conviction. Ante, at 509; Brief for United States 11. The Government also has not challenged the Court of Appeals’ determination that the error it identified was structural and plain. See id., at 8, n. 5 ; see also 28 F. 3d 943, 951-952 (CA9 1994). In light of these concessions, I agree that “[t]he trial judge’s refusal to allow the jury to pass on the ‘materiality’ of Gaudin’s false statements infringed” his “right to have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt of every element of the crime with which he [was] charged.” Ante, at 522 and this page. I write separately to point out that there are issues in this area of the law which, though similar to those decided in *524 the Court’s opinion, are not disposed of by the Court today. There is a certain syllogistic neatness about what we do decide: Every element of an offense charged must be proved to the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt; “materiality” is an element of the offense charged under § 1001; therefore, the jury, not the court, must decide the issue of materiality. But the Government’s concessions have made this case a much easier one than it might otherwise have been. Whether “materiality” is indeed an element of every offense under 18 U. S. C. § 1001 is not at all obvious from its text. Section 1001 of Title 18 provides: “Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.” Currently, there is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals over whether materiality is an element of the offense created by the second clause of § 1001. Compare, e. g., United States v. Corsino, 812 F. 2d 26, 30 (CA1 1987) (“ ‘While materiality is not an explicit requirement of the second, false statements, clause of § 1001, courts have inferred a judge-made limitation of materiality in order to exclude trifles from its coverage’ ”), with United States v. Elkin, 731 F. 2d 1005, 1009 (CA2 1984) (“It is settled in this Circuit that materiality is not an element of the offense of making a false statement in violation of § 1001”). The Court does not resolve that conflict; rather, it merely assumes that materiality is, in fact, an element of the false statement clause of § 1001. Ante, at 511; cf. Sullivan, supra, at 278 , n. (assuming that reasonable-doubt jury *525 instruction was erroneous in light of the “question presented and the State’s failure to raise this issue below”). As with many aspects of statutory construction, determination of what elements constitute a crime often is subject to dispute. See, e. g., National Organization for Women, Inc. v. Scheidler, 510 U. S. 249, 262 (1994) (holding that “RICO contains no economic motive requirement”); United States v. Culbert, 435 U. S. 371, 380 (1978) (declining to limit the Hobbs Act’s scope to an undefined category of conduct termed “racketeering”). “[I]n determining what facts must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt the [legislature’s] definition of the elements of the offense is usually dispositive.” McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U. S. 79, 85 (1986). Nothing in the Court’s decision stands as a barrier to legislatures that wish to define — or that have defined — the elements of their criminal laws in such a way as to remove issues such as materiality from the jury’s consideration. We have noted that “ ‘[t]he definition of the elements of a criminal offense is entrusted to the legislature, particularly in the case of federal crimes, which are solely creatures of statute.’” Staples v. United States, 511 U. S. 600, 604 (1994) (quoting Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 424 (1985)); see also McMillan, supra, at 85 . Within broad constitutional bounds, legislatures have flexibility in defining the elements of a criminal offense. See Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197, 210 (1977). Federal and state legislatures may reallocate burdens of proof by labeling elements as affirmative defenses, ibid., or they may convert elements into “sentencing factor[s]” for consideration by the sentencing court, McMillan, supra, at 85-86 . The Court today does not resolve what role materiality plays under § 1001. The Court properly acknowledges that other mixed questions of law and fact remain the proper domain of the trial court. Ante, at 520-521. Preliminary questions in a trial regarding the admissibility of evidence, Fed. Rule Evid. 104(a), the competency of witnesses, ibid., the voluntariness *526 of confessions, Crane v. Kentucky, 476 U. S. 683, 688-689 (1986), the legality of searches and seizures, Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 12(b)(3), and the propriety of venue, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 18, may be decided by the trial court. Finally, the Government has not argued here that the error in this case was either harmless or not plain. Brief for United States 8, n. 5. As to the former, there is a “strong presumption” that a constitutional violation will be subject to harmless-error analysis. See Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 579 (1986). Accordingly, “the Court has applied harmless-error analysis to a wide range of errors and has recognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless.” Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 306 (1991); cf. id., at 309-310 (listing examples of structural errors). In particular, the Court has subjected jury instructions plagued by constitutional error to harmless-error analysis. See, e. g., Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391, 402 (1991) (taint of an unconstitutional burden-shifting jury instruction subject to harmless-error analysis); Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263, 266 (1989) (per curiam) (jury instruction containing an erroneous mandatory presumption subject to harmless-error analysis); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497, 502-504 (1987) (jury instruction misstating an element of an offense subject to harmless-error analysis); Rose, supra, at 581-582 (jury instruction containing an erroneous rebuttable presumption subject to harmless-error analysis); but see Sullivan, 508 U. S., at 280-282 (erroneous burden of proof instruction not subject to harmless-error analysis). The Court today has no occasion to review the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the constitutional error here “cannot be harmless.” 28 F. 3d, at 951 . As to the latter, in United States v. Olano, 507 U. S. 725, 732 (1993), the Court noted the limitations on “plain error” review by the courts of appeals under Rule 52(b). “The first limitation on appellate authority under Rule 52(b) is that there indeed be an ‘error.’” Ibid. Second, “the error [must] be ‘plain.’” Id., at 734 . Thus, “[a]t a minimum, a *527 court of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule 52(b) unless the error is clear under current law.” Ibid. Third, the plain error must “‘affec[t] substantial rights,’” ibid., i. e., “in most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial,” ibid. Finally, if these three prerequisites are met, the decision to correct forfeited error remains within the sound discretion of the court of appeals. A court of appeals, however, should not exercise that discretion unless the error “ ‘ “seriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” ’ ” Id., at 732 . In affirming the Court of Appeals, the Court concludes that “it is fair to say that we cannot hold for respondent today while still adhering to the reasoning and the holding of [Sinclair v. United States, 279 U. S. 263 (1929)].” Ante, at 519-520. Before today, every Court of Appeals that has considered the issue, except for the Ninth Circuit, has held that the question of materiality is one of law. See 28 F. 3d, at 955 (Kozinski, J., dissenting) (collecting cases). Thus, it is certainly subject to dispute whether the error in this ease was “clear under current law.” Olano, supra, at 734 . The Court, however, does not review the Court of Appeals’ determination that the failure to submit the issue of materiality to the jury constituted “plain error.” 28 F. 3d, at 952 .

 28 F. 3d 943 (1994).  We granted certiorari.  513 U. S. 1071 (1995).  II Section 1001 of Title 18 provides: "Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."
