 § 540.71(e).  An inmate may appeal through the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Procedure.  See §§ 542.10 to 542.16.  [7] The warden is instructed to permit the inmate to review the rejected material for the purpose of filing an appeal "unless such review may provide the inmate with information of a nature which is deemed to pose a threat or detriment to the security, good order or discipline of the institution or to encourage or instruct in criminal activity." § 540.71(d).  [8] *407 III There is little doubt that the kind of censorship just described would raise grave First Amendment concerns outside the prison context.  It is equally certain that "[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution," Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S., at 84 , nor do they bar free citizens from exercising their own constitutional rights by reaching out to those on the "inside," id., at 94-99 ; Bell v. Wolfish, <citedDecision>441 U. S. 520</citedDecision> (1979); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S. 119 (1977); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817 (1974).  We have recognized, however, that these rights must be exercised with due regard for the "inordinately difficult undertaking" that is modern prison administration.  Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S., at 85 .  In particular, we have been sensitive to the delicate balance that prison administrators must strike between the order and security of the internal prison environment and the legitimate demands of those on the "outside" who seek to enter that environment, in person or through the written word.  Many categories of noninmates seek access to prisons.  Access is essential to lawyers and legal assistants representing prisoner clients, see Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396 (1974), to journalists seeking information about prison conditions, see Pell v. Procunier, supra , and to families and friends of prisoners who seek to sustain relationships with them, see Procunier v. Martinez, supra .  All these claims to prison access undoubtedly are legitimate; yet prison officials may well conclude that certain proposed interactions, though seemingly innocuous to laymen, have potentially significant implications for the order and security of the prison.

 The first Turner factor is multifold: we must determine whether the governmental objective underlying the regulations at issue is legitimate and neutral, and that the regulations are rationally related to that objective.  We agree with the District Court that this requirement has been met. [12] *415 The legitimacy of the Government's purpose in promulgating these regulations is beyond question.  The regulations are expressly aimed at protecting prison security, a purpose this Court has said is "central to all other corrections goals." Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S., at 823 .  As to neutrality, "[w]e have found it important to inquire whether prison regulations restricting inmates' First Amendment rights operated in a neutral fashion, without regard to the content of the expression." Turner, 482 U. S., at 90 .  The ban on all correspondence between certain classes of inmates at issue in Turner clearly met this "neutrality" criterion, as did the restrictions at issue in Pell and <citedDecision>Wolfish</citedDecision> .  The issue, however, in this case is closer.  On their face, the regulations distinguish between rejection of a publication "solely because its content is religious, philosophical, political, social or sexual, or because its content is unpopular or repugnant" (prohibited) and rejection because the publication is detrimental to security (permitted).  28 CFR § 540.71 (b)(1988).  Both determinations turn, to some extent, on content.  But the Court's reference to "neutrality" in Turner was intended to go no further than its requirement in Martinez that "the regulation or practice in question must further an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression." 416 U. S., at 413 .

App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  The Court of Appeals did not contest the District Court's factual finding as such, but ruled that upholding a practice merely because it is based upon "reasonably founded" fears is improper under Martinez : the Court of Appeals held that this finding "conflicts with the holding of Martinez that prison administrators have the burden of showing that a restrictive practice is `generally necessary.' " 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 194, 824 F. 2d, at 1174 .  As we here do not apply the Martinez standard, we reject the Court of Appeals' sole ground for questioning the District Court's findings in this respect.  In our view, when prison officials are able to demonstrate that they have rejected a less restrictive alternative because of reasonably founded fears that it will lead to greater harm, they succeed in demonstrating that the alternative they in fact selected was not an "exaggerated response" under Turner .  Furthermore, the administrative inconvenience of this proposed alternative is also a factor to be considered and adds additional support to the District Court's conclusion that petitioners were not obligated to adopt it.  See Wolfish, <citedDecision>441 U. S., at 549</citedDecision> .  V In sum, we hold that Turner 's reasonableness standard is to be applied to the regulations at issue in this case, and that those regulations are facially valid under that standard.  We agree with the remand for an examination of the validity of the regulations as applied to any of the 46 publications introduced at trial as to which there remains a live controversy.  See 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 196, 824 F. 2d, at 1176 .  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  *420 JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.

 It also approved the officials' refusal to deliver bulk packets of union literature to specific inmates for distribution to others.  Applying Equal Protection Clause as well as First Amendment standards, the Court held that the restriction was reasonable because it was limited in scope and because the union retained "other avenues of outside informational flow .  .  .  ." Id., at 131 ; see id., at 133, 136 .  In the third case, Bell v. Wolfish, <citedDecision>441 U. S. 520</citedDecision> (1979), the Court upheld a regulation that allowed only publishers, bookstores, and book clubs to mail hardbound books to pretrial detainees.  Hardbacks might serve as containers for contraband, jail administrators argued.  Since the risk of improper use by publishers and similar sources was low, the jail delivered books from them but not from other outsiders.  <citedDecision>Id., at 549</citedDecision> .  The Court found this explanation acceptable and held that the rule did not violate the detainees' First Amendment rights.  <citedDecision>Id., at 550</citedDecision> .  Although the Court did not expressly address the rights of nonprisoners, the fact that softcover publications were delivered without restriction, see <citedDecision>id., at 552</citedDecision> , minimized the abridgment of outsiders' rights.  The approval in <citedDecision>Wolfish</citedDecision> of greater protection for publishers than for individual citizens reinforces Martinez 's view that the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners must be carefully weighed and undermines the Court's approach today.  Most recently, Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), confirmed the vitality of Martinez for evaluating encroachments on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners.  The Court relied on the three interim "prisoners' rights" cases to establish a reasonableness standard for reviewing inmate-to-inmate correspondence.  Id., at 89.  But in its unanimous invalidation of a restriction on inmate marriages, the Court acknowledged that "because the regulation may entail a `consequential *427 restriction on the [constitutional] rights of those who are not prisoners,' " Martinez might posit the correct level of review.  482 U. S., at 97 (quoting Martinez, 416 U. S., at 409 ).  It did not "reach this question, however, because even under the reasonable relationship test, the marriage regulation does not withstand scrutiny."

 The warden or Regional Director is to respond within 15 or 30 days, respectively.  § 542.14.  An adverse decision by the Regional Director may be appealed to the General Counsel of the Bureau; an adverse decision by the warden may be appealed to the Regional Director.  § 542.15.  [8]  Although the regulations do not so provide, it is the practice of the Bureau to withhold in its entirety any publication containing excludable material.  This practice, referred to by the parties as the "all-or-nothing rule," is also at issue in this case. [9]  We do not think it sufficient to focus, as respondents urge, on the identity of the individuals whose rights allegedly have been infringed.  Although the Court took special note in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396 (1974), of the fact that the rights of nonprisoners were at issue, and stated a rule in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), for circumstances in which "a prison regulation impinges on inmates' constitutional rights," id., at 89 (emphasis added), any attempt to forge separate standards for cases implicating the rights of outsiders is out of step with the intervening decisions in Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817 (1974); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S. 119 (1977); and Bell v. Wolfish, <citedDecision>441 U. S. 520</citedDecision> (1979).  These three cases, on which the Court expressly relied in Turner when it announced the reasonableness standard for "inmates' constitutional rights" cases, all involved regulations that affected rights of prisoners and outsiders.  Pell involved the right of representatives of the news media to conduct interviews in the prisons in order to inform the public about prison conditions.  The asserted right at issue in Jones was the right of a prisoners' union to send its literature into the prison.  In <citedDecision>Wolfish</citedDecision> , publishers sought to send hardback books into the prison.  In all these cases, regulations worked a "consequential restriction on the .  .  .  rights of those who are not prisoners." Martinez, 416 U. S., at 409 .  But the Court in Turner observed: "In none of these .
