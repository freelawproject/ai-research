Case of interest: Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n of Cal. (1935)
-----------------------
erick v. Rosner, 294 U.S. 629, 642, "the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one." So far as judgments are concerned, the decisions,[5] as distinguished from dicta,[6] show that the *295 actual exceptions have been few and far between, apart from Haddock v. Haddock. For this Court has been reluctant to admit exceptions in case of judgments rendered by the courts of a sister state, since the "very purpose" of Art. IV, ยง 1 was "to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation." Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, pp. 276-277.
This Court, to be sure, has recognized that in case of statutes, "the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed," some "accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states" is necessary. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, <caseOfInterest>294 U.S. 532</caseOfInterest>, 547. But that principle would come into play only in case the Nevada decrees were assailed on the ground that Nevada must give full faith and credit in its divorce proceedings to the divorce statutes of North Carolina. Even then, it would be of no avail here. For as stated in the Alaska Packers case, "Prima facie every state is entitled to enforce in its own courts its own statutes, lawfully enacted. One who challenges that right, because of the force given to a conflicting statute of another state by the full faith and credit clause, assumes the burden of showing, upon some rational basis, that of the conflicting interests involved those of the foreign state are superior to those of the *296 forum." Id., pp. 547-548. It is difficult to perceive how North Carolina could be said to have an interest in Nevada's domiciliaries superior to the interest of Nevada. Nor is there any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one stat

 of Nevada. That question is not before us. It may be that for the purposes of that state the petitioners have been released from their marital vows, consistently with the procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, on the basis of compliance with its residential requirements and constructive service of process on the non-resident spouses. But conceding the validity in Nevada of its decrees dissolving the marriages, it does not mechanically follow that the Full Faith and Credit Clause compels North Carolina to accept them.
We have recognized an area of flexibility in the application of the Clause to preserve and protect state policies in matters of vital public concern. We have said that conflicts between such state policies should be resolved, "not by giving automatic effect to the full faith and credit clause, . . . but by appraising the governmental interests of each jurisdiction, and turning the scale of decision according to their weight." Alaska Packers Assn. v. Comm'n, <caseOfInterest>294 U.S. 532</caseOfInterest>, 547. (See also Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U.S. 268, 273-274, and compare the dissenting opinion in Yarborough v. Yarborough, 290 U.S. *310 202, 213-227.) That Clause should no more be read "with literal exactness like a mathematical formula" than are other great and general clauses of the Constitution placing limitations upon the States to weld us into a Nation. Cf. Home Bldg. & L. Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398, 428. Rather it should be construed to harmonize its direction "with the necessary residuum of state power." Id., at p. 435.
Prominent in the residuum of state power, as pointed out above, is the right of a state to deal with the marriage relations of its citizens and to pursue its chosen domestic policy of public morality in that connection. Both Nevada and North Carolina have rights in this regard which are entitled to recognition. The conflict between those rights here should not be resolved by extending into North Carolina the effects of Nevada's action through

; and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in Fall v. Eastin, supra, p. 14.

That the case of Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., 191 U.S. 373, is not an exception but only an appropriate application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens, see Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U.S. 629, 642-643.
[6]  It has been repeatedly stated that the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to enforce the penal laws of another. See, for example, Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U.S. 657, 666; Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U.S. 243, 260; Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U.S. 145, 160.

But the question of whether a judgment based on a penalty is entitled to full faith and credit was reserved in Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U.S. 268, 279.
For other dicta that the application of the full faith and credit clause may be limited by the policy of the law of the forum, see Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, supra, p. 160; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, <caseOfInterest>294 U.S. 532</caseOfInterest>, 546; Broderick v. Rosner, supra, note 5, p. 642.

[9]  The fact that a stay in a state is not for long is not necessarily fatal to the existence of a domicil. As stated in Williamson v. Osenton, 232 U.S. 619, 624, the "essential fact that raises a change of abode to a change of domicil is the absence of any intention to live elsewhere." The intention to stay for a time to which a person "did not then contemplate an end" was held sufficient. Id., p. 625. And see District of Columbia v. Murphy, 314 U.S. 441. Nor is there any doubt that a married woman may acquire in this country a domicil separate from her husband. Williamson v. Osenton, supra, pp. 625-626, and cases cited.
