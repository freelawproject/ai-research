 After the completion of the rechanneling project the bed of the Colorado River was substantially narrowed, and the Bonelli land re-emerged.  The Supreme Court of Arizona held that Arizona owned the title to the beds of navigable rivers within its borders, and that Arizona therefore acquired title to the Bonelli land when it became part of the riverbed as a result of the eastward migration of the Colorado.  That court went on to hold that under state law the re-emergence of the land was an avulsive change, which did not divest the State of its title to the exposed land.  This Court granted certiorari and reversed the Supreme Court of Arizona.  We phrased the critical inquiry in Bonelli in these words: “The issue before us is not what rights the State has accorded private [land] owners in lands which the State holds as sovereign; but, rather, how far the State’s sovereign right extends under the equal-footing doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act — whether the State retains title to the lands formerly beneath the stream of the Colorado River or whether that title is defeasible by the withdrawal of those waters.” 414 U. S., at 319-320 .  (Emphasis added.) We held that federal common law should govern in deciding whether a State retained title to lands which had reemerged from the bed of a navigable stream, relying in part on Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, <citedDecision>296 U. S. 10</citedDecision> (1935)., That case held that the extent and validity of a federal grant was a question to be resolved by federal law, and in Bonelli *370 we decided that the nature of the title conferred by the equal-footing doctrine set forth hr Pollard’s Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. 212 (1845), should likewise be governed by federal common law. Under the equal-footing doctrine “the new States since admitted have the same rights, sovereignty and jurisdiction ... as the original States possess within their respective borders.” Mumford v. Wardwell, 6 Wall. 423, 436 (1867).  Pollard’s Lessee held that under the equal-footing doctrine new States, upon their admission to the Union, acquire title to the lands underlying navigable waters within their boundaries.  We went on to discuss the nature of the sovereign’s interest in the riverbed, which we found to lie in the protection of navigation, fisheries, and similar purposes.  We held that under federal common law, as we construed it in that case, Arizona’s sovereign interest in the re-emerged land was not sufficient to enable it to retain title.  We found the principle governing title to lands which have been formed by accretion, rather than that which governs title where there has been an avulsive change in the channel of the river, to be applicable.  We chose the former because it would both ensure the riparian owner access to the water’s edge and prevent the State from receiving a windfall.  We therefore decided that Bonelli, as riparian owner, was entitled to the land in question.

 Where Mexico had patented tidal lands to a private owner before ceding to the United States the territory which ultimately became the State of California, California did not succeed to the ownership of such lands upon her admission to the Union.  Knight v. United States Land Assn., 142 U. S. 161 (1891).  If a navigable stream is an interstate boundary, this Court, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction over suits between States, has necessarily developed a body of federal common law to determine the effect of a change in the bed of the stream on the boundary.  See, e. g., Nebraska v. Iowa, 143 U. S. 359 (1892); Arkansas v. Tennessee, 246 U. S. 158 (1918).  Congress possesses by virtue of its commerce power a “navigational servitude” with respect to navigable waters.  “All navigable waters are under the control of the United States for the purpose of regulating and improving navigation, and although the title to the shore and submerged soil is in the various States and individual *376 owners under them, it is always subject to the servitude in respect of navigation created in favor of the Federal government by the Constitution.” Gibson v. United States, 166 U. S. 269, 271-272 (1897).  In Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, <citedDecision>296 U. S. 10</citedDecision> (1935), this Court also found a basis to apply federal law, but its rationale does not dictate a different result in this case. In Borax, the city of Los Angeles brought suit to quiet title in certain land in Los Angeles Harbor.  Los Angeles claimed the land under a grant from the State of California, whereas Borax, Ltd., claimed the land as a successor in interest to a federal patentee.  The federal patent had purported to convey a specified quantity of land, 18.88 acres, according to a survey by the General Land Office.  This Court recognized that if the patent purported to convey lands which were part of the tidelands, the patent would be invalid to that extent since the Federal Government has no power to convey lands which are rightfully the State’s under the equal-footing doctrine.  <citedDecision>Id., at 17-19</citedDecision> .  The Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals to remand for a new trial to allow the city to attempt to prove that some portion of the lands described in the federal patent was in fact tideland.  The Court went on to hold that the boundary between the upland and tideland was to be determined by federal law. <citedDecision>Id., at 22</citedDecision> .  This same principle would require that determination of the initial boundary between a riverbed, which the State acquired under the equal-footing doctrine, and riparian fast lands likewise be decided as a matter of federal law rather than state law. But that determination is solely for the purpose of fixing the boundaries of the riverbed acquired by the State at the time of its admission to the Union; thereafter the role of the equal-footing doctrine is ended, and the land is subject to the laws of the State.  The expressions in Bonelli suggesting a more ex *377 pansive role for the equal-footing doctrine are contrary to the line of cases following Pollard’s Lessee.  6 For example, this Court has held that subsequent changes in the contour of the land, as well as subsequent transfers of the land, are governed by the state law. Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 343 (1906).  Indeed, the rule that lands once having passed from the Federal Government are subject to the laws of the State in which they lie antedates Pollard’s Lessee .  As long ago as 1839, the Court said: “We hold the true principle to be this, that whenever the question in any Court, state or federal, is, whether a title to land which had once been the property of the United States has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws of the United States; but that whenever, according to those laws, the title shall have passed, then that property, like all other property in the state, is subject to state legislation; so far as that legislation is consistent with the admission that the title passed and vested according to the laws of the United States.” Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet., at 517 .  (Emphasis added.)

 Here, however, we are not dealing with substantive property law as such, but rather with an issue substantially related to the constitutional sovereignty of the States.  In cases such as this, considerations of stare decisis play a less important role than they do in cases involving substantive property law. Cf. The Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, *382 470 (1849) (Taney, C. J., dissenting); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 405-411 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944).  Even if we were to focus on the effect of our decision upon rules of substantive property law, our concern for unsettling titles would lead us to overrule Bonelli, rather than to retain it.  See Minnesota Co. v. National Co., 3 Wall. 332, 334 (1866).  Since one system of resolution of property disputes has been adhered to from 1845 until 1973, and the other only for the past three years, a return to the former would more closely conform to the expectations of property owners than would adherence to the latter.  We are also persuaded that, in large part because of the positions taken in the briefs presented to the Court in Bonelli, the Bonelli decision was not a deliberate repudiation of all the cases which had gone before.  We there proceeded on the view, which we now think to have been mistaken, that <citedDecision>Borax, supra,</citedDecision> should be read so expansively as to in effect overrule sub silentio the line of eases following Pollard’s Lessee .  For all of these reasons, we have now decided that Bonelli’s application of federal common law to cases such as this must be overruled.  The judgment under review is vacated, and the case remanded to the Supreme Court of Oregon for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  The case was brought and tried in the Circuit Court of Benton County, Ore. Both parties appealed from the judgment rendered by that court to the Oregon Court of Appeals.  Subsequent to that judgment, our decision in Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 414 U. S. 313 (1973), had come down and the Court of Appeals employed the reasoning of Bonelli in deciding the appeal.  Both parties then sought review in the Supreme Court of Oregon, which granted discretionary review limited to the factual question of the length of a channel known as Fischer Cut, modified the Court of Appeals’ decision in this respect, and, without discussion, affirmed the decision “[i]n all other respects.” Because of this procedural history we shall, as a matter of convenience, refer in the course of this opinion to rulings and findings of the “Oregon courts."
