 Thus, while Exxon’s contractual obligation was to provide Waterman’s vessels with fuel when Waterman placed an order, it met that obligation sometimes in the capacity of “seller” and other times in the capacity of “agent.” In the transaction at issue here, Exxon acted as Waterman’s agent, procuring bunker fuel for the Hooper from Arabian Marine Operating Co. (Arabian Marine) of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.  In October 1983, Arabian Marine delivered over 4,000 tons of fuel to the Hooper in Jeddah and invoiced Exxon for the cost of the fuel.  Exxon paid for the fuel and invoiced Waterman, in turn, for $763,644.  Shortly thereafter, Waterman sought reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; Waterman never paid the full amount *606 of the fuel bill.  During the reorganization proceedings, Central Gulf agreed to assume personal liability for the unpaid bill if a court were to hold the Hooper liable in rem for that cost.  Subsequently, Exxon commenced this litigation in federal district court against Central Gulf in personam and against the Hooper in rem. Exxon claimed to have a maritime lien on the Hooper under the Federal Maritime Lien Act, 46 U. S. C. §971 (1982 ed.).  1 The District Court noted that “[a] prerequisite to the existence of a maritime lien based on a breach of contract is that the subject matter of the contract must fall within the admiralty jurisdiction.” <citedDecision>707 F. Supp. 155, 158</citedDecision> (SDNY 1989).  Relying on the Second Circuit’s decision in Peralta Shipping Corp. v. Smith & Johnson (Shipping) Corp., 739 F. 2d 798 (CA2 1984), cert. denied, 470 U. S. 1031 (1985), the District Court concluded that it did not have admiralty jurisdiction over the claim.  See <citedDecision>707 F. Supp., at 159-161</citedDecision> .  In Peralta, the Second Circuit held that it was constrained by this Court's decision in Minturn v. Maynard, supra, and by those Second Circuit cases faithfully adhering to Minturn , to follow a per se rule excluding agency contracts from admiralty jurisdiction.  See Peralta, supra, at 802-804 .  The District Court also rejected the argument that Exxon should be excepted from the Minturn rule because it had provided credit necessary for the Hooper to purchase the fuel and thus was more than a mere agent.  To create such an exception, the District Court reasoned, “‘would blur, if not obliterate, a rather clear admiralty distinction.’” <citedDecision>707 F. Supp., at 161</citedDecision> , quoting Peralta, supra, at 804 .  2 *607 The District Court denied Exxon’s motion for reconsideration.  The court first rejected Exxon’s claim that in procuring fuel for Waterman it was acting as a.seller rather than an agent.  Additionally, the District Court declined Exxon’s invitation to limit the Minturn rule to either general agency or preliminary service contracts.  3 Finally, the District Court determined that even if it were to limit Minturn , Exxon’s contract with Waterman was both a general agency contract and a preliminary services contract and thus was excluded from admiralty jurisdiction under either exception.  See 717 F. Supp. 1029, 1031-1037 (SDNY 1989).  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit summarily affirmed the judgment of the District Court “substantially for the reasons given” in the District Court’s two opinions.

 We remove only the precedent of Minturn from the body of rules that have developed over what types of contracts are maritime.  Rather than apply a rule excluding all or certain agency contracts from the realm of admiralty, lower courts should look to the subject matter of the agency contract and determine whether the services performed under the contract are maritime in nature.  See generally Kossick, supra, at 735-738 (analogizing the substance of the contract at issue to established types of “maritime” obligations and finding the contract within admiralty jurisdiction).  Ill There remains the question whether admiralty jurisdiction extends to Exxon’s claim regarding the delivery of fuel in Jeddah.  We conclude that it does.  Like the District Court, we believe it is clear that when Exxon directly supplies marine fuels to Waterman’s ships, the arrangement is maritime in nature.  See <citedDecision>707 F. Supp., at 161</citedDecision> .  Cf. The Golden Gate, 52 F. 2d 397 (CA9 1931) (entertaining an action in admiralty for the value of fuel oil furnished to a vessel), cert. denied sub nom. Knutsen v. Associated Oil Co., 284 U. S. 682 (1932).  In this case, the only difference between the New York delivery over which the District Court asserted jurisdiction, see n. 2, supra, and the Jeddah delivery was that, in Jeddah, *613 Exxon bought the fuels from a third party and had the third party deliver them to the Hooper.  The subject matter of the Jeddah claim, like the New York claim, is the value of the fuel received by the ship.  Because the nature and subject-matter of the two transactions are the same as they relate to maritime commerce, if admiralty jurisdiction extends to one, it must extend to the other.  Cf. North Pacific, supra, at 128 (“[T]here is no difference in character as to repairs made upon ... a vessel .  .

 That issue is not before us, and we leave it to be decided on remand.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  1 The relevant provision of the Federal Maritime Lien Act has been amended and recodified at 46 U. S. C. § 31342 .  2 In the same action, Exxon also claimed a maritime lien on the Hooper for a separate unpaid fuel bill for approximately 42 tons of gas oil Exxon had supplied directly to the Hooper in New York. The District Court held that because Exxon was the “supplier” rather than an agent with respect to the New York delivery, the claim for $13,242 fell within the court’s admiralty jurisdiction.  The court granted summary judgment in Exxon’s *607 favor on this claim.  <citedDecision>707 F. Supp., at 161-162</citedDecision> .  This ruling is not at issue here.  3 The preliminary contract rule, which excludes “preliminary services” from admiralty, was enunciated in the Second Circuit as early as 1881.  See The Thames, 10 F. 848 (SDNY 1881) (“The distinction between preliminary services leading to a maritime contract and such contracts themselves have [sic] been affirmed in this country from the first, and not yet departed from”).  In the Second Circuit, the agency exception to admiralty jurisdiction — the Minturn rule — has been fused with the preliminary contract rule.  See Cory Bros. & Co. v. United States, 51 F. 2d 1010, 1012 (CA2 1931) (explaining Minturn as involving a preliminary services contract).  In denying Exxon’s motion for reconsideration, the District Court declined to “disentangle” the two rules, asserting that Circuit precedent had established the rule of Minturn “as a subset of the preliminary contract rule.” 717 F. Supp. 1029, 1036 (SDNY 1989).
