 The limits imposed upon the commerce power when Congress seeks to apply it to the States are not so inflexible as to preclude temporary enactments tailored to combat a national emergency.  “[Although an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived, nevertheless emergency may afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed.” Wilson v. New, 243 U. S. 332, 348 (1917).  With respect to the Court’s decision in Wirtz , we reach a different conclusion.  Both appellee and the District Court thought that decision required rejection of appel *854 lants’ claims.  Appellants, in turn, advance several arguments by which they seek to distinguish the facts before the Court in Wirtz from those presented by the 1974 amendments to the Act.  There are undoubtedly factual distinctions between the two situations, but in view of the conclusions expressed earlier in this opinion we do not believe the reasoning in Wirtz may any longer be regarded as authoritative.  Wirtz relied heavily on the Court’s decision in United States v. California, <citedDecision>297 U. S. 175</citedDecision> (1936).  The opinion quotes the following language from that case: “‘[We] look to the activities in which the states have traditionally engaged as marking the boundary of the restriction upon the federal taxing power.  But there is no such limitation upon the plenary power to regulate commerce.  The state can no more deny the power if its exercise has been authorized by Congress than can an individual.’ <citedDecision>297 U. S., at 185</citedDecision> .” 392 U. S., at 198 .  But we have reaffirmed today that the States as States stand on a quite different footing from an individual or a corporation when challenging the exercise of Congress’ power to regulate commerce.  We think the dicta 18 from *855 United States v. <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> , simply wrong.  19 Congress may not exercise that power so as to force directly upon the States its choices as to how essential decisions regarding the conduct of integral governmental functions are to be made.  We agree that such assertions of power, if unchecked, would indeed, as Mr. Justice Douglas cautioned in his dissent in Wirtz , allow “the National Government [to] devour the essentials of state sovereignty,” 392 U. S., at 205 , and would therefore transgress the bounds of the authority granted Congress under the Commerce Clause.  While there are obvious differences between the schools and hospitals involved in Wirtz , and the fire and police departments affected'here, each provides an integral portion of those governmental services which the States and their political subdivisions have traditionally afforded their citizens.  20 We are therefore persuaded that Wirtz must be overruled.  *856 The judgment of the District Court is accordingly reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  So ordered.

 Surely the federal power to tax is no less a delegated power than is the commerce power: both find their genesis *844 in Art. I, § 8.  Nor can characterizing the limitation recognized upon the federal taxing power as an “implied immunity” obscure the fact that this “immunity” is derived from the sovereignty of the States and the concomitant barriers which such sovereignty presents to otherwise plenary federal authority.  The complaint recited that a number of appellants were prohibited by their State Constitutions from incurring debts in excess of taxes for the current year.  Those Constitutions also impose ceilings upon the percentage rates at which property might be taxed by those governmental units. App. 36-37.  These examples are obviously not an exhaustive catalogue of the numerous line and support activities which are well within the area of traditional operations of state and local governments.  We express no view as to whether different results might obtain if Congress seeks to affect integral operations of state governments by exercising authority granted it under other sections of the Constitution such as the spending power, Art. I, § 8, cl. 1, or § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The holding of United States v. <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> , as opposed to the language quoted in the text, is quite consistent with our holding today.  There California's activity to which the congressional command was directed was not in an area that the States have regarded as integral parts of their governmental activities.  It was, on the contrary, the operation of a railroad engaged in "common carriage by rail in interstate commerce .  .  .  .” <citedDecision>297 U. S., at 182</citedDecision> .  For the same reasons, despite Mr. Justice Brennan’s claims to the contrary, the holdings in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), are likewise unimpaired by our decision today.  It also seems appropriate to note that Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92 (1946), has not been overruled as the dissent asserts.  Indeed that decision, *855 upon which our Brother heavily relies, has no direct application to the questions we consider today at all. For there the Court sustained an application of the Emergency Price Control Act to a sale of timber by the State of Washington, expressly noting that the “only question is whether the State’s power to make the sales must be in subordination to the power of Congress to fix maximum prices in order to carry on war.” Id., at 102 .  The Court rejected the State’s claim of immunity on the ground that sustaining it would impermissibly “impair a prime purpose of the Federal Government’s establishment.” Ibid. Nothing we say in this opinion addresses the scope of Congress’ authority under its war power.  Cf. n. 17, supra. MR. Justice Brennan’s dissent leaves no doubt from its discussion, post, at 876-878, that in its view Congress may under its commerce power deal with the States as States just as they might deal with private individuals.  We venture to say that it is this conclusion, rather than the one we reach, which is in the words of the dissent a “startling restructuring of our federal system .
