 See Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, at 507 (1951).  These later decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.  [2] As we *448 said in Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 297-298 (1961), "the mere abstract teaching .  .  .  of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence, is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action." See also Herndon v. Lowry, <citedDecision>301 U. S. 242, 259-261</citedDecision> (1937); Bond v. Floyd, 385 U. S. 116, 134 (1966).  A statute which fails to draw this distinction impermissibly intrudes upon the freedoms guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  It sweeps within its condemnation speech which our Constitution has immunized from governmental control.  Cf. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 (1957); De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353 (1937); Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931).  See also United States v. Robel, 389 U. S. 258 (1967); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U. S. 589 (1967); Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11 (1966); Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500 (1964); Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360 (1964).  Measured by this test, Ohio's Criminal Syndicalism Act cannot be sustained.  The Act punishes persons who "advocate or teach the duty, necessity, or propriety" of violence "as a means of accomplishing industrial or political reform"; or who publish or circulate or display any book or paper containing such advocacy; or who "justify" the commission of violent acts "with intent to exemplify, spread or advocate the propriety of the doctrines of criminal syndicalism"; or who "voluntarily assemble" with a group formed "to teach or advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism."
**Combined Opinion**
 It offers itself for belief and if believed it is acted on unless some other belief outweighs it or some failure of energy stifles the movement at its birth.  The only difference between the expression of an opinion and an incitement in the narrower sense is the speaker's enthusiasm for the result.  Eloquence may set fire to reason.  But whatever may be thought of the redundant discourse before us it had no chance of starting a present conflagration.  If in the long run the beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of the community, the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way." We have never been faithful to the philosophy of that dissent.  *453 The Court in Herndon v. Lowry, <citedDecision>301 U. S. 242</citedDecision> , overturned a conviction for exercising First Amendment rights to incite insurrection because of lack of evidence of incitement.  <citedDecision>Id., at 259-261</citedDecision> .  And see Hartzel v. United States, 322 U. S. 680 .  In Bridges v. California, 314 U. S. 252, 261-263 , we approved the "clear and present danger" test in an elaborate dictum that tightened it and confined it to a narrow category.  But in Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494 , we opened wide the door, distorting the "clear and present danger" test beyond recognition.  [1] In that case the prosecution dubbed an agreement to teach the Marxist creed a "conspiracy." The case was submitted to a jury on a charge that the jury could not convict unless it found that the defendants "intended to overthrow the Government `as speedily as circumstances would permit.' " Id., at 509-511 .
