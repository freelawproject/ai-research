And, even when permitting specified forms of state taxation of restricted Indian property, Congress has significantly provided in numerous statutes that no tax lien should attach. 11 I conclude that when Congress imposed restrictions upon Indian property, it meant, and was saying in effect, that the property was exempt from state taxation while the restrictions continue or until Congress waives the immunity. Indeed, Congress has clearly stated that this was its intention by declaring in the Act of April 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 68 , which permitted a gross production tax to be imposed by Oklahoma on lead and zinc produced from restricted Quapaw lands: 'In accordance with the uniform policy of the United States Government to hold the lands of the Quapaw Indians while restricted and the income therefrom free from State taxation of whatsoever nature, except as said immunity is expressly waived, and, in pursuance of said fixed policyIt is herein expressly provided that the waiver of tax immunity herein provided shall be in lieu of all other State taxes of whatever nature on said restricted lands or the income therefrom, * * *.' 12 37 When Congress has intended that restricted property should be taxed, it has explicitly said so. 13 In the absence of such assent restricted property remains beyond the reach of a state's taxing power. Nonalienability and tax exemption have been said to be distinct things so far as vested rights are concerned, see Choate v. Trapp, <targetCase>224 U.S. 665</targetCase> , 673, <targetCase>32 S.Ct. 565</targetCase> , 568, 56 L.Ed. 941 , but this of course does not mean that the concepts of restriction and immunity from state taxation are unrelated. Nor does the circumstance that some of the applicable statutes expressly provide specific tax exemptions for restricted lands indicate that restriction is not tantamount to immunity from state taxation. 14 At the time the allotments to the members of the Five Civilized Tribes were made there was no State of Oklahoma. It had been held that Congress had power to lay taxes upon Indian property within Indian Territory, The Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616 , 20 L.Ed. 227 , and its creature, the Territorial government, was agitating for the taxation of Indian property.

920 , 87 L.Ed. â€”-, decided this term, since there we decided no more than that Congress might authorize the exemption of certain Indian lands from taxation because of an historic policy in respect to those lands. Cf. McCurdy v. United States, 246 U.S. 263 , 269, 38 S.Ct. 289 , 291, 62 L.Ed. 706 . Choate v. Trapp, <targetCase>224 U.S. 665</targetCase> , <targetCase>32 S.Ct. 565</targetCase> , 56 L.Ed. 941 , holding that under certain circumstances the United States could not withdraw a tax exemption once assured, has no bearing on the instant problem since it is conceded that the question here is entirely one of what Congress has in fact directed. 4 Choctaw.
