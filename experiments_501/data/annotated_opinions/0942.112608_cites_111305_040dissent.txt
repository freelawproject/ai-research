 .  .  (1977).” Castleberry v. State, 678 P. 2d 720, 724 (Okla. 1984).  This Court affirmed by an equally divided Court. 471 U. S. 146 (1985).  In the case the Court decides today, the California Court of Appeal also had no difficulty applying the critical distinction.  Relying on Chadwick , it explained that “the officers had probable cause to believe marijuana would be found only in a brown lunch bag and nowhere else in the car. We are compelled to hold they should have obtained a search warrant before opening it.” 216 Cal. App. 3d 586, 592 , 265 Cal. Rptr. 23, 27 (1990).  In the case in which the police had probable cause to search two vehicles, United States v. Johns, <citedDecision>469 U. S. 478</citedDecision> (1985), 9 we rejected the respondent’s reliance on Chadwick with a straightforward explanation of why that case, unlike Ross , did not involve an exception to the warrant requirement.  We first expressed our agreement with the Court of Appeals that the Customs officers who had conducted the search had *596 probable cause to search the vehicles.  Id., at 482.  We then explained: “Under the circumstances of this case, respondents’ reliance on Chadwick is misplaced.  .  .  .

 .  did not involve the exception to the warrant requirement recognized in Carroll v. United States, supra, because the police had no probable cause to believe that the automobile, as contrasted to the footlocker, contained contraband.  See 433 U. S., at 11-12 .  This point is underscored by our decision in Ross , which held that notwithstanding Chadwick police officers may conduct a warrantless search of containers discovered in the course of a lawful vehicle search.  See 456 U. S., at 810-814 .  Given our conclusion that the Customs officers had probable cause to believe that the pickup trucks contained contraband, Chadwick is simply inapposite.  See 456 U. S., at 817 .” <citedDecision>469 U. S., at 482-483</citedDecision> .  The decided cases thus provide no support for the Court’s concern about “confusion.” The Court instead relies primarily on predictions that were made by Justice Blackmun in his dissenting opinions in Chadwick and Sanders.  10 The Court, however, cites no evidence that these predictions have in fact materialized or that anyone else has been unable to understand the “‘inherent opaqueness,”’ ante, at 579, of this uncomplicated issue.  The only support offered by the Court, other than the unsubstantiated allegations of prior dissents, is three law review comments and a sentence from Professor LaFave’s treatise.  None of the law review pieces *597 criticize the holdings in Chadwick and Sanders.  11 The sentence from Professor LaFave’s treatise, at most, indicates that, as is often the case, there may be some factual situations at the margin of the relevant rules that are difficult to decide.  Moreover, to the extent Professor LaFave criticizes our jurisprudence in this area, he is critical of Ross rather than Chadwick or Sanders.

 Moreover, we quoted the following paragraph from Justice Powell’s opinion concurring in the judgment in the intervening case of Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 (1981): “ ‘[W]hen the police have probable cause to search an automobile, rather than only to search a particular container that fortuitously is located in it, the exigencies that allow the police to search the entire automobile without a warrant support the warrantless search of every container found therein.  See post, at 451, and n. 13 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This analysis is entirely consistent with the holdings in Chadwick and Sanders, neither of which is an ‘automobile case,’ because the police there had probable cause to search the double-locked footlocker and the suitcase respectively before either came near an automobile.’ ” Id., at 435, quoted in United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798, 816 (1982).  Although the Court today purports to acknowledge that the warrant requirement is the general rule, ante, at 580, it nonetheless inexplicably persists in referring to Chadwick and Sanders as announcing a “separate rule, unique to luggage and other closed packages, bags, and containers.” Ante, at 571.  Equally inexplicable is the Court’s contention that, in overruling Sanders, it has not “extend[ed] the Carroll doctrine” that created the automobile exception.  Ante, at 580.  In its discussion of the <citedDecision>Johns</citedDecision> case, the Court makes the puzzling statement that it “cannot see the benefit of a rule that requires law enforcement officers to conduct a more intrusive search in order to justify a less intrusive one.” See ante, at 575.  I assume that the Court does not mean to suggest that evidence found during the course of a search may provide the probable cause that justifies the search.  Our cases have unequivocally rejected this bootstrap justification for a search which was not lawful when it commenced.  See, e. g., United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 595 (1948); Byars v. United States, 273 U. S. 28, 29-30 (1927).  Perhaps the Court fears that defendants will attempt similar post hoc reasoning and argue that, when the police have searched only a container rather than the whole car, they must have had probable cause only to search the container.  If so, the Court’s fear is unwarranted, for <citedDecision>Johns</citedDecision> itself foreclosed this argument.  See <citedDecision>469 U. S., at 482-483</citedDecision> .  See ante, at 578-579 (referring to the undocumented prediction made by Justice Blackmun, joined by then-JusTiCE Rehnquist, in dissent in Chadwick); ante, at 579 (referring to the fact that the dissenters had “bemoaned the ‘inherent opaqueness’ of the difference between the Carroll and Chadwick principles and noted ‘the confusion to be created for all concerned’ ”).  One of the three pieces, Kamisar, The “Automobile Search” Cases: The Court Does Little to Clarify the “Labyrinth” of Judicial Uncertainty, in 3 The Supreme Court: Trends and Developments 1980-1981 (D. Opperman ed. 1982), was written prior to the decision in Ross .  Moreover, rather than criticizing Chadwick and Sanders, the article expressly endorses Justice Brennan’s refutation of the arguments advanced by Justice Black-mun in his dissent in Chadwick .  See Kamisar, supra, at 83-85.  The other two articles were written shortly after Ross , and both criticize Ross rather than Chadwick or Sanders.
