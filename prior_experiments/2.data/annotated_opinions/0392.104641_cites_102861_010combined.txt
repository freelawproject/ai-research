[27] But this Court rejected that construction sub silentio and invalidated the tax in memorandum opinions citing only the Choctaw, O. & G.R. Co. case ( 235 U.S. 292 ) and *357 the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. case ( 240 U.S. 522 ). Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U.S. 503 ; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U.S. 549 . Suspicions that this Court had overlooked the fact that under the revised statute the gross production tax was in lieu of rather than in addition to all other ad valorem property taxes, [28] were dispelled by Mr. Justice Holmes' remark in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra at 504-505, that the statutory change had been noticed and regarded as immaterial. [29] If a gross receipts tax was a burden on the Federal Government "so as to interfere with the performance of its functions, it could not be saved because it was in lieu of a tax upon property or was so characterized." See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., <targetCase>302 U.S. 134</targetCase> , 158. The high-water mark of immunity for non-Indian lessees of restricted and allotted Indian lands came in 1922 when the Gillespie decision, supra, invalidated an Oklahoma net income tax upon income derived by a lessee from sales of his share of oil produced from restricted lands. The non-Indian lessee's immunity was last sustained here by Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, supra . That decision held, on application of a rule of strict construction of congressional waivers, that Congress' express waiver of immunity from gross production taxes on oil produced from the specified Indian lands did not extend to petroleum excise taxes. The state did not challenge *358 the implied constitutional immunity but pitched its argument on the ground of statutory exemption. [30] The instrumentality doctrine has been applied to confer a correlative immunity upon private lessees of state-owned lands. The Texas rule that oil and gas leases are present sales to the lessees of the oil and gas in place caused this Court to sustain the imposition of the federal income tax upon income of the lessee derived from the sale of oil and gas produced from lands leased from that state.

This was done by holding that the Federal Government was barred from taxing the income of a lessee of state lands as the state was barred from taxing the income of the lessee of federal lands. A parallel immunity from state occupational or privilege taxes was once accorded private contractors with, or agencies of, the Government, Williams v. Talladega, *359 226 U.S. 404 , notwithstanding the venerable rule that the property of such a contractor or agency is liable to state property taxation. See the cases cited supra in note 18. Decisions curtailing this immunity were presaged by Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U.S. 514 . It held subject to federal income taxation income received by a consulting engineer from a state for services in connection with temporary work. Equally significant was Alward v. Johnson, 282 U.S. 509 , 514, which sustained a state tax measured by gross receipts on the property of a stage line engaged in carrying the mails. [31] Later this Court sustained a state tax on the gross receipts of a contractor with the Federal Government, James v. Dravo Contracting Co., <targetCase>302 U.S. 134</targetCase> ; Silas Mason Co. v. Tax Commission, 302 U.S. 186 ; a state tax on the net income of such a contractor, Atkinson v. Tax Commission, 303 U.S. 20 ; state sales and use taxes on purchases of materials used by a contractor in performing a cost-plus contract with the United States, Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U.S. 1 ; Curry v. United States, 314 U.S. 14 ; and a state severance tax imposed on a contractor who severed and purchased timber from lands owned by the United States, Wilson v. Cook, 327 U.S. 474 . It was pointed out that ". . . the Constitution, unaided by Congressional legislation, . . .

Burnet v. A.T. Jergins Trust, 288 U.S. 508 , 516, in which a city leased oil and gas land to a private trust, which was held liable for a federal income tax on its share of the receipts, the Court stating that "the doctrine of Gillespie v. Oklahoma is to be applied strictly and only in circumstances closely analogous to those which it disclosed." [33] Citing Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393 , which the opinion characterized as "a corollary" to the Gillespie case. 303 U.S. at 383. The federal income tax in the Coronado case was levied upon the lessee of state school lands. Cf. note 32 supra. [34] Among the cases which one or the other of respondents attempts to distinguish on the ground that the tax was imposed on an independent contractor rather than a "true Federal instrumentality" are: James v. Dravo Contracting Co., <targetCase>302 U.S. 134</targetCase> ; Buckstaff Co. v. McKinley, 308 U.S. 358 ; Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U.S. 1 ; and Wilson v. Cook, 327 U.S. 474 . It is also contended that cases sustaining taxes on the property of a federal instrumentality, e.g., Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5 ; Alward v. Johnson, 282 U.S. 509 ; Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, 288 U.S. 325 , are not inconsistent with the view they ask us to take. Cf. Part I supra. [35] The incongruity of the doctrine respondents ask us to perpetuate is underscored by decisions subsequent to the Mountain Producers case withdrawing income tax immunity for state and federal official salaries.

§ 189.16 . And rental and royalty payments provided for by the Department of the Interior are the same for lands allotted under the General Allotment Act as they are for lands of members of the Five Civilized Tribes, 25 C.F.R. §§ 183.24 , 189.16. Production from the latter lands has been subject to Oklahoma's gross production tax since 1928. See note 42 infra. The Government, in its brief amicus curiae, states that, because differences in the value of different tracts of land would be reflected in the bonuses which lessees are willing to pay, an exact comparison of bonuses is impossible. [37] See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., <targetCase>302 U.S. 134</targetCase> , 160-161; Pittman v. Home Owners Corp., 308 U.S. 21 , 32-33; Maricopa County v. Valley Bank, 318 U.S. 357 , 361; Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U.S. 705 , 715-719; Oklahoma Tax Commission v. United States, 319 U.S. 598 , 606-607; Mayo v. United States, 319 U.S. 441 , 446; Smith v. Davis, 323 U.S. 111 , 116-119. [38] See Cohen, op. cit. supra note 5, at 255-256. [39] 41 Stat. 1250 . As has been stated, Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, 296 U.S. 521 , held that this statute did not authorize the imposition of the state's petroleum excise tax.
