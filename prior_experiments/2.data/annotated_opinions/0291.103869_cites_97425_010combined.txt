For as to them a totally different principle comes into operation, namely, the special status of Indians during the whole course of our constitutional and legal history. There can be no doubt of Congress' plenary power to exempt Indians and their property from all forms of state taxation. Such power exists to prevent impairment of the manner in, or means by which Congress effectuates its Indian policy, at least so long as Congress has not determined that the interests of the Indians require their complete release from tutelage or the final termination of the United States' guardian hip over them.

7 And Congress was careful to provide that nothing in the creation of the State of Oklahoma should qualify this promise. Thus the Oklahoma Enabling Act ( 34 Stat. 267 ) provided that the Oklahoma Constitution should not 'limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.' The constitution adopted by the people of Oklahoma renounced any claims to Indian lands (Art. 1, § 3), and exempted from taxation 'such property as may be exempt by reason of treaty stipulations, existing between the Indians and the United States government, or by Federal laws, during the force and effect of such treaties or Federal laws' (Art. X, § 6). See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., <targetCase>221 U.S. 286</targetCase> , 309, <targetCase>31 S.Ct. 578</targetCase> , 583, 55 L.Ed. 738 ; Ex parte Webb, 225 U.S. 663 , 682, 683, 32 S.Ct. 769 , 775, 776, 56 L.Ed. 1248 ; Ward v.

1054 ; cf. State of Minnesota v. United States, 305 U.S. 382 , 59 S.Ct. 292 , 83 L.Ed. 235 . Both devices had a common purpose, to protect a dependent people against loss of their property through their own improvidence or the greed of others during the period of transition in which they began to assume the responsibilities of citizenship. To achieve this purpose the protection afforded by Congress was not niggardly. See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., <targetCase>221 U.S. 286</targetCase> , <targetCase>31 S.Ct. 578</targetCase> , 55 L.Ed. 738 ; Heckman v. United States, 224 U.S. 413 , 32 S.Ct. 424 , 56 L.Ed. 820 ; Brader v. James, 246 U.S. 88 , 38 S.Ct. 285 , 62 L.Ed. 591 . 36 State taxation of 'restricted' lands as well as taxation of 'trust' lands, in the absence of Congressional authorization, is a possible cause of the loss which Congress has said shall not occur.
