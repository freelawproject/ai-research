 8 In addi *643 tion, because 70% to 75%• of the coal-bearing land in Montana is owned by the Federal Government, Montana derives a large amount of coal mining revenue from the United States as well, 9 In light of these circumstances, the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee of the United States House of Representatives concluded that Montana’s coal severance tax results in revenues “far in excess of the direct and indirect impact costs attributable to the coal production.” H. R. Rep. No. 96-1527, pt. 1, p. 2 (1980).  Several commentators have agreed that Montana and other similarly situated Western States have pursued a policy of “OPEC-like revenue maximization,” and that the Montana tax accordingly bears no reasonable relationship to the services and protection afforded by the State.  R. Nehring & B. Zycher with J. Wharton, Coal Development and Government Regulation in the Northern Great Plains: A Preliminary Report 148 (1976); Church, at 272.  See Krutilla, at 185.  These findings, of course, are not dispositive of the issue whether the Montana severance tax is “fairly related” to the services *644 provided by the State within the meaning of our prior cases. They do suggest, however, that appellants’ claim is a substantial one.  The failure of the Court to acknowledge this stems, it seems to me, from a misreading of our prior cases. It is to those cases that I now turn.  h — t hH This Court’s Commerce Clause cases have been marked by-tension between two competing concepts: the view that interstate commerce should enjoy a “free trade” immunity from state taxation, see, e. g., Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249, 252 (1946), and the view that interstate commerce may be required to “ 'pay its way,’ ” see, e. g., Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, <citedDecision>303 U. S. 250, 254</citedDecision> (1938).  See generally Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., at 278-281, 288-289, n. 15 ; Simet & Lynn, Interstate Commerce Must Pay Its Way: The Demise of Spector, 31 Nat. Tax J. 53 (1978); Hellerstein, Foreword, State Taxation Under the Commerce Clause: An Historical Perspective, 29 Yand.  L. Rev. 335, 335-339 (1976).  In Complete Auto Transit, the Court resolved that tension by unanimously reaffirming that interstate commerce is not immune from state taxation.  430 U. S., at 288 .  But at the same time the Court made clear that not all state taxation of interstate commerce is valid; a state tax will be sustained against Commerce Clause challenge only if “the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.” Id., at 279 .  See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 754 (1981).

 Ante, at 626.  This interpretation emasculates the fourth prong.  No trial will ever be necessary on the issue of fair relationship so long as a State is careful to impose a proportional rather than a flat tax rate; thus, the Court’s rule is no less “mechanical” than the approach entertained in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245 (1922), disapproved today, ante, at 617.  10 Under the Court’s reasoning, any ad valorem tax will satisfy the fourth prong; indeed, the Court implicitly ratifies Montana’s contention that it is free to tax this coal at 100% or even 1,000% of value, should it *646 choose to do so. Tr. of Oral Arg. 21.  Likewise, the Court’s analysis indicates that Montana’s severance tax would not run afoul of the Commerce Clause even if it raised sufficient revenue to allow Montana to eliminate all other taxes upon its citizens.  11 The Court’s prior cases neither require nor support such a startling result.  12 The Court often has noted that “‘[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business.’ ” Complete Auto Transit, 430 U. S., at 279 (emphasis added), quoting Western Live Stock, <citedDecision>303 U. S., at 254</citedDecision> .  See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 754 .  Accordingly, *647 interstate commerce cannot claim any exemption from a state tax that “is fairly related to the services provided by the State.” Complete Auto Transit, 430 U. S., at 279 .  We have not interpreted this requirement of “fair relation” in a narrow sense; interstate commerce may be required to share equally with intrastate commerce the cost of providing “police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and ‘the advantages of a civilized society.’ ” Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980), quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 445 (1979).  See, e. g., Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S. 416, 433 (1946).  Moreover, interstate commerce can be required to “pay its own way” in a narrower sense as well: the State may tax interstate commerce for the purpose of recovering those costs attributable to the activity itself.  See, e. g., Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252 (1919).
