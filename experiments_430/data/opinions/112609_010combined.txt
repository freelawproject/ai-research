  This case arose over an unpaid bill for fuels acquired for the vessel,
  <em>
   Green Harbour ex William Hooper (Hooper).
  </em>
  The
  <em>
   Hooper
  </em>
  is owned by respondent Central Gulf Lines, Inc. (Central Gulf) and was chartered by the Waterman Steamship Corporation (Waterman) for use in maritime commerce. Petitioner Exxon Corporation (Exxon) was Waterman’s exclusive worldwide supplier of gas and bunker fuel oil for some 40 years.
 </p>
<p id="A_3">
  In 1983, Waterman and Exxon negotiated a marine fuel requirements contract. Under the terms of the contract, upon request, Exxon would supply Waterman’s vessels with marine fuels when the vessels called at ports where Exxon could supply the fuels directly. Alternatively, in ports where Exxon had to rely on local suppliers, Exxon would arrange for the local supplier to provide Waterman vessels with fuel. In such cases, Exxon would pay the local supplier for the fuel and then invoice Waterman. Thus, while Exxon’s contractual obligation was to provide Waterman’s vessels with fuel when Waterman placed an order, it met that obligation sometimes in the capacity of “seller” and other times in the capacity of “agent.”
 </p>
<p id="A_i9">
  In the transaction at issue here, Exxon acted as Waterman’s agent, procuring bunker fuel for the
  <em>
   Hooper
  </em>
  from Arabian Marine Operating Co. (Arabian Marine) of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In October 1983, Arabian Marine delivered over 4,000 tons of fuel to the
  <em>
   Hooper
  </em>
  in Jeddah and invoiced Exxon for the cost of the fuel. Exxon paid for the fuel and invoiced Waterman, in turn, for $763,644. Shortly thereafter, Waterman sought reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; Waterman never paid the full amount
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="606"> 
   *606
   </span>
  of the fuel bill. During the reorganization proceedings, Central Gulf agreed to assume personal liability for the unpaid bill if a court were to hold the
  <em>
   Hooper
  </em>
  liable
  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  for that cost.
 </p>
<p id="b660-5">
  Subsequently, Exxon commenced this litigation in federal district court against Central Gulf
  <em>
   in personam
  </em>
  and against the
  <em>
   Hooper in rem.
  </em>
  Exxon claimed to have a maritime lien on the

That the money advanced and paid for respondents was, in whole or in part, to pay bills due by a steamboat for repairs or supplies, will not make the transaction maritime, or give the libellant a remedy in admiralty.

  appears to have rested on two rationales: (1) that the agent’s claim was nothing more than a “demand for a balance of accounts” which could be remedied at common law through an action of
  <em>
   assumpsit;
  </em>
  and (2) that the agent had no contractual or legal right to advance monies “on the credit, pledge, or security of the vessel.” The first rationale appears to be an application of the then-accepted rule that “the

  admiralty has no jurisdiction at all in matters of account between part owners,”

S. 532, 534</a></span> (1956) (“A line of authorities emerged to the effect that admiralty had no jurisdiction to grant relief in such cases”). The second rationale appears to be premised on the then-accepted rule that a contract would not be deemed maritime absent a “hypothecation” or a pledge by the vessel’s owner of the vessel as security for debts created pursuant to the contract. In other words, to sue in admiralty on a contract, the claimant had to have some form of a lien interest in the vessel, even if the action was one

  the Court held that an action cognizable as

  There remains the question whether admiralty jurisdiction extends to Exxon’s claim regarding the delivery of fuel in Jeddah. We conclude that it does. Like the District Court, we believe it is clear that when Exxon directly supplies marine fuels to Waterman’s ships, the arrangement is maritime in nature.

  The subject matter of the Jeddah claim, like the New York claim, is the value of the fuel received by the ship. Because the nature and subject-matter of the two transactions are the same as they relate to maritime commerce, if admiralty jurisdiction extends to one, it must extend to the other. Cf.

   As noted, the District Court regarded the services performed by Exxon in the Jeddah transaction as “preliminary” and characterized the rule excluding agency contracts from admiralty as “a subset” of the preliminary contract doctrine. See
