**Concurrence Opinion**
 The “Ex Post Facto” Clause of the Constitution 1 has been construed to embrace any law that deprives a person accused of crime of a “substantial protection” that the law afforded at the time of the alleged offense.  Thus, the Clause prohibits not only the retroactive creation of new criminal offenses and more harsh penalties, but also substantial changes in procedure that are designed to protect the defendant from a wrongful conviction.  The question in this case is whether a law that changed a postconviction remedy for an erroneous sentence — by conforming it to the law in effect at the time of the offense instead of affording the defendant a new trial on all issues — effected a “substantial” deprivation within the meaning of our cases. I agree with the Court’s conclu *53 sion that the new law did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause, but I believe that conclusion is entirely consistent with our precedents.  I Respondent committed a crime that was punishable by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and was convicted on March 17, 1982.  Under Texas law, it was the jury’s task to impose sentence as well as to determine guilt or innocence.  By consequence of a faulty instruction, respondent was improperly sentenced to life imprisonment and a fine of $10,000.  The following year, in Bogany v. State, <citedDecision>661 S. W. 2d 957</citedDecision> (1983), the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held in a somewhat similar case that the fine was not authorized by law, and that no reviewing court had authority to correct such an erroneous sentence.  Instead, the entire judgment was deemed “void” and the defendant was entitled to a new trial. 2 Understandably, the Texas Legislature recognized that corrective legislation was in order, for it is difficult to understand why an error in sentencing should necessitate a second trial on the issue of guilt or innocence.  *54 Theoretically, the legislature might have remedied the situation in either of two ways.  It might have authorized a punishment of both life imprisonment and a $10,000 fine for respondent’s offense or, alternatively, it might have authorized a court to correct the sentence by eliminating the fine.  The former option would plainly have violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because it would have increased respondent’s punishment beyond the penalty authorized at the time of his offense.  The second option, which the Texas Legislature adopted, is not subject to that defect; nor does it criminalize previously innocent conduct or make any change in the procedures used to convict or to sentence respondent.  It created a new remedy designed to conform respondent’s sentence to that authorized by law at the time of his offense.

 It does, however, become insubstantial by failing to do so. Whatever else may be said of the factors that determine whether a procedural protection affects substantial rights, it is difficult to imagine how a retroactive law could, when viewed from the standpoint of the date the offense was committed, implicate substantial rights of any defendant if the law does no more than expand the flexibility of postconviction processes available to the State with respect to a defendant *61 who is subject to a valid conviction and sentence.  Indeed, respondent has barely even attempted to articulate any justification for the Texas procedure that the legislature abolished.  The mere possibility of a capricious and unlikely windfall is not the sort of procedural protection that could reasonably be judged substantial from the perspective of the defendant at the time the offense was committed.  Accordingly, I concur in the Court’s judgment, but not in its opinion.  Art. I, § 10, of the Constitution provides in part: “No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.” At the time of respondent’s offense, it apparently was well established under Texas law that, as a general proposition, when a criminal jury rendered a verdict not authorized by law the verdict was void at its inception.  See, e. g., Ex parte McIver, 586 S. W. 2d 851, 854 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979); Ocker v. State, 477 S. W. 2d 288, 290 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972).  However, until the Court of Criminal Appeals decided <citedDecision>Bogany</citedDecision> , there was some doubt both as to whether that general rule would apply to the error in this case and as to whether the sentence imposed by the jury in this case was in fact unlawful.  See, e. g., Adams v. State, 642 S. W. 2d 211, 213-214 (Tex. App. 1982) (reforming jury’s sentence); Bogany v. State, 646 S. W. 2d 663, 664-665 (Tex. App.) (stating that jury’s sentence could be reformed), rev’d, <citedDecision>661 S. W. 2d 957</citedDecision> (Tex. Crim. App. 1983); <citedDecision>id., at 960</citedDecision> (McCormick, J., dissenting) (contending that supplementary fine was authorized by law).  For purposes of this opinion, I assume that both the substantive limitation upon respondent’s sentence and the procedural limitation on the remedial powers of reviewing courts were law at the time that respondent’s offense was committed.  The Missouri Supreme Court relied upon the reasoning of the St. Louis Court of Appeals.  See State v. Kring, 74 Mo. 612, 631 (1881).  The relevant passage from the Court of Appeals opinion was quoted (and then disavowed) by this Court in Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221, 223-224 (1883): ‘“Formerly it was held in Missouri (State v. Ross, 29 Mo. 32 ) that, when a conviction is had of murder in the second degree on an indictment charging murder in the first degree, if this be set aside, the defendant cannot again be tried for murder in the first degree.  A change introduced by sect. 23 of art. 2 of the Constitution of 1875 has abrogated this rule.  On the oral argument something was said by counsel for the defendant to the effect that under the old rule defendant could not be put on his trial for murder in the first degree, and that he could not be affected by the change of the constitutional provision, the crime having been committed whilst the old constitution was in force.
