 , who brought with him the broken respirator.  Finding the equipment unusable, the PA gave Jones an injection of the tranquilizer, thorazine, to calm him.  Treatment with a tranquilizer was unquestionably contraindicated by Jones’ medical condition.  Twenty minutes later, Jones was dead.  “Conclusion: Jones, who was convicted of bank robbery and sentenced to 10 years in prison, was in fact, sentenced to death and was murdered by neglect.” 1 *421 The incident described above eventually came to the attention of this Court, which allowed Jones’ mother to pursue her civil rights action against prison officials.  Carlson v. Green, 446 U. S. 14 (1980).  Clearly the Labyrinth article’s report of inadequate medical treatment of federal prisoners raised “a matter that is both newsworthy and of great public importance.” Pell v. Procunier, <citedDecision>417 U. S. 817, 880, n. 7</citedDecision> (1974).  As the Court concedes, ante, at 407, both publishers and recipients of such criticism ordinarily enjoy the fullest First Amendment protections.  2 See <citedDecision>Pell, supra, at 822</citedDecision> ; Martin v. Struthers, 319 U. S. 141, 146-147 (1943).  Yet Labyrinth’s efforts to disseminate the article to its subscribers at Marion Federal Penitentiary met Government resistance.  Marion officials, acting within Federal Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) regulations, 3 returned the magazine on the ground that “the article entitled ‘Medical Murder’ would be detrimental to the good order and discipline of this institution .... [T]his type of philosophy could guide inmates in this institution into situations which could cause themselves and other inmates problems with the Medical Staff.” J. L. 12.  Two years after publication a Marion official testified that he *422 believed the article had posed no threat.  App. 104.  Nonetheless, the District Court below found the suppression of this and 45 other publications “reasonable,” and thus sustained the rejections wholesale.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a-34a, 47a.

 .  .  .  The wife of a prison inmate who is not permitted to read all that her husband wanted to say to her has suffered an abridgment of her interest in communicating with him as plain as that which results from censorship of her letter to him.” 416 U. S., at 408-409 (citations omitted).  The Court today abandons Martinez’s fundamental premise.  In my opinion its suggestion that three later opinions applying reasonableness standards warrant this departure, see ante, at 410, n. 9, is disingenuous.  Those cases did involve communications between inmates and outsiders; however, as I shall demonstrate, their legal and factual foundations differed critically from those in Martinez or in this case. In Pell v. Procunier, <citedDecision>417 U. S. 817</citedDecision> (1974), inmates and reporters challenged regulations prohibiting face-to-face media interviews with specific prisoners.  <citedDecision>Id., at 819</citedDecision> .  The infringement on prisoners’ rights, the Court held, was reasonable because prisoners could write letters to the media — a means of communication less disruptive than the physical entry of reporters into the prison.  <citedDecision>Id., at 824</citedDecision> .  The reporters’ assertion of a special right of access could not prevail, the Court explained, because the First Amendment does not give the media greater access to public events or institutions — including prisons — than it gives ordinary citizens.  9 <citedDecision>Id., at 835</citedDecision> .  <citedDecision>Pell</citedDecision> in no way diluted the basic distinction articulated in Martinez .  Inmates in Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., 433 U. S. 119 (1977), had maintained that First *426 Amendment associational rights protected their efforts to form a union.  The Court concluded that the administrators’ grounds for preventing union organizing within the prison— an activity occurring largely among inmates — were reasonable.  Id., at 129 .  It also approved the officials’ refusal to deliver bulk packets of union literature to specific inmates for distribution to others.  Applying Equal Protection Clause as well as First Amendment standards, the Court held that the restriction was reasonable because it was limited in scope and because the union retained “other avenues of outside informational flow .  .

 .” 28 CFR § 540.70 (a) (1988).  “The Warden may reject a publication only if it is determined detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity.” § 540.71(b).  See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, 422 (1974) (Marshall, J., concurring) (“A prisoner does not shed .  .  .  basic First Amendment rights at the prison gate”).  See also Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 84 (1987); Pell v. Procunier, <citedDecision>417 U. S. 817, 822</citedDecision> (1974); Coffin v. Reichard, 143 F. 2d 443, 445 (CA6 1944) (per curiam).  Suffice it to say that the problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree.  Most require expertise, comprehensive planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government.  For all of those reasons, courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform." Martinez , 416 11.  S., at 404-405.  It is obvious that Martinez calls for less than strict scrutiny, and the Court today correctly rejects petitioners’ argument to the contrary.
