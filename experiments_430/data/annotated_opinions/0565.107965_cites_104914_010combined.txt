 E. Dowell, A History of Criminal Syndicalism Legislation in the United States 21 (1939).  In 1927, this Court sustained the constitutionality of California's Criminal Syndicalism Act, Cal. Penal Code §§ 11400-11402 , the text of which is quite similar to that of the laws of Ohio.  Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357 (1927).  The Court upheld the statute on the ground that, without more, "advocating" violent means to effect political and economic change involves such danger to the security of the State that the State may outlaw it.  Cf. Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U. S. 380 (1927).  But Whitney has been thoroughly discredited by later decisions.  See Dennis v. United States, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 494, at 507</citedDecision> (1951).  These later decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.  [2] As we *448 said in Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 297-298 (1961), "the mere abstract teaching .  .  .  of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence, is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action." See also Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242, 259-261 (1937); Bond v. Floyd, 385 U. S. 116, 134 (1966).

 [3] Accordingly, we are here confronted with a statute which, by its own words and as applied, purports to punish mere advocacy and to forbid, on pain of criminal punishment, assembly with others merely to advocate the described type of action.  [4] Such a statute falls within the condemnation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The contrary teaching of Whitney v. California, supra , cannot be supported, and that decision is therefore overruled.  Reversed.  MR. JUSTICE BLACK, concurring.  I agree with the views expressed by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS in his concurring opinion in this case that the "clear and present danger" doctrine should have no place *450 in the interpretation of the First Amendment.  I join the Court's opinion, which, as I understand it, simply cites Dennis v. United States, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 494</citedDecision> (1951), but does not indicate any agreement on the Court's part with the "clear and present danger" doctrine on which <citedDecision>Dennis</citedDecision> purported to rely.  MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.  While I join the opinion of the Court, I desire to enter a caveat.  The "clear and present danger" test was adumbrated by Mr. Justice Holmes in a case arising during World War Ia war "declared" by the Congress, not by the Chief Executive.  The case was Schenck v. United States, 249 U. S. 47, 52 , where the defendant was charged with attempts to cause insubordination in the military and obstruction of enlistment.  The pamphlets that were distributed urged resistance to the draft, denounced conscription, and impugned the motives of those backing the war effort.  The First Amendment was tendered as a defense.

 If in the long run the beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of the community, the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way." We have never been faithful to the philosophy of that dissent.  *453 The Court in Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242 , overturned a conviction for exercising First Amendment rights to incite insurrection because of lack of evidence of incitement.  Id., at 259-261 .  And see Hartzel v. United States, 322 U. S. 680 .  In Bridges v. California, 314 U. S. 252, 261-263 , we approved the "clear and present danger" test in an elaborate dictum that tightened it and confined it to a narrow category.  But in Dennis v. United States, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 494</citedDecision> , we opened wide the door, distorting the "clear and present danger" test beyond recognition.  [1] In that case the prosecution dubbed an agreement to teach the Marxist creed a "conspiracy." The case was submitted to a jury on a charge that the jury could not convict unless it found that the defendants "intended to overthrow the Government `as speedily as circumstances would permit.' " <citedDecision>Id., at 509-511</citedDecision> .  The Court sustained convictions under that charge, construing it to mean a determination of " `whether the gravity of the "evil," discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.' " [2] <citedDecision>Id., at 510</citedDecision> , quoting from United States v. Dennis, 183 F. 2d 201, 212 .  Out of the "clear and present danger" test came other offspring.  Advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow of government as an abstract principle is immune from prosecution.  Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 318 .  But an "active" member, who has a guilty knowledge and intent of the aim to overthrow the Government *454 by violence, Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290 , may be prosecuted.  Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 228 .  And the power to investigate, backed by the powerful sanction of contempt, includes the power to determine which of the two categories fits the particular witness.

"Bury the niggers." "We intend to do our part." "Give us our state rights." "Freedom for the whites." "Nigger will have to fight for every inch he gets from now on." [2]  It was on the theory that the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 670 , 18 U. S. C. § 2385 , embodied such a principle and that it had been applied only in conformity with it that this Court sustained the Act's constitutionality.  Dennis v. United States, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 494</citedDecision> (1951).  That this was the basis for Dennis was emphasized in Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 320-324 (1957), in which the Court overturned convictions for advocacy of the forcible overthrow of the Government under the Smith Act, because the trial judge's instructions had allowed conviction for mere advocacy, unrelated to its tendency to produce forcible action.  [3]  The first count of the indictment charged that appellant "did unlawfully by word of mouth advocate the necessity, or propriety of crime, violence, or unlawful methods of terrorism as a means of accomplishing political reform .  .  .  ." The second count charged that appellant "did unlawfully voluntarily assemble with a group or assemblage of persons formed to advocate the doctrines of criminal syndicalism .
