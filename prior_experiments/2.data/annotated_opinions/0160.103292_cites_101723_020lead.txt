Whether the transfer made by the decedent in his lifetime is “intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death” by reason of that which he retained, is the crux of the problem. We must put to one side questions that arise under sections of the estate tax law other than § 302 (c) — sections, that is, relating to transfers taking place at death. Section 302 (c) deals with *111 property not technically passing at death but with interests theretofore created. The taxable event is a transfer inter vivos. But the measure of the tax is the value of the transferred property at the time when death brings it into enjoyment. We turn to the cases which beget the difficulties. In Klein v. United <targetCase>States, supra</targetCase>, decided in 1931, the decedent during his lifetime had conveyed land to his wife for her lifetime, “and if she shall die prior to the decease of said grantor then and in that event she shall by virtue hereof take no greater or other estate in said lands and the reversion in fee in and to the same shall in that event remain vested in said grantor, . . .” The instrument further provided, “Upon condition and in the event that said grantee shall survive the said grantor, then and in that case only the said grantee shall by virtue of this conveyance take, have, and hold the said lands in fee simple, . . .” The taxpayer contended that the decedent had reserved a mere “possibility of reverter” and that such a “remote interest,” 2 extinguishable upon the grantor’s death, was not sufficient to bring the conveyance within the reckoning of the taxable estate. This Court held otherwise. It rejected formal distinctions pertaining to the law of real property as irrelevant criteria in this field of taxation. “Nothing is to be gained,” it was said, “by multiplying words in respect of the various niceties of the art of conveyancing or the law of contingent and vested remainders. It is perfectly plain that ‘'the death of the grantor was the indispensable and intended event which brought the larger estate into being for the grantee and effected its transmission from the dead to the living, thus satisfying the terms of the taxing act and justifying the tax imposed.” Klein v. United <targetCase>States, supra</targetCase>, at 234. *112 The inescapable rationale of this decision, rendered by a unanimous Court, was that the statute taxes, not merely those interests which are deemed to pass at death according to refined technicalities of the law of property. It also taxes inter vivos transfers that are too much akin to testamentary dispositions not to be subjected to the same excise. By bringing into the gross estate at his death that which the. settlor gave contingently upon it, this Court fastened on the vital factor. It refused to subordinate the plain purposes of a modern fiscal measure to^the wholly unrelated origins of the recondite learning of ancient property law. Surely the Klein decision was not intended to encourage the belief that a change merely in the phrasing of a grant would serve to create a judicially cognizable difference in the scope of § 302 (c), although the grantor retained in himself the possibility of regaining the transferred property upon precisely the same contingency.

. . However we label the device it is . but a means by which the gift, is rendered incomplete until the donor’s death.” 296 U. S. at 47. For the majority in the St. Louis Trust Company cases, these practicalities had less significance than the formal categories of property law. The grantor’s death, the majority said, in Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., “simply put an end to what, at best, wás a mere possibility óf a reverter by extinguishing it — that is to say, by converting what was merely possible into an utter impossibility.” 296 U. S. *115 39, 43. This was precisely the mode of argument which had been rejected in Klein v. United <targetCase>States, supra</targetCase>. We are now asked to accept all three decisions as constituting a .coherent body of law, and to apply their distinctions to the trusts before us. In Nos. 110, 111 and 112 (Helvering v. Hallock) the decedent in 1919 created a trust under a separation agreement, giving 'the income to his wife for life, with this further provision: “If and when Anne Lamson Hallock shall die then and in such event . . . the within trust shall terminate and said Trustee shall .
