**Combined Opinion**
 The District Court concluded that, by virtue of the dismissal of his appeal by the Virginia Supreme Court in state habeas, Coleman had procedurally defaulted the seven claims.  App. 38-39.  The District Court nonetheless went on to address the merits of all 11 of Coleman's claims.  The court ruled against Coleman on all of the claims and denied the petition.  Id., at 40-52.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  <citedDecision>895 F. 2d 139</citedDecision> (1990).  The court held that Coleman had defaulted all of the claims that he had presented for the first time in state habeas.  Coleman argued that the Virginia Supreme Court had not "clearly and expressly" stated that its decision in state habeas was based on a procedural default, and therefore the federal courts could not treat it as such under the rule of Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255 (1989).  The Fourth Circuit disagreed.  It concluded that the Virginia Supreme Court had met the "plain statement" requirement of Harris by granting a motion to dismiss that was based solely on procedural grounds.  <citedDecision>895 F. 2d, at 143</citedDecision> .  The Fourth Circuit held that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision *729 rested on independent and adequate state grounds and that Coleman had not shown cause to excuse the default.  <citedDecision>Id., at 143-144</citedDecision> .  As a consequence, federal review of the claims Coleman presented only in the state habeas proceeding was barred.  <citedDecision>Id., at 144</citedDecision> .  We granted certiorari, 498 U. S. 937 (1990), to resolve several issues concerning the relationship between state procedural defaults and federal habeas review, and now affirm.  II A This Court will not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.  See, e. g., Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, 296 U. S. 207, 210 (1935); Klinger v. Missouri, 13 Wall. 257, 263 (1872).  This rule applies whether the state law ground is substantive or procedural.  See, e. g., Fox Film, supra ; Herndon v. Georgia, 295 U. S. 441 (1935).  In the context of direct review of a state court judgment, the independent and adequate state ground doctrine is jurisdictional.
**Combined Opinion**
 The court in O'Brien did conduct such a review, but the court also explicitly declined to announce a rule that there is a constitutional exception to the time requirement for filing a notice of appeal.  There is no evidence other than O'Brien that the Virginia Supreme Court has ever conducted such a review, and O'Brien explicitly declined to announce such a *744 practice.  We decline Coleman's invitation to announce such a practice for that court. Finally, Coleman argues that the Virginia Supreme Court's dismissal order in this case is at least ambiguous because it was issued "[u]pon consideration" of all the filed papers, including Coleman's petition for appeal and the Commonwealth's brief in opposition, both of which discussed the merits of Coleman's federal claims.  There is no doubt that the Virginia Supreme Court's "consideration" of all filed papers adds some ambiguity, but we simply cannot read it as overriding the court's explicit grant of a dismissal motion based solely on procedural grounds.  Those grounds are independent of federal law. Coleman contends also that the procedural bar was not adequate to support the judgment.  Coleman did not petition for certiorari on this question, and we therefore accept the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the bar was adequate.  See <citedDecision>895 F. 2d, at 143</citedDecision> .  IV In Daniels v. Allen , the companion case to Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953), we confronted a situation nearly identical to that here.  Petitioners were convicted in a North Carolina trial court and then were one day late in filing their appeal as of right in the North Carolina Supreme Court. That court rejected the appeals as procedurally barred.  We held that federal habeas was also barred unless petitioners could prove that they were "detained without opportunity to appeal because of lack of counsel, incapacity, or some interference by officials." Id., at 485-486 .  Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963), overruled this holding.  Noia failed to appeal at all in state court his state conviction, and then sought federal habeas review of his claim that his confession had been coerced.
