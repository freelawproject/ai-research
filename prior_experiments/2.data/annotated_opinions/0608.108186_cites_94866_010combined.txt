[19] Some have suggested that the number 12 was fixed upon simply because that was the number of the presentment jury from the hundred, from which the petit jury developed. [20] *88 Other, less circular but more fanciful reasons for the number 12 have been given, "but they were all brought forward after the number was fixed," [21] and rest on little more than mystical or superstitious insights into the significance of "12." Lord Coke's explanation that the " number of twelve is much respected in holy writ, as 12 apostles, 12 stones, 12 tribes, etc., " [22] is typical. [23] In *89 short, while sometime in the 14th century the size of the jury at common law came to be fixed generally at 12, [24] that particular feature of the jury system appears to have been a historical accident, unrelated to the great *90 purposes which gave rise to the jury in the first place. [25] The question before us is whether this accidental feature of the jury has been immutably codified into our Constitution. This Court's earlier decisions have assumed an affirmative answer to this question. The leading case so construing the Sixth Amendment is Thompson v. Utah, <targetCase>170 U.S. 343</targetCase> (1898). There the defendant had been tried and convicted by a 12-man jury for a crime committed in the Territory of Utah. A new trial was granted, but by that time Utah had been admitted as a State. The defendant's new trial proceeded under Utah's Constitution, providing for a jury of only eight members. This Court reversed the resulting conviction, holding that Utah's constitutional provision was an ex post facto law as applied to the defendant. In reaching its conclusion, the Court announced that the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the defendant's trial when Utah was a Territory, and that the jury referred to in the Amendment was a jury "constituted, as it was at common law, of twelve persons, neither more nor less." 170 U.S. , at 349 . Arguably unnecessary for the result, [26] *91 this announcement was supported simply by referring to the Magna Carta, [27] and by quoting passages from treatises which notedwhat has already been seen that at common law the jury did indeed consist of 12. Noticeably absent was any discussion of the essential step in the argument: namely, that every feature of the jury as it existed at common lawwhether incidental or essential to that institutionwas necessarily included in the Constitution wherever that document referred to a "jury." [28] Subsequent decisions have reaffirmed the *92 announcement in <targetCase>Thompson</targetCase>, often in dictum [29] and usually by relyingwhere there was any discussion of the issue at allsolely on the fact that the common-law jury consisted of 12. [30] See Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276 , 288 (1930); [31] Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U.S. 516 , 519 (1905); Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U.S. 581 , 586 (1900). While "the intent of the Framers" is often an elusive quarry, the relevant constitutional history casts considerable doubt on the easy assumption in our past decisions that if a given feature existed in a jury at common law in 1789, then it was necessarily preserved in the Constitution. *93 Provisions for jury trial were first placed in the Constitution in Article III's provision that "[t]he Trial of all Crimes . . . shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed."

And I agree with *117 the Court that the same "trial by jury" is guaranteed to state defendants by the Fourteenth Amendment as to federal defendants by the Sixth. "Once it is decided that a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is `fundamental to the American scheme of justice' . . . the same constitutional standards apply against both the State and Federal Governments." Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 , 795 (1969). At the same time, I adhere to the decision of the Court in Thompson v. Utah, <targetCase>170 U.S. 343</targetCase> , 349 (1898), that the jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment consists "of twelve persons, neither more nor less." As I see it, the Court has not made out a convincing case that the Sixth Amendment should be read differently than it was in <targetCase>Thompson</targetCase> even if the matter were now before us de novo much less that an unbroken line of precedent going back over 70 years should be overruled. The arguments made by MR. JUSTICE HARLAN in Part IB of his opinion persuade me that <targetCase>Thompson</targetCase> was right when decided and still states sound doctrine. I am equally convinced that the requirement of 12 should be applied to the States. MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, dissenting in No. 188, ante, p. 66, and concurring in the result in No. 927. In Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968), the Court held, over my dissent, joined by MR. JUSTICE STEWART, that a state criminal defendant is entitled to a jury trial in any case which, if brought in a federal court, would require a jury under the Sixth Amendment. Today the Court concludes, in No.

What if New York, now compelled by virtue of Baldwin to provide juries for the trial of misdemeanors, concludes that three jurors are adequate "interposition between the accused and his accuser of the common-sense judgment of a group of laymen," and constitute adequate "community participation and [provide] shared responsibility which results from that group's determination of guilt or innocence"? The Court's elaboration of what is required provides no standard and vexes the meaning of the right to a jury trial in federal courts, as well as state courts, by uncertainty. Can it be doubted that a unanimous jury of 12 provides a greater safeguard than a majority vote of six? The uncertainty that will henceforth plague the meaning of trial by jury is itself a further sufficient reason for not hoisting the anchor to history. 2. The circumvention of history is compounded by the cavalier disregard of numerous pronouncements of this Court that reflect the understanding of the jury as one of 12 members and have fixed expectations accordingly. Thus in <targetCase>Thompson</targetCase> v. <targetCase>Utah</targetCase> a unanimous Court answered in the affirmative the question whether the Sixth Amendment jury "is a jury constituted, as it was at common law, of twelve persons, neither more nor less." <targetCase>170 U.S. 343</targetCase> , 349 (1898), [12] and it appears that before Duncan no Justice of this Court has seen fit to question this holding, one that has often been reiterated. See Patton v. United States, 281 U.S. 276 , 288 (1930), where *127 the Court reaffirmed earlier pronouncements and stated that the Sixth Amendment jury is characterized by three essential features: "(1) that the jury should consist of twelve men, neither more nor less; (2) that the trial should be in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge having power to instruct them as to the law and advise them in respect of the facts; and (3) that the verdict should be unanimous." See also Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U.S. 581 , 586 (1900); Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U.S. 516 , 527 (1905); Andres v. United States, 333 U.S. 740 , 748 (1948) (unanimity). [13] As Mr. Justice Frankfurter stated in Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386 , 392 (1958), in applying a constitutional provision "rooted in history . . . a long course of adjudication in this Court carries impressive authority."

[26] At the time of the crime and at the first trial the statutes of the Territory of Utahwholly apart from the Sixth Amendment ensured Thompson a 12-man jury. See 170 U.S. , at 345 . The Court found the ex post facto question easy to resolve, once it was assumed that Utah's subsequent constitutional provision deprived Thompson of a right previously guaranteed him by the United States Constitution; the possibility that the same result might have been reached solely on the basis of the rights formerly accorded Thompson under the territorial statute was hinted at, but was not explicitly considered. [27] Whether or not the Magna Carta's reference to a judgment by one's peers was a reference to a "jury"a fact that historians now dispute, see, e. g., 1 F. Pollock & F. Maitland, The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I, p. 173 n. 3 (2d ed. 1909); Frankfurter & Corcoran, Petty Federal Offenses and the Constitutional Guaranty of Trial by Jury, 39 Harv. L. Rev. 917, 922 n. 14 (1926) (criticizing <targetCase>Thompson</targetCase> v. <targetCase>Utah</targetCase> 's reliance on the document "long after scholars had exposed this ancient error") it seems clear that the Great Charter is not authority for fixing the number of the jury at 12. See W. Mckechnie, Magna Carta 134-138, 375-382 (1958); Scott, Trial by Jury and the Reform of Civil Procedure, 31 Harv. L. Rev. 669, 672 (1918). As the text indicates, the question is not whether the 12-man jury is traced to 1215 or to 1789, but whether that particular feature must be accepted as a sine qua non of the jury trial guaranteed by the Constitution. See Heller, supra, n. 25, at 64. [28] The <targetCase>Thompson</targetCase> opinion also reasoned that if a jury can be reduced from 12 to eight, then there was nothing to prevent its similarly being reduced to four or two or even zero, thus dispensing with the jury altogether. See 170 U.S. , at 353 . That bit of "logic," resurrected today in MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S concurring opinion, post, at 126, suffers somewhat as soon as one recognizes that he can get off the "slippery slope" before he reaches the bottom. We have no occasion in this case to determine what minimum number can still constitute a "jury," but we do not doubt that six is above that minimum. [29] A ruling that the Sixth Amendment refers to a common-law jury was essential to the holding in Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U.S. 516 (1905), where the Court held invalid a conviction by a six-man jury in Alaska. The ruling was accepted at the Government's concession without discussion or citation; the major focus of the case was on the question whether the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the territory in question at all. See 197 U.S. , at 519 . [30] Similarly, cases interpreting the jury trial provisions of the Seventh Amendment generally leap from the fact that the jury possessed a certain feature at common law to the conclusion that that feature must have been preserved by the Amendment's simple reference to trial by "jury." E. g., Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U.S. 1 , 13-14 (1899); American Publishing Co. v. Fisher, 166 U.S. 464 , 468 (1897). While much of our discussion in this case may be thought to bear equally on the interpretation of the Seventh Amendment's jury trial provisions, we emphasize that the question is not before us; we do not decide whether, for example, additional references to the "common law" that occur in the Seventh Amendment might support a different interpretation. See infra, at 97 and n. 44. [31] The Patton opinion furnishes an interesting illustration of the Court's willingness to re-examine earlier assertions about the nature of "jury trial" in almost every respect except the 12-man-jury requirement. Patton reaffirmed the 12-man requirement with a simple citation to <targetCase>Thompson</targetCase> v. <targetCase>Utah</targetCase> , while at the same time discarding as "dictum" the equally dogmatic assertion in <targetCase>Thompson</targetCase> that the requirement could not be waived. See 281 U.S. , at 293 . [32] U. S. Const., Art. III, § 2, cl. 3. [33] Frankfurter & Corcoran, supra, n. 27, at 969.
