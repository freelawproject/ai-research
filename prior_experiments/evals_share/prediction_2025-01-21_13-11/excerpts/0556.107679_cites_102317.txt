Case of interest: McNally v. Hill (1934)
-----------------------
J. Kirby, Jr., argued the cause for respondents, pro hac vice. With him on the brief was Thomas S. Currier.

MR. CHIEF JUSTICE WARREN delivered the opinion of the Court.
This case concerns the scope of 28 U.S. C. § 2241 (c) (3), which specifies that the United States District Courts may issue writs of habeas corpus on behalf of prisoners who are "in custody in violation of the Constitution . . . of the United States." The question presented is whether a district court may entertain a petition for a writ of habeas corpus from a prisoner incarcerated under consecutive sentences who claims that a sentence that he is scheduled to serve in the future is invalid because of a deprivation of rights guaranteed by the Constitution. The Court considered this issue in McNally v. Hill, <caseOfInterest>293 U.S. 131 </caseOfInterest>(1934), and held that the habeas corpus statute does not authorize attacks upon future consecutive sentences. We granted certiorari in this case to re-examine McNally. 389 U.S. 1035 (1968). We conclude that the decision in that case was compelled neither by statute nor by history and that today it represents an indefensible barrier to prompt adjudication of constitutional claims in the federal courts.
Respondents, Robert Rowe and Clyde Thacker, are serving prison terms in the Virginia State Penitentiary. In June 1963 Rowe was sentenced to 30 years' imprisonment after a jury found him guilty of rape. Subsequently, he pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with felonious abduction with intent to defile arising from the same events which had led to the rape conviction.[1] He *56 was sentenced to a 20-year term on this conviction to run consecutively to the 30-year sentence. After exhausting state remedies,[2] Rowe petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District

. C. §§ 2312-2313).[15] He had been sentenced to two years on the first count and four years each on the second and third counts, the sentences on the first and second counts to run concurrently *61 and the sentence on the third consecutively. In his application in a district court for a writ of habeas corpus, McNally claimed that the indictment failed to state an offense as to the third count. He did not attack the convictions under the first and second counts. When he filed his petition he was serving under the second count. The lower courts denied relief on the merits. But this Court affirmed on a jurisdictional ground, holding that because McNally had not begun to serve the sentence on the third countand therefore was not "in custody" under that sentencehis petition for relief was premature:
"[W]ithout restraint which is unlawful, the writ may not be used. A sentence which the prisoner has not begun to serve cannot be the cause of restraint which the statute makes the subject of <caseOfInterest>inquiry." 293 U.S., at 138</caseOfInterest>.
The effect of this disposition was ameliorated somewhat by the Court's suggestion that McNally might seek relief by another route. Id., at 140. See also Holiday v. Johnston, 313 U.S. 342, 349 (1941). But cf. Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546 (1941). Moreover, McNally's challenge was directed at the face of the indictment. Therefore, postponement of adjudication of his claims probably would not have resulted in the loss of crucial evidence. But the harshness of a rule which may delay determination of federal claims for decades becomes obvious when applied to the cases of Rowe and Thacker. Their cases also exemplify the manner in which the decision in McNally cuts against the prior and subsequent development of the writ in the federal courts.
Both Rowe and Thacker allege that they were so inadequately represented at trial that they were denied the assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Petitioner concedes that, but for *62 McNally, respondents' allegations

good time," the 30-year sentence will expire in 1982. Under the two sentences, he will be eligible for parole in 1974. If he were relieved of the 20-year term, he would be eligible for parole in 1970. See Va. Code Ann. § 53-251 (1967).
[4]  These sentences were originally suspended, but the suspension was revoked in 1956.
[5]  If Thacker does not receive good-time credit, he will commence service of the three sentences in 2009. He will be eligible for parole in 1976.
[6]  The decision of the Court of Appeals in the present case was preceded by two cases in which it held that § 2241 (c) (3) permits attack upon a future consecutive sentence which affects or may affect a prisoner's current parole eligibility. Williams v. Peyton, 372 F.2d 216 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1967); Martin v. Virginia, 349 F.2d 781 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1965). In McNally, the Court rejected the prisoner's argument that he was entitled to habeas corpus relief because he would be eligible for parole if the challenged sentence were <caseOfInterest>invalidated. 293 U.S., at 134</caseOfInterest>, 140. In Williams and Martin, the Court of Appeals concluded that this Court's decision in Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236 (1963), represented a departure from this narrow reading of the habeas corpus statute.

[10]  The indignation aroused by the decision in Darnel's Case, supra, n. 7, led to enactment in 1627 of the Petition of Right, 3 Car. 1, c. 1, which condemned a return reciting that imprisonment was by "speciale mandatum Domini Regis" as insufficient under "the law of the land."
