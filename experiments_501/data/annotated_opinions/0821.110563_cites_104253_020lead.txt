 II A As an initial matter, appellants assert that the Montana Supreme Court erred in concluding that the Montana tax is not subject to the strictures of the Commerce Clause.  In appellants’ view, Heisler’s “mechanical” approach, which looks to whether a state tax is levied on goods prior to their entry into interstate commerce, no longer accurately reflects the law. Appellants contend that the correct analysis focuses on whether the challenged tax substantially affects interstate commerce, in which case it must be scrutinized under the Complete Auto Transit test.  We agree that Heisler’s reasoning has been undermined by more recent cases. The Heisler analysis evolved at a time when the Commerce Clause was thought to prohibit the States from imposing any direct taxes on interstate commerce.  *615 See, e. g., Helson & Randolph v. Kentucky, 279 U. S. 245, 250-252 (1929); Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v. Monier, 266 U. S. 555, 562 (1925).  Consequently, the distinction between intrastate activities and interstate commerce was crucial to protecting the States’ taxing power.  4 The Court has, however, long since rejected any suggestion that a state tax or regulation affecting interstate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches only to a “local” or intrastate activity.  See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333, 350 (1977); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 141-142 (1970); Nippert v. Richmond, <citedDecision>327 U. S. 416, 423-424</citedDecision> (1946).  Correspondingly, the Court has rejected the notion that state taxes levied on interstate commerce are per se invalid.  See, e. g., Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734 (1978); Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra. In reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes, our goal has instead been to “establish a consistent and rational method of inquiry” focusing on “the practical effect of a challenged tax.” Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S. 425, 443 (1980).  See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 276-281 (1978); Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedor *616 ing Cos., supra, at 743-751; Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra, at 277-279 .  We conclude that the same “practical” analysis should apply in reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state severance taxes.  In the first place, there is no real distinction — in terms of economic effects — between severance taxes and other types of state taxes that have been subjected to Commerce Clause scrutiny.  5 See, e. g., Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157 (1954); Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., 330 U. S. 422 (1947), Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n, 302 U. S. 90 (1937), both overruled in Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., supra. 6 State taxes levied on a “local” activity preceding entry of the goods into interstate commerce may substantially affect interstate commerce, and this effect is the proper focus of Commerce Clause inquiry.

 See National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551 (1977); Standard Pressed Steel Co. v. Washington Revenue Dept., 419 U. S. 560 (1975).  As the Court explained in Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., supra, at 446 (emphasis added), “the incidence of the tax as well as its measure [must be] tied to the earnings which the State .  .. has made possible, insofar as government is the prerequisite for the fruits of civilization for which, as Mr. Justice Holmes was fond of saying, we pay taxes.” Against this background, we have little difficulty concluding that the Montana tax satisfies the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test.  The “operating incidence” of the tax, see General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S., at 440-441 , is on the mining of coal within Montana.  Because it is measured as a percentage of the value of the coal taken, the Montana tax is in “proper proportion” to appellants’ activities within the State and, therefore, to their “consequent enjoyment of the opportunities and protections which the State has afforded” in connection with those activities.  Id., at 441 .  Cf. <citedDecision>Nippert</citedDecision> v. Richmond, <citedDecision>327 U. S., at 427</citedDecision> .  *627 When a tax is assessed in proportion to a taxpayer’s activities or presence in a State, the taxpayer is shouldering its fair share of supporting the State’s provision of “police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and 'the advantages of a civilized society.’ ” Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S., at 228, quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S., at 445 .  Appellants argue, however, that the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test must be construed as requiring a factual inquiry into the relationship between the revenues generated by a tax and costs incurred on account of the taxed activity, in order to provide a mechanism for judicial disapproval under the Commerce Clause of state taxes that are excessive.  This assertion reveals that appellants labor under a misconception about a court’s role in cases such as this.  16 The simple fact is that the appropriate level or rate of taxation is essentially a matter for legislative, and not judicial, resolution.  17 See Helson & Randolph v. Kentucky, 279 U. S. 245, 252 (1929); cf. Pittsburgh v. Alco Parking Corp., 417 *628 U. S. 369 (1974); Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40 (1934).  In essence, appellants ask this Court to prescribe a test for the validity of state taxes that would require state and federal courts, as a matter of federal constitutional law, to calculate acceptable rates or levels of taxation of activities that are conceded to be legitimate subjects of taxation.

 In the first place, it is doubtful whether any legal test could adequately reflect the numerous and competing economic, geographic, demographic, social, and political considerations that must inform a decision about an acceptable rate or level of state taxation, and yet be reasonably capable of application in a wide variety of individual cases. But even apart from the difficulty of the judicial undertaking, the nature of the factfinding and judgment that would be required of the courts merely reinforces the conclusion that questions about the appropriate level of state taxes must be resolved through the political process.  Under our federal system, the determination is to be made by state legislatures in the first instance and, if necessary, by Congress, when particular state taxes are thought to be contrary to federal interests.  18 Cf. Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S., at 448-449 ; Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S., at 280 .  Furthermore, the reference in the cases to police and fire protection and other advantages of civilized society is not, as appellants suggest, a disingenuous incantation designed to avoid a more searching inquiry into the relationship between the value of the benefits conferred on the taxpayer and the amount of taxes it pays.  Rather, when the measure of a tax is reasonably related to the taxpayer’s activities or presence in the State — from which it derives some benefit such as the *629 substantial privilege of mining coal — the taxpayer will realize, in proper proportion to the taxes it pays, “[t]he only benefit to which the taxpayer is constitutionally entitled ...[:] that derived from his enjoyment of the privileges of living in an organized society, established and safeguarded by the devotion of taxes to public purposes.” Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S., at 522 .  Correspondingly, when the measure of a tax bears no relationship to the taxpayers’ presence or activities in a State, a court may properly conclude under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test that the State is imposing an undue burden on interstate commerce.  See <citedDecision>Nippert</citedDecision> v. Richmond, <citedDecision>327 U. S., at 427</citedDecision> ; cf. Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157 (1954).  We are satisfied that the Montana tax, assessed under a formula that relates the tax liability to the value of appellant coal producers’ activities within the State, comports with the requirements of the Complete Auto Transit test.  We therefore turn to appellants’ contention that the tax is invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  Ill A Appellants contend that the Montana tax, as applied to mining of federally owned coal, is invalid under the Supremacy Clause because it “substantially frustrates” the purposes of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, ch. 85, 41 Stat. 437 , 30 U. S. C. § 181 et seg. (1976 ed. and Supp. Ill) (1920 Act), as amended by the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1975, Pub. L. 94-377, 90 Stat. 1083 (1975 Amendments) .  Appellants argue that under the 1920 Act, the “economic rents” attributable to the mining of coal on federal land — i.  e., the difference between the cost of production (including a reasonable profit) and the market price of the coal— are to be captured by the Federal Government in the form of royalty payments from federal lessees.  The payments thus *630 received are then to be divided between the States and the Federal Government according to a formula prescribed by the Act.
