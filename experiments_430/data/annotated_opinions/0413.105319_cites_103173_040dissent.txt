 Bond v. Hume, 243 U. S. 15 ; Ohio v. Chattanooga Boiler & Tank Co., 289 U. S. 439 ; Industrial Commission v. McCartin, 330 U. S. 622 .  See also Bonaparte v. Tax Court, 104 U. S. 592 ; American Fire Insurance Co. v. King Lumber & Mfg. Co., 250 U. S. 2 .  These cases prove that, where the statute of either the forum or the outside State is not found to be exclusive regarding remedies or rights elsewhere, the statute need not be accorded exclusive effect.  Further, the Court has stated that, in the area of workmen’s compensation, “unmistakable language” is required before exclusiveness will be attributed.  See Industrial Commission v. McCartin, 330 U. S., at 628 .  *416 (3) Those in which the forum applied its own substantive law, statutory or judicial, when clearly in conflict with the out-of-state statute.  National Mutual Building & Loan Association v. Brahan, 193 U. S. 635 ; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U. S. 386 ; Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243 ; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Head, 234 U.

S. 469 ; Order of United Commercial Travelers v. Wolfe, 331 U. S. 586 .  These cases have arisen in three principal fields: (a) commercial law; (b) insurance; and (c) workmen's compensation.  As a statistical matter, in 21 cases of direct conflict the Court held for the forum 10 times and for the sister State 11 times.  (a) In commercial law a number of cases have involved statutory assessment against out-of-state shareholders under the laws of the State of incorporation of an insolvent corporation.  The Court’s consistent position has *417 been that the law of the incorporating State must be given effect by the forum.  E. g., Converse v. Hamilton, supra. That law is deemed to create a transitory cause of action based on the contractual relation between the corporation and the shareholder by which the shareholder is held to have consented to reasonable state regulation.  The Court has relied on the fact that in each case a judicial proceeding in the incorporating State had previously passed upon the necessity and amount of the assessment, and that, although shareholders in the forum were not parties to such a proceeding, their interest was adequately represented by other shareholders.

 3 To make the interest of Arkansas prevail over the interest of Missouri on the basis of the Full Faith and Credit Clause would require that Clapper be explicitly overruled and that, in the area of workmen’s compensation law, the place of injury be decisive.  And if Clapper is to be overruled, on which I and those who join me express no opinion, it should be done with reasons making manifest why Mr. Justice Brandéis’ long-matured, weighty opinion in that *422 case was ill-founded.  It should not be cast aside on the presupposition that full faith and credit need not be given to a sister-state workmen's compensation statute if the law of the forum happens to be more favorable to the claimant.  (3) Furthermore, the new provision of 28 U. S. C. § 1738 cannot be disregarded.  In 1948 Congress for the first time dealt with the full faith and credit effect to be given statutes.  4 The absence of such a provision was used by-Mr.  Justice Stone to buttress the Court’s opinions both in Alaska Packers, 294 U. S., at 547 , and Pacific Employers, <citedDecision>306 U. S., at 502</citedDecision> .  Hence, if § 1738 has any effect, it would seem to tend toward respecting Missouri’s legislation.  See Reese, Full Faith and Credit to Statutes: The Defense of Public Policy, 19 U. of Chi. L. Rev. 339, 343 et seq. There is, however, a readily available alternative short of overruling Clapper which dispenses with the difficulties inherent in applying the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  This alternative proceeds along the following lines: Missouri’s workmen’s compensation statute is in terms applicable and exclusive as to workmen injured outside the State under Missouri employment contracts.  5 Hogan *423 (the subcontractor here) was a Missouri employer and had a Missouri employment contract with Carroll (the injured workman).  Thus when Carroll sought workmen’s compensation in Arkansas (where he was hurt), Hogan and his insurer could have relied on the Missouri statute and the Clapper case as a defense.  They did not, presumably since Arkansas workmen’s compensation cost them no more than Missouri’s and they had an opportunity to recoup from the prime contractor as a third party under Arkansas law. 6 But Lanza (the prime contractor) was not a Missouri employer, nor does the record disclose that he had a Missouri employment contract either with Hogan or Carroll.
