**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Frankfurter, whom Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Harlan join, dissenting.  In order to place the problems presented by this case in the proper context for adjudication, it has seemed to me desirable to examine the course of the Court’s decisions touching the constitutional requirement for giving full faith and credit to statutes of a sister State.  The cases fall into three main groups: 1 (1) Those in which the forum was called upon to give effect to a sister-state statute and declined to do so. Hancock National Bank v. Farnum, 176 U. S. 640 ; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Sowers, 213 U. S. 55 ; Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. George, 233 U. S. 354 ; Clark v. Williard, 292 U. S. 112 ; Broderick v. Rosner, <citedDecision>294 U. S. 629</citedDecision> ; Hughes v. Fetter, 341 U. S. 609 ; First National Bank of Chicago v. United Air Lines, Inc., 342 U. S. 396 ; Wells v. Simonds Abrasive Co., 345 U. S. 514 .  *415 From these cases it appears that the forum cannot, by statute or otherwise, refuse to enforce a sister-state statute giving a transitory cause of action, whether in contract or tort.  E. g., Broderick v. <citedDecision>Rosner, supra;</citedDecision> Hughes v. Fetter, supra. Indeed, the forum may permissibly go a step in the other direction and disregard the venue provisions of an out-of-state statute which would have prevented the forum from enforcing the right.  Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. George, supra. The forum may, however, apply its own more restrictive statute of limitations to an outside wrongful death action, Wells v. Simonds Abrasive Co., supra, and dicta indicate that it may refuse to enforce a penal law, a law found antagonistic to the forum's public policy, or a law which requires specialized proceedings or remedies not available in the forum, see <citedDecision>Broderick</citedDecision> v. Rosner, <citedDecision>294 U. S., at 642-643</citedDecision> ; Hughes v. Fetter, 341 U. S., at 612 .  (2) Those in which the forum applied its own statute rather than that of a sister State because the latter was not of limiting exclusiveness, or in which the forum applied the sister-state statute because the forum’s was not exclusive.  Bond v. Hume, 243 U. S. 15 ; Ohio v. Chattanooga Boiler & Tank Co., 289 U. S. 439 ; Industrial Commission v. McCartin, 330 U. S. 622 .  See also Bonaparte v. Tax Court, 104 U. S. 592 ; American Fire Insurance Co. v. King Lumber & Mfg. Co., 250 U. S. 2 .  These cases prove that, where the statute of either the forum or the outside State is not found to be exclusive regarding remedies or rights elsewhere, the statute need not be accorded exclusive effect.  Further, the Court has stated that, in the area of workmen’s compensation, “unmistakable language” is required before exclusiveness will be attributed.  See Industrial Commission v. McCartin, 330 U. S., at 628 .
