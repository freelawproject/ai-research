Williams v. Standard Oil Co., 278 U.S. 235 . Save for that decision and Morehead v. Tipaldo, 298 U.S. 587 , holding unconstitutional a New York statute authorizing the fixing of women's wages, the subsequent cases in this Court have given increasingly wider scope to the price-fixing powers of the states and of Congress. [5] Tagg Bros. v. United States, 280 U.S. 420 , decided in 1930, upheld the power of the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act to determine the just and reasonable charges of persons engaged in the business of buying and selling in interstate commerce livestock at a stockyard on a commission basis. In 1931 a New Jersey statute limiting commissions of agents of fire insurance companies was sustained by O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 282 U.S. 251 . A New York statute authorizing the fixing of minimum and maximum retail prices for milk was upheld in 1934. Nebbia v. New York, <targetCase>291 U.S. 502</targetCase> . And see Hegeman Farms Corp. v. Baldwin, 293 U.S. 163 ; Borden's Farm Products Co. v. Ten Eyck, 297 U.S. 251 . Cf. Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511 ; Mayflower Farms v. Ten Eyck, 297 U.S. 266 . In 1937 Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261 U.S. 525 , was overruled and a statute of Washington which authorized the fixing of minimum wages for women and minors was sustained. West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 .
**Combined Opinion**
They represent in large measure a basic departure from the philosophy and approach of the majority in the Ribnik case. The standard there employed, following that used in Tyson & Brother v. Banton, 273 U.S. 418 , 430 et seq., was that the constitutional validity of price-fixing legislation, at least in absence of a so-called emergency, [6] was dependent on whether or not the business in question was "affected with a public interest." Cf. Brazee v. Michigan, 241 U.S. 340 . It was said to be so affected if it had been "devoted to the public use" and if "an interest in effect" had been granted "to the public in that use." Ribnik v. McBride, supra, p. 355. That test, labelled by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent in the Tyson case (273 U.S. at p. 446) as "little more than a fiction," was discarded in <targetCase>Nebbia</targetCase> v. New York, supra, pp. 531-539. It was there stated that such criteria "are not susceptible of definition and form an unsatisfactory test of the constitutionality of legislation directed at business practices or prices," and that the phrase "affected with a public interest" can mean "no more than *246 that an industry, for adequate reason, is subject to control for the public good." Id., p. 536. And see the dissenting opinion in Ribnik v. McBride, supra, at p. 359. The Ribnik case, freed from the test which it employed, can no longer survive. But respondents maintain that the statute here in question is invalid for other reasons.
