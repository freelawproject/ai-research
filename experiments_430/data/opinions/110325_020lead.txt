<p id="b117-6">Respondents, John Salvueci and Joseph Zaekular, were charged in a federal indictment with 12 counts of unlawful possession of stolen mail, in violation of 18 TJ. S. C. § 1708. The 12 checks which formed the basis of the indictment had been seized by the Massachusetts police during the search of an apartment rented by respondent Zackular’s mother. The search was conducted pursuant to a warrant.</p>
<p id="b117-7">Respondents filed a motion to suppress the checks on the ground that the affidavit supporting the application for the search warrant was inadequate to demonstrate probable cause. The District Court granted respondents’ motions and ordered that the checks be suppressed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government sought reconsideration of the District Court’s ruling, contending that respondents lacked “standing” to challenge the constitutionality of the search. The District Court reaffirmed its suppression order and the Government appealed.</p>
<p id="b117-8">The Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that respondents had “standing” and the search warrant was constitutionally inadequate. The court found that the respondents were not required to establish a legitimate expectation of privacy in the premises searched or the property seized because they were entitled to assert “automatic standing” to object to the search <page-number citation-index="1" label="86">*86</page-number>and seizure under <em><span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v.

<p id="b118-5">II</p>
<p id="b118-6">As early as 1907, this Court took the position that remedies for violations of constitutional rights would only be afforded to a person who “belongs to the class for whose sake the constitutional protection is given.” <em>Hatch </em>v. <em>Reardon, </em><span class="citation" data-id="96569"><a href="/opinion/96569/new-york-ex-rel-hatch-v-reardon/#160" aria-description="Citation for case: New York Ex Rel. Hatch v. Reardon">204 U. S. 152, 160</a></span>. The exclusionary rule is one form of remedy afforded for Fourth Amendment violations, and the Court in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States">Jones</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States </em>held that the <em><span class="citation" data-id="96569"><a href="/opinion/96569/new-york-ex-rel-hatch-v-reardon/" aria-description="Citation for case: New York Ex Rel. Hatch v. Reardon">Hatch</a></span> </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="96569"><a href="/opinion/96569/new-york-ex-rel-hatch-v-reardon/" aria-description="Citation for case: New York Ex Rel. Hatch v. Reardon">Reardon</a></span> </em>principle properly limited its availability. The Court reasoned that ordinarily “it is entirely proper to require of one who seeks to challenge the legality of a search as the basis for suppressing relevant evidence that he . . . establish, that he himself was the victim of an invasion of privacy.” <span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/#261" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States">362 U. S., at 261</a></span>. Subsequent attempts to vicariously assert violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of others have been repeatedly rejected by this Court. <em>Alderman </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107872"><a href="/opinion/107872/alderman-v-united-states/#174" aria-description="Citation for case: Alderman v. United States">394 U. S. 165, 174</a></span> (1969); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108760"><a href="/opinion/108760/brown-v-united-states/#230" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown v. United States">411 U. S. <page-number citation-index="1" label="87">*87</page-number>223, 230</a></span> (1973). Most recently, in <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em><span class="citation" data-id="9427384"><a href="/opinion/109953/rakas-v-illinois/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rakas v. Illinois">439 U. S. 128</a></span> (1978), we held that “it is proper to permit only defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated to benefit from the [exclusionary] rule’s protections.” <span class="citation" data-id="9427384"><a href="/opinion/109953/rakas-v-illinois/#134" aria-description="Citation for case: Rakas v. Illinois"><em>Id., </em>at 134</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b119-5">Even though the Court in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States">Jones</a></span> </em>recognized that the exclusionary rule should only be available to protect defendants who have been the victims of an illegal search or seizure, the Court thought it necessary to establish an exception. In cases where possession of the seized evidence was an essential element of the offense charged, the Court held that the defendant was not obligated to establish that his own Fourth Amendment rights had been violated, but only that the search and seizure of the evidence was unconstitutional.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Upon such a showing, the exclusionary rule would be available to prevent the admission of the evidence against the defendant.</p>
<p id="b119-6">The Court found that the prosecution of such possessory offenses presented a “special problem” which necessitated the departure from the then settled principles of Fourth Amendment “standing.” <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Two circumstances were found to require this exception. First, the Court found that in order to establish standing at a hearing on a motion to suppress, the defendant would often be “forced to allege facts the proof of which would tend, if indeed not be sufficient, to convict him,” since several Courts of Appeals had “pinioned a defendant within this dilemma” by holding that evidence adduced at the motion <page-number citation-index="1" label="88">*88</page-number>to suppress could be used against the defendant at trial. <span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/#262" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States">362 U. S., at 262</a></span>. The Court declined to embrace any rule which would require a defendant to assert his Fourth Amendment claims only at the risk of providing the prosecution with self-incriminating statements admissible at trial. The Court sought resolution of this dilemma by relieving the defendant of the obligation of establishing that his Fourth Amendment rights were violated by an illegal search or seizure.</p>
<p id="b120-5">The Court also commented that this rule would be beneficial for a second reason. Without a rule prohibiting a Government challenge to a defendant’s “standing” to invoke the exclusionary rule in a possessory offense prosecution, the Government would be allowed the “advantage of contradictory positions.” <span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/#263" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States"><em>Id., </em>at 263</a></span>. The Court reasoned that the Government ought not to be allowed to assert that the defendant possessed the goods for purposes of criminal liability, while simultaneously asserting that he did not possess them for the purposes of claiming the protections of the Fourth Amendment. The Court found that “[i]t is not consonant with the amenities, to put it mildly, of the administration of criminal justice to sanction such squarely contradictory assertions of power by the Government.” <span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/#263" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States"><em>Id., </em>at 263-264</a></span>. Thus in order to prevent both the risk that self-incrimination would attach to the assertion of Fourth Amendment rights, as well as to prevent the “vice of prosecutorial self-contradiction,” see <em><span class="citation" data-id="108760"><a href="/opinion/108760/brown-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown v. United States">Brown</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 229, the Court adopted the rule of “automatic standing.”</p>
<p id="A5o">In the 20 years which have lapsed since the Court’s decision in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States">Jones</a></span>, </em>the two reasons which led the Court to the rule of automatic standing have likewise been affected 'by time. This Court has held that testimony given by a defendant in support of a motion to suppress cannot be admitted as evi-denee of his guilt at trial. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107636"><a href="/opinion/107636/simmons-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Simmons v. United States">390 U. S. 377</a></span> (1968). Developments in the principles of Fourth Amendment standing, as well, clarify that a prosecutor may, with legal consistency and legitimacy, assert that a defendant <page-number citation-index="1" label="89">*89</page-number>charged with possession of a seized item did not have a privacy interest violated in the course of the search and seizure. We are convinced not only that the original tenets of the <em><span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States">Jones</a></span> </em>decision have eroded, but also that no alternative principles exist to support retention of the rule.</p>
<p id="b121-5">A</p>
<p id="b121-6">The “dilemma” identified in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States">Jones</a></span>, </em>that a defendant charged with a possessory offense might only be able to establish his standing to challenge a search and seizure by giving self-incriminating testimony admissible as evidence of his guilt, was eliminated by our decision in <em><span class="citation" data-id="107636"><a href="/opinion/107636/simmons-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Simmons v. United States">Simmons</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>In <em><span class="citation" data-id="107636"><a href="/opinion/107636/simmons-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Simmons v. United States">Simmons</a></span>, </em>the defendant Garrett was charged with bank robbery. During the search of a codefendant's mother’s house, physical evidence used in the bank robbery, including a suitcase, was found in the basement and seized. In an effort to establish his standing to assert the illegality of the search, Garrett testified at the suppression hearing that the suitcase was similar to one he owned and that he was the owner of the clothing discovered inside the suitcase. Garrett’s motion to suppress was denied, but his testimony was admitted into evidence against him as part of the Government’s case-in-chief at trial. This Court reversed, finding that “a defendant who knows that his testimony may be admissible against him at trial will sometimes be deterred from presenting the testimonial proof of standing necessary to assert a Fourth Amendment claim.” <span class="citation" data-id="107636"><a href="/opinion/107636/simmons-v-united-states/#392" aria-description="Citation for case: Simmons v. United States">390 U. S., at 392-393</a></span>. The Court found that, in effect, the defendant was</p>
<blockquote id="b121-7">“obliged either to give up what he believed, with advice of counsel, to be a valid Fourth Amendment claim or, in legal effect, to waive his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. In these circumstances, we find it intolerable that one constitutional right should have to be surrendered in order to assert another. We therefore hold that when a defendant testifies in support of a motion to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment <page-number citation-index="1" label="90">*90</page-number>grounds, his testimony may not thereafter be admitted against him at trial on the issue of guilt unless he makes no objection.” <span class="citation" data-id="107636"><a href="/opinion/107636/simmons-v-united-states/#394" aria-description="Citation for case: Simmons v. United States"><em>Id., </em>at 394</a></span>.</blockquote>
<p id="b122-5">This Court’s ruling in <em><span class="citation" data-id="107636"><a href="/opinion/107636/simmons-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Simmons v.

United States">Jones</a></span>, </em>but also grants a form of “use immunity” to those defendants charged with nonpossessory crimes. In this respect, the protection of <em><span class="citation" data-id="107636"><a href="/opinion/107636/simmons-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Simmons v. United States">Simmons</a></span> </em>is therefore broader than that of <em><span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v.

United States">Brown</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108760"><a href="/opinion/108760/brown-v-united-states/#228" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown v. United States">411 U.

United States">Jones</a></span> </em>decision, can no longer occur under the prevailing interpretation of the Constitution [in Simmons].”</p>
<p id="b122-6">B</p>
<p id="b122-7">This Court has identified the self-incrimination rationale as the cornerstone of the <em><span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States">Jones</a></span> </em>opinion. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="108760"><a href="/opinion/108760/brown-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown v. United States">Brown</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 228. We need not belabor the question of whether the “vice” of prosecutorial contradiction could alone support a rule countenancing the exclusion of probative evidence on the grounds that someone other than the defendant was denied a Fourth Amendment right. The simple answer is that the decisions of this Court, especially our most recent decision in <em>Rakas </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em><span class="citation" data-id="9427384"><a href="/opinion/109953/rakas-v-illinois/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rakas v. Illinois">439 U. S. 128</a></span> (1978), clearly establish that a prosecutor may simultaneously maintain that a defendant criminally possessed the seized good, but was not subject to a Fourth Amendment deprivation, without legal contradiction. To conclude that a prosecutor engaged in self-contradiction in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106022"><a href="/opinion/106022/jones-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v. United States">Jones</a></span>, </em>the Court necessarily relied on the unexamined assumption that a defendant’s possession of a seized good sufficient to establish criminal culpability was also sufficient to establish Fourth Amendment “standing.” This assumption, however, even if correct at the time, is no longer so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b123-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="91">*91</page-number>The person in legal possession of a good seized during an illegal search has not necessarily been subject to a Fourth Amendment deprivation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As we hold today in <em>Rawlings </em>v. <em>Kentucky, post, </em>p. 98, legal possession of a seized good is not a proxy for determining whether the owner had a Fourth Amendment interest, for it does not invariably represent the protected Fourth Amendment interest. This Court has repeatedly repudiated the notion that “arcane distinctions developed in property and tort law” ought to control our Fourth Amendment inquiry. <em><span class="citation" data-id="9427384"><a href="/opinion/109953/rakas-v-illinois/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rakas v.

That issue need not be and is not resolved here, for it is an issue which more aptly relates to the proper breadth of the <em><span class="citation" data-id="107636"><a href="/opinion/107636/simmons-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Simmons v.

The same argument has been rejected by this Court as a sufficient basis for allowing persons whose Fourth Amendment rights were not violated to nevertheless claim the benefits of the exclusionary rule.

<blockquote id="b126-6">“The deterrent values of preventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated have been considered sufficient to justify the suppression of probative evidence even though the case against the defendant is weakened or destroyed. We adhere to that judgment. But we are not convinced that the additional benefits of extending the exclusionary rule to other defendants would justify further encroachment upon the public interest in prosecuting those accused of crime and having them acquitted or convicted on the basis of all the evidence which exposes the truth.”</blockquote>
