**Combined Opinion**
 Section 1 of the Twenty-first Amendment repealed that prohibition, and ยง 2 delegated to the several States the power to prohibit commerce in, or the use of, alcoholic beverages.  [21] The States' regulatory power over this segment of commerce is therefore largely "unfettered *515 by the Commerce Clause." Ziffrin, Inc. v. Reeves, 308 U. S. 132, 138 (1939).  As is clear, the text of the Twenty-first Amendment supports the view that, while it grants the States authority over commerce that might otherwise be reserved to the Federal Government, it places no limit whatsoever on other constitutional provisions.  Nevertheless, Rhode Island argues, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that in this case the Twenty-first Amendment tilts the First Amendment analysis in the State's favor.  See 39 F. 3d, at 7-8 .  In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on our decision in California v. LaRue, <citedDecision>409 U. S. 109</citedDecision> (1972).  [22] In <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> , five Members of the Court relied on the Twenty-first Amendment to buttress the conclusion that the First Amendment did not invalidate California's prohibition of certain grossly sexual exhibitions in premises licensed to serve alcoholic beverages.  Specifically, the opinion stated that the Twenty-first Amendment required that the prohibition be given an added presumption in favor of its validity.  See <citedDecision>id., at 118-119</citedDecision> .  We are now persuaded that the Court's analysis in <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> would have led to precisely the same result if it had placed no reliance on the Twenty-first Amendment.  Entirely apart from the Twenty-first Amendment, the State has ample power to prohibit the sale of alcoholic beverages in inappropriate locations.  Moreover, in subsequent cases, the Court has recognized that the States' inherent police powers provide ample authority to restrict the kind of "bacchanalian revelries" described in the <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> opinion regardless of whether alcoholic beverages are involved.  <citedDecision>Id., at 118</citedDecision> ; see, e. g., Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U. S. 50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U. S. 560 (1991).  As we recently noted: " <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> did not involve *516 commercial speech about alcohol, but instead concerned the regulation of nude dancing in places where alcohol was served." Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 483, n. 2 .  Without questioning the holding in <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> , we now disavow its reasoning insofar as it relied on the Twenty-first Amendment.  As we explained in a case decided more than a decade after <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> , although the Twenty-first Amendment limits the effect of the dormant Commerce Clause on a State's regulatory power over the delivery or use of intoxicating beverages within its borders, "the Amendment does not license the States to ignore their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution." Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 712 (1984).  That general conclusion reflects our specific holdings that the Twenty-first Amendment does not in any way diminish the force of the Supremacy Clause, ibid.; California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97, 112-114 (1980), the Establishment Clause, Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116, 122, n. 5 (1982), or the Equal Protection Clause, Craig v. Boren, 429 U. S. 190, 209 (1976).  We see no reason why the First Amendment should not also be included in that list.  Accordingly, we now hold that the Twenty-first Amendment does not qualify the constitutional prohibition against laws abridging the freedom of speech embodied in the First Amendment.  The Twenty-first Amendment, therefore, cannot save Rhode Island's ban on liquor price advertising.  VIII Because Rhode Island has failed to carry its heavy burden of justifying its complete ban on price advertising, we conclude that R. I.
**Combined Opinion**
 The Twenty-first Amendment cannot save an otherwise invalid restriction on speech.  Nothing in the Amendment's text or history justifies its use to alter the application of the First Amendment.  "[O]ur prior cases have made clear that the [Twenty-first] Amendment *533 does not license the States to ignore their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution." Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 712 (1984).  See also Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116, 122, n. 5 (1982) ("The State may not exercise its power under the Twenty-first Amendment in a way which impinges upon the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment"); Craig, supra, at 206 ("Neither the text nor the history of the Twenty-first Amendment suggests that it qualifies individual rights protected by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment where the sale or use of liquor is concerned" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The Twenty-first Amendment does not trump First Amendment rights or add a presumption of validity to a regulation that cannot otherwise satisfy First Amendment requirements.  The Court of Appeals relied on California v. LaRue, <citedDecision>409 U. S. 109, 118-119</citedDecision> (1972), for its determination that the Twenty-first Amendment provided an "added presumption" of the regulation's validity.  There, this Court upheld a State's regulations prohibiting establishments licensed to sell liquor by the drink from offering explicitly sexual entertainment.  As we recently explained in Coors, " <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> did not involve commercial speech about alcohol, but instead concerned the regulation of nude dancing in places where alcohol was served." 514 U. S., at 483, n. 2.  The cases following <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> similarly involved the regulation of nude or nearly nude dancing in establishments licensed to serve alcohol.  New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U. S. 714 (1981) (per curiam) ; Newport v. Iacobucci, 479 U. S. 92 (1986) (per curiam) .  Nothing in <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> suggested that the Twenty-first Amendment would permit a State to prohibit the kind of speech at issue here, and as discussed above, the text and history of the Twenty-first Amendment clearly indicate that the Amendment was not intended to supplant the general application of constitutional provisions, except for its limited exception to the Commerce Clause's normal *534 operation.  Indeed, <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> notes that prior decisions "did not go so far as to hold or say that the Twenty-first Amendment supersedes all other provisions of the United States Constitution in the area of liquor regulations," <citedDecision>409 U. S., at 115</citedDecision> , and <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> certainly does not stand for that proposition.  The Court of Appeals' reliance on <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> was misplaced.  Rhode Island's prohibition on alcohol-price advertising, as a means to keep alcohol prices high and consumption low, cannot survive First Amendment scrutiny.  The Twenty-first Amendment cannot save this otherwise invalid regulation.  While I agree with the Court's finding that the regulation is invalid, I would decide that issue on narrower grounds.  I therefore concur in the judgment.  NOTES [*]  Briefs of amici curiae urging reversal were filed for the American Advertising Federation et al. by Richard E. Wiley, Andrew Krulwich, Howard H.

Central Hudson, supra, at 569-571 .
