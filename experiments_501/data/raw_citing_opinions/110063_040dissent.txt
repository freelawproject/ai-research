<p id="b397-7">This Court’s seeming preoccupation in recent years with laws relating to wildlife must, I suspect, appear curious to casual observers of this institution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is no more curious, however, than this Court’s recent pronouncements on the validity of <em>Geer </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em><span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v. Connecticut">161 U. S. 519</a></span> (1896). For less than one year ago we unreservedly reaffirmed the principles announced in <em>Geer. Baldwin </em>v. <em>Montana Fish &amp; Game Comm’n, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109868"><a href="/opinion/109868/baldwin-v-fish-and-game-commn-of-mont/#386" aria-description="Citation for case: Baldwin v. Fish and Game Comm&#x27;n of Mont.">436 U. S. 371, 386</a></span> (1978). Today, the Court overrules that decision. Because I disagree with the Court’s overruling of <em><span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v. Connecticut">Geer</a></span> </em>and holding that Oklahoma’s law relating to the sale of minnows violates the Commerce Clause, I dissent.</p>
<p id="b397-8">In its headlong rush to overrule <em><span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v. Connecticut">Geer</a></span>, </em>the Court characterizes that decision as “rest[ing] on the holding that no interstate commerce was involved.” <em>Ante, </em>at 327. It is true that one of the rationales relied on by the <em><span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v. Connecticut">Geer</a></span> </em>Court was that the State could exercise its power to control the killing and ownership of animals <em>ferae naturae </em>to prohibit such game <page-number citation-index="1" label="340">*340</page-number>from leaving the borders of the State and thus prevent the game from ever becoming the objects of interstate commerce. <span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/#530" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v.

Connecticut">Geer</a></span> </em>was of the view that the challenged statute effectively prevented certain game from entering the stream of interstate commerce, there could be no basis for a Commerce Clause challenge to the State’s law. <span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/#530" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v. Connecticut"><em>Id., </em>at 530, 532</a></span>.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I do not dispute the Court’s rejection of this theory; as the Court points out, this rationale was rejected long before today. <em>Ante, </em>at 329; see <em>West </em>v. <em>Kansas Natural Gas Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="97421"><a href="/opinion/97421/west-v-kansas-natural-gas-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.">221 U. S. 229</a></span> (1911). My objection is that this line of reasoning, while undoubtedly considered important by the majority in <em><span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v.

And no one — not the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals or the State in this Court — contends that the minnows at issue are not the subjects of interstate commerce. It is obvious that the Court has simply set this theory up as a sort of strawman to facilitate the toppling of a decision which, in other respects, enunciates principles that have remained valid and vital, albeit somewhat refined, at least until today.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b399-5">The Court in <em><span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v.

But the concept expressed by the “ownership” doctrine is not obsolete. <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>Montana Fish &amp; Game Comm’n, supra, </em>at 392 (Burger, C. J., concurring).

<p id="b401-5">The Oklahoma law at issue in this case serves the special interest of the State, as representative of its citizens, in preserving and regulating exploitation of free-swimming minnows found within its waters. “[T]he law serve [s] to protect against the depletion of minnows in Oklahoma’s natural streams through commercial exportation.” <span class="citation" data-id="1166510"><a href="/opinion/1166510/hughes-v-state/#575" aria-description="Citation for case: Hughes v.

Oklahoma’s statutory scheme may not be the most artfully designed to accomplish its pur<page-number citation-index="1" label="344">*344</page-number>pose.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But the range of regulations that a State may adopt under these circumstances is extremely broad, particularly where, as here, the burden on interstate commerce is, at most, minimal. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="109662"><a href="/opinion/109662/douglas-v-seacoast-products-inc/" aria-description="Citation for case: Douglas v.

<p id="b402-5">Contrary to the view of the Court, I do not think that Oklahoma’s regulation of the commercial exploitation of natural minnows either discriminates against out-of-state enterprises in favor of local businesses or that it burdens the interstate commerce in minnows. At least, no such showing has been made on the record before us. Cf. <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Paul, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106601"><a href="/opinion/106601/florida-lime-avocado-growers-inc-v-paul/#154" aria-description="Citation for case: Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul">373 U. S. 132, 154</a></span> (1963). This is not a case where a State’s regulation permits residents to export naturally seined minnows but prohibits nonresidents from so doing. No person is allowed to export natural minnows for sale outside of Oklahoma; the statute is evenhanded in its application. See Okla. Stat., Tit. 29, § 4r-115 (B) (Supp. 1978). The State has not used its power to protect its own citizens from outside competition. See <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109703"><a href="/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commission/" aria-description="Citation for case: Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Commission">432 U. S. 333</a></span> (1977); <em>H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Du Mond, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104652"><a href="/opinion/104652/h-p-hood-sons-inc-v-du-mond/" aria-description="Citation for case: H. P. Hood &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond">336 U. S. 525</a></span> (1949). Nor is this a <page-number citation-index="1" label="345">*345</page-number>case where a State requires a nonresident business, as a condition to exporting minnows, to move a significant portion of its operations to the State or to use certain state resources in pursuit of its business for the benefit of the local economy. See <em>Toomer </em>v. <em>Witsell, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104563"><a href="/opinion/104563/toomer-v-witsell/" aria-description="Citation for case: Toomer v. Witsell">334 U. S. 385</a></span> (1948); <em>Foster-Fountain Packing Co. </em>v. <em>Haydel, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101328"><a href="/opinion/101328/foster-fountain-packing-co-v-haydel/" aria-description="Citation for case: Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel">278 U. S. 1</a></span> (1928); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Haydel, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101329"><a href="/opinion/101329/johnson-v-haydel/" aria-description="Citation for case: Johnson v. Haydel">278 U. S. 16</a></span> (1928); cf. <em>Pike </em>v. <em>Bruce Church, Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="108085"><a href="/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/#145" aria-description="Citation for case: Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.">397 U. S. 137, 145</a></span> (1970). And, notwithstanding the Court’s protestations to the contrary, Oklahoma has not blocked the flow of interstate commerce in minnows at the State’s borders. See <em>ante, </em>at 336-337. Appellant, or anyone else, may freely export as many minnows as he wishes, so long as the minnows so transported are hatchery minnows and not naturally seined minnows. On this record, I simply fail to see how interstate commerce in minnows, the commodity at issue here, is impeded in the least by Oklahoma’s regulatory scheme.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b403-4">Oklahoma does regulate the manner in which both residents and nonresidents procure minnows to be sold outside the State. But there is no showing in this record that requiring appellant to purchase his minnows from hatcheries instead of from persons licensed to seine minnows from the State’s waters in any way increases appellant’s costs of doing business. There also is nothing in the record to indicate that naturally seined minnows are any more desirable as items of commerce than hatchery minnows. So far as the record before us indicates, hatchery minnows and naturally seined minnows are fungible. Accordingly, any minimal burden that may result from requiring appellant to purchase minnows destined for sale out of state from hatcheries instead of from <page-number citation-index="1" label="346">*346</page-number>those licensed to seine minnows is, in my view, more than outweighed by Oklahoma’s substantial interest in conserving and regulating exploitation of its natural minnow population. I therefore would affirm the judgment of the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>

<p id="b401-8">Given the primacy of the local interest here, in the absence of conflicting federal regulation I would require one challenging a state conservation law on Commerce Clause grounds to establish a far greater burden on interstate commerce than is shown in this case.

See also <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109703"><a href="/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commission/#350" aria-description="Citation for case: Hunt v.

<p id="b402-6"> The Court seems to doubt the conservation purpose of the Oklahoma law because the State places no limit on the number of minnows a licensed dealer may take from state waters and imposes no regulation governing the disposition of minnows within the State. <em>Ante, </em>at 337-338, and n. 20. But the State could rationally have concluded that it could adequately preserve its natural minnow population without such additional measures. Tr. of Oral Arg. 18, 20, 21-23. Since, in my view, the prohibition on export of naturally seined minnows imposes little, if any, burden on the interstate commerce in minnows, the State has not violated the Commerce Clause by choosing an export ban on natural minnows as the means to effectuate its special interest in conserving wildlife located within its territorial limits.</p>
