Mr. Justice Robeets: I think that the judgment should be reversed.. Four years ago in Colgate v. Harvey, 296 U. S. 404 , this court held that the equal protection clause and the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibit such a discrimination as results from the statute now under review. I adhere to the views expressed in *94 the opinion of the court in that case, and think it should be followed in this. Mr. Justice McReynolds joins in this opinion.
