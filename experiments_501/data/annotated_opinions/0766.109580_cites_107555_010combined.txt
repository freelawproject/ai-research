**Combined Opinion**
 For all of these reasons, we have now decided that Bonelli 's application of federal common law to cases such as this must be overruled.  The judgment under review is vacated, and the case remanded to the Supreme Court of Oregon for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, dissenting.  I would not overrule Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 414 U. S. 313 (1973), and would therefore affirm the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court. MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE WHITE joins, dissenting.  The Court today overrules a three-year-old decision, Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 414 U. S. 313 (1973), in which *383 seven of the eight participating Justices joined.  In addition, as the Court is certain to announce when the occasion arises, today's holding also overrules Hughes v. Washington, <citedDecision>389 U. S. 290</citedDecision> (1967), a nine-year-old decision also joined by all but one of the participating Justices.  [1] It is surprising, to say the least, to find these nearly unanimous recent decisions swept away in the name of stare decisis.  See ante, at 381-382.  The public, especially holders of riparian or littoral property *384 whose titles derive from the United States, deserve some explanation for the Court's change of course.  Yet today's majority does not contend either that circumstances have changed since 1973 or that experience has shown <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> and Bonelli to be unworkable.  Nor does the majority attempt to explain why a result it finds so clearly commanded by our earlier cases was almost unanimously rejected by this Court twice in the last decade.  We are left, then, with a mystery.  I respectfully suggest that the solution to this puzzle is not hard to find.  In contrast to the Bonelli and <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> Courts, the Court today decides a question the parties did not present, [2] brief, [3] or argue.  [4] By so doing, the Court rules *385 without the benefit of "that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions." Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 204 (1962).  The lack of illumination has caused the Court to choose the wrong path.  I The question the Court elects to decide in this case is whether a grant of riparian [5] land by the Federal Government is to be interpreted according to federal or state law. The Court holds that federal law governs only the determination of the initial boundaries of the grant; all other questions are to be determined under state law. This conclusion *386 depends on an unjustifiably limited interpretation of the meaning of a riparian grant.  It is undisputed that "the quality of being riparian" is perhaps "the land's `most valuable feature' and is part and parcel of the ownership of the land itself." Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 414 U. S., at 326 , quoting <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> v. Washington, <citedDecision>389 U. S., at 293</citedDecision> .  Cf. New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 , 717 (1836).  In the natural course, however, a riparian boundary tends to move, a fact reflected in the common-law doctrines of accretion, avulsion, erosion, and reliction.  Prior to today's ruling, federal grantees of riparian land, and holders under them, correctly understood that their titles incorporated boundaries whose precise location would depend on the movements of the water and on the federal common law. There can be no doubt that the federal grantee's expectation that his grant would be interpreted according to federal law and his belief that federal law would recognize boundary shifts occasioned by changes in the course of the water bordering his land were well founded.  One hundred forty years ago, this Court found it obvious that whoever had title to the land bordering water would have title to new land formed by alluvial deposits on the existing upland: "The question is well settled at common law, that the person whose land is bounded by a stream of water, which changes its course gradually by alluvial formations, shall still hold by the same boundary, including the accumulated soil.  No other rule can be applied on just principles.  Every proprietor whose land is thus bounded is subject to loss, by the same means which may add to his territory: and as he is without remedy for his loss, in this way, he cannot be held accountable for his gain."
**Combined Opinion**
 Similarly, in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1 (1894), [6] the Court said: "The rule, everywhere admitted, that where the land encroaches upon the water by gradual and imperceptible degrees, the accretion or alluvion belongs to the owner of the land, is equally applicable to lands bounding on tide waters or on fresh waters, and to the King or the State as to private persons; and is independent of the law governing the title in the soil covered by the water.  " Id., at 35 (emphasis added).  Thus, the right to such additions [7] was part of the title which passed with the federal grant, cf. 3 American Law of Property ยง 15.27, p. 859 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952), and was protected by federal law. By holding that state law now governs the impact of changes in the course of the bordering water on a federal riparian grant, the Court denies that "a question which concerns the validity and effect of an act done by the United States" is "necessarily a federal question." Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296 U. S. 10, 22 (1935).  As far as federal law is concerned, a federal riparian grant *388 is now understood to have incorporated a fixed rather than ambulatory boundary.  Ante, at 376.  The rule of New Orleans v. United States, supra , and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, supra , is discarded along with Bonelli and <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> .  The cases the Court concludes compel this dramatic shift do not even support it.  Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498 (1839), [8] was an action of ejectment brought against the commander of a United States military post to recover part of the post.  The plaintiff claimed under a state registration certificate.  As the majority notes, the Court rejected that argument with the following language: "We hold the true principle to be this, that whenever the question in any Court, state or federal, is, whether a title to land which had once been the property of the United States has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws of the United States; but that whenever, according to those laws, the title shall have passed, then that property, like all other property in the state, is subject to state legislation; so far as that legislation is consistent with the admission that the title passed and vested according to the laws of the United States.  " Id., at 517 (emphasis added).  The italicized language, on which the majority opinion makes no comment, explains why state law cannot control this case. Denial of the riparian holder's federal common-law rights to a changing boundary is not "consistent with the admission that the title .
**Combined Opinion**
 As the majority indicates, the Shively Court engaged in a thorough review of earlier cases. It summarized its conclusions, in part, as follows: "The title and rights of riparian or littoral proprietors in the soil below [the] high water mark, therefore, are governed by the laws of the several States, subject to the rights granted to the United States by the Constitution." Id., at 57-58 .  But the Shively Court, unlike today's majority, realized that this proposition does not affect the rights of riparian holders to the benefits of the common-law doctrines governing boundary changes.  [12] Those rights are "independent of *391 the law governing the title in the soil covered by the water." Id., at 35 .  See id., at 36 .  [13] Thus, the cases refute the majority's contention that the results in <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> and Bonelli sharply departed from prior law. Today's holding cannot, therefore, be based on interpretation of the meaning of the pre-statehood riparian grants under which Corvallis Sand & Gravel holds title, since the right to an ambulatory boundary was assumed to be part of the rights of a riparian grantee at the time the grants were made.  Moreover, the cases also demonstrate that there is no constitutional basis for today's holding.  The only constitutional question discussed in the majority opinion is the law governing the States' title to land beneath navigable waters, and the rights of the riparian holder are independent of that law. II Since today's ruling cannot be a matter either of constitutional law or of interpretation of the meaning of federal grants, it must be a choice-of-law decision.  In deciding whether to formulate and apply a federal common-law rule, "normally the guiding principle is that a significant *392 conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of state law in the premises must first be specifically shown." Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S. 63, 68 (1966).  See generally P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro, & H. Wechsler, Hart & Wechsler's The Federal Courts and the Federal System 756-832 (2d ed. 1973).  In order to assure an informed presentation of federal policies and interests when faced with a choice between federal and state law, this Court in the past has invited the Solicitor General to file a brief amicus curiae expressing the views of the United States.  [14] See, e. g., Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 382 U. S. 810 (1965); Yiatchos v. Yiatchos, 372 U. S. 905 (1963).  We followed this practice in both Bonelli, 409 U. S. 1022 (1972), and Hughes, 385 U. S. 807 (1966), and the Solicitor General participated as an amicus in both cases. Today's majority has made no similar effort to inform itself about the impact of its ruling on the Federal Government.  Indeed, the majority opinion does not even consider that issue, although it is normally central to a choice-of-law decision.  As the opinion and result show, the only views the Court has received are those of the amici States, whose interests here are hostile to those of the United States.  I cannot, of course, know what the Solicitor General would have said had the Court indicated that it was considering a choice-of-law question and invited him to present the views of the Government.  In both Bonelli and <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> , however, the submissions for the United States as amicus curiae strongly urged the Court to hold that federal rather *393 than state law governed the case. In Bonelli, the Government noted that its quiet enjoyment of the more than 200 miles of Colorado River shoreline it owned in Arizona had been threatened by some interpretations of the state court's decision.  Memorandum for the United States as Amicus Curiae 1-2, filed Sept. 20, 1973, in Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona , O. T. 1973, No. 72-397.  The Government urged that the state-court opinion be given a narrow interpretation and affirmed as consistent with the applicable federal law. Id., at 3-5.  In <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> , the Government urged that the decision of the State Supreme Court be reversed.  The Solicitor General explained that the Government considered that decision a serious threat: "The decision is of broad consequence.  It trenches on a significant element of title to realty acquired from the United States in the past and it materially curtails the nature of the title that the United States may convey in the future.  .  .  .  Equally important, it affects the powers of the United States with respect to more than 200 miles of Washington's coastline owned today by the federal government.

 .  "To be sure, the court below stated that it did not `question the federal government's right over its own *394 property' .  .  .  .  [But] the court below failed to recognize that `the federal government's right over its own property' embraces the right effectively to dispose of such property." Memorandum for United States as Amicus Curiae 3-5 in <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Washington</citedDecision> , O. T. 1967, No. 15.  The Solicitor General explained that the decision in <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> endangered the Government's ability to carry out congressional policy toward Indians, since the Government would no longer have been able to convey rights to a boundary adjacent to the sea if it turned over trust lands to the Indian beneficiaries.  Id., at 5-6; cf. United States v. Washington, 294 F. 2d 830 (CA9 1961), cert. denied, 369 U. S. 817 (1962).  But the problem with the Indian trust lands was merely "exemplary" because the state decision in <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> "restrains the government from disposing of the full measure of its title in connection with any program or policy which it may wish to pursue in the future.  In sum, we do not believe that it can be said here, as it could in Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S. 63, 68 , that there is `no significant threat to any identifiable federal policy or interest.' " Memorandum for United States as Amicus Curiae 6 in <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> v. Washington, supra .  Today's decision necessarily has an even greater impact on federal interests, since it casts doubt on the Government's continued ownership "of the full measure of its title." III One final word.  Stare decisis should be more than a fine-sounding phrase.  This is especially true for us, because "unless we respect the .  .  .

 [5]  The compact entered into when Alabama was admitted to the Union contained the following language: " `[A]ll navigable waters within the said state shall for ever remain public highways, free to the citizens of said state, and of the United States, without any tax, duty, impost, or toll therefor, imposed by the said state.'.  .  ." 3 How., at 229 .  The Court found that this language merely enunciated Congress' right to regulate commerce upon the navigable waters, similarly reserved to it with respect to the original States, and thus the language did not detract from the State's absolute title in the bed.  Id., at 229-230 .  [6] Amici Utah and New Mexico also urge us to reconsider our decision in Hughes v. Washington, <citedDecision>389 U. S. 290</citedDecision> (1967).  They advance the same reasons for such reconsideration as they do with respect to Bonelli.  But <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> was not cited by the Oregon courts below, and in Bonelli we expressly declined to rely upon it as a basis for our decision there, see 414 U. S., at 321 n. 11.  We therefore have no occasion to address the issue.  We are aware of the fact that <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> gave to Borax the same sort of expansive construction as did Bonelli, but we are likewise aware that <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> dealt with oceanfront property, a fact which the Court thought sufficiently different from the usual situation so as to justify a "federal common law" rule of riparian proprietorship: "The rule deals with waters that lap both the lands of the State and the boundaries of the international sea.  This relationship, at this particular point of the marginal sea, is too close to the vital interest of the Nation in its own boundaries to allow it to be governed by any law but the `supreme Law of the Land.' " <citedDecision>389 U. S., at 293</citedDecision> .  [7]  We are fortified in our conclusion that Bonelli 's equal-footing analysis was unsound by the fact that its author has likewise rejected it.  The dissenting opinion of our Brother MARSHALL, post, p. 382, would sustain the result reached in Bonelli but on a ground explicitly avoided in the Bonelli opinion.  The "mystery" or "puzzle" to which our Brother refers, post, at 384, turns out to be nonexistent; in rejecting Bonelli 's equal-footing analysis, we are simply refusing to be more Roman than the Romans.  The dissent's own abandonment of Bonelli 's ratio decidendi is anything but a ringing endorsement of the rule of stare decisis.  [8]  We think that the insistence of our dissenting Brethren that "federal common law" should be applied to a determination of title in this case, albeit not for the same reason expounded in Bonelli, misapprehends the meaning and significance of the term "common law" as it is used in several of our old cases. In the generic sense of the term, the "common law" has been defined as: " `the body of those principles and rules of action, relating to the government and security of persons and property, which derive their authority solely from usages and customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts recognizing, affirming and enforcing such usages and customs; and, in this sense, particularly the ancient unwritten law of England.' " Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Call Pub. Co., 181 U. S. 92, 102 (1901) (citing Black's Law Dictionary).  It is in this descriptive sense that the term is used in the two principal quotations relied upon in the dissenting opinion, New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 , 717 (1836), and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 68 (1874).  In the passage from New Orleans , the Court simply summarized the accepted British common-law doctrine of accretion.  In Lovingston , the Court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois which had rested upon the proper rule of common law, without any indication that this rule was not the law of Illinois.  In light of the treatment of the subject in such later cases as Barney v. Keokuk , Packer v. Bird , Shively v. Bowlby , and Joy v. St. Louis , all discussed in the text, no "rule" requiring the application of "federal common law" to questions of riparian ownership may be deduced from New Orleans and Lovingston .  See post, at 387-388.  [1]  Although the Court rejects the reasoning on which <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> is based, it refrains from formally overruling <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> on the ground that that case was not relied on in Bonelli and not cited by the Oregon courts below.  Ante, at 377 n. 6.  In Bonelli, the Solicitor General urged the Court to find federal law controlling because riparian lands patented by the United States were involved and, under <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> , federal common law therefore controlled the riparian rights of the landowner.  Memorandum for United States as Amicus Curiae 3-4, filed Jan. 2, 1973; and Memorandum for United States as Amicus Curiae 2-3, filed Sept. 20, 1973, in Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona , O. T. 1973, No. 72-397.  The petitioner took the same position.  Brief for Petitioners 31-34 in Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, supra .  The Bonelli Court did not reach this contention, noting that there was some doubt that the land in question was riparian at the time of the federal patent.  414 U. S., at 321 n. 11.  In its eagerness to do away with Bonelli 's result as well as its approach, however, today's opinion explicitly concludes that had Bonelli relied on the theory advocated by the petitioner there and the Solicitor General, it would now be rejected.  Ante, at 371-372, 378-381.  Nevertheless, the majority suggests that <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> might still control oceanfront property.  Ante, at 377 n. 6.  It is difficult to take seriously the suggestion that the national interest in international relations justifies applying a different rule to oceanfront land grants than to other grants by the Federal Government.  It is clear that the States have complete title to the lands below the line of mean high tide.  See Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296 U. S. 10 (1935); 43 U. S. C. ยงยง 1301 (a) (2), 1311.  These lands, of course, are the only place where the waters " `lap both the lands of the State and the boundaries of the international sea.' " Ante, at 377 n. 6, quoting <citedDecision>Hughes</citedDecision> v. Washington, <citedDecision>389 U. S., at 293</citedDecision> .  There are no international relations implications in the ownership of land above the line of mean high tide.  See Note, The Federal Rule of Accretion and California Coastal Protection, 48 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1457 , 1472 (1975).  [2]  The cross-petitions for certiorari did not raise the question whether federal law governed the outcome; they were concerned only with whether the Oregon courts properly interpreted the governing federal common law. The State's petition for certiorari in No. 76-567 stated the question presented as: "In a typical situation of a navigable river flowing through two channels, where the smaller of the two channels after 20 years of erosive flooding `suddenly' becomes the main channel, and the other channel eventually becomes unusable, does federal law deprive the public of title to the beds of both channels?" In No. 75-577, Corvallis Sand & Gravel Co. raised two questions in its petition for certiorari: "1.  Does plaintiff, State of Oregon, have sufficient ownership to maintain statutory ejectment to recover possession of the bed of a navigable fresh water stream where its claim of ownership is based on sovereignty rather than grant and where there is no allegation pleaded and no proof that the public rights of navigation, fishery and related uses are being impaired or interfered with by defendant Corvallis Sand and Gravel Company?  "2.
