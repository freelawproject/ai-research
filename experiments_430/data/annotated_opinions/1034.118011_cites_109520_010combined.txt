 It is true enough that the Act extends to the States a power withheld from them by the Constitution.  See California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202 (1987).  Nevertheless, we do not see how that consideration is relevant to the question whether Congress may abrogate state sovereign immunity.  The Eleventh Amendment immunity may not be lifted by Congress unilaterally deciding that it will be replaced *59 by grant of some other authority.  Cf. Atascadero, 473 U. S., at 246-247 ("[T]he mere receipt of federal funds cannot establish that a State has consented to suit in federal court").  Thus our inquiry into whether Congress has the power to abrogate unilaterally the States' immunity from suit is narrowly focused on one question: Was the Act in question passed pursuant to a constitutional provision granting Congress the power to abrogate?  See, e. g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, <citedDecision>427 U. S. 445, 452-456</citedDecision> (1976).  Previously, in conducting that inquiry, we have found authority to abrogate under only two provisions of the Constitution.  In <citedDecision>Fitzpatrick</citedDecision> , we recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment, by expanding federal power at the expense of state autonomy, had fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution.  <citedDecision>Id., at 455</citedDecision> .  We noted that § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contained prohibitions expressly directed at the States and that § 5 of the Amendment expressly provided that "The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article." See id., at 453 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We held that through the Fourteenth Amendment, federal power extended to intrude upon the province of the Eleventh Amendment and therefore that § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to abrogate the immunity from suit guaranteed by that Amendment.  In only one other case has congressional abrogation of the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity been upheld.  In Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1 (1989), a plurality of the Court found that the Interstate Commerce Clause, Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, granted Congress the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity, stating that the power to regulate interstate commerce would be "incomplete without the authority to render States liable in damages." 491 U. S., at 19-20.

Union Gas, supra, at 39.  Never before the decision in Union Gas had we suggested that the bounds of Article III could be expanded by Congress operating pursuant to any constitutional provision other than the Fourteenth Amendment.  Indeed, it had seemed fundamental that Congress could not expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts beyond the bounds of Article III. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803).  The plurality's citation of prior decisions for support was based upon what we believe to be a misreading of precedent.  See Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 40-41 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The plurality claimed support for its decision from a case holding the unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that the States may waive their sovereign immunity, see id., at 14-15 (citing Parden v. Terminal Railway of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184 (1964)), and cited as precedent propositions that had been merely assumed for the sake of argument in earlier cases, see 491 U. S., at 15 (citing Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S., at 475-476 , and n. 5, and County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S., at 252 ).  The plurality's extended reliance upon our decision in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, <citedDecision>427 U. S. 445</citedDecision> (1976), that Congress could under the Fourteenth Amendment abrogate the States' sovereign immunity was also, we believe, misplaced.  <citedDecision>Fitzpatrick</citedDecision> was based upon a rationale wholly inapplicable to the Interstate Commerce Clause, viz., that the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted well after the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment and the ratification of the Constitution, operated *66 to alter the pre-existing balance between state and federal power achieved by Article III and the Eleventh Amendment.  <citedDecision>Id., at 454</citedDecision> .  As the dissent in Union Gas made clear, <citedDecision>Fitzpatrick</citedDecision> cannot be read to justify "limitation of the principle embodied in the Eleventh Amendment through appeal to antecedent provisions of the Constitution." Union Gas, supra, at 42 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  In the five years since it was decided, Union Gas has proved to be a solitary departure from established law. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc. , 506 U. S. 139 (1993).  Reconsidering the decision in Union Gas, we conclude that none of the policies underlying stare decisis require our continuing adherence to its holding.  The decision has, since its issuance, been of questionable precedential value, largely because a majority of the Court expressly disagreed with the rationale of the plurality.  See Nichols v. United States, 511 U. S. 738, 746 (1994) (the "degree of confusion following a splintered decision .  .

 The Eleventh Circuit's dismissal of petitioner's suit is hereby affirmed.  [18] It is so ordered.  Justice Stevens, dissenting.  This case is about powerthe power of the Congress of the United States to create a private federal cause of action against a State, or its Governor, for the violation of a federal right.  In Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), the entire Courtincluding Justice Iredell whose dissent provided the blueprint for the Eleventh Amendmentassumed that Congress had such power.  In Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890)a case the Court purports to follow todaythe Court *77 again assumed that Congress had such power.  In Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, <citedDecision>427 U. S. 445</citedDecision> (1976), and Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 24 (1989) (Stevens, J., concurring), the Court squarely held that Congress has such power.  In a series of cases beginning with Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 238-239 (1985), the Court formulated a special "clear statement rule" to determine whether specific Acts of Congress contained an effective exercise of that power.  Nevertheless, in a sharp break with the past, today the Court holds that with the narrow and illogical exception of statutes enacted pursuant to the Enforcement Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress has no such power.  The importance of the majority's decision to overrule the Court's holding in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co .  cannot be overstated.  The majority's opinion does not simply preclude Congress from establishing the rather curious statutory scheme under which Indian tribes may seek the aid of a federal court to secure a State's good-faith negotiations over gaming regulations.  Rather, it prevents Congress from providing a federal forum for a broad range of actions against States, from those sounding in copyright and patent law, to those concerning bankruptcy, environmental law, and the regulation of our vast national economy.

 They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will." The Federalist No. 81, p. 488 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Here, of course, no question of a State's contractual obligations is presented.  The Seminole Tribe's only claim is that the State of Florida has failed to fulfill a duty to negotiate that federal statutory law alone imposes.  Neither the Federalist *93 Papers, nor Hans , provides support for the view that such a claim may not be heard in federal court. III In reaching my conclusion that the Constitution does not prevent Congress from making the State of Florida suable in federal court for violating one of its statutes, I emphasize that I agree with the majority that in all cases to which the judicial power does not extendeither because they are not within any category defined in Article III or because they are within the category withdrawn from Article III by the Eleventh AmendmentCongress lacks the power to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts.  As I have previously insisted: "A statute cannot amend the Constitution." Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 24 .  It was, therefore, misleading for the Court in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, <citedDecision>427 U. S. 445</citedDecision> (1976), to imply that § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment authorized Congress to confer jurisdiction over cases that had been withdrawn from Article III by the Eleventh Amendment.  Because that action had been brought by Connecticut citizens against officials of the State of Connecticut, jurisdiction was not precluded by the Eleventh Amendment.  As Justice Brennan pointed out in his concurrence, the congressional authority to enact the provisions at issue in the case was found in the Commerce Clause and provided a sufficient basis for refusing to allow the State to "avail itself of the nonconstitutional but ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity." Id., at 457 (opinion concurring in judgment).  In confronting the question whether a federal grant of jurisdiction is within the scope of Article III, as limited by the Eleventh Amendment, I see no reason to distinguish among statutes enacted pursuant to the power granted to Congress to regulate commerce among the several States, and with the Indian tribes, Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, the power to establish *94 uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy, Art. I, § 8, cl. 4, the power to promote the progress of science and the arts by granting exclusive rights to authors and inventors, Art. I, § 8, cl. 8, the power to enforce the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, § 5, or indeed any other provision of the Constitution.  There is no language anywhere in the constitutional text that authorizes Congress to expand the borders of Article III jurisdiction or to limit the coverage of the Eleventh Amendment.  The Court's holdings in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, <citedDecision>427 U. S. 445</citedDecision> (1976), and Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1 (1989), do unquestionably establish, however, that Congress has the power to deny the States and their officials the right to rely on the nonconstitutional defense of sovereign immunity in an action brought by one of their own citizens.  As the opinions in the latter case demonstrate, there can be legitimate disagreement about whether Congress intended a particular statute to authorize litigation against a State.  Nevertheless, the Court there squarely held that the Commerce Clause was an adequate source of authority for such a private remedy.  In a rather novel rejection of the doctrine of stare decisis, the Court today demeans that holding by repeatedly describing it as a "plurality decision" because Justice White did not deem it necessary to set forth the reasons for his vote.  As Justice Souter's opinion today demonstrates, the arguments in support of Justice White's position are so patent and so powerful that his actual vote should be accorded full respect.  Indeed, far more significant than the "plurality" character of the three opinions supporting the holding in Union Gas is the fact that the issue confronted today has been squarely addressed by a total of 13 Justices, 8 of whom cast their votes with the so-called "plurality." [15] *95 The fundamental error that continues to lead the Court astray is its failure to acknowledge that its modern embodiment of the ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity "has absolutely nothing to do with the limit on judicial power contained in the Eleventh Amendment."
