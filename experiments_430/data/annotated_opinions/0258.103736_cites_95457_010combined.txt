 Nor is there any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state.  Certainly Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U.S. 145 , did not so hold.  Indeed, the recent case of Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 306 U.S. 493, 502 , held that in the case of statutes "the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of another state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the courts of the state of its enactment with respect to the same persons and events." Moreover, Haddock v. Haddock is not based on the contrary theory.  Nor did it hold that a decree of divorce granted by the courts of one state need not be given full faith and credit in another if the grounds for the divorce would not be recognized by the courts of the forum.  It does not purport to challenge or disturb the rule, earlier established by Christmas v. Russell, supra , and subsequently fortified by Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra , that, even though the cause of action could not have been entertained in the state of the forum, a judgment obtained thereon in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit.  For the majority opinion in the Haddock case accepted both Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108 , and Atherton v. Atherton, <citedDecision>181 U.S. 155</citedDecision> .  Cheever v. Wilson held that a decree of divorce granted by a state in which one spouse was domiciled and which had personal jurisdiction over the other was as conclusive in other states as it was in the state where it was obtained.  <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> held that full faith and credit must be given a decree of divorce granted by *297 the state of the matrimonial domicil on constructive service against the other spouse who was a non-resident of that state.  The decisive difference between those cases and Haddock v. Haddock was said to be that, in the latter, the state granting the divorce had no jurisdiction over the absent spouse, since it was not the state of the matrimonial domicil, but the place where the husband had acquired a separate domicil after having wrongfully left his wife.  This Court accordingly classified Haddock v. Haddock with that group of cases which hold that when the courts of one state do not have jurisdiction either of the subject matter or of the person of the defendant, the courts of another state are not required by virtue of the full faith and credit clause to enforce the judgment.  [7] But such differences in result between Haddock v. Haddock and the cases which preceded it rest on distinctions which in our view are immaterial, so far as the full faith and credit clause and the supporting legislation are concerned.  The historical view that a proceeding for a divorce was a proceeding in rem (2 Bishop, Marriage & Divorce, 4th ed., § 164) was rejected by the Haddock case. We likewise agree that it does not aid in the solution of the problem presented by this case to label these proceedings as proceedings in rem. Such a suit, however, is not a mere in personam action.  Domicil of the plaintiff, immaterial to jurisdiction in a personal action, is recognized in the Haddock case and elsewhere (Beale, Conflict of Laws, § 110.1) as essential in order to give the court jurisdiction which will entitle the divorce decree to extraterritorial effect, at least when the defendant has neither been personally served nor entered an appearance.  The findings *298 made in the divorce decrees in the instant case must be treated on the issue before us as meeting those requirements.

 See Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, 286 U.S. 276, 279 ; New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, 300 U.S. 308, 313 ; Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463-464 ; Skiriotes v. Florida, 313 U.S. 69 .  Each state as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate concern in the marital status of persons domiciled within its borders.  The marriage relation creates problems of large social importance.  Protection of offspring, property interests, and the enforcement of marital responsibilities are but a few of commanding problems in the field of domestic relations with which the state must deal.  Thus it is plain that each state, by virtue of its command over its domiciliaries and its large interest in the institution of marriage, can alter within its *299 own borders the marriage status of the spouse domiciled there, even though the other spouse is absent.  There is no constitutional barrier if the form and nature of the substituted service (see Milliken v. Meyer, supra, p. 463 ) meet the requirements of due process.  <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Atherton, supra, p. 172</citedDecision> .  Accordingly, it was admitted in the Haddock case that the divorce decree, though not recognized in New York, was binding on both spouses in Connecticut where granted.  201 U.S. 569 , 572, 575, 579.  And this Court in Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 , upheld the validity within the Territory of Oregon of a divorce decree granted by the legislature to a husband domiciled there, even though the wife resided in Ohio where the husband had deserted her.  It therefore follows that, if the Nevada decrees are taken at their full face value (as they must be on the phase of the case with which we are presently concerned), they were wholly effective to change in that state the marital status of the petitioners and each of the other spouses by the North Carolina marriages.  Apart from the requirements of procedural due process ( <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Atherton, supra, p. 172</citedDecision> ) not challenged here by North Carolina, no reason based on the Federal Constitution has been advanced for the contrary conclusion.  But the concession that the decrees were effective in Nevada makes more compelling the reasons for rejection of the theory and result of the Haddock case. This Court stated in <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Atherton, supra, p. 162</citedDecision> , that "A husband without a wife, or a wife without a husband, is unknown to the law." But if one is lawfully divorced and remarried in Nevada and still married to the first spouse in North Carolina, an even more complicated and serious condition would be realized.  We would then have what the Supreme Court of Illinois declared to be the "most perplexing and distressing complications in the domestic relations of many citizens in the different States." Dunham v. Dunham, 162 Ill. 589, 607 .  Under the circumstances *300 of this case, a man would have two wives, a wife two husbands.  The reality of a sentence to prison proves that that is no mere play on words.  Each would be a bigamist for living in one state with the only one with whom the other state would permit him lawfully to live.  Children of the second marriage would be bastards in one state but legitimate in the other.

 Whatever may be said as to the practical effect which such a rule would have in clouding divorce decrees, the question as to where the fault lies has no relevancy to the existence of state power in such circumstances.  See Bingham, In the Matter of Haddock v. Haddock , 21 Corn.  L.Q.  393, 426.  The existence of the power of a state to alter the marital status of its domiciliaries, as distinguished from the wisdom of its exercise, is not dependent on the underlying causes of the domestic rift.  As we have said, it is dependent on the relationship which domicil creates and the pervasive control which a state has over marriage and divorce within its own borders.  <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Atherton</citedDecision> , which preceded Haddock v. Haddock , and Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551 , which followed it, recognized that the power of the state of the matrimonial domicil to grant a divorce from the absent spouse did not depend on whether his departure from the state was or was not *301 justified.  As stated above, we see no reason, and none has here been advanced, for making the existence of state power depend on an inquiry as to where the fault in each domestic dispute lies.  And it is difficult to prick out any such line of distinction in the generality of the words of the full faith and credit clause.  Moreover, so far as state power is concerned, no distinction between a matrimonial domicil and a domicil later acquired has been suggested or is apparent.  See Mr. Justice Holmes dissenting, Haddock v. Haddock, supra, p. 631 ; Goodrich, Matrimonial Domicile, 27 Yale L. Journ. 49.  It is one thing to say as a matter of state law that jurisdiction to grant a divorce from an absent spouse should depend on whether by consent or by conduct the latter has subjected his interest in the marriage status to the law of the separate domicil acquired by the other spouse.  Beale, Conflict of Laws, § 113.11; Restatement, Conflict of Laws, § 113.

 The duty of a state to respect the judgments of a sister state arises only where such judgments meet the tests of justice and fair dealing that are embodied in the historic phrase, "due process of law." But in this case all talk about due process is beside the mark.  If the actions of the Nevada court had been taken "without due process of law," the divorces which it purported to decree would have been without legal sanction in every state, including Nevada.  There would be no occasion to consider the applicability of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  It is precisely because the Nevada decrees do satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause and are binding in Nevada upon the absent spouses that we are called upon to decide whether these judgments, unassailable in the state which rendered them, are, despite the commands of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, null and void elsewhere.  North Carolina did not base its disregard of the Nevada decrees on the claim that they were a fraud and a sham, and no claim was made here on behalf of North Carolina *307 that the decrees were not valid in Nevada.  It is indisputable that the Nevada decrees here, like the Connecticut decree in the Haddock case, were valid and binding in the state where they were rendered.  Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U.S. 562, 569-70 ; Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 ; Atherton v. Atherton, <citedDecision>181 U.S. 155</citedDecision> .  In denying constitutional sanction to such a valid judgment outside the state which rendered it, the Haddock decision made an arbitrary break with the past and created distinctions incompatible with the role of this Court in enforcing the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  Freed from the hopeless refinements introduced by that case, the question before us is simply whether the Nevada decrees were rendered under circumstances that would make them binding against the absent spouses in the state where they were rendered.  North Carolina did not challenge the power of Nevada to declare the marital status of persons found to be Nevada residents.  North Carolina chose instead to disrespect the consequences of Nevada's exertion of such power.  It is therefore no more rhetorical to say that Nevada is seeking to impose its policy upon North Carolina than it is to say that North Carolina is seeking to impose its policy upon Nevada.  For all but a very small fraction of the community the niceties of resolving such conflicts among the laws of the states are, in all likelihood, matters of complete indifference.

Williard, supra, note 3 .  [6]  A spouse who appears and contests the jurisdiction of the court of another state to grant a divorce may not collaterally attack its findings of domicile and jurisdiction made after such appearance.  Davis v. Davis, 305 U.S. 32 .  So also, a deserter from the matrimonial domicile may be bound by a divorce granted by a court of the state where the matrimonial domicile is situated.  Whether fault on the part of the deserter is an essential seems on the basis of our cases on jurisdiction for divorce to be an open question; Atherton v. Atherton, <citedDecision>181 U.S. 155</citedDecision> ; Haddock v. Haddock, supra, at 570, 572, 583 ; and Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551 ; but our decisions on analogous problems might be found to afford adequate support for a decision that it is not.  Cf. Washington ex rel. Bond & Goodwin & Tucker v. Superior Court, 289 U.S. 361 ; Doherty & Co. v. Goodman, 294 U.S. 623 .  See, further, Restatement, Conflict of Laws, §§ 112, 113.  [7]  This was the decision in Bell v. Bell, 181 U.S. 175 ; And Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U.S. 14 .  Davis v. Davis, supra, note 6, in no way indicates that a finding of domicile after appearance of the absent spouse and litigation of the question would be conclusive upon the state of his domicile in litigation involving its interests and not merely those of the parties.
