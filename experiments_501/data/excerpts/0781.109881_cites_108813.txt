 See, e. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47-49 (1977); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 , 406 n. 1 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  Nor is this a case where we should “place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court’s own error.” Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).  First, Monroe v. Pape , insofar as it completely immunizes municipalities from suit under § 1983, was a departure from prior practice.  See, e. g., Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, 18 F. Cas. 393 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873); City of Manchester v. Leiby, 117 F. 2d 661 (CA1 1941); Hannan v. City of Haverhill, 120 F. 2d 87 (CA1 1941); Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157 (1943); Holmes v. Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 (1955), in each of which municipalities were defendants in § 1983 suits.  59 Moreover, the constitutional de- *696 feet that led to the rejection of the Sherman amendment would not have distinguished between municipalities and school boards, each of which is an instrumentality of state administration.  See supra, at 673-682.  For this reason, our cases — decided both before and after Monroe , see n. 5, supra— holding school boards liable in § 1983 actions are inconsistent with Monroe , especially as Monroe’s, immunizing principle was extended to suits for injunctive relief in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, <citedDecision>412 U. S. 507</citedDecision> (1973).  60 And although in many of these cases jurisdiction was not questioned, we ought not “disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years.” Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962); see Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, at 88 (Marshall, C. J.) (“Those decisions are not cited as authority .  .  .  but they have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench”).  Thus, while we have reaffirmed Monroe without further examination on three occasions, 61 it can scarcely be said that Monroe is so consistent with the warp and woof of civil rights law as to be beyond question.  Second, the principle of blanket immunity established in Monroe cannot be cabined short of school boards.  Yet such an extension would itself be inconsistent with recent expressions of congressional intent.  In the wake of our decisions, Congress not only has shown no hostility to federal-court decisions against school boards, but it has indeed rejected efforts to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over school boards.  62 Moreover, recognizing that school boards are often *697 defendants in school desegregation suits, which have almost without exception been § 1983 suits, Congress has twice passed legislation authorizing grants to school boards to assist them in complying with federal-court decrees.  63 Finally, in *698 regard to the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641 , 42 U. S. C. § 1988 (1976 ed.), which allows prevailing parties (in the discretion of the court) in § 1983 suits *699 to obtain attorney’s fees from the losing parties, the Senate stated: “[Defendants in these cases are often State or local bodies or State or local officials.  In such cases it is intended that the attorneys’ fees, like other items of costs, will be collected either directly from the official, in his official capacity, from funds of his agency or under his control, or from the State or local government (whether or not the agency or government is a named party).” S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).  Far from showing that Congress has relied on Monroe , therefore, events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of Monroe to school boards and has attempted to allow awards of attorney’s fees against local governments even though Monroe, City of Kenosha v. <citedDecision>Bruno</citedDecision> , and Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible.  64 Third, municipalities can assert no reliance claim which can *700 support an absolute immunity.  As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in Monroe , “[t]his is not an area of commercial law in which, presumably, individuals may have arranged their affairs in reliance on the expected stability of decision.” 365 U. S., at 221-222 (dissenting in part).  Indeed, municipalities simply cannot “arrange their affairs” on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely since injunctive suits against local officials under § 1983 would prohibit any such arrangement.  And it scarcely need be mentioned that nothing in Monroe encourages municipalities to violate constitutional rights or even suggests that such violations are anything other than completely wrong.  Finally, even under the most stringent test for the propriety of overruling a statutory decision proposed by Mr. Justice Harlan in Monroe 65 — “that it appear beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [Monroe] misapprehended the meaning of the [section],” 365 U. S., at 192 (concurring opinion) — the overruling of Monroe insofar as it holds that local governments are not “persons” who may be defendants in § 1983 suits is clearly proper.  It is simply beyond doubt that, under the 1871 Congress’ view of the law, were § 1983 liability unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state officers.

Des Moines Independent School District, supra, at 504; McNeese v. Board of Education, supra, at 671.  However, we do uphold Monroe v. Pape insofar as it holds that the doctrine of respondeat superior is not a basis for rendering municipalities *664 liable under § 1983 for the constitutional torts of their employees.  See Part II, infra.  We expressly declined to consider “policy considerations” for or against municipal liability.  See 365 U. S., at 191.  Mr. Justice Douglas, the author of Monroe, has suggested that the municipal exclusion might more properly rest on a theory that Congress sought to prevent the financial ruin that civil rights liability might impose on municipalities.  See City of Kenosha v. Bruno, <citedDecision>412 U. S. 507, 517-520</citedDecision> *665 (1973).  However, this view has never been shared by the Court, see Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S., at 190 ; Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 708 (1973), and the debates do not support this position.  Globe 522.  Briefly, § 2 created certain federal crimes in addition to those defined in § 2 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, 14 Stat. 27 , each aimed primarily at the Ku Klux Klan.  Section 3 provided that the President could send the militia into any State wracked with Klan violence.  Finally, § 4 provided for suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in enumerated circumstances, again primarily those thought to obtain where Klan violence was rampant.  See Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 335-336 (1871) (hereinafter Globe App.).

 Nonetheless, when Congress’ rejection of the only form of vicarious liability presented to it is combined with the absence of any language in § 1983 which can easily be construed to create respondeat superior Lability, the inference that Congress did not intend to impose such liability is quite strong.  A third justification, often cited but which on examination is apparently insufficient to justify the doctrine of respondeat superior, see, e. g., 2 F. Harper & F. James, § 26.3, is that liability follows the right to control the actions of a tortfeasor.  By our decision in Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U. S. 362 (1976), we would appear to have decided that the mere right to control without any control or direction having been exercised and without any failure to supervise is not enough to support § 1983 liability.  See 423 U. S., at 370-371 .  Each case cited by Monroe, see 365 U. S., at 191 n. 50, as consistent with the position that local governments were not § 1983 “persons” reached its - conclusion by assuming that state-law immunities overrode the § 1983 cause of action.  This has never been the law. Although many suits against school boards also include private individuals as parties, the “principal defendant is usually the local board of education or school board.” Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S., at 292-293 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973); City of Kenosha v. Bruno, <citedDecision>412 U. S. 507</citedDecision> (1973); Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976).  During the heyday of the furor over busing, both the House and the *697 Senate refused to adopt bills that would have removed from the federal courts jurisdiction "to make any decision, enter any judgment, or issue any order requiring any school hoard to malee any change in the racial composition of the student body at any public school or in any class at any public school to which students are assigned in conformity with a freedom of choice system, or requiring any school hoard to transport any students from one public school to another public school or from one place to another place or from one school district to another school district in order to effect a change in the racial composition of the student body at any school or place or in any school district, or denying to any student the right or privilege of attending any public school or class at any public school chosen by the parent of such student in conformity with a freedom of choice system, or requiring any school hoard to close any school and transfer the students from the closed school to any other school for the purpose of altering the racial composition of the student body at any public school, or precluding any school board from carrying into effect any provision of any contract between it and any membqr of the faculty of any public school it operates specifying the public school where the member of the faculty is to perform his or her duties under the contract.” S. 1737, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., § 1207 (1973) (emphasis added).  Other bills designed either completely to remove the federal courts from the school desegregation controversy, S. 287, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973), or to limit the ability of federal courts to subject school boards to remedial orders in desegregation cases, S. 619, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973); S. 179, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., § 2 (a) (1973); H. R. 13534, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., § 1 (1972), have similarly failed.  In 1972, spurred by a finding “that the process of eliminating or preventing minority group isolation and improving the quality of education for all children often involves the expenditure of additional funds to which local educational agencies do not have access,” 86 Stat. 354 , 20 U. S. C. § 1601 (a) (1976 ed.), Congress passed the Emergency School Aid Act.  Section 706 (a)(1) (A) (i) of that Act, 20 U. S. C. § 1605 (a) (1) (A) (i) (1976 ed.), authorizes the Assistant Secretary “to make a grant to, or a contract with, a local educational agency [w]hich is implementing a plan .  .  .

 20 U. S. C. §§ 1703 , *699 1706, 1708, 1710, 1718 (1976 ed.).  The Act assumes that school boards will usually be the defendants in such suits.  For example, § 211 of the Act, 88 Stat. 516 , as set forth in 20 U. S. C. § 1710 (1976 ed.), provides: “The Attorney General shall not institute a civil action under section 1706 of this title [which allows for suit by both private parties and the Attorney General to redress discrimination in public education] before he— “ (a) gives to the appropriate educational agency notice of the condition or conditions which, in his judgment, constitute a violation of part 2 [the prohibitions against discrimination in public education].” Section 219 of the Act, -20 II.  S. C. § 1718 (1976 ed.), provides for the termination of court-ordered busing “if the court finds the defendant educational agency has satisfied the requirements of the fifth or fourteenth amendments to the Constitution, whichever is applicable, and will continue to be in compliance with the requirements thereof.” Whether Congress’ attempt is in fact effective is the subject of Hutto v. Finney, O. T. 1977, No. 76-1660, cert. granted, 434 U. S. 901 , and therefore we express no view on it here.  We note, however, that Mr. Justice Harlan’s test has not been expressly adopted by this Court. Moreover, that test is based on two factors: stare decisis and “indications of congressional acceptance of this Court’s earlier interpretation [of the statute in question]365 U. S., at 192.  As we have explained, the second consideration is not present in this case. No useful purpose would be served by an attempt at this late date to determine whether Monroe was correct on its facts.  Similarly, since this case clearly involves official policy and does not involve respondeat superior, we do not assay a view on how our cases which have relied on that aspect of Monroe that is overruled today — Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973); City of Kenosha v. Bruno, <citedDecision>412 U. S. 507</citedDecision> (1973); and Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976) — should have been decided on a correct view of § 1983.  Nothing we say today affects the conclusion reached in Moor , see 411 U. S., at 703-704, that 42 U. S. C. § 1988 cannot be used to create a federal cause of action where § 1983 does not otherwise provide one, or the conclusion reached in <citedDecision>City of Kenosha</citedDecision> , see <citedDecision>412 U. S., at 513</citedDecision> , that "nothing .  .  .  suggest [s] that the generic word 'person’ in § 1983 was intended to have a bifurcated application to municipal corporations depending on the nature of the relief sought against them.”


**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting.  Seventeen years ago, in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961), this Court held that the 42d Congress did not intend to subject a municipal corporation to liability as a “person” within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. § 1983 .  Since then, the Congress has remained silent, but this Court has reaffirmed that holding on at least three separate occasions.  Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976); City of Kenosha v. Bruno, <citedDecision>412 U. S. 507</citedDecision> (1973); Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973).  See also Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 277-279 (1977).  Today, the Court abandons this long and consistent line of precedents, offering in justification only an elaborate canvass of the same legislative history which was before the Court in 1961.  Because I cannot agree that this Court is “free to disregard these precedents,” which have been “considered maturely and recently” by this Court, Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 186 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring), I am compelled to dissent.  I As this Court has repeatedly recognized, id., at 175 n. 12; Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 , 671 n. 14 (1974), considerations of stare decisis are at their strongest when this Court confronts its previous constructions of legislation.  In all cases, private parties shape their conduct according to this Court’s settled construction of the law, but the Congress is at *715 liberty to correct our mistakes of statutory construction, unlike our constitutional interpretations, whenever it sees fit.  The controlling principles were best stated by Mr. Justice Brandéis: “Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.
