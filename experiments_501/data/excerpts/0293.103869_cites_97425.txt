 Normally it is true that strong considerations of fiscal and social policy view tax exemptions with a hostile eye.  Such exemptions are not to be lightly implied, and every reasonable implication in construing legislation is to be *613 made against their grant.  But this general doctrine against tax exemption is irrelevant in considering the taxing power of a state in relation to Indians.  For as to them a totally different principle comes into operation, namely, the special status of Indians during the whole course of our constitutional and legal history.  There can be no doubt of Congress’ plenary power to exempt Indians and their property from all forms of state taxation.  Such power exists to prevent impairment of the manner in, or means by which Congress effectuates its Indian policy, at least so long as Congress has not determined that the interests of the Indians require their complete release from tutelage or the final termination of the United States’ guardianship over them.  Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U. S. 705 ; cf. Tiger v. Western Investment Co., <citedDecision>221 U. S. 286, 315-16</citedDecision> ; Brader v. James, 246 U. S. 88, 96 ; United States v. McGowan, 302 U. S. 535, 538 .  See United States v. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 45-47 .  To deny such constitutional power is to deny the presupposition of all legislation relating to Indians as well as an unbroken line of decisions on Indian law in this Court and all that underlies them.  This course of legislation and adjudication may be fairly summarized as recognizing the special relation of Indians toward the United States and the exclusion of state power with relation to them, except in so far as the federal government has actually released to the state governments its constitutional supremacy over this special field.  Therefore, so far as the power of a state to tax Indian property is concerned, the ordinary rule of tax exemption is reversed; a state must make an affirmative showing of a grant by Congress of the withdrawal of the immunity of Indian property from state taxation.  This is so because it is Indian property and because Indians stand in a special relation to the federal government from which the states are excluded unless the Congress has manifested *614 a clear purpose to terminate such an immunity and allow states to treat Indians as part of the general community.  Congress has manifested no such purpose with regard to the estates of the deceased Indians before us.

 The United States was unable, however, to prevent state interference with the Creeks and the Seminóles in their domains east of the Mississippi, and accordingly proposed removal west of the Mississippi, guaranteeing that there no State or Territory should “ever have a right to pass laws for the government of such Indians, but they shall be allowed to govern themselves, so far as may be compatible with the general jurisdiction which Congress may think proper to exercise over them.” Article XIV, Treaty of March 24, 1832 ( 7 Stat. 366 ).  Long after the removal this guarantee was reaffirmed.  Article IV, Treaty of August 7, 1856 ( 11 Stat. 699 ).  Nothing in the subsequent *617 treaties and allotment acts relating specifically to the Creeks and the Seminóles was inconsistent with this guarantee of freedom from state control.  7 And Congress was careful to provide that nothing in the creation of the State of Oklahoma should qualify this promise.  Thus the Oklahoma Enabling Act ( 34 Stat. 267 ) provided that the Oklahoma Constitution should not “limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.” The constitution adopted by the people of Oklahoma renounced any claims to Indian lands (Art. 1, § 3), and exempted from taxation “such property as may be exempt by reason of treaty stipulations, existing between the Indians and the United States Government, or by Federal laws, during the force and effect of such treaties or Federal laws” (Art. X, § 6).  See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., <citedDecision>221 U. S. 286, 309</citedDecision> ; Ex parte Webb, 226 U. S. 663 , 682-83; Ward v. Love County, 253 U. S. 17 ; Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363, 366 .  As we recently said in Board of Commissioners v. Seber, supra, Congress in 1887 turned from a policy of protecting Indian tribes in the possession of their domains to a program, now discontinued, of assimilating the Indians through dissolution of their tribal governments and the compulsory individualization of their lands.  This allotment program evolved out of the historical background sketched above, and took its cue from the previous protection and freedom from state control accorded Indians and their lands.  The Indian surrendered tribal land, pro *618 tected against state taxation as well as against all other forms of voluntary and involuntary encumbrance and alienation.  Cf. The Kansas Indians, supra; The New York Indians, supra. Under the various allotment acts he received in return land which was intended to have the same measure of protection for a temporary period, generally subject to extension.  Thus the General Allotment Act of 1887 ( 24 Stat. 388 ) provided for the issuance to allottees of trust patents which were to declare: “the United States does .  .

 9 But there are no differences of substance between the two forms of tenure which suggest that while the one is exempt from state taxation, the other is not, or that Congress intended to favor Indians holding under “trust patents” over those holding restricted fees.  ‘ Cf. The Kansas Indians, supra, at p. 755.  The power of Congress over “trust” and “restricted” lands is the same, Board of Commissioners v. Seber, supra, and in practice the terms have been used interchangeably.  See United States v. Bowling, 256 U. S. 484 ; cf. Minnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382 .  Both devices had a common purpose, to protect a dependent *619 people against loss of their property through their own improvidence or the greed of others during the period of transition in which they began to assume the responsibilities of citizenship.  To achieve this purpose the protection afforded by Congress was not niggardly.  See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., <citedDecision>221 U. S. 286</citedDecision> ; Heckman v. United States, 224 U. S. 413 ; Brader v. James, 246 U. S. 88 .  State taxation of “restricted” lands as well as taxation of “trust” lands, in the absence of Congressional authorization, is a possible cause of the loss which Congress has said shall not occur.  The restrictions are not limited to voluntary sale — consistently with their purpose they extend to all forms of transfer or encumbrance, involuntary as well as voluntary.  Cf. Goudy v. Meath, 203 U. S. 146 .  The interference of state taxation with Congress’ program of protection is made clear by the fact that the instant Oklahoma inheritance tax acts impose liens upon the property until the taxes are paid.  10 The possible consequences of a tax lien upon Indian property are pointed out in The New York Indians, supra, where it was held that the mere existence of a lien in a state taxing act invalidates it, despite a provision to the effect that no foreclosure of a lien should affect the Indian’s right of occupancy.  And, even when permitting specified forms of state taxation of restricted Indian property, Congress has significantly provided in numerous statutes that no tax lien should attach.
