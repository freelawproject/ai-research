Mr. Justice Nehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court. On March 5, 1975, respondent, a member of the police force in Muskegon, Mich., was charged in a three-count indictment with distribution of various narcotics.  Both before his trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan, and twice during the trial, respondent moved to dismiss the two counts of the indictment which concerned transactions that took place during the preceding September, on the ground that his defense had been prejudiced by prein-dictment delay.  At the close of all the evidence, the court granted respondent’s motion.  Although the court did not explain its reasons for dismissing the second count, it explicitly concluded that respondent had “presented sufficient proof of prejudice with respect to Count I.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a.  The court submitted the third count to the jury, which returned a verdict of not guilty.  The Government sought to appeal the dismissals of the first two counts to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  That court, relying on our opinion in United States v. Jenkins, <citedDecision>420 U. S. 358</citedDecision> (1975), concluded that any further prosecution of respondent was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and therefore dismissed the appeal.  544 F. 2d 903 (1976).  The Government has sought review in this Court only with regard to the dismissal of the first count.  We granted certiorari to give further consideration to the applicability of the Double Jeopardy Clause to Government appeals from orders granting defense motions to terminate a trial before verdict.  We now reverse.  I The problem presented by this case could not have arisen during the first century of this Court’s existence.  The Court has long taken the view that the United States has no right of *85 appeal in a criminal case, absent explicit statutory authority.

 1 In 1971, however, Congress adopted the current language of the Act, permitting Government appeals from any decision dismissing an indictment, “except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.” 18 U. S. C. §3731 (1976 ed.).  Soon thereafter, this Court remarked in .a footnote., with more optimism than prescience that “[t]he end of our problems with this Act is finally in sight.” United States v. Weller, 401 U. S. 254 , 255 n. 1 (1971).  For in fact the 1971 amendment did not end the debate over appeals by the Government in'', criminal cases; it simply shifted the focus of the debate from j issues of statutory construction to issues as to the scope and J meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  • > In our first encounter with the new statute, we concluded that “Congress intended to remove all statutory, barriers to Government appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit.” United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 337 (1975).  Since up to that point Government appeals had been subject to statutory restrictions independent of the Double Jeopardy Clause, our previous cases construing the statute proved to be of little assistance in determining when the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment would *86 prohibit further prosecution.  A detailed canvass of the history of the double jeopardy principles in English and American law led us to conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause was primarily “directed at the threat of multiple prosecutions,” and posed no bar to Government appeals “where those appeals would not require a new trial.” Id., at 342 .  We accordingly held in <citedDecision>Jenkins, supra, at 370</citedDecision> , that, whether or not a dismissal of an indictment after jeopardy had attached amounted to an acquittal on the merits, the Government had no right to appeal, because “further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand.” 2 If <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> is a correct statement of the law, the judgment of the Court of Appeals relying on that decision, as it was bound to do, would in all likelihood have to be affirmed.  3 Yet, though our assessment of the history and meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause in Wilson, Jenkins, and Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377 (1975), occurred only three Terms ago, our vastly increased exposure to the various facets of the Double Jeopardy Clause has now convinced us that <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> *87 was wrongly decided.  It placed an unwarrantedly great emphasis on the defendant’s right to have his guilt decided by the first jury empaneled to try him so as to include those cases where the defendant himself seeks to terminate the trial before verdict on grounds unrelated to factual guilt or innocence.  We have therefore decided to overrule <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> , and thus to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case. II The origin and history of the Double Jeopardy Clause are hardly a matter of dispute.  See generally Wilson; supra, at 339-340; Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187-188 (1957); id., at 200 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  The constitutional provision had its origin in the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon.  These three pleas prevented the retrial of a person who had previously been acquitted, convicted, or pardoned for the same offense.  As this Court has described the purpose underlying the prohibition against double jeopardy: “The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to malee repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.” Green, supra, at 187-188 .  These historical purposes are necessarily general in nature, and their application has come to abound in often subtle distinctions which cannot by any means all be traced to the original three common-law pleas referred to above.  Part of the difficulty arises from the development of other protections for criminal defendants in the years since the *88 adoption of the Bill of Rights.

 Such a motion ,by the defendant is deemed to be a deliberate election on his part to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined before the first trier of fact.  “The important considera *94 tion, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of such error.” United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600, 609 (1976).  But “[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause does protect a defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby to subject defendants to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions.” Id., at 611 .  B We turn now to the relationship between the Double Jeopardy Clause and reprosecution of a defendant who has successfully obtained not a mistrial but a termination of the trial in his favor before any determination of factual guilt or innocence.  Unlike the typical mistrial, the granting of a motion such as this obviously contemplates that the proceedings will terminate then and there in favor of the defendant.  The prosecution, if it wishes to reinstate the proceedings in the face of such a ruling, ordinarily must seek reversal of the decision of the trial court. The Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U. S. C. § 3731 (1976 ed.), as previously noted, makes appealability of a ruling favorable to the defendant depend upon whether further proceedings upon reversal would be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Jenkins, <citedDecision>420 U. S., at 370</citedDecision> , held that, regardless of the character of the midtrial termination, appeal was barred if “further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand.” However, only last Term, in Lee, supra, the Government was permitted to institute a second prosecution after a midtrial dismissal of an indictment.  The Court found the circumstances presented by that case “functionally indistinguishable from a declaration of mistrial.” 432 U. S., at 31 .  Thus, Lee demonstrated that, at least in some cases, the dismissal of an indictment may be treated on the same basis as the declaration of a mistrial.  *95 In the present case, the District Court’s dismissal of the first count of the indictment was based upon a claim of prein-dictment delay and not on the court’s conclusion that the Government had not produced sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the defendant.  Respondent Scott points out quite correctly that he had moved to dismiss the indictment on this ground prior to trial, and that had the District Court chosen to grant it at that time the Government could have appealed the ruling under our holding in Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377 (1975).  He also quite correctly points out that jeopardy had undeniably “attached” at the time the District Court terminated the trial in his favor; since a successful Government appeal would require further proceedings in the District Court leading to a factual resolution of the issue of guilt or innocence, <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> bars the Government’s appeal.  However, our growing experience with Government appeals convinces us that we must re-examine the rationale of <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> in light of Lee, Martin Linen, and other recent expositions of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  IV Our decision in <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> was based upon our perceptions of the underlying purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, see supra, at 87: “ ‘The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity ....’” <citedDecision>Jenkins, supra, at 370</citedDecision> , quoting Green, 355 U. S., at 187 .  Upon fuller consideration, we are now of the view that this language from Green , while entirely appropriate in the circumstances of that opinion, is not a principle which can be *96 expanded to include situations in which the defendant is responsible for the second prosecution.  It is quite true that the Government with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense.  This truth is expressed in the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon, which lie at the core of the area protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  As we have recognized in cases from United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896), to Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54, a defendant once acquitted may not be again subjected to trial without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.  But that situation is obviously a far cry from the present case, where the Government was quite willing to continue with its production of evidence to show the defendant guilty before the jury first empaneled to try him, but the defendant elected to seek termination of the trial on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence.  This is scarcely a picture of an all-powerful state relentlessly pursuing a defendant who had either been found not guilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact.

 In Green the question of the defendant’s factual guilt or innocence of murder in the first degree was actually submitted to the jury as a trier of fact; in the present case, respondent successfully avoided such a submission of the first count of the indictment by persuading the trial court to dismiss it on a basis which did not depend on guilt or innocence.  He was thus neither acquitted nor convicted, because he himself successfully undertook to persuade the trial court not to submit the issue of guilt or innocence to the jury which had been empaneled to try him.  The reason for treating a trial aborted on the initiative of the trial judge differently from a trial verdict reversed on appeal, for purposes of double jeopardy, is thus described in Jorn, 400 U. S., at 484 (opinion of Harlan, J.): “[I]n the [second] situation the defendant has not been deprived of his option to go to the first jury, and, perhaps, end the dispute then and there with an acquittal.  On the other hand, where the judge, acting without the defendant’s consent, aborts the proceeding, the defendant has *100 been deprived of his Valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.5 ” We think the same reasoning applies in pari passu where the defendant, instead of obtaining a reversal of his conviction on appeal, obtains the termination of the proceedings against him in the trial court without any finding by a court or jury as to his guilt or innocence.  He has not been “deprived55 of his valued right to go to the first jury; only the public has been deprived of its valued right to “one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws.55 Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S., at 509 .  No interest protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause is invaded when the Government is allowed to appeal and seek reversal of such a midtrial termination of the proceedings in a manner favorable to the defendant.  13 It is obvious from what we have said that we believe we pressed too far in <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> the concept of the “defendant's valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tri *101 bunal.” Wade v. Hunter, 336 U. S. 684, 689 (1949).  We now conclude that where the defendant himself seeks to have the trial terminated without any submission to either judge or jury as to his guilt or innocence, an appeal by the Government from his successful effort to do so is not barred by 18 U. S. C. §3731 (1976 ed.).  We recognize the force of the doctrine of stare decisis, but we are conscious as well of the admonition of Mr. Justice Brandéis: “[I]n cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.  The Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function.” Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406-408 (1932) (dissenting opinion).  Here, “the lessons of experience” indicate that Government appeals from midtrial dismissals requested by the defendant would significantly advance the public interest in assuring that each defendant shall be subject to a just judgment on the merits of his case, without “enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.” Green, 355 U. S., at 188 .  Accordingly, the contrary holding of United States v. <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> is overruled.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.  It is so ordered.  A thorough account of the enactment and development of the Act is set out in Mr. Justice Harlan’s opinion for the Court in United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267, 291-296 (1970).  The rule established in Wilson and <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> was later described in the following terms: “[Dismissals (as opposed to mistrials) if they occurred at a stage of the proceeding after which jeopardy had attached, but prior to the factfinder’s conclusion as to guilt or innocence, were final so far as the accused defendant was concerned and could not be appealed by the Government because retrial was barred by double jeopardy.  This made the issue of double jeopardy turn very largely on temporal considerations — if the Court granted an order of dismissal during the factfinding stage of the proceedings, the defendant could not be reprosecuted, but if the dismissal came later, he could.” Lee v. United, States, 432 U. S. 23, 36 (1977) (RehN-qtjist, J., concurring).  The Government contends here that the District Court in <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> entered a judgment of acquittal in favor of Jenkins, but our opinion in that case recognized that it could not be said with certainty whether this was the case. See Jenkins, <citedDecision>420 U. S., at 367</citedDecision> .  Two years later, review was provided for all "infamous” crimes.  Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, § 5, 26 Stat. 827 .  The Court thereby rejected the English rule set out in Vaux’s Case, 4 Co. Rep. 44a, 76 Eng. Rep. 992 (K. B. 1590), which refused to recognize a plea of autrefois acquit where the initial indictment had been insufficient to support a conviction.  Again, this ruling provided a greater measure of protection for criminal defendants than had been known at the time of the *89 adoption of the Constitution.  A contrary ruling would have altered this Court’s task in such cases as Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23 (1977), and Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S. 458 (1973).  In so doing, the Court rejected the contention of Mr, Justice Holmes in dissent that “there is no rule that a man may not be tried twice in the same case.” 195 U. S., at 134 .  He went on to say: “If a statute should give the right to take exceptions to the Government, I believe it would be impossible to maintain that the prisoner would be protected by the Constitution from being tried again.  He no more would be put in jeopardy a second time when retried because of a mistake of law in his favor, than he would be when retried for a mistake that did him harm.” Id., at 135 .  Mr. Justice Holmes’ concept of continuing jeopardy would have greatly simplified the matter of Government appeals, but it has never been accepted by a majority of this Court. See Jenkins, <citedDecision>420 U. S., at 358</citedDecision> .  In <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> we had assumed that a judgment of acquittal could be appealed where no retrial would be needed on remand: “When this principle is applied to the situation where the jury returns a verdict of guilt but the trial court thereafter enters a judgment of acquittal, an appeal is permitted.  In that situation a conclusion by an appellate court that the judgment of acquittal was improper does not require a criminal defendant to submit to a second trial; the error can be corrected on remand by the entry of a judgment on the verdict.” Id,., at 365.  Despite the Court’s heavy emphasis on the finality of an acquittal in Martin Linen and Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54, neither decision explicitly repudiates this assumption.  Sanabria, ante, at 75; Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at 569-570 .  Downum , in 1963, was the first case in which this Court actually reversed a subsequent conviction because of an improper declaration of a mistrial.  This, too, provided greater protection for a defendant than was available at the common law. Although English precedents clearly disapproved of unnecessary mistrials, see generally Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S., at 506-508 , and nn. 21-23, the English rule at the time of the adoption of the Constitution was, as it remains today, that nothing short of a final judgment would bar further prosecution.  “The fact that the jury was discharged without giving a verdict cannot be a bar to a subsequent indictment.” 11 Halsbury’s Laws of England, Criminal Law, Evidence, and Procedure ¶242 (4th ed. 1976).  In <citedDecision>Jenkins</citedDecision> , which was a bench trial, we had difficulty, as did the Court of Appeals in that case, in characterizing the jorecise import of the District Court’s order dismissing the indictment.  The analysis that governed our disposition turned not on whether the defendant had -been acquitted but on whether the proceeding had terminated “in the defendant’s favor,” 420 U. S., at 365 n. 7, and whether “further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand,” id., at 370.  We thus had no occasion to determine whether the District Court simply had made "an erroneous interpretation of the controlling law,” id., at 365 n. 7, or whether it had “resolved [controlling] issues of fact in favor of the respondent,” id., at 367; see id., at 362 n. 3.  The defense of insanity in a federal criminal prosecution was first recognized by this Court in Davis v. United States, 160 U. S. 469 (1895).  Mr. Justice Harlan’s opinion for the Court construed federal law in light of the larger body of common law in other jurisdictions, and concluded: “One who takes human life cannot be said to be actuated by malice aforethought, or to have deliberately intended to take life, or to have 'a wicked, depraved, and malignant heart,’ or a heart 'regardless of society duty and fatally bent on mischief’ unless at the time he had sufficient mind to comprehend the criminality or the right and wrong of such an act.” Id., at 485 .  While Congress has never made explicit statutory provision for this affirmative defense or any other, it has recognized the validity of the defense by regulating its use in federal prosecutions.
