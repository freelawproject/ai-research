And we may assume that Mercoid did not act innocently. Indeed the Circuit Court of Appeals said that it could find no use for the accused devices other than in the Cross combination patent. And it assumed, as was held in Smith v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., 106 F. 2d 622, that the Cross patent was valid. But though we assume the validity of the patent and accept fully the findings of the Circuit Court of Appeals, we think the judgment below should be reversed. Ever since Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, was overruled by Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U. S. 602, this Court has consistently held that the owner of a patent may not employ it to secure a limited monopoly of an unpatented material used in applying the invention. Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>; Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>; Morton Salt *665 Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., 314 U. S. 488; B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, 314 U. S. 495. In those cases both direct and contributory infringement suits were disallowed on a showing that the owner of the patent was using it “as the effective means of restraining competition with its sale of an unpatented article.” Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 490. The Court has repeatedly held that to allow such suits would be to extend the aid of a court of equity in expanding the patent beyond the legitimate scope of its monopoly. It is true that those cases involved the use of the patent for a machine or process to secure a partial monopoly in supplies consumed in its operation or unpatented materials employed in it. But we can see no difference in principle where the unpatented material or device is itself an integral part of the structure embodying the patent. The grant of a patent is the grant of a special privilege “to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.” Const., Art. I, § 8. It carries, of course, a right to be free from competition in the practice of the invention. But the limits of the patent are narrowly and strictly confined to the precise terms of the grant. Ethyl Gasoline Corp. v. United States, 309 U. S. 436, 456; United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U. S. 241, 251. It is the public interest which is dominant in the patent system. Pennock v. Dialogue, 2 Pet. 1; Kendall v. Winsor, 21 How. 322, 329; Adams v. Burke, 17 Wall. 453; Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, pp. 510-511; Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>; United States v. Masonite Corp., 316 U. S. 265, 278. It is the protection of the public in a system of free enterprise which alike nullifies a patent where any part of it is invalid (Marconi Wireless Co. v. United States, 320 U. S. 1, 58; and see General Electric Co. v. Wabash Corp., 304 U. S. 364, 372) and denies to the patentee after issuance the power to use it in such a way as to acquire a monopoly which is not plainly within. *666 the terms of the grant. The necessities or convenience of the patentee do not justify any use of the monopoly of the patent to create another monopoly. The fact that the patentee has the power to refuse a license does not enable him to enlarge the monopoly of the patent by the expedient of attaching conditions to its use. United States v. Masonite Corp., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 277. The method by which the monopoly is sought to be extended is immaterial. United States v. Univis Lens Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, pp. 251-252. The patent is a privilege. But it is a privilege which is conditioned by a public purpose. It results from invention and is limited to the invention which it defines. When the patentee ties something else to his invention, he acts only by virtue of his right as the owner of property to make contracts concerning it and not otherwise. He then is subject to all the limitations upon that right which the general law imposes upon such contracts.

But for the patent such restraint on trade would plainly run afoul of the anti-trust laws. If the restraint is lawful because of the patent, the patent will have been expanded by contract. That on which no patent could be obtained would be as effectively protected as if a patent had been issued. Private business would function as its own patent office and impose its own law upon its licensees. It would obtain by contract what letters patent alone may grant. Such a vast power “to multiply monopolies” at the will of the patentee (Chief Justice White dissenting in Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 63) would carve out exceptions to the anti-trust laws which Congress has not sanctioned. Mr. Justice Brandéis, speaking for the Court, stated in the Carbice case that “Control over the supply of such un-patented material is beyond the scope of the patentee’s monopoly; and this limitation, inherent in the patent grant, is not dependent upon the peculiar function or character of the unpatented material or on the way in which it is used.” 283 U. S. p. 33. We now add that it makes no difference that the unpatented device is part of the patented whole. That result may not be obviated in the present case by calling the combustion stoker switch the “heart of the invention” or the “advance in the art.” The patent is for a combination only. Since none of the separate elements of the combination is claimed as the invention, none of them when dealt with separately is protected by the patent monopoly. Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 1), 213 U. S. 301, 318. Whether the parts are new or old, the combination is the in *668 vention and it is distinct from any of them. See Schumacher v. Cornell, 96 U. S. 549, 554; Rowell v. Lindsay, 113 U. S. 97, 101. If a limited monopoly over the combustion stoker switch were allowed, it would not be a monopoly accorded inventive genius by the patent laws but a monopoly born of a commercial desire to avoid the rigors of competition fostered by the anti-trust laws. If such an expansion of the patent monopoly could be effected by contract, the integrity of the patent system would be seriously compromised. Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 2), <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, is authority for the conclusion that he who sells an unpatented part of a combination patent for use in the assembled machine may be guilty of contributory infringement. The protection which the Court in that case extended to the phonograph record, which was an unpat-ented part of the patented phonograph, is in substance inconsistent with the view which we have expressed in this case. The rule of the Leeds & Catlin case (No. 2) accordingly must no longer prevail against the defense 1 that a combination patent is being used to protect an unpatented part from competition. That result obtains here though we assume for the purposes of this case that Mercoid was a contributory infringer and that respondents could have enjoined the infringement had they not misused the patent for the purpose of monopolizing unpatented material. Inasmuch as their misuse of the patent would have precluded them from enjoining a direct infringement (Mor *669 ton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>) they cannot stand in any better position with respect to a contributory infringer. Where there is a collision between the principle of the Carbice case and the conventional rules governing either direct or contributory infringement, the former prevails. . i| The result of this decision, together with those which have preceded it, is to limit substantially the doctrine of contributory infringement. What residuum may be left we need not stop to consider. It is sufficient to say that in whatever posture the issue may be tendered courts of equity will withhold relief where the patentee and those claiming under him are using the patent privilege contrary to the public interest. Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 492. There remain the questions of res judicata and Mer-eoid’s right to relief under the counterclaim. Respondents point out that Mercoid knew of Mid-Continent’s actions and the license agreement prior to 1935 when the earlier suit involving the validity of the Cross patent (Smith v. Mid-Continent Investment Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>) was instituted. They state, and the District Court found, that although Mercoid was not made a party to the earlier suit it provided the defense. The contention therefore is that the doctrine of res judicata binds Mercoid as respects issues which were actually litigated and all issues which might have been raised in that earlier suit. And it is pointed out that among the defenses which might have been interposed were those relating to the misuse of the patent and the violations of the anti-trust laws. It is argued, moreover, that although Minneapolis-Honeywell was not a party to the earlier litigation, it is entitled to the benefit of the judgment since its title or claim derives from the patentee. We do not stop to examine the premises on which the argument is based; for though we assume that they are correct, it does not follow that the *670 doctrine of res judicata forecloses the defense which is tendered. Respondents ask the equity court for an injunction against infringement by petitioner of the patent in question and for an accounting.

And the determination of that policy is not “at the mercy” of the parties (id., p. 498) nor dependent on the usual rules governing the settlement of private litigation. “Courts of equity may, and frequently do, go much farther both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are accustomed to go when only privaté interests are involved.” Virginian Ry. Co. v. System Federation, 300 U. S. 515, 552. “Where an important public interest would be prejudiced,” the reasons for denying injunctive relief “may be compelling.” Harrisonville v. Dickey Clay Co., 289 U. S. 334, 338. And see United States v. Morgan, 307 U. S. 183, 194. That is the principle which has led this Court in the past to withhold aid from a patentee in suits for either direct or indirect infringement where the patent was being misused. Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 492. That principle is controlling here. The parties cannot foreclose the courts from the exercise of that discretion by the failure to interpose the same defense in an earlier litigation. Cf. Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., 317 U. S. 173. What we have just said does not, of course, dispose of Mercoid’s counterclaim for damages. That was based *671 on § 4 of the Clayton Act which provides: “Any person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the anti-trust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States in the district in which the defendant resides or is found or has an agent, without respect to the amount in controversy, and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee.” 38 Stat.
