 These “Aguilar costs” thus reduce the amount of Title I money an LEA has available for remedial education, and LEA’s have had to cut back on the number of students who receive Title I benefits.  From Title I funds available for New York City children between the 1986-1987 and the 1993-1994 school years, the Board had to deduct $7.9 million “off-the-top” for compliance with Aguilar .  App. 333.  When Aguilar was handed down, it was estimated that some 20,000 economically disadvantaged children in the city of New York, see 473 U. S., at 431 *214 (O’Connor, J., dissenting), and some 183,000 children nationwide, see L. Levy, The Establishment Clause 176 (1986), would experience a decline in Title I services.  See also S. Rep. No. 100-222, p. 14 (1987) (estimating that Aguilar costs have “resulted in a decline of about 35 percent in the number of private school children who are served”).  In October and December of 1995, petitioners — the Board and a new group of parents of parochial school students entitled to Title I services — filed motions in the District Court seeking relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) from the permanent injunction entered by the District Court on remand from our decision in Aguilar .  Petitioners argued that relief was proper under Rule 60(b)(5) and our decision in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, 502 U. S. 367, 388 (1992), because the “decisional law [had] changed to make legal what the [injunction] was designed to prevent.” Specifically, petitioners pointed to the statements of five Justices in Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, <citedDecision>512 U. S. 687</citedDecision> (1994), calling for the overruling of Aguilar .  The District Court denied the motion.  The District Court recognized that petitioners, “at bottom,” sought “a procedurally sound vehicle to get the [propriety of the injunction] back before the Supreme Court,” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 96-553, p. A12, and concluded that “the Board ha[d] properly proceeded under Rule 60(b) to seek relief from the injunction.” Id., at A19.  Despite its observations that “the landscape of Establishment* Clause decisions has changed,” id., at A10, and that “[t]here may be good reason to conclude that Aguilar's demise is imminent,” id., at A20, the District Court denied the Rule 60(b) motion on the merits because Aguilar’s demise had “not yet occurred.” The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit “affirmed substantially for the reasons stated in” the District Court’s opinion.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 96-553, p. A5; judgt.  order reported at 101 F. 3d 1394 (1996).  We granted certiorari, 519 U. S. 1086 (1997), and now reverse.

 .  modification should not be granted where a party relies upon events that actually were anticipated at the time [the order was entered]”).  We also agree with respondents that the statements made by five Justices in Kiryas Joel do not, in themselves, furnish a basis for concluding that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has changed.  In Kiryas Joel, we considered the constitutionality of a New York law that carved out a public school district to coincide with the boundaries of the village of Kiryas Joel, which was an enclave of the Satmar Hasidic sect. Before the new district was created, Satmar children wishing to receive special educational services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 U. S. C. § 1400 et seq., could receive those services at public schools located outside the village.  Because Satmar parents rarely permitted their children to attend those schools, New York created a new public school district within the boundaries of the village so that Satmar children could stay within the village but receive IDEA services on public school premises from publicly employed instructors.  In the course of our opinion, we observed that New York had created the special school district in response to our decision in Aguilar , which had required New York to cease providing IDEA services to Satmar children on the premises of their private religious schools.  <citedDecision>512 U. S., at 692</citedDecision> .  Five Justices joined opinions calling for reconsideration of Aguilar .  See <citedDecision>512 U. S., at 718</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <citedDecision>id., at 731</citedDecision> (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); <citedDecision>id., at 750</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Thomas, J., dissenting).  But the question of Aguilar’s propriety was not before us.  The views of five Justices that the case should be reconsidered or overruled cannot be said to have effected a change in Establishment Clause law. In light of these conclusions, petitioners’ ability to satisfy the prerequisites of Rule 60(b)(5) hinges on whether our later Establishment Clause cases have so undermined *218 Aguilar that it is no longer good law. We now turn to that inquiry.  Ill A In order to evaluate whether Aguilar has been eroded by our subsequent Establishment Clause cases, it is necessary to understand the rationale upon which Aguilar , as well as its companion case, School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985), rested.  In Ball , the Court evaluated two programs implemented by the School District of Grand Rapids, Michigan.  The district’s Shared Time program, the one most analogous to Title I, provided remedial and “enrichment” classes, at public expense, to students attending nonpublic schools.  The classes were taught during regular school hours by publicly employed teachers, using materials purchased with public funds, on the premises of nonpublic schools.
