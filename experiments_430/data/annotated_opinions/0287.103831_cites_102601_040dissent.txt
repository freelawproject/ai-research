 Is there anything in the decisions of this Court which indicates that church or press is free from the financial *128 burdens of government?  We find nothing.  Religious societies depend for their exemptions from taxation upon state constitutions or general statutes, not upon the Federal Constitution.  Gibbons v. District of Columbia, 116 U. S. 404 .  This Court has held that the chief purpose of the free press guarantee was to prevent previous restraints upon publication.  Near v. Minnesota, 283 U. S. 697, 713 .  14 In Grosjean v. American Press Co., <citedDecision>297 U. S. 233, 250</citedDecision> , it was said that the predominant purpose was to preserve “an untrammeled press as a vital source of public information.” In that case, a gross receipts tax on advertisements in papers with a circulation of more than twenty thousand copies per week was held invalid because “a deliberate and calculated device in the guise of a tax to limit the circulation.  .  .  .” There was this further comment: “It is not intended by anything we have said to suggest that the owners of newspapers are immune from any of the ordinary forms of taxation for support of the government.  But this is not an ordinary form of tax, but one single in kind, with a long history of hostile misuse against the freedom of the press.” <citedDecision>Id., 250</citedDecision> .  It may be said, however, that ours is a too narrow, technical and legalistic approach to the problem of state taxation of the activities of church and press; that we should look not to the expressed or historical meaning of the First Amendment but to the broad principles of free speech and free exercise of religion which pervade our national way of life. It may be that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees these principles rather than the more definite concept expressed in the First Amendment.  This would mean that as a Court, we should determine what sort of liberty it is that the due process clause of *129 the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees against state restrictions on speech and church.  But whether we give content to the literal words of the First Amendment or to principles of the.  liberty of the press and the church, we conclude that cities or states may levy reasonable, non-discriminatory taxes on such activities as occurred in these cases. Whatever exemptions exist from taxation arise from the prevailing law of the various states.  The constitutions of Alabama and Pennsylvania, with substantial similarity to the exemption provisions of other constitutions, forbid the taxation of lots and buildings used exclusively for religious worship.  Alabama (1901), § 91; Pennsylvania (1874), Art. IX, § 1.

 “The Freedom of Speech, and of the Press, and the right of the People peaceably to assemble, and consult for their common good, and to apply to the Government for a redress of grievances, shall not be infringed.” Records of the United States Senate, 1A-C2 (U. S. Nat. Archives).  Apparently when the proposed amendments were passed by the Senate on September 9,1789, what is now the first amendment read as follows: “Congress shall make no law establishing articles of faith, or a mode of worship, or prohibiting the free exercise of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition to the government for a redress of grievances.” Id.
