**Lead Opinion**
 The single rationally conceivable issue in dispute before the jury was whether the petitioner had been one of the robbers.  And the jury by its verdict found that he had not.  The federal rule of law, therefore, would make a second prosecution for the robbery of Roberts wholly impermissible.  The ultimate question to be determined, then, in the light of Benton v. Maryland, supra, is whether this established rule of federal law is embodied in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy.  We do not hesitate to hold that it is.  10 For whatever else that *446 constitutional guarantee may embrace, North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 , it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to “run the gantlet” a second time.  Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 190</citedDecision> .  The question is not whether Missouri could validly charge the petitioner with six separate offenses for the robbery of the six poker players.  It is not whether he could have received a total of six punishments if he had been convicted in a single trial of robbing the six victims.  It is simply whether, after a jury determined by its verdict that the petitioner was not one of the robbers, the State could constitutionally hale him before a new jury to litigate that issue again.  After the first jury had acquitted the petitioner of robbing Knight, Missouri could certainly not have brought him to trial again upon that charge.  Once a jury had determined upon conflicting testimony that there was at least a reasonable doubt that the petitioner was one of the robbers, the State could not present the same or different identification evidence in a second prosecution for the robbery of Knight in the hope that a different jury might find that evidence more convincing.  The situation is constitutionally no different here, even though the second trial related to another victim of the same robbery.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 For it has long been recognized as the very essence of our federalism that the States should have the widest latitude in the administration of their own systems of criminal justice.” 356 U. S., at 468 .  But in the present case Missouri did not have “the widest latitude” because Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969), decided after Hoag , held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee that no person shall “be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb” is enforceable against the States, and North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), accorded fully retroactive effect to that holding.  This means, under our decisions, that federal standards as to what constitutes the “same offence” apply alike to federal and state proceedings; it would be incongruous to have different standards determine the validity of a claim of double jeopardy depending on whether the claim was asserted in a state or federal court. Cf. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 11 (1964).  The Double Jeopardy Clause is a guarantee “that the State with all its resources and power [shall] not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity .  .  .  .” Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 187</citedDecision> (1957).  This guarantee is expressed as a prohibition against multiple prosecutions for the “same offence.” Although the phrase “same offence” appeared in most of the early common-law articulations of the double-jeop *451 ardy principle, 1 questions of its precise meaning rarely arose prior to the 18th century, and by the time the Bill of Rights was adopted it had not been authoritatively defined.  2 When the common law did finally attempt a definition, in The King v. Vandercomb, 2 Leach 708, 720, 168 Eng. Rep. 455, 461 (Crown 1796), it adopted the “same evidence” test, which provided little protection from multiple prosecution: “[U]nless the first indictment were such as the prisoner might have been convicted upon by proof of the facts contained in the second indictment, an acquittal on the first indictment can be no bar to the second.” The “same evidence” test of “same offence” was soon followed by a majority of American jurisdictions, but its deficiencies are obvious.  It does not enforce but virtually annuls the constitutional guarantee.  For example, where a single criminal episode involves several victims, under the “same evidence” test a separate prosecution may be brought as to each.  E. g., State v. Hoag, 21 N. J. 496, 122 A. 2d 628 (1956), aff’d, 356 U. S. 464 (1958).  The “same evidence” test permits multiple prosecutions where a single transaction is divisible into chronologically discrete crimes.

**Dissenting Opinion**
 Here the complainant in the second trial is not the same as in the first even though the State is a party in both cases. Very properly, in criminal cases, finality and conservation of private, public, and judicial resources are lesser values than in civil litigation.  Also, courts that have applied the collateral-estoppel concept to criminal actions would *465 certainly not apply it to both parties, as is true in civil cases, i.  e., here, if Ashe had been convicted at the first trial, presumably no court would then hold that he was thereby foreclosed from litigating the identification issue at the second trial. 2 Perhaps, then, it comes as no surprise to find that the only expressed rationale for the majority’s decision is that Ashe has “run the gantlet” once before.  This is not a doctrine of the law or legal reasoning but a colorful and graphic phrase, which, as used originally in an opinion of the Court written by Me. Justice Black, was intended to mean something entirely different.  The full phrase is “run the gantlet once on that charge .  .  .” (emphasis added); it is to be found in Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 190</citedDecision> (1957), where no question of multiple crimes against multiple victims was involved.  Green, having been found guilty of second-degree murder on a charge of first degree, secured a new trial. This Court held nothing more than that Green, once put in jeopardy — once having “run the gantlet .  .  .  on that charge” — of first degree murder, could not be compelled to defend against that charge again on retrial.  Today’s step in this area of constitutional law ought not be taken on no more basis than casual reliance on the “gantlet” phrase lifted out of the context in which it was originally used.  This is decision by slogan.
