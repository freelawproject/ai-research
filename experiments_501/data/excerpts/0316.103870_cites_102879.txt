**Dissenting Opinion**
 Tact, respect, and generosity toward variant views will always commend themselves to those charged with the duties of legislation so as to achieve a maximum of good will and to require a minimum of unwilling submission to a general law. But the real question is, who is to make such accommodations, the courts or the legislature?  This is no dry, technical matter.  It cuts deep into one’s conception of the democratic process — it concerns no less the practical differences between the means for making these accommodations that are open to courts and to legislatures.  A court can only strike down.  It can only say “This or that law is void.” It cannot modify or qualify, it cannot make exceptions to a general require *652 ment.  And it strikes down not merely for a day. At least the finding of unconstitutionality ought not to have ephemeral significance unless the Constitution is to be reduced to the fugitive importance of mere legislation.  When we are dealing with the Constitution of the United States, and more particularly with the great safeguards of the Bill of Rights, we are dealing with principles of liberty and justice “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked ás fundamental” — something without which “a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible.” Palko v. Connecticut, <citedDecision>302 U. S. 319, 325</citedDecision> ; Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 530, 531 .  If the function of this Court is to be essentially no different from that of a legislature, if the considerations governing constitutional construction are to be substantially those that underlie legislation, then indeed judges should not have life tenure and they should be made directly responsible to the electorate.  There have been many but unsuccessful proposals in the last sixty years to amend the Constitution to that end.  See Sen. Doc. No. 91, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 248-51.  Conscientious scruples, all would admit, cannot stand against every legislative compulsion to do positive acts in conflict with such scruples.  We have been told that such compulsions override religious scruples only as to major concerns of the state.  But the determination of what is major and what is minor itself raises questions of policy.
