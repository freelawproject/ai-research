  ""rationale"": ""The passage explicitly undermines the Target Case, Liggett Co. v. Baldridge, 278 U.S. 105, by stating that it 'belongs to that vintage of decisions which exalted substantive due process by striking down state legislation which a majority of the Court deemed unwise.' The passage also notes that the Court has 'steadily rejected the due process philosophy enunciated in the Adair-Coppage line of cases,' which includes Liggett. Furthermore, the passage quotes a later case, Daniel v. Family Security Life Ins. Co., 336 U.S. 220, which comments on Liggett disparagingly and notes a 'pronounced shift of emphasis' that has deprived the words 'unreasonable' and 'arbitrary' of the meaning ascribed to them in Liggett. This implicit criticism and undermining of Liggett's holding constitutes Implicit Negative Actions, indicating that the Target Case has been overruled.""
