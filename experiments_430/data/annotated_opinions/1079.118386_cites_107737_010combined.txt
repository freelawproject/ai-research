 In 1994, after having resolved the numerous other issues in the case, he issued an order permanently excluding pervasively sectarian schools in Jefferson Parish from receiving any Chapter 2 materials or equipment.  Two years later, Chief Judge Heebe having retired, Judge Livaudais received the case. Ruling in early 1997 on postjudgment motions, he reversed the decision of former Chief Judge Heebe and upheld Chapter 2, pointing to several significant changes in the legal landscape over the previous seven years.  Helms v. Cody, 1997 WL 35283 (Jan. 28), App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a.  In particular, Judge Livaudais cited our 1993 decision in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 , in which we held that a State could, as part *805 of a federal program for the disabled, provide a signlanguage interpreter to a deaf student at a Catholic high school.  Judge Livaudais also relied heavily on a 1995 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Walker v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 46 F. 3d 1449 , upholding Chapter 2 on facts that he found "virtually indistinguishable." The Ninth Circuit acknowledged in Walker , as Judge Heebe had in his 1990 summary judgment ruling, that Meek and Wolman appeared to erect a constitutional distinction between providing textbooks (permissible) and providing any other in-kind aid (impermissible).  46 F. 3d, at 1464 1465; see Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 236</citedDecision> (1968) (upholding textbook program).  The Court of Appeals viewed this distinction, however, as "thin" and "unmoored from any Establishment Clause principles," and, more importantly, as "rendered untenable" by subsequent cases, particularly Zobrest .  46 F. 3d, at 1465-1466.  These cases, in the Ninth Circuit's view, revived the principle of <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> and of Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , [3] that "state benefits provided to all citizens without regard to religion are constitutional." 46 F. 3d, at 1465.  The Ninth Circuit also relied, id., at 1467, on our observation in Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687 (1994), that "we have frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of any benefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges," id., at 704 .  The Ninth Circuit purported to distinguish Meek and Wolman based on the percentage of schools receiving aid that were parochial (a large percentage in those cases and a moderate percentage in Walker ), 46 F. 3d, at 1468, but that court undermined this distinction when it observed that Meek also upheld "the massive provision of textbooks *806 to parochial schools." 46 F. 3d, at 1468, n. 16.  Thus, although the Ninth Circuit did not explicitly hold that Meek and Wolman were no longer good law, its reasoning seemed to require that conclusion.  Finally, in addition to relying on our decision in Zobrest and the Ninth Circuit's decision in Walker , Judge Livaudais invoked Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995), in which, a few months after Walker , we held that the Establishment Clause does not require a public university to exclude a student-run religious publication from assistance available to numerous other student-run publications.

 See Agostini, supra, at 226 (presence of signlanguage interpreter in Catholic school "`cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking'" (quoting Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 ) (emphasis added in Agostini )); 521 U. S., at 230 (question is whether "any use of [governmental] aid to indoctrinate religion could be attributed to the State"); see also Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 841-842 ; Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 488-489 (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397 (1983); cf. Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 337 (1987) ("For a law to have forbidden `effects' under Lemon , it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through its own activities and influence").  We have also indicated that the answer to the question of indoctrination will resolve the question whether a program of educational aid "subsidizes" religion, as our religion cases use that term. See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 230-231 ; see also id., at 230 .  In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, we have consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion.  If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government.  For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question.  If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any particular *810 indoctrination.  To put the point differently, if the government, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without regard to religion, to all who adequately further that purpose, see Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 245-247</citedDecision> (discussing dual secular and religious purposes of religious schools), then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose.  The government, in crafting such an aid program, has had to conclude that a given level of aid is necessary to further that purpose among secular recipients and has provided no more than that same level to religious recipients.  As a way of assuring neutrality, we have repeatedly considered whether any governmental aid that goes to a religious institution does so "only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of individuals." Agostini, supra, at 226 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We have viewed as significant whether the "private choices of individual parents," as opposed to the "unmediated" will of government, Ball, 473 U. S., at 395, n. 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), determine what schools ultimately benefit from the governmental aid, and how much.  For if numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.  Private choice also helps guarantee neutrality by mitigating the preference for pre-existing recipients that is arguably inherent in any governmental aid program, see, e. g., Gilder, The Revitalization of Everything: The Law of the Microcosm, Harv. Bus. Rev. 49 (Mar./Apr.
**Combined Opinion**
 For to say that a program does not create an incentive to choose religious schools is to say that the private choice is truly "independent," Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 .  See Agostini, supra, at 232 (holding that Title I did not create any impermissible incentive, because its services were "available to all children who meet the Act's eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school"); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (discussing, in successive sentences, neutrality, private choice, and financial incentives, respectively); Witters, supra, at 488 (similar).  When such an incentive does exist, there is a greater risk that one could attribute to the government any indoctrination by the religious schools.  See Zobrest, supra, at 10 .  We hasten to add, what should be obvious from the rule itself, that simply because an aid program offers private schools, and thus religious schools, a benefit that they did not previously receive does not mean that the program, by reducing the cost of securing a religious education, creates, under Agostini `s second criterion, an "incentive" for parents to choose such an education for their children.  For any aid will have some such effect.  See Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244</citedDecision> ; Everson, 330 U. S., at 17 ; see also Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 .  B Respondents inexplicably make no effort to address Chapter 2 under the Agostini test.  Instead, dismissing Agostini as factually distinguishable, they offer two rules that they contend should govern our determination of whether Chapter 2 has the effect of advancing religion.  They argue first, and chiefly, that "direct, nonincidental" aid to the primary educational mission of religious schools is always impermissible.  Second, they argue that provision to religious schools of aid that is divertible to religious use is similarly impermissible.  [7] *815 Respondents' arguments are inconsistent with our more recent case law, in particular Agostini and Zobrest , and we therefore reject them.  1 Although some of our earlier cases, particularly Ball, 473 U. S., at 393-394 , did emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect aid, the purpose of this distinction was *816 merely to prevent "subsidization" of religion, see id., at 394 .
**Combined Opinion**
 Id., at 226-229 .  To the extent that respondents intend their direct/indirect distinction to require that any aid be literally placed in the hands of schoolchildren rather than given directly to the school for teaching those same children, the very cases on which respondents most rely, Meek and Wolman , demonstrate the irrelevance of such formalism.  In Meek , we justified our rejection of a program that loaned instructional materials and equipment by, among other things, pointing out that the aid was loaned to the schools, and thus was "direct *818 aid." 421 U. S., at 362-363 .  The materials-and-equipment program in Wolman was essentially identical, except that the State, in an effort to comply with Meek , see Wolman, 433 U. S., at 233, 250 , loaned the aid to the students.  (The revised program operated much like the one we upheld in Allen.  Compare Wolman, supra, at 248 , with Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 243-245</citedDecision> .) Yet we dismissed as "technical" the difference between the two programs: "[I]t would exalt form over substance if this distinction were found to justify a result different from that in Meek .  " 433 U. S., at 250 .  Wolman thus, although purporting to reaffirm Meek , actually undermined that decision, as is evident from the similarity between the reasoning of Wolman and that of the Meek dissent.  Compare Wolman, supra, at 250 (The "technical change in legal bailee" was irrelevant), with Meek, supra, at 391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) ("Nor can the fact that the school is the bailee be regarded as constitutionally determinative").  That Meek and Wolman reached the same result, on programs that were indistinguishable but for the direct/indirect distinction, shows that that distinction played no part in Meek .  Further, respondents' formalistic line breaks down in the application to real-world programs.  In Allen, for example, although we did recognize that students themselves received and owned the textbooks, we also noted that the books provided were those that the private schools required for courses, that the schools could collect students' requests for books and submit them to the board of education, that the schools could store the textbooks, and that the textbooks were essential to the schools' teaching of secular subjects.  See <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 243-245</citedDecision> .  Whether one chooses to label this program "direct" or "indirect" is a rather arbitrary choice, one that does not further the constitutional analysis.  Of course, we have seen "special Establishment Clause dangers," Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 , when money is *819 given to religious schools or entities directly rather than, as in Witters and Mueller , indirectly.  See 515 U. S., at 842 (collecting cases); id., at 846-847 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608-609 (1988); compare Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), with Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472 (1973).  [8] But *820 direct payments of money are not at issue in this case, and we refuse to allow a "special" case to create a rule for all cases. 2 Respondents also contend that the Establishment Clause requires that aid to religious schools not be impermissibly religious in nature or be divertible to religious use.  We agree with the first part of this argument but not the second.  Respondents' "no divertibility" rule is inconsistent with our more recent case law and is unworkable.
**Combined Opinion**
 [9] In Agostini , we explained Zobrest by making just this distinction between the content of aid and the use of that aid: "Because the only government aid in Zobrest was the interpreter, who was herself not inculcating any religious messages, no government indoctrination took place." 521 U. S., at 224 (second emphasis added).  Agostini also acknowledged that what the dissenters in Zobrest had charged was essentially true: Zobrest did effect a "shift .  .  .  in our Establishment Clause law." 521 U. S., at 225 .  The interpreter herself, assuming that she *823 fulfilled her assigned duties, see id., at 224-225 , had "no inherent religious significance," Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244</citedDecision> (discussing bus rides in Everson ), and so it did not matter (given the neutrality and private choice involved in the program) that she "would be a mouthpiece for religious instruction," Agostini, supra, at 226 (discussing Zobrest ).  And just as a government interpreter does not herself inculcate a religious messageeven when she is conveying oneso also a government computer or overhead projector does not itself inculcate a religious message, even when it is conveying one.  In Agostini itself, we approved the provision of public employees to teach secular remedial classes in private schools partly because we concluded that there was no reason to suspect that indoctrinating content would be part of such governmental aid.  See 521 U. S., at 223-225, 226-227, 234-235 .  Relying on Zobrest , we refused to presume that the public teachers would "`inject religious content' " into their classes, 521 U. S., at 225 , especially given certain safeguards that existed; we also saw no evidence that they had done so, id., at 226-227 .  In Allen we similarly focused on content, emphasizing that the textbooks were preapproved by public school authorities and were not "unsuitable for use in the public schools because of religious content." <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 245</citedDecision> .  See Lemon, 403 U. S., at 617 ("We note that the dissenters in Allen seemed chiefly concerned with the pragmatic difficulties involved in ensuring the truly secular content of the textbooks" (emphasis added)).  Although it might appear that a book, because it has a pre-existing content, is not divertible, and thus that lack of divertibility motivated our holding in Allen, it is hard to imagine any book that could not, in even moderately skilled hands, serve to illustrate a religious message.  [10] Post, at 855 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) *824 (agreeing with this point).  Indeed, the plaintiffs in Walker essentially conceded as much.  46 F. 3d, at 1469, n. 17.  A teacher could, for example, easily use Shakespeare's King Lear, even though set in pagan times, to illustrate the Fourth Commandment.
**Combined Opinion**
 Although we left it open on remand for the District Court to reaffirm its prior finding, we took pains to emphasize the narrowness of the "pervasively sectarian" category, see id., at 620-621 (opinion of the Court), and two *827 Members of the majority questioned whether this category was "well-founded," id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring).  Then, in Zobrest and Agostini , we upheld aid programs to children who attended schools that were not only pervasively sectarian but also were primary and secondary.  Zobrest , in turning away a challenge based on the pervasively sectarian nature of Salpointe Catholic High School, emphasized the presence of private choice and the absence of government-provided sectarian content.  509 U. S., at 13 .  Agostini , in explaining why the aid program was constitutional, did not bother to mention that pervasively sectarian schools were at issue, [13] see 521 U. S., at 226 235, a fact that was not lost on the dissent, see id., at 249 (opinion of Souter, J.).  In disregarding the nature of the school, Zobrest and Agostini were merely returning to the approach of Everson and Allen, in which the Court upheld aid programs to students at pervasively sectarian schools.  See post, at 875, 885-886 (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting this fact regarding Everson ); Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 251-252</citedDecision> (Black, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>id., at 262-264, 269-270</citedDecision> , n. (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Second, the religious nature of a recipient should not matter to the constitutional analysis, so long as the recipient adequately furthers the government's secular purpose.  See supra, at 810.  If a program offers permissible aid to the religious (including the pervasively sectarian), the areligious, and the irreligious, it is a mystery which view of religion the government has established, and thus a mystery what the constitutional violation would be.  The pervasively sectarian recipient has not received any special favor, and it is most bizarre that the Court would, as the dissent seemingly does, reserve special hostility for those who take their religion seriously, who think that their religion should affect the whole *828 of their lives, or who make the mistake of being effective in transmitting their views to children.  Third, the inquiry into the recipient's religious views required by a focus on whether a school is pervasively sectarian is not only unnecessary but also offensive.  It is well established, in numerous other contexts, that courts should refrain from trolling through a person's or institution's religious beliefs.
**Combined Opinion**
 The aid follows the child. *831 Because Chapter 2 aid is provided pursuant to private choices, it is not problematic that one could fairly describe Chapter 2 as providing "direct" aid.  The materials and equipment provided under Chapter 2 are presumably used from time to time by entire classes rather than by individual students (although individual students are likely the chief consumers of library books and, perhaps, of computers and computer software), and students themselves do not need to apply for Chapter 2 aid in order for their schools to receive it, but, as we explained in Agostini , these traits are not constitutionally significant or meaningful.  See id., at 228-229 .  Nor, for reasons we have already explained, is it of constitutional significance that the schools themselves, rather than the students, are the bailees of the Chapter 2 aid.  The ultimate beneficiaries of Chapter 2 aid are the students who attend the schools that receive that aid, and this is so regardless of whether individual students lug computers to school each day or, as Jefferson Parish has more sensibly provided, the schools receive the computers.  Like the Ninth Circuit, and unlike the dissent, post, at 888, we "see little difference in loaning science kits to students who then bring the kits to school as opposed to loaning science kits to the school directly." Walker, supra, at 1468, n. 16; see Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244, n.6</citedDecision> .  Finally, Chapter 2 satisfies the first Agostini criterion because it does not provide to religious schools aid that has an impermissible content.  The statute explicitly bars anything of the sort, providing that all Chapter 2 aid for the benefit of children in private schools shall be "secular, neutral, and nonideological," § 7372(a)(1), and the record indicates that the Louisiana SEA and the Jefferson Parish LEA have faithfully enforced this requirement insofar as relevant to this case. The chief aid at issue is computers, computer software, and library books.  The computers presumably have no preexisting content, or at least none that would be impermissible for use in public schools.  Respondents do not contend *832 otherwise.  Respondents also offer no evidence that religious schools have received software from the government that has an impermissible content.  There is evidence that equipment has been, or at least easily could be, diverted for use in religious classes.
**Combined Opinion**
Post, at 883-884.  I also disagree with the plurality's conclusion that actual diversion of government aid to religious indoctrination is consistent with the Establishment Clause.  See ante, at 820 825.  Although "[o]ur cases have permitted some government funding of secular functions performed by sectarian organizations," our decisions "provide no precedent for the use of public funds to finance religious activities." Rosenberger, supra, at 847 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  At least two of the decisions at the heart of today's case demonstrate that we have long been concerned that secular government aid not be diverted to the advancement of religion.  In both Agostini , our most recent school aid case, and Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 236</citedDecision> (1968), we rested our approval of the relevant programs in part on the fact that the aid had not been used to advance the religious missions of the recipient schools.  See Agostini, supra, at 226-227 ("[N]o evidence has ever shown that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students"); Allen, supra, at 248 ("Nothing in this record supports the proposition that all textbooks, whether they deal with mathematics, physics, foreign languages, history, or literature, are used by the parochial schools to teach religion").  Of course, our focus on the lack of such evidence would have been entirely unnecessary if we had believed that the Establishment Clause permits the actual diversion of secular government aid to religious indoctrination.  Our decision in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589 (1988), also demonstrates that actual diversion is constitutionally impermissible.  After concluding *841 that the government-aid program in question was constitutional on its face, we remanded the case so that the District Court could determine, after further factual development, whether aid recipients had used the government aid to support their religious objectives.  See id., at 621-622 ; id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., concurring) ("[T]he only purpose of further inquiring whether any particular grantee institution is pervasively sectarian is as a preliminary step to demonstrating that the funds are in fact being used to further religion").  The remand would have been unnecessary if, as the plurality contends, actual diversion were irrelevant under the Establishment Clause.
**Combined Opinion**
 Because we held similar programs unconstitutional in Meek and Wolman , respondents contend that those decisions, and not Agostini , are controlling.  See, e. g., Brief for Respondents 11, 22-25.  Like respondents, Justice Souter also relies on Meek and Wolman in finding the character of the Chapter 2 aid constitutionally problematic.  See post, at 893, 903.  At the time they were decided, Meek and Wolman created an inexplicable rift within our Establishment Clause jurisprudence concerning government aid to schools.  Seven years before our decision in Meek , we held in Allen that a New York statute that authorized the lending of textbooks to students attending religious schools did not violate the *850 Establishment Clause.  <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 238</citedDecision> .  We explained that the statute "merely [made] available to all children the benefits of a general program to lend school books free of charge," that the State retained ownership of the textbooks, and that religious schools received no financial benefit from the program.  <citedDecision>Id., at 243-244</citedDecision> .  We specifically rejected the contrary argument that the statute violated the Establishment Clause because textbooks are critical to the teaching process, which in a religious school is employed to inculcate religion.  <citedDecision>Id., at 245-248</citedDecision> .  In Meek and Wolman , we adhered to Allen, holding that the textbook lending programs at issue in each case did not violate the Establishment Clause.  See Meek, 421 U. S., at 359-362 (plurality opinion); Wolman , 433 U. S., at 236 238 (plurality opinion).  At the same time, however, we held in both cases that the lending of instructional materials and equipment to religious schools was unconstitutional.  See Meek, supra, at 362-366 ; Wolman, supra, at 248-251 .  We reasoned that, because the religious schools receiving the materials and equipment were pervasively sectarian, any assistance in support of the schools' educational missions would inevitably have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  For example, in Meek we explained: "[I]t would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania's church-related elementary and secondary schools and to then characterize [the statute] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.
**Combined Opinion**
 In any event, Chapter 2 contains both a secular content restriction, 20 U. S. C. § 7372 (a)(1), and a prohibition on the use of aid for religious worship or instruction, § 8897, so Tilton provides no basis for upholding respondents' challenge.  Finally, our decision in Bowen proves only that actual diversion, as opposed to mere divertibility, is constitutionally impermissible.  See, e. g., 487 U. S., at 621 .  Had we believed that the divertibility of secular aid was sufficient to call the aid program into question, there would have been no need for the remand we ordered and no basis for the reversal.  IV Because divertibility fails to explain the distinction our cases have drawn between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment, there remains the question of which of the two irreconcilable strands of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence we should now follow.  Between the two, I would adhere to the rule that we have applied in the context of textbook lending programs: To establish a First Amendment violation, plaintiffs must prove that the aid in question actually is, or has been, used for religious purposes.  See Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362 ; Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 248</citedDecision> .  Just as we held in Agostini that our more recent cases had undermined the assumptions underlying Ball and Aguilar , I would now hold that Agostini and the cases on which it relied have undermined the assumptions underlying Meek and Wolman .  To be sure, Agostini only addressed the specific presumption that public-school employees teaching on the premises of religious schools would inevitably inculcate religion.  Nevertheless, I believe that our definitive rejection of that presumption also stood foror at least strongly *858 pointed tothe broader proposition that such presumptions of religious indoctrination are normally inappropriate when evaluating neutral school aid programs under the Establishment Clause.  In Agostini , we repeatedly emphasized that it would be inappropriate to presume inculcation of religion; rather, plaintiffs raising an Establishment Clause challenge must present evidence that the government aid in question has resulted in religious indoctrination.  See 521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-227 .  We specifically relied on our statement in Zobrest that a presumption of indoctrination, because it constitutes an absolute bar to the aid in question regardless of the religious school's ability to separate that aid from its religious mission, constitutes a "flat rule, smacking of antiquated notions of `taint,' [that] would indeed exalt form over substance."

 But paradigms are not perfect fits very often, and government spending resists easy classification as between universal general service or subsidy of favoritism.  The 5-to-4 division of the Everson Court turned on the inevitable question whether reimbursing all parents for the cost of transporting their children to school was close enough to police protection to tolerate its indirect benefit in some degree to religious schools, with the majority in Everson thinking the reimbursement statute fell on the lawful side of the line. Although the state scheme reimbursed parents for transporting children to sectarian schools, among others, it gave "no money to the schools.  It [did] not support them.  Its legislation [did] no more than provide a general program to help parents get their children, regardless of their religion, safely and expeditiously to and from accredited schools." Id., at 18 .  The dissenters countered with factual analyses showing the limitation of the law's benefits in fact to private school pupils who were Roman Catholics, id., at 20 (Jackson, J., dissenting), and indicating the inseparability of transporting pupils to school from support for the religious instruction that was the school's raison d'être, id., at 45-46 (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  Everson is usefully understood in the light of a successor case two decades later, Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 236</citedDecision> (1968), in which the challenged government practice was lending textbooks to pupils of schools both public and private, including religious ones (as to which there was no evidence that they had previously supplied books to their classes and some evidence that they had not, <citedDecision>id., at 244, n. 6</citedDecision> ).  By the time of Allen, the problem of classifying the state benefit, as between aid to religion and general public service consistent with government neutrality, *876 had led to the formulation of a "test" that required secular, primary intent and effect as necessary conditions of any permissible scheme.  Id., at 243.  Again the Court split, upholding the state law in issue, but with Everson' s majority author, Justice Black, now in dissent.  What is remarkable about Allen today, however, is not so much its division as its methodology, for the consistency in the way the Justices went about deciding the case transcended their different conclusions.  Neither side rested on any facile application of the "test" or any simplistic reliance on the generality or evenhandedness of the state law. Disagreement concentrated on the true intent inferrable behind the law, the feasibility of distinguishing in fact between religious and secular teaching in church schools, and the reality or sham of lending books to pupils instead of supplying books to schools.  The majority, to be sure, cited the provision for books to all schoolchildren, regardless of religion, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 243</citedDecision> , just as the Everson majority had spoken of the transportation reimbursement as going to all, 330 U. S., at 16 , in each case for the sake of analogy to the provision of police and fire services.  [5] But the stress was on the practical significance of the actual benefits received by the schools.  As Everson had rested on the understanding that no money and no support went to the school, id., at 18 , Allen emphasized that the savings to parents were devoid of any measurable effect in teaching religion, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 243-244</citedDecision> .  Justice Harlan, concurring, summed up the approach with his observations that the required government "[n]eutrality is .  .  .  a coat of many colors," and quoted Justice Goldberg's conclusion, that there was "`no simple and clear measure' .  .  .  by which this or any [religious school aid] case may readily be decided," <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 249 (quoting Schempp, 374 U. S., at 306 ).  *877 After Everson and Allen, the state of the law applying the Establishment Clause to public expenditures producing some benefit to religious schools was this: 1.  Government aid to religion is forbidden, and tax revenue may not be used to support a religious school or religious teaching.  2.  Government provision of such paradigms of universally general welfare benefits as police and fire protection does not count as aid to religion.  3.  Whether a law's benefit is sufficiently close to universally general welfare paradigms to be classified with them, as distinct from religious aid, is a function of the purpose and effect of the challenged law in all its particularity.

 I say "some sense," for we have used the term in at least three ways in our cases, and an understanding of the term's evolution will help to explain the concept as it is understood today, as well as the limits of its significance in Establishment Clause analysis.  "Neutrality" has been employed as a term to describe the requisite state of government equipoise between the forbidden encouragement and discouragement of religion; to characterize a benefit or aid as secular; and to indicate evenhandedness in distributing it.  As already mentioned, the Court first referred to neutrality in Everson , simply stating that government is required "to be a neutral" among religions and between religion and nonreligion.  330 U. S., at 18 .  Although "neutral" may have carried a hint of inaction when we indicated that the First Amendment "does not require the state to be [the] adversary" of religious believers, ibid., or to cut off general government services from religious organizations, Everson provided no explicit definition of the term or further indication of what the government was required to do or not do to be *879 "neutral" toward religion.  In practical terms, "neutral" in Everson was simply a term for government in its required median position between aiding and handicapping religion.  The second major case on aid to religious schools, Allen, used "neutrality" to describe an adequate state of balance between government as ally and as adversary to religion, see <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 242</citedDecision> (discussing line between "state neutrality to religion and state support of religion").  The term was not further defined, and a few subsequent school cases used "neutrality" simply to designate the required relationship to religion, without explaining how to attain it.  See, e. g., Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 677 (1971) (describing cases that "see[k] to define the boundaries of the neutral area between [the Religion Clauses] within which the legislature may legitimately act"); Roemer v. Board of Public Works of Md., 426 U. S. 736, 747 (1976) (plurality opinion of Blackmun, J.) ("Neutrality is what is required.  The State must confine itself to secular objectives, and neither advance nor impede religious activity.  Of course, that principle is more easily stated than applied"); see also Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 782 (1973) (describing "neutral posture" toward religion); Roemer, supra, at 745-746 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) ("The Court has enforced a scrupulous neutrality by the State, as among religions, and also as between religious and other activities"); cf. Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 254 (1977) (quoting Lemon and noting difficulty of religious teachers' remaining "`religiously neutral' ").  The Court began to employ "neutrality" in a sense different from equipoise, however, as it explicated the distinction between "religious" and "secular" benefits to religious schools, the latter being in some circumstances permissible.  See infra, at 884-899 (discussing considerations).  Even though both Everson and Allen had anticipated some such distinction, neither case had used the term "neutral" in this way.  In Everson , Justice Black indicated that providing *880 police, fire, and similar government services to religious institutions was permissible, in part because they were "so separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function." 330 U. S., at 18 .  Allen similarly focused on the fact that the textbooks lent out were "secular" and approved by secular authorities, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 245</citedDecision> , and assumed that the secular textbooks and the secular elements of education they supported were not so intertwined with religious instruction as "in fact [to be] instrumental in the teaching of religion," <citedDecision>id., at 248</citedDecision> .  Such was the Court's premise in Lemon for shifting the use of the word "neutral" from labeling the required position of the government to describing a benefit that was nonreligious.  We spoke of "[o]ur decisions from Everson to Allen [as] permitt[ing] the States to provide church-related schools with secular, neutral, or nonideological services, facilities, or materials," 403 U. S., at 616, and thereafter, we regularly used "neutral" in this second sense of "secular" or "nonreligious." See, e. g., Tilton, supra, at 687-688 (characterizing subsidized teachers in Lemon as "not necessarily religiously neutral," but buildings as "religiously neutral"); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 365-366 (1975) (describing instructional materials as "`secular, nonideological and neutral' " and "wholly neutral"); id., at 372 (describing auxiliary services as "religiously neutral"); Roemer, supra, at 751 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (describing Tilton `s approved buildings as "neutral or nonideological in nature"); 426 U. S., at 754 (describing Meek `s speech and hearing services as "neutral and nonideological"); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 10 (1993) (discussing translator as "neutral service"); Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 232 (1997) (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was "neutral and nonideological"); cf. Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 478 (1973) (noting that District Court approved testing cost reimbursement as payment for services that were "`secular, neutral, or nonideological' " in character, citing Lemon, 403 U. S., at *881 616); Wolman, supra, at 242 (quoting Lemon, supra, at 616 (describing permitted services aid as "secular, neutral, or nonideological")).  The shift from equipoise to secular was not, however, our last redefinition, for the Court again transformed the sense of "neutrality" in the 1980's.  Reexamining and reinterpreting Everson and Allen, we began to use the word "neutral" to mean "evenhanded," in the sense of allocating aid on some common basis to religious and secular recipients.  Again, neither Everson nor Allen explicitly used "neutral" in this manner, but just as the label for equipoise had lent itself to referring to the secular characteristic of what a government might provide, it was readily adaptable to referring to the generality of government services, as in Everson `s paradigms, to which permissible benefits were compared.
**Combined Opinion**
 In cases where we have permitted aid, we have regularly characterized it as "neutral" in the sense (noted supra, at 879 881) of being without religious content.  See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 688 (characterizing buildings as "religiously neutral"); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (describing translator as "neutral service"); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 232 (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was "neutral and nonideological").  See also ante, at 820 (plurality opinion) (barring aid with religious content).  [10] Second, we have long held government aid invalid when circumstances would allow its diversion to religious education.  The risk of diversion is obviously high when aid in the form of government funds makes its way into the coffers of religious organizations, and so from the start we have understood the Constitution to bar outright money grants of aid to religion.  [11] See Everson, 330 U. S., at 16 ("[The State] *891 cannot consistently with the `establishment of religion' clause of the First Amendment contribute tax-raised funds to the support of an institution which teaches the tenets and faith of any church"); id., at 18 ("The State contributes no money to the schools.  It does not support them"); Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 243-244</citedDecision> ("[N]o funds or books are furnished to parochial schools, and the financial benefit is to parents and children, not schools"); Walz, supra, at 675 ("Obviously a direct money subsidy would be a relationship pregnant with involvement and, as with most governmental grant programs, could encompass sustained and detailed administrative relationships for enforcement of statutory or administrative standards"); Lemon, supra, at 612 (identifying "three main evils" against which Establishment Clause was to protect as "sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity," citing Walz ); 403 U. S., at 621 (distinguishing direct financial aid program from Everson and Allen and noting problems with required future surveillance); Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 762, 774 (striking down "direct money grants" for maintaining buildings because there was no attempt to restrict payments to those expenditures related exclusively to secular purposes); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480, 482 (striking down "direct money grant" for testing expenses); [12] Hunt v. *892 McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 745, n. 7 (1973) (noting approved aid is "no expenditure of public funds, either by grant or loan"); Wolman, 433 U. S., at 239 , and n. 7 (noting that "statute does not authorize any payment to nonpublic school personnel for the costs of administering the tests"); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228-229 (emphasizing that approved services are not "distributed `directly to the religious schools.' .  .  .  No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a schoolwide basis" (citations omitted)); Bowen, 487 U. S., at 614-615 ; Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 (noting that "we have recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions"); cf. Lemon, 403 U. S., at 619-620 (noting that safeguards and accounting inspections required to prevent government funds from supporting religious education will cause impermissible entanglement); Roemer, 426 U. S., at 753-757 (approving segregated funds after finding recipients not pervasively religious); Ball, 473 U. S., at 392-393 (noting that "[w]ith but one exception, our subsequent cases have struck down attempts by States to make payments out of *893 public tax dollars directly to primary or secondary religious educational institutions"), overruled in part by Agostini, supra, at 236 ; Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 ("It is equally well-settled .  .  .  that the State may not grant aid to a religious school, whether cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct subsidy to the religious school" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); Rosenberger, supra, at 851-852 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting that student fee was not a tax).  Divertibility is not, of course, a characteristic of cash alone, and when examining provisions for ostensibly secular supplies we have considered their susceptibility to the service of religious ends.  [13] In upholding a scheme to provide students with secular textbooks, we emphasized that "each book loaned must be approved by the public school authorities; only secular books may receive approval." Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244-245</citedDecision> ; see also Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362 (opinion of Stewart, J.); Wolman, supra, at 237-238 .  By the same token, we could not sustain provisions for instructional materials adaptable to teaching a variety of subjects.  [14] Meek, supra, at 363; Wolman, supra, at 249-250 .  While the textbooks had a known and fixed secular content not readily divertible *894 to religious teaching purposes, the adaptable materials did not.  [15] So, too, we explained the permissibility of busing on public routes to schools but not busing for field trips designed by religious authorities specifically because the latter trips were components of teaching in a pervasively religious school.  Compare Everson, 330 U. S., at 17 (noting wholly separate and secular nature of public bus fare to schools), with Wolman, 433 U. S., at 254 ("The field trips are an integral part of the educational experience, and where the teacher works within and for a sectarian institution, an unacceptable risk of fostering of religion is an inevitable byproduct" (citation omitted)).  We likewise were able to uphold underwriting the expenses of standard state testing in religious schools while being forced to strike down aid for testing designed by the school officials, because the latter tests could be used to reinforce religious teaching.

 Divertibility was, again, the issue in an order remanding an as-applied challenge to a grant supporting counseling on teenage sexuality for findings that the aid had not been used to support religious education.  Bowen, 487 U. S., at 621 ; see also id., at 623 (O'Connor, J., concurring).  And the most recent example of attention to the significance of divertibility occurred in our explanation that public school teachers could be assigned to provide limited instruction in religious schools in Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-227 , a majority of the Court rejecting the factual assumption that public school teachers could be readily lured into providing religious instruction.  [16] *896 Third, our cases have recognized the distinction, adopted by statute in the Chapter 2 legislation, between aid that merely supplements and aid that supplants expenditures for offerings at religious schools, the latter being barred.  Although we have never adopted the position that any benefit that flows to a religious school is impermissible because it frees up resources for the school to engage in religious indoctrination, Hunt, supra, at 743 , from our first decision holding it permissible to provide textbooks for religious schools we have repeatedly explained the unconstitutionality of aid that supplants an item of the school's traditional expense.  See, e. g., Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370, 375 (1930) (noting that religious schools "are not the beneficiaries of these appropriations.  They obtain nothing from them, nor are they relieved of a single obligation because of them" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Everson, 330 U. S., at 18 (specifically noting that bus fare program did not support or fund religious schools); Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244</citedDecision> (stating that "the financial benefit [of providing the textbooks] is to parents and children, not to schools" (footnote omitted)); <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> *897 at 244, n. 6 (explicitly recognizing that "the record contains no evidence that any of the private schools in appellants' districts previously provided textbooks for their students"); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 656 (opinion of Brennan, J.) (noting no aid to schools was involved in Allen ).  We ignored this prohibition only once, in Regan, 444 U. S., at 646 ; see also ante, at 16, n. 7, where reimbursement for budgeted expenses of required testing was not struck down, but we then quickly returned to the rule as a guideline for permissible aid.  [17] In Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12 , the Court specifically distinguished Meek and Ball by explaining that the invalid programs in those cases "relieved sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students." In Agostini , the Court made a point of noting that the objects of the aid were "by law supplemental to the regular curricula" and, citing Zobrest , explained that the remedial education services did not relieve the religious schools of costs they would otherwise have borne.  521 U. S., at 228 (citing Zobrest, supra, at 12 ).  The Court explicitly stated that the *898 services in question did not "supplant the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already provided in New York City's sectarian schools." 521 U. S., at 229 .
**Combined Opinion**
 The First Amendment was violated.  But the record here goes beyond risk, to instances of actual diversion.  What one would expect from such paltry efforts at monitoring and enforcement naturally resulted, and the record strongly suggests that other, undocumented diversions probably occurred as well.  First, the record shows actual diversion in the library book program.  App. 132a133a.  Although only limited evidence exists, it contrasts starkly with the records of the numerous textbook programs that we have repeatedly upheld, where there was no evidence of any actual diversion.  See Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244-245</citedDecision> ; Meek, supra, at 361-362; Wolman, supra, at 237 238.  Here, discovery revealed that under Chapter 2, nonpublic schools requested and the government purchased at least 191 religious books with taxpayer funds by December 1985.  [27] App. 133a.  Books such as A Child's Book of Prayers, id., at 84a, and The Illustrated Life of Jesus, id., at 132a, *910 were discovered among others that had been ordered under the program.  See also id., at 59a62a.  The evidence persuasively suggests that other aid was actually diverted as well.  The principal of one religious school testified, for example, that computers lent with Chapter 2 funds were joined in a network with other non-Chapter 2 computers in some schools, and that religious officials and teachers were allowed to develop their own unregulated software for use on this network.

 We approved a similar arrangement in Quick Bear, 210 U. S., at 77-82 , and the Federal Government appears to have long had such a program, see 1999 Catalog of Caring: Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area 44, 45, 59, 74-75 (listing numerous religious organizations, many of which engage in religious education or in proselytizing, to which federal employees may contribute via payroll deductions); see generally Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788 (1985) (discussing Combined Federal Campaign).  Finally, at least some of our prior cases striking down direct payments involved serious concerns about whether the payments were truly neutral.  See, e. g., Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 762-764, 768, 774-780 (1973) (striking down, by 8-to-1 vote, program providing direct grants for maintenance and repair of school facilities, where payments were allocated per-pupil but were only available to private, nonprofit schools in low-income areas, "`all or practically all'" of which were Catholic).  Id., at 768 .  [9]  The dissent would find an establishment of religion if a governmentprovided projector were used in a religious school to show a privately purchased religious film, even though a public school that possessed the same kind of projector would likely be constitutionally barred from refusing to allow a student bible club to use that projector in a classroom to show the very same film, where the classrooms and projectors were generally available to student groups.  See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1993).  [10]  Although we did, elsewhere in Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 236</citedDecision> (1968), observe, in response to a party's argument, that there was no evidence that the schools were using secular textbooks to somehow further religious instruction, see <citedDecision>id., at 248</citedDecision> , we had no occasion to say what the consequence would be were such use occurring and, more importantly, we think that this brief concluding comment cannot be read, especially after Zobrest (not to mention Witters , Mueller , and Agostini ) as essential to the reasoning of Allen.  [11]  Justice O'Connor agrees that the Constitution does not bar divertible aid.  See post, at 857 (opinion concurring in judgment).  She also finds actual diversion unproblematic if "true private-choice" directs the aid.  See post, at 842.  And even when there is not such private choice, she thinks that some amount of actual diversion is tolerable and that safeguards for preventing and detecting actual diversion may be minimal, as we explain further, infra, at 832-834.  [12]  It is thus surprising for the dissent to accuse us of following a rule of "breathtaking .
**Combined Opinion**
 [3]  The Court upheld payments by Indian tribes to apparently Roman Catholic schools in Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U. S. 50 (1908), suggesting in dicta that there was no Establishment Clause problem, but it did not squarely face the question.  Nor did the Court address a First Amendment challenge to a state program providing textbooks to children in Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370 (1930); it simply concluded that the program had an adequate public purpose.  The Court first squarely faced the issue in Everson .  [4]  While Everson `s dissenters parted company with the majority over the specific question of school buses, the Court stood as one behind the principle of no aid for religious teaching.  330 U. S., at 15-16 ; id., at 25-26 (Jackson, J., dissenting); id., at 28-29, 31-32 (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  [5]  Indeed, two of the dissenters in Allen agreed with the majority on this method of analysis, asking whether the books at issue were similar enough to fire and police protection.  See <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 252</citedDecision> (Black, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>id., at 272</citedDecision> (Fortas, J., dissenting).  [6]  In fact, religious education in Roman Catholic schools is defined as part of required religious practice; aiding it is thus akin to aiding a church service.  See 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 798, reprinted in The Code of Canon Law: A Text and Commentary 566 (1985) (hereinafter Text & Commentary) (directing parents to entrust children to Roman Catholic schools or otherwise provide for Roman Catholic education); Canon 800, § 2, Text & Commentary 567 (requiring the faithful to support establishment and maintenance of Roman Catholic schools); Canons 802, 804, Text & Commentary 567, 568 (requiring diocesan bishop to establish and regulate schools "imparting an education imbued with the Christian spirit").  [7]  Although the Court no longer assumes that public school teachers assigned to religious schools for limited purposes will teach religiously, see Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 223-228 (1997), we have never abandoned the presumption that religious teachers will teach just that way.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 615-620 (1971); id., at 635-641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 480 (1973); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 369-371 (1975); Wol- man v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 249-250 (1977); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 399-400 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by Agostini, supra, at 236 .  Cf. NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 504 (1979) ("The church-teacher relationship in a church-operated school differs from the employment relationship in a public or other nonreligious school").  [8]  In Agostini , the Court indicated that "we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid," 521 U. S., at 225 , and cited Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993).
