 The second reason given is that there has been little or no reliance on our Bramblett decision; I believe that this ground is quite debatable, if not actually erroneous.  Today's decision harkens to the important reason behind the doctrine of stare decisis, but does not heed it.  That doctrine is "a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon `an arbitrary discretion.' " Patterson, supra, at 172 , citing The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton).  Respect for precedent is strongest "in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation." Illinois Brick Co., supra, at 736.  Justice Brandeis' dissenting opinion in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., <citedDecision>285 U. S. 393</citedDecision> (1932), made the point this way: " Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.  This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation." <citedDecision>Id.</citedDecision> , at 406 (citations omitted).  We have recognized a very limited exception to this principle for what had been called "intervening developments in the law." But the cases exemplifying this principle, e. g., Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320 (1972); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc. , 490 U. S. 477 (1989), have invariably made clear that the "intervening developments" were in the case law of this Court, not of the lower federal courts.  Indeed, in Illinois Brick Co. , we refused to follow a line of lower court decisions *720 which had carved out an exception from one of our precedents.  431 U. S., at 743-744 .  But today's decision departs radically from the previously limited reliance on this exception.  The principle of stare decisis is designed to promote stability and certainty in the law. While most often invoked to justify a court's refusal to reconsider its own decisions, itapplies a fortiori to enjoin lower courts to follow the decision of a higher court. This principle is so firmly established in our jurisprudence that no lower court would deliberately refuse to follow the decision of a higher court. But cases come in allshapes and varieties, and it is not always clear whether a precedent applies to a situation inwhich some of the facts are different from those in the decided case. Here lower courts must necessarily make judgments as to how far beyond its particular facts the higher court precedent extends.  If there is appeal as a matter of right from the lower court to the higher court, any decision by the lower court that is viewed as mistaken by the higher court will in the normal course of events be corrected in short order by reversal on appeal.

" Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d 234, 237 (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963).  [10]  Some 17 years before Masterpol , the Second Circuit restricted the application of§ 1001 in a slightly different manner.  In United States v. D'Amato, 507 F. 2d 26 (1974), the court overturned a § 1001 conviction arising out ofa falseaffidavit submitted inthe course of a private civil lawsuit.  Based upon a review of relevant case law and legislative history, the court concluded that § 1001 did not apply "where the Government is involved only by way of a court deciding a matter in which the Government or its agencies are not involved." Id., at 28.  Accord, United States v. London, 714 F. 2d 1558, 1561-1562 (CA11 1983).  [11]  See also, e. g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S., at 172-173 ( stare decisis has "special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done"); Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986) (noting "the strong presumption of continued validity that adheres in the judicial interpretation of a statute"); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 189 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring) (declining to overturn "a line of [statutory] authority which I firmly believe to have been incorrectly decided"); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., <citedDecision>285 U. S. 393, 406</citedDecision> (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (" Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.  This is commonly true, even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation") (citation omitted).  [12]  Because the fate of the judicial function exception is tied so closely to Bramblett , we find no merit in the Government's suggestion that a reconsideration of the validity of that decision is not fairly included in the question on which we granted certiorari.  See generally Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379-383 (1995).  [13]  The dissent criticizes us for according respect to a body of law developed in the lower courts, arguing that our decision will "induce" federal judges on the courts of appeals to "ignore" precedents from this Court and thereby invite chaos in the judicial system.  Post, at 721.  We would have thought it self-evident that the lower courts must adhere to our precedents.
