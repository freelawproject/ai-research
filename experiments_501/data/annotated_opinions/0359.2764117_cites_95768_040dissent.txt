 But such cer *358 tainly has not been the law since 1873.  Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457 .  Nor was it the law when this Court last considered the divorce problem, in 1945.  Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U. S. 226 .  A State that is asked to enforce the action of another State may appropriately ascertain whether that other State had power to do what it purported to do.  And if the enforcing State has an interest under our Constitution in regard to the subject-matter that is vital and intimate, it should not be within the power of private parties to foreclose that interest by their private arrangement.  Andrews v. Andrews, <citedDecision>188 U. S. 14</citedDecision> ; cf. Fall v. Eastin, 215 U. S. 1 ; Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Commission, 294 U. S. 532 .  .~-"íf the marriage contract were no different from a contract to sell an automobile, the parties thereto might well be permitted to bargain away all interests involved, in or out of court. But the State has an interest in the family relations of its citizens vastly different from the interest it has in an ordinary commercial transaction.  That interest cannot be bartered or bargained away by the immediate parties to the controversy by a default or an arranged contest in a proceeding for divorce in a State to which the parties are strangers.  Therefore, the constitutional power of a State to determine the marriage status of two of its citizens should not be deemed foreclosed by a proceeding between the parties in another State, even though in other types of controversy considerations making it desirable to put an end to litigation might foreclose the parties themselves from reopening the dispute.  1 I cannot agree that the Constitution forbids *359 a State from insisting that it is not bound by any such proceedings in a distant State wanting in the power that domicile alone gives, and that its courts need not honor such an intrinsically sham proceeding, no matter who brings the issue to their attention.  ___ That society has a vital interest in the domestic reía-tions of its members will be almost impatiently conceded.  2 But it is not enough to pay lip-service to the commonplace as an abstraction.

 pDecisibns of this Court that have not stood the test of time have been due not to want of foresight by the prescient Framers of the Constitution, but to misconceptions regarding its requirements.  I cannot bring myself to believe that the Full Faith and Credit Clause gave to the few States which offer bargain-counter divorces constitutional power to control the social policy governing domestic relations of the many States which do not.  [This is also a dissent to Coe v. Coe, post, p. 378.] Nor do I regard Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32 , as contrary authority.  That case did not depend for its result on the fact that there had been an adjudication of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the divorce enforced, inasmuch as this Court found that the State granting the divorce was in fact that of the domicile.  305 U. S. at 41.  Moreover this Court’s citation therein of <citedDecision>Andrews</citedDecision> v. Andrews, *359 supra, indicates an absence of intention to overrule the holding of that case that opportunity to litigate the issue of domicile does not foreclose inquiry as to the true facts.  <citedDecision>Andrews</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Andrews</citedDecision> has since been cited with respect, as recently as Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 309, 320, n. 7 , and 325 U. S. 226, 229, 240, 242 .  Compare the English laws providing for a King’s Proctor to represent the interests of the Crown in divorce proceedings.  Sections 5-7, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1860, 23 & 24 Vict., c. 144; § 1, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1873, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 31; § 181, The Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, 15 & 16 Geo. 5, c. 49, 9 Halsbury’s Statutes of England 393-94.  Rev. L. 1835, c. 76: § 39.  “When any inhabitant of this state shall go into any other state or country, in order to obtain a divorce for any cause, which had occurred here, and whilst the parties resided here, or for any cause, which would not authorize a divorce, by the laws of this state, a divorce so obtained shall be of no force or effect in this state.” § 40.  “In all other cases, a divorce decreed in any other state or country, according to the law of the place, by a court having jurisdiction of the cause and of both of the parties, shall be valid and effectual in this state.” See note 13, infra.  Del. Rev. Code, c. 86, § 29 (1935).
