 2 This right was designed “to guard against a *511 spirit of oppression and tyranny on the part of rulers,” and “was from very early times insisted on by our ancestors in the parent country, as the great bulwark of their civil and political- liberties.” Id., at 540-541.  See also Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 151-154 (1968) (tracing the history of trial by jury).  Ill Thus far, the resolution of the question before us seems simple.  The Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to demand that a jury find him guilty of all the elements of the crime with which he is charged; one of the elements in the present case is materiality; respondent therefore had a right to have the jury decide materiality.  To escape the force of this logic, the Government offers essentially three arguments.  Having conceded the minor premise — that materiality is an element of the offense — the Government argues first, that the major premise is flawed; second, that (essentially) a page of history is worth a volume of logic, and uniform practice simply excludes the element of materiality from the syllogism; and third, that stare decisis requires the judgment here to be reversed.  A As to the first, the Government’s position is that “materiality,” whether as a matter of logic or history, is a “legal” question, and that although we have sometimes spoken of “requiring the jury to decide ‘all the elements of a criminal offense,’ e. g., Estelle v. McGuire, [ 502 U. S. 62, 69 ] (1991); see Victor v. Nebraska, [ 511 U. S. 1, 5 ] (1994); Patterson v. New York, <citedDecision>432 U. S. 197, 210</citedDecision> (1977), the principle actually applies to only the factual components of the essential elements.” Brief for United States 33 (emphasis added).  The Government claims that this understanding of the jury’s role *512 dates back to Sparf v. United States, 156 U. S. 51 (1895), and is reaffirmed by recent decisions of this Court. By limiting the jury’s constitutionally prescribed role to “the factual components of the essential elements” the Government surely does not mean to concede that the jury must pass upon all elements that contain some factual component, for that test is amply met here.  Deciding whether a statement is “material” requires the determination of at least two subsidiary questions of purely historical fact: (a) “what statement was made?” and (b) “what decision was the agency trying to make?” The ultimate question: (c) “whether the statement was material to the decision,” requires applying the legal standard of materiality (quoted above) to these historical facts.  What the Government apparently argues is that the Constitution requires only that (a) and (b) be determined by the jury, and that (c) may be determined by the judge. We see two difficulties with this.  First, the application-of-legal-standard-to-fact sort of question posed by (c), commonly called a “mixed question of law and fact,” has typically been resolved by juries.  See J. Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at Common Law 194, 249-250 (1898).  Indeed, our cases have recognized in other contexts that the materiality inquiry, involving as it does “delicate assessments of the inferences a ‘reasonable [decisionmaker]’ would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him,... [is] peculiarly on[e] for the trier of fact.” TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U. S. 438, 450 (1976) (securities fraud); McLanahan v. Universal Ins. Co., 1 Pet. 170, 188-189, 191 (1828) (materiality of false statements in insurance applications).

 See United States v. Battiste, 24 F. Cas. 1042, 1043 (No. 14,545) (CC Mass. 1835) (Story, J., sitting as Circuit Justice) (the jury’s general verdict is “necessarily compounded of [both] law and fact”).  As Thayer wrote at the end of the 19th century: “From the beginning ... it was perceived that any general verdict, such as .  .  .  not guilty, involved a conclusion of law, and that the jury did, in a sense, in such cases answer a question of law.” Thayer, supra, at 253.  The more modern authorities the Government cites also do not support its concept of the criminal jury as mere fact-finder.  Although each contains language discussing the jury’s role as factfinder, see Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U. S. 275 (1993); Court of Ulster Cty. v. Allen, 442 U. S. 140, 156 (1979); Patterson v. New York, <citedDecision>432 U. S. 197, 206</citedDecision> (1977); In re Winship, 397 U. S. 358, 364 (1970), each also confirms that the jury’s constitutional responsibility is not merely to determine the facts, but to apply the law to those facts and draw the ultimate conclusion of guilt or innocence.  The point is put with unmistakable clarity in Allen , which involved the constitutionality of statutory inferences and presumptions.  Such devices, Allen said, can help *515 “the trier of fact to determine the existence of an element of the crime — that is, an ‘ultimate’ or ‘elemental’ fact — from the existence of one or more ‘evidentiary’ or ‘basic’ facts .... Nonetheless, in criminal cases, the ultimate test of any device’s constitutional validity in a given case remains constant: the device must not undermine the factfinder’s responsibility at trial, based on evidence adduced by the State, to find the ultimate facts beyond a reasonable doubt.” Allen, supra, at 156 .  See also Sullivan, supra, at 277 (“The right [to jury trial] includes, of course, as its most important element, the right to have the jury, rather than the judge, reach the requisite finding of ‘guilty’”); <citedDecision>Patterson, supra, at 204</citedDecision> ; Winship, supra, at 361, 363.  B The Government next argues that, even if the jury is generally entitled to pass on all elements of a crime, there is a historical exception for materiality determinations in perjury prosecutions.  We do not doubt that historical practice is relevant to what the Constitution means by such concepts as trial by jury, see Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 276-277 (1856); Holland v. Illinois, 493 U. S. 474, 481 (1990), and it is precisely historical practice that we have relied on in concluding that the jury must find all the elements.  The existence of a unique historical exception to this principle — and an exception that reduces the power of the jury precisely when it is most important, i.  e., in a prosecution not for harming another individual, but for offending against the Government itself— would be so extraordinary that the evidence for it would have to be convincing indeed.  It is not so. The practice of having courts determine the materiality of false statements in perjury prosecutions is neither as old, nor as uniform, as the Government suggests.  In England, no pre-Revolution cases appear to have addressed the question, *516 and the judges reached differing results when the issue finally arose in the mid-19th century.
