 The State further refined its case at the second trial by declining to call one of the participants in the poker game whose identification testimony at the first trial had been conspicuously negative.  The case went to the jury on instructions virtually identical to those given at the first trial. This time the jury found the petitioner guilty, and he was sentenced to a 35-year term in the state penitentiary.  The Supreme Court of Missouri affirmed the conviction, holding that the “plea of former jeopardy must be denied.” State v. Ashe, 350 S. W. 2d 768, 771 .  A collateral attack upon the conviction in the state courts five years later was also unsuccessful.  State v. Ashe, 403 S. W. 2d 589 .  The petitioner then brought the present habeas corpus proceeding in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, claiming that the second prosecution had violated his right not to be twice put in jeopardy.  Considering itself bound by this court’s decision in Hoag v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>356 U. S. 464</citedDecision> , the District Court denied the writ, although apparently finding merit in the petitioner’s claim.  4 The Court *441 of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, also upon the authority of <citedDecision>Hoag</citedDecision> v. New <citedDecision>Jersey, supra.</citedDecision> 5 We granted certiorari to consider the important constitutional question this case presents.  393 U. S. 1115 .  As the District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly noted, the operative facts here are virtually identical to those of <citedDecision>Hoag</citedDecision> v. New <citedDecision>Jersey, supra.</citedDecision> In that case the defendant was tried for the armed robbery of three men who, along with others, had been held up in a tavern.  The proof of the robbery was clear, but the evidence identifying the defendant as one of the robbers was weak, and the defendant interposed an alibi defense.  The jury brought in a verdict of not guilty.  The defendant was then brought to trial again, on an indictment charging the robbery of a fourth victim of the tavern holdup.  This time the jury found him guilty.  After appeals in the state courts proved unsuccessful, Hoag brought his case here.  Viewing the question presented solely in terms of Fourteenth Amendment due process — whether the course that New Jersey had pursued had “led to fundamental unfairness,” <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 467</citedDecision> — this Court declined to reverse the judgment of conviction, because “in the circumstances shown by this record, we cannot say that *442 petitioner’s later prosecution and conviction violated due process.” 6 <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 466</citedDecision> .  The Court found it unnecessary to decide whether “collateral estoppel” — the principle that bars relitigation between the same parties of issues actually determined at a previous trial — is a due process requirement in a state criminal trial, since it accepted New Jersey’s determination that the petitioner’s previous acquittal did not in any event give rise to such an estoppel.  <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 471</citedDecision> .  And in the view the Court took of the issues presented, it did not, of course, even approach consideration of whether collateral estop-pel is an ingredient of the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy.  The doctrine of Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 , puts the issues in the present case in a perspective quite different from that in which the issues were perceived in <citedDecision>Hoag</citedDecision> v. New <citedDecision>Jersey, supra.</citedDecision> The question is no longer whether collateral estoppel is a requirement of due process, but whether it is a part of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee against double jeopardy.  And if collateral estoppel is embodied in that guarantee, then its applicability in a particular case is no longer a matter to be left for state court determination within the broad *443 bounds of “fundamental fairness,” but a matter of constitutional fact we must decide through an examination of the entire record.  Cf. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 285 ; Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U. S. 268, 271 ; Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 51 ; Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227, 229 ; Norris v. Alabama, 294 U. S. 587, 590 .  “Collateral estoppel” is an awkward phrase, but it stands for an extremely important principle in our adversary system of justice.  It means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.  Although first developed in civil litigation, collateral estoppel has been an established rule of federal criminal law at least since this Court's decision more than 50 years ago in United States v. Oppenheimer, 242 U. S. 85 .  As Mr. Justice Holmes put the matter in that case, “It cannot be that the safeguards of the person, so often and so rightly mentioned with solemn reverence, are less than those that protect from a liability in debt.” 242 U. S., at 87 .

 *447 In this case the State in its brief has frankly conceded that following the petitioner’s acquittal, it treated the first trial as no more than a dry run for the second prosecution: “No doubt the prosecutor felt the state had a provable case on the first charge and, when he lost, he did what every good attorney would do — he refined his presentation in light of the turn of events at the first trial.” But this is precisely what the constitutional guarantee forbids.  The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  There can be no doubt of the “retroactivity” of the Court’s decision in Benton v. Maryland.  In North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 , decided the same day as Benton , the Court unanimously accorded fully “retroactive” effect to the Benton doctrine.  “The Court instructs the jury that if you believe and find from the evidence in this case, beyond a reasonable doubt, that at the County of Jackson and State of Missouri, on the 10th day of January, 1960, the defendant herein, BOB FRED ASHE, alias BOBBY FRED ASHE, either alone or knowingly acting in concert with others, did then and there with force and arms in and upon one Don Knight, unlawfully and feloniously make an assault and took and carried away any money from his person or in his presence and against his will, by force and violence to his person, or by putting him in fear of some, immediate injury to his person, with felonious intent to convert the same to his own use, without any honest claim to said money on the part of the defendant and with intent to permanently deprive the said Don Knight of his ownership and without the consent of the said Don Knight, if such be your finding, then you will find the defendant guilty of Robbery, First Degree, and so find in your verdict.” “The Court instructs the jury that all persons are equally guilty who act together with a common intent in the commission of a crime, and a crime so committed by two or more persons jointly is the act of all and of each one so acting.  “The Court instructs the jury that when two or more persons knowingly act together in the commission of an unlawful act or purpose, then whatever either does in furtherance of such unlawful act or purpose is in law the act and deed of each of such persons.” “However persuasive the dissenting opinions in the <citedDecision>Hoag</citedDecision> case may be, it is the duty of this Court to follow the law as stated by the Supreme Court of the United States until it expresses a contrary view.  Certainly the factual circumstances of this case provide an excellent opportunity for reexamination of the questions presented.  An examination of the transcript of both trials shows that in both the single issue in real contest, as distinguished from the issues that may be said to have been in technical dispute, was the question *441 of whether petitioner was or was not present at the time the money was taken from the poker table and the other property taken from persons of the respective poker players.” Ashe v. Swenson, 289 F. Supp. 871, 873 .  “It usually is difficult for a lower federal court to forecast with assurance a Supreme Court decision as to the continuing validity of a holding of a decade ago by a Court then divided as closely as possible.  This is particularly so when the decision is in the rapidly developing and sensitive area of the criminal law and the Fourteenth Amendment Bill of Rights relationship.  We feel, however, that our task is not to forecast but to follow those dictates, despite their closeness of decision, which at this moment in time are on the books and for us to read.  .  .  .” Ashe v. Swenson, 399 F. 2d 40, 46 .  The particular “circumstance” most relied upon by the Court was “the unexpected failure of four of the State’s witnesses at the earlier trial to identify petitioner, after two of these witnesses had previously identified him in the course of the police investigation.  Indeed, after the second of the two witnesses failed to identify petitioner, the State pleaded surprise and attempted to impeach his testimony.  We cannot say that, after such an unexpected turn of events, the State’s decision to try petitioner for the Yager robbery was so arbitrary or lacking in justification that it amounted to a denial of those concepts constituting ‘the very essence of a scheme of ordered justice, which is due process.’ ” <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 469-470</citedDecision> .  In the case now before us, by contrast, there is no claim of any “unexpected turn of events” at the first trial, unless the jury verdict of acquittal be so characterized.  See also Coffey v. United States, 116 U. S. 436, 442-443 ; Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309, 333-334 ; Sealfon v. United States, 332 U. S. 575 ; United States v. De Angelo, 138 F. 2d 466 ; United States v Curzio, 170 F. 2d 354 ; Yawn v. United States, 244 F. 2d 235 ; United States v. Cowart, 118 F. Supp. 903 .  Mayors & Yarbrough, Bis Vexari: New Trials and Successive Prosecutions, 74 Harv. L. Rev. 1 , 38-39.  See Yawn v. United States, supra; United States v. De Angelo, supra. “If a later court, is permitted to state that the jury may have disbelieved substantial and uncontradicted evidence of the prosecution on a point the defendant did not contest, the possible multiplicity of prosecutions is staggering.  ... In fact, such a restrictive definition of ‘determined’ amounts simply to a rejection of collateral estoppel, since it is impossible to imagine a statutory offense in which the government has to prove only one element or issue to sustain a conviction.” Mayers & Yarbrough, supra, at 38.  See generally Lugar, Criminal Law, Double Jeopardy and Res Judicata, 39 Iowa L. Rev. 317 .  See also Comment., Twice in Jeopardy, 75 Yale L. J. 262; Hunvald, Criminal Law in Missouri, 25 Mo. L.

Rev. 513 ; McLaren, The Doctrine of Res Judicata as Applied to the Trial of Criminal Cases, 10 Wash. L. Rev. 19S.  It is true, as this Court said in <citedDecision>Hoag</citedDecision> v. New <citedDecision>Jersey, supra,</citedDecision> that we have never squarely held collateral estoppel to be a constitutional requirement.  Until perhaps a century ago, few situations arose ealling for its application.  For at common law, and under early federal criminal statutes, offense categories were relatively few and distinct.  A single course of criminal conduct was likely to yield but a single offense.  See Comment, Statutory Implementation of Double Jeopardy Clauses: New Life for a Moribund Constitutional Guarantee, 65 Yale L. J. 339, 342.  In more recent times, with the advent of specificity in draftsmanship and the extraordinary proliferation of overlapping and related statutory offenses, it became possible for prosecutors to spin out a startlingly numerous series of offenses from a single alleged criminal transaction.  See Note, Double Jeopardy and the Multiple-Count.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Brennan, whom Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Marshall join, concurring.  I agree that the Double Jeopardy Clause incorporates collateral estoppel as a constitutional requirement and therefore join the Court’s opinion.  However, even if *449 the rule of collateral estoppel had been inapplicable to the facts of this case, it is my view that the Double Jeopardy Clause nevertheless bars the prosecution of petitioner a second time for armed robbery.  The two prosecutions, the first for the robbery of Knight and the second for the robbery of Roberts, grew out of one criminal episode, and therefore I think it clear on the facts of this case that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited Missouri from prosecuting petitioner for each robbery at a different trial. Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 196-201 (1959) (separate opinion).  My conclusion is not precluded by the Court's decision in Hoag v. New Jersey, <citedDecision>356 U. S. 464</citedDecision> (1958), although the basic fact situation there was identical to that in this case. Three armed men entered a tavern and robbed five customers.  Hoag was tried and acquitted under indictments for robbing three of the customers.  He was then brought to trial under a fourth indictment, the same as the first three in all respects except that it named a fourth customer as the victim.  This time Hoag was convicted.  The New Jersey courts, in rejecting Hoag’s double-jeopardy claim, construed the applicable New Jersey statute as making each of the four robberies, although taking place on the same occasion, a separate offense.  This construction was consistent with the state courts’ view that a claim of double jeopardy cannot be upheld unless the same evidence necessary to sustain a second indictment would have been sufficient to secure a conviction on the first.  The issues differed only in the identifications of the victims and the property taken from each; otherwise the State’s evidence covered the same ground at both trials.  This Court stated that it was unable to hold that the Due Process *450 Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment “always prevents a State from allowing different offenses arising out of the same act or transaction to be prosecuted separately, as New Jersey has done.  For it has long been recognized as the very essence of our federalism that the States should have the widest latitude in the administration of their own systems of criminal justice.” <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 468</citedDecision> .  But in the present case Missouri did not have “the widest latitude” because Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969), decided after <citedDecision>Hoag</citedDecision> , held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee that no person shall “be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb” is enforceable against the States, and North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), accorded fully retroactive effect to that holding.  This means, under our decisions, that federal standards as to what constitutes the “same offence” apply alike to federal and state proceedings; it would be incongruous to have different standards determine the validity of a claim of double jeopardy depending on whether the claim was asserted in a state or federal court. Cf. Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 11 (1964).  The Double Jeopardy Clause is a guarantee “that the State with all its resources and power [shall] not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity .  .  .  .” Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187 (1957).  This guarantee is expressed as a prohibition against multiple prosecutions for the “same offence.” Although the phrase “same offence” appeared in most of the early common-law articulations of the double-jeop *451 ardy principle, 1 questions of its precise meaning rarely arose prior to the 18th century, and by the time the Bill of Rights was adopted it had not been authoritatively defined.  2 When the common law did finally attempt a definition, in The King v. Vandercomb, 2 Leach 708, 720, 168 Eng. Rep. 455, 461 (Crown 1796), it adopted the “same evidence” test, which provided little protection from multiple prosecution: “[U]nless the first indictment were such as the prisoner might have been convicted upon by proof of the facts contained in the second indictment, an acquittal on the first indictment can be no bar to the second.” The “same evidence” test of “same offence” was soon followed by a majority of American jurisdictions, but its deficiencies are obvious.  It does not enforce but virtually annuls the constitutional guarantee.  For example, where a single criminal episode involves several victims, under the “same evidence” test a separate prosecution may be brought as to each.  E. g., State v. Hoag, 21 N. J. 496, 122 A. 2d 628 (1956), aff’d, <citedDecision>356 U. S. 464</citedDecision> (1958).  The “same evidence” test permits multiple prosecutions where a single transaction is divisible into chronologically discrete crimes.  E. g., Johnson v. Commonwealth, 201 Ky. 314 , 256 S. W. 388 (1923) (each of 75 poker hands a separate “offense”).  Even a single criminal act may lead to multiple prosecutions if it is viewed from the perspectives of different statutes.  E. g., *452 State v. Elder, 65 Ind. 282 (1879).  Given the tendency of modern criminal legislation to divide the phases of a criminal transaction into numerous separate crimes, the opportunities for multiple prosecutions for an essentially unitary criminal episode are frightening.  And given our tradition of virtually unreviewable prosecutorial discretion concerning the initiation and scope of a criminal prosecution, 3 the potentialities for abuse inherent in the ‘‘same evidence” test are simply intolerable.

**Dissenting Opinion**
 The weight of the harassment factor does not warrant elevating collateral-estoppel principles in criminal trials to the level of an “ingredient” of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  True harassment deserves serious consideration because of the strain of the new trial. But society has an urgent interest in protecting the public from criminal acts and we ought not endorse any concepts that put a premium on aggravated criminal conduct in multiple crimes committed at the same time.  Arguably if Ashe had made a defense solely by alibi, that he was in Vietnam at the time and offered evidence of Army records etc., one might reasonably say the jury decided what the Court today says it probably decided.  On this record however, such an analysis is baseless.  See ante, at 439 n. 3.  For a criticism of the collateral-estoppel doctrine because of the “guesswork” necessary to apply it to general criminal verdicts, see Note, 75 Yale L. J. 262, 285 (1965).  Hoag v.
