**Lead Opinion**
 IV. It is clear that petitioner’s larceny conviction cannot stand once federal double jeopardy standards are applied.  Petitioner was acquitted of larceny in his first trial. Because he decided to appeal his burglary conviction, he is forced to suffer retrial on the larceny count as well.  As this Court held in Green v. United States, supra, at 193— 194, “[conditioning an appeal of one offense on a coerced surrender of a valid plea of former jeopardy on another offense exacts a forfeiture in plain conflict with the constitutional bar against double jeopardy.” Maryland argues that Green does not apply to this case because petitioner’s original indictment was absolutely void.  One cannot be placed in “jeopardy” by a void indictment, the State argues.  This argument sounds a bit strange, however, since petitioner could quietly have served out his sentence under this “void” indictment had he not appealed his burglary conviction.  Only by accepting the option of a new trial could the in *797 dictment be set aside; at worst the indictment would seem only voidable at the defendant’s option, not absolutely void.  In any case, this argument was answered here over 70 years ago in United States v. Ball, <citedDecision>163 U. S. 662</citedDecision> (1896).  In that case Millard Fillmore Ball was indicted, together with two other men, for the murder of one William T. Box in the Indian Territory.  He was acquitted and his codefendants were convicted.  They appealed and won a reversal on the ground that the indictment erroneously failed to aver the time or place of Box’s death.  All three defendants were retried, and this time Ball was convicted.  This Court sustained his double jeopardy claim, notwithstanding the technical invalidity of the indictment upon which he was first tried.  The Court refused to allow the Government to allege its own error to deprive the defendant of the benefit of an acquittal by a jury.  <citedDecision>Id., at 667-668</citedDecision> .  “ [A] lthough the indictment was fatally defective, yet, if the court had jurisdiction of the cause and of the party, its judgment is not void, but only voidable by writ of error .  .  .  ,” and the Government could not have the acquittal set aside over the defendant’s objections.  <citedDecision>Id., at 669-670</citedDecision> .  This case is totally indistinguishable.  Petitioner was acquitted of larceny.  He has, under Green , a valid double jeopardy plea which he cannot be forced to waive.  Yet Maryland wants the earlier acquittal set aside, over petitioner’s objections, because of a defect in the indictment.  This it cannot do.  Petitioner’s larceny conviction cannot stand.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice White, concurring. While I agree with the Court’s extension of the prohibition against double jeopardy to the States, and with the Court’s conclusion that the concurrent sentence rule constitutes no jurisdictional bar, additional comment on the wisdom and effects of applying a concurrent sentence rule seems appropriate. In a time of increasingly congested judicial dockets, often requiring long delays before trial and upon appeal, *799 judicial resources have become scarce. Where a man has been convicted on several counts and sentenced concurrently upon each, and where judicial review of one count sustains its validity, the need for review of the other counts is not a pressing one since, regardless of the outcome, the prisoner will remain in jail for the same length of time under the count upheld. Rather than permit other cases to languish while careful review of these redundant counts is carried to its futile conclusion, judicial resources might be better employed by moving on to more pressing business. This is not a rule of convenience to the judge, but rather of fairness to other litigants. This is not to say, however, that the fact of conviction under the unreviewed counts could never be of importance to the prisoner. After his release it is possible they might be used against him in a recidivism prosecution, or used to impeach his testimony in a trial for another offense, to pick two obvious examples. Nevertheless, the unreviewed counts are, by hypothesis, not of immediate importance to his confinement, and our experience gives us no indication that they are frequently of such importance later that the concurrent sentence rule should not be applied. The unreviewed count is often one which, but for the concurrent sentence rule, the prisoner would have a right to challenge, either directly or on collateral attack. Arguably, to deny him that right when another man, convicted after a separate trial on each count, or sentenced consecutively, could not be denied that right under the applicable state or federal law, raises an equal protection question. But clearly so long as the denied review is of no significance to the prisoner the denial of equal protection is not invidious but only theoretical. But should a situation arise in which the convict can demonstrate that the unreviewed count is being used *800 against him, so as to work some harm to him additional to that stemming from the reviewed count, his grievance becomes real. At that point it may be that the unreviewed count may not be used against him, unless it is determined that the lack of earlier review can be cured by then supplying the convict the review to which he would earlier have been entitled but for his concurrent sentence on another count. For myself, postponed review, a question which the Court reserves {ante, at 791, n. 7), presents no insuperable difficulties. Appellate review is always conducted on a cold record, and collateral proceedings frequently deal with a stale record and stale facts. There is nothing inherently unfair in permitting the record to become colder while it is irrelevant to any human need, and other litigants’ demands are more pressing. Whether reversal on such a record, after delayed review, would permit retrial or a hearing on a claim involving, for example, a coerced confession, is yet a further question which there is no present need to address. Should a satisfactory hearing or retrial prove impossible this would be an unfortunate byproduct of an initially crowded docket. For the foregoing reasons, I agree with the Court that the concurrent sentence rule, while not of jurisdictional dimensions, should be preserved as a matter of proper judicial administration both on direct appeal and collateral attack, although at least in theory it raises a number of questions concerning the subsequent effects of the unreviewed counts. It may be that where it can be reliably predicted in a particular case that each count would entail concrete prejudicial consequences at a later date, the appellate court at the time of initial review would prefer to deal with all counts rather than to apply the concurrent sentence rule.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Had petitioner not appealed his burglary conviction, the State would surely have allowed him to rest on his larceny acquittal and merely serve out his burglary sentence.  However, the State argues that the burglary and larceny counts were originally contained in a single indictment; that upon petitioner’s appeal the indictment was declared totally void and the trial court found to have lacked jurisdiction; and that the State could then proceed as if there had never been a previous indictment or trial. The State’s contention that petitioner’s first trial was a complete nullity because the trial court “lacked juris *811 diction” is unconvincing.  As has been noted, it appears that the State would willingly have seen petitioner serve out the burglary sentence imposed in consequence of that trial. Under state procedure, petitioner could avail himself of the “jurisdictional” defect only by appealing his conviction.  The crucial issue, therefore, is what legitimate interest had the State in compelling petitioner to jeopardize his larceny acquittal as a condition of appealing his burglary conviction?  I can perceive no legitimate state interest.  Certainly it is the purest fiction to say that by appealing his burglary conviction petitioner “waived” his right not to be retried for larceny or “consented” to retrial on that charge.  The notion of “waiver” was first employed in United States v. Ball, <citedDecision>163 U. S. 662</citedDecision> (1896), to justify retrial of an accused for the same offense following reversal of a conviction on appeal.  The “waiver” doctrine was more fully articulated in Trono v. United States, 199 U. S. 621 (1905), where it was held that retrial and conviction for murder following a successful appeal from a manslaughter conviction did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  15 Trono apparently dictated the result in Brantley v. Georgia, 217 U. S. 284 (1910), in which the Court held in a brief per curiam, without citing any authority, that a Georgia retrial and conviction for murder following the reversal on appeal of an earlier manslaughter conviction did not amount to “a case of twice in jeopardy under any view of the Constitution of the United States.” Id., at 285 .  16 We have since *812 recognized that the “waiver” rationale is a “conceptual abstraction” which obscures rather than illuminates the underlying clash of societal and individual interests.  See United States v. Tateo, 377 U. S. 463, 466 (1964).  Accordingly, I do not think that the reasoning in Trono or the apparent holding in Brantley , insofar as they would require affirmance of petitioner’s larceny conviction, can any longer be regarded as good law. Nor did the State in the present case have the sorts of interests which have been held to justify retrial for the same offense after a conviction has been reversed on appeal by the accused and in the more unusual case when an acquittal has been set aside following an appeal by the State.  17 When the accused has obtained a reversal on appeal, the societal interest in convicting the guilty has been deemed too weighty to permit every such accused to be “granted immunity from punishment because of any defect sufficient to constitute reversible error in the proceedings leading to conviction.” United States v. Tateo, supra, at 466 .
