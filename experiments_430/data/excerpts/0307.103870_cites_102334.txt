**Lead Opinion**
 As the present Chief Justice said in dissent in the Gobitis case, the State may “require teaching by instruction and study of all in our history and in the structure and organization of our government, including the guaranties of civil liberty, which tend to inspire patriotism and love of country.” 310 U. S. at 604 .  Here, however, we are dealing with a compulsion of students to declare a belief.  They are not merely made acquainted with the flag salute so that they may be informed as to what it is or even what it means.  The issue here is whether this slow and easily neglected 11 route to aroused loyalties constitutionally may be short-cut by substituting a compulsory salute and slogan.  12 This issue is not prejudiced by *632 the Court’s previous holding that where a State, without compelling attendance, extends college facilities to pupils who voluntarily enroll, it may prescribe military training as part of the course without offense to the Constitution.  It was held that those who take advantage of its opportunities may not on ground of conscience refuse compliance with such conditions.  Hamilton v. Regents, <citedDecision>293 U. S. 245</citedDecision> .  In the present case attendance is not optional.  That case is also to be distinguished from the present one because, independently of college privileges or requirements, the State has power to raise militia and impose the duties of service therein upon its citizens.  There is no doubt that, in connection with the pledges, the flag salute is a form of utterance.  Symbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating ideas.  The use of an emblem or flag to symbolize some system, idea, institution, or personality, is a short cut from mind to mind.  Causes and nations, political parties, lodges and ecclesiastical groups seek to knit the loyalty of their followings to a flag or banner, a color or design.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Me. Justice Black and Me. Justice Douglas, concurring: We are substantially in agreement with the opinion just read, but since we originally joined with the Court in the Gobitis case, it is appropriate that we make a brief statement of reasons for our change of view. Reluctance to make the Federal Constitution a rigid bar against state regulation of conduct thought inimical to the public welfare was the controlling influence which moved us to consent to the Gobitis decision. Long reflection convinced us that although the principle is sound, its application in the particular case was wrong. Jones v. Opelika, 316 U. S. 584, 623 . We believe that the statute before us fails to accord full scope to the freedom of religion secured to the appellees by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The statute requires the appellees to participate in a ceremony aimed at inculcating respect for the flag and for this country. The Jehovah’s Witnesses, without any desire to show disrespect for either the flag or the country, interpret the Bible as commanding, at the risk of God’s displeasure, that they not go through the form of a pledge of allegiance to any flag. The devoutness of their belief is evidenced by their willingness to suffer persecution and punishment, rather than make the pledge. No well-ordered society can leave to the individuals an absolute right to make final decisions, unassailable by the State, as to everything they will or will not do. The First Amendment does not go so far. Religious faiths, honestly held, do not free individuals from responsibility to conduct themselves obediently to laws which are either imperatively necessary to protect society as a whole from grave *644 and pressingly imminent dangers or which, without any general prohibition, merely regulate time, place or manner of religious activity. Decision as to the constitutionality of particular laws which strike at the substance of religious tenets and practices must be made by this Court. The duty is a solemn one, and in meeting it we cannot say that a failure, because of religious scruples, to assume a particular physical position and to repeat the words of a patriotic formula creates a grave danger to the nation. Such a statutory exaction is a form of test oath, and the test oath has always been abhorrent in the United States. Words uttered under coercion are proof of loyalty to nothing but self-interest. Love of country must spring from willing hearts and free minds, inspired by a fair administration of wise laws enacted by the people’s elected representatives within the bounds of express constitutional prohibitions. These laws must, to be consistent with the First Amendment, permit the widest toleration of conflicting viewpoints consistent with a society of free men. Neither our domestic tranquillity in peace nor our martial effort in war depend on compelling little children to participate in a ceremony which ends in nothing for them but a fear of spiritual condemnation. If, as we think, their fears are groundless, time and reason are the proper antidotes for their errors. The ceremonial, when enforced against conscientious objectors, more likely to defeat than to serve its high purpose, is a handy implement for disguised religious persecution. As such, it is inconsistent with our Constitution’s plan and purpose. Me. Justice Muephy, concurring: I agree with the opinion of the Court and join in it. The complaint challenges an order of the State Board of Education which requires teachers and pupils to participate in the prescribed salute to the flag. For refusal to conform with the requirement, the State law prescribes ex *645 pulsion. The offender is required by law to be treated as unlawfully absent from school and the parent or guardian is made liable to prosecution and punishment for such absence. Thus not only is the privilege of public education conditioned on compliance with the requirement, but noncompliance is virtually made unlawful. In effect compliance is compulsory and not optional. It is the claim of appellees that the regulation is invalid as a restriction on religious freedom and freedom of speech, secured to them against State infringement by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. A reluctance to interfere with considered state action, the fact that the end sought is a desirable one, the emotion aroused by the flag as a symbol for which we have fought and are now fighting again, — all of these are understandable. But there is before us the right of freedom to believe, freedom to worship one’s Maker according to the dictates of one’s conscience, a right which the Constitution specifically shelters. Reflection has convinced me that as a judge I have no loftier duty or responsibility than to uphold that spiritual freedom to its farthest reaches. The right of freedom of thought and of religion as guaranteed by the Constitution against State action includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all, except insofar as essential operations of government may require it for the preservation of an orderly society, — as in the case of compulsion to give evidence in court. Without wishing to disparage the purposes and intentions of those who hope to inculcate sentiments of loyalty and patriotism by requiring a declaration of allegiance as a feature of public education, or unduly belittle the benefits that may accrue therefrom, I am impelled to conclude that such a requirement is not essential to the maintenance of effective government and orderly society. To many it is deeply distasteful to join in a public chorus of affirmation of private belief. By some, in- *646 eluding the members of this sect, it is apparently regarded as incompatible with a primary religious obligation and therefore a restriction on religious freedom. Official compulsion to affirm what is contrary to one’s religious beliefs is the antithesis of freedom of worship which, it is well to recall, was achieved in this country only after what Jefferson characterized as the “severest contests in which I have ever been engaged.” 1 I am unable to agree that the benefits that may accrue to society from the compulsory flag salute are sufficiently definite and tangible to justify the invasion of freedom and privacy that is entailed or to compensate for a restraint on the freedom of the individual to be vocal or silent according to his conscience or personal inclination. The trenchant words in the preamble to the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom remain unanswerable: “. . . all attempts to influence [the mind] by temporal punishments, or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypocrisy and meanness, . . .” Any spark of love for country which may be generated in a child or his associates by forcing him to make what is to him an empty gesture and recite words wrung from him contrary to his religious beliefs is overshadowed by the desirability of preserving freedom of conscience to the full. It is in that freedom and the example of persuasion, not in force and compulsion, that the real unity of America lies. See Jefferson, Autobiography, vol. 1, pp. 53-59.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Most unwillingly, therefore, I must differ from my brethren with regard to legislation like this.  I cannot bring my mind to believe that the “liberty” secured by the Due Process Clause gives this Court authority to deny to the State of West Virginia the attainment of that which we all recognize as a legitimate legislative end, namely, the promo-' tion of good citizenship, by employment of the means here chosen.  Not so long ago we were admonished that “the only check upon our own exercise of power is our own sense of self-restraint.  For the removal of unwise laws from the statute books appeal lies not to the courts but to the ballot and to the processes of democratic government.” *648 United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 79 (dissent).  We have been told that generalities do not decide concrete cases. But the intensity with which a general principle is held may determine a particular issue, and whether we put first things first may decide a specific controversy.  The admonition that judicial self-restraint alone limits arbitrary exercise of our authority is relevant every time we are asked to nullify legislation.  The Constitution does not give us greater veto power when dealing with one phase of “liberty” than with another, or when dealing with grade school regulations than with college regulations that offend conscience, as was the case in Hamilton v. Regents, <citedDecision>293 U. S. 245</citedDecision> .  In neither situation is our function comparable to that of a legislature or are we free to act as though we were a super-legislature.  Judicial self-restraint is equally necessary whenever an exercise of 'political or legislative power is challenged.  There is no warrant in the constitutional basis of this Court’s authority for attributing different roles to it depending upon the nature of the challenge to the legislation.  Our power does not vary according to the particular provision of the Bill of Rights which is invoked.  The right not to have property taken without just compensation has, so far as the scope of judicial power is concerned, the same constitutional dignity as the right to be protected against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the latter has no less claim than freedom of the press or freedom of speech or religious freedom.  In no instance is this Court the primary protector of the particular liberty that is invoked.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 An act compelling profession of allegiance to a religion, no matter how subtly or tenuously promoted, is bad.  But an act promoting good citizenship and national allegiance is within the domain of governmental authority and is therefore to be judged by the same considerations of power and of constitutionality as those involved in the many *655 claims of immunity from civil obedience because of religious scruples.  That claims are pressed on behalf of sincere religious convictions does not of itself establish their constitutional validity.  Nor does waving the banner of religious freedom relieve us from examining into the power we are asked to deny the states.  Otherwise the doctrine of separation of church and state, so cardinal in the history of this nation and for the liberty of our people, would mean not the disestablishment of a state church but the establishment of all churches and of all religious groups.  The subjection of dissidents to the general requirement of saluting the flag, as a measure conducive to the training of children in good citizenship, is very far from being the first instance of exacting obedience to general laws that have offended deep religious scruples.  Compulsory vaccination, see Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11 , food inspection regulations, see Shapiro v. Lyle, 30 F. 2d 971 , the obligation to bear arms, see Hamilton v. Regents, <citedDecision>293 U. S. 245, 267</citedDecision> , testimonial duties, see Stansbury v. Marks, 2 Dall. 213 , compulsory medical treatment, see People v. Vogelgesang, 221 N. Y. 290 , 116 N. E. 977 — these are but illustrations of conduct that has often been compelled in the enforcement of legislation of general applicability even though the religious consciences of particular individuals rebelled at the exaction.  Law is concerned with external behavior and not with the inner life of man.  It rests in large measure upon compulsion.  Socrates lives in history partly because he gave his life for the conviction that duty of obedience to secular law does not presuppose consent to its enactment or belief in its virtue.  The consent upon which free government rests is the consent that comes from sharing in the process of making and unmaking laws.  The state is not shut out from a domain because the individual conscience may deny the state’s claim.  The individual con *656 science may profess what faith it chooses.  It may affirm and promote that faith — in the language of the Constitution, it may “exercise” it freely — but it cannot thereby restrict community action through political organs in matters of community concern, so long as the action is not asserted in a discriminatory way either openly or by stealth.  One may have the right to practice one’s religion and at the same time owe the duty of formal obedience to laws that run counter to one’s beliefs.  Compelling belief implies denial of opportunity to combat it and to assert dissident views.  Such compulsion is one thing.  Quite another matter is submission to conformity of action while denying its wisdom or virtue and with ample opportunity for seeking its change or abrogation.  In Hamilton v. Regents, <citedDecision>293 U. S. 245</citedDecision> , this Court unanimously held that one attending a state-maintained university cannot refuse attendance on courses that offend his religious scruples.  That decision is not overruled today, but is distinguished on the ground that attendance at the institution for higher education was voluntary and therefore a student could not refuse compliance with its conditions and yet take advantage of its opportunities.  But West Virginia does not compel the attendance at its public schools of the children here concerned.  West Virginia does not so compel, for it cannot.  This Court denied the right of a state to require its children to attend public schools.  Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 .  As to its public schools, West Virginia imposes conditions which it deems necessary in the development of future citizens precisely as California deemed necessary the requirements that offended the student’s conscience in the <citedDecision>Hamilton</citedDecision> case. The need for higher education and the duty of the state to provide it as part of a public educational system, are part of the democratic faith of most of our states.  The right to secure such education in institutions not maintained by public funds is unquestioned.  *657 But the practical opportunities for obtaining what is becoming in increasing measure the conventional equipment of American youth may be no less burdensome than that which parents are increasingly called upon to bear in sending their children to parochial schools because the education provided by public schools, though supported by their taxes, does not satisfy their ethical and educational necessities.  I find it impossible, so far as constitutional power is concerned, to differentiate what was sanctioned in the <citedDecision>Hamilton</citedDecision> case from what is nullified in this case. And for me it still remains to be explained why the grounds of Mr. Justice Cardozo’s opinion in <citedDecision>Hamilton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Regents, supra,</citedDecision> are not sufficient to sustain the flag salute requirement.  Such a requirement, like the requirement in the <citedDecision>Hamilton</citedDecision> case, “is not an interference by the state with the free exercise of religion when the liberties of the constitution are read in the light of a century and a half of history during days of peace and war.” <citedDecision>293 U. S. 245, 266</citedDecision> .  The religious worshiper, “if his liberties were to be thus extended, might refuse to contribute taxes ... in furtherance of any other end condemned by his conscience as irreligious or immoral.  The right of private judgment has never yet been so exalted above the powers and the compulsion of the agencies of government.” <citedDecision>Id., at 268</citedDecision> .  Parents have the privilege of choosing which schools they wish their children to attend.  And the question here is whether the state may make certain requirements that seem to it desirable or important for the proper education of those future citizens who go to schools maintained by the states, or whether the pupils in those schools may be relieved from those requirements if they run counter to the consciences of their parents.  Not only have parents the right to send children to schools of their own choosing but the state has no right to bring such schools “under a strict governmental control” or give “affirmative direction *658 concerning the intimate and essential details of such schools, entrust their control to public officers, and deny both owners and patrons reasonable choice and discretion in respect of teachers, curriculum, and textbooks.” Farrington v. Tokushige, 273 U. S. 284, 298 .  Why should not the state likewise have constitutional power to make reasonable provisions for the proper instruction of children in schools maintained by it?  When dealing with religious scruples we are dealing with an almost numberless variety of doctrines and beliefs entertained with equal sincerity by the particular groups for which they satisfy man’s needs in his relation to the mysteries of the universe.  There are in the United States more than 250 distinctive established religious denominations.
