**Combined Opinion**
We do not think it consistent to hold that the general agent has enough "possession and control" to be an employer under the Jones Act but not enough to be responsible for maintenance under New York law. It is true, as respondent argues, that Caldarola dealt only with the general agent's liability to a stevedore, as opposed to a crew member, under the law of New York. We think, however, that vicarious liability to anyone must be predicated on the relation which exists under the standard form agreement and the shipping articles between the general agent on the one hand and the master and crew of the vessel on the other. Caldarola held that this relation was not one which involved that proximity necessary to a finding of liability in the general agent for the torts of the master and crew. We perceive no reason why the rationale of this holding does not apply with equal force to a suit under the Jones Act. Under common-law principles of agency such a conclusion is required. We think it equally compelled even if we are to adopt, as the Court in Hust suggested, the perhaps less technical and more substantial tests propounded in Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U.S. 111 . Hust was decided June 10, 1946; Caldarola June 23, 1947. Certainly from the latter date, the danger of relying on Hust was apparent to the world though it must be admitted there was enough uncertainty in the law *794 properly to give concern to Congress. [14] Notwithstanding there may be some undesirable results in overruling Hust, such as loss of rights under the Suits in Admiralty Act by reliance on Hust, we think that in view of Caldarola, the uncertainty as to remedies that the two decisions generate, and the desirability of clarifying the position of the United States as an employer through the War Shipping Administration, that case should be and is overruled. II. A re-examination of the present standard service agreement will make clear the conclusion set out in Part I of this opinion. 46 C.F.R.

Rights of any seaman under the Social Security Act, as amended by subsection (b) (2) and (3), and claims therefor shall be governed solely by the provisions of such Act, so amended. When used in this subsection the term `administratively disallowed' means a denial of a written claim in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed by the Administrator, War Shipping Administration. . . ." [9] See the discussion of the Brady case at 328 U.S. 745-47 . [10] Newsboys, Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U.S. 111 , 120, 128-31; unloaders of coal cars, United States v. Silk, 331 U.S. 704 , 713; meat boners, Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb, 331 U.S. 722 . [11] But compare Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 237 U.S. 84 , 94: "We are of the opinion that Congress used the words `employe' and `employed' in the statute in their natural sense, and intended to describe the conventional relation of employer and employe." Hull v. Philadelphia & Reading R. Co., 252 U.S. 475 . [12] It is much the same type of problem as was presented in Bartels v. Birmingham, 332 U.S. 126 . There we concluded that the leader and organizer of a traveling orchestra was the employer of the band members rather than the various dance hall proprietors for whom the orchestra performed.
