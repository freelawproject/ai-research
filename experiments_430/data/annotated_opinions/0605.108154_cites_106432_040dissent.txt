**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Black, dissenting.  Congress in 1932 enacted the Norris-LaGuardia Act, § 4 of which, 29 U. S. C. § 104 , with exceptions not here relevant, specifically prohibited federal courts in the broadest and most comprehensive language from *256 issuing any injunctions, temporary or permanent, against participation in a labor dispute.  Subsequently, in 1947, Congress gave jurisdiction to the federal courts in “[s]uits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization.” Although this subsection, § 301 (a) of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U. S. C. § 185 (a), explicitly waives the diversity and amount-in-controversy requirements for federal jurisdiction, it says nothing at all about granting injunctions.  Eight years ago this Court considered the relation of these two statutes: after full briefing and argument, relying on the language and history of the Acts, the Court decided that Congress did not wish this later statute to impair in any way Norris-LaGuardia’s explicit prohibition against injunctions in labor disputes.  Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, <citedDecision>370 U. S. 195</citedDecision> (1962).  Although Congress has been urged to overrule our holding in Sinclair, it has steadfastly refused to do so. Nothing in the language or history of the two Acts has changed.  Nothing at all has changed, in fact, except the membership of the Court and the personal views of one Justice.  I remain of the opinion that Sinclair was correctly decided, and, moreover, that the prohibition of the Norris-LaGuardia Act is close to the heart of the entire federal system of labor regulation.  In my view Sinclair should control the disposition of this case. Even if the majority were correct, however, in saying that Sinclair misinterpreted the Taft-Hartley and Norris-LaGuardia Acts, I should be compelled to dissent.  I believe that both the making and the changing of laws which affect the substantial rights of the people are primarily for Congress, not this Court. Most especially is this so when the laws involved are the focus of strongly held views of powerful but antagonistic political and economic interests.  The Court’s function in the application and interpretation of such laws must be carefully limited to avoid encroaching on the power of *257 Congress to determine policies and make laws to carry them out.

 And it is Congress, not this Court, that is elected by the people.  This Court should, therefore, interject itself as little as possible into the law-making and law-changing process.  Having given our view on the meaning of a statute, our task is concluded, absent extraordinary circumstances.  When the Court changes its mind years later, simply because the judges have changed, in my judgment, it takes upon itself the function of the legislature.  The legislative effect of the Court’s reversal is especially clear here.  In Sinclair the Court invited Congress to act if it should be displeased with the judicial interpretation of the statute.  We said, <citedDecision>370 U. S., at 214</citedDecision> -215: “Strong arguments are made to us that it is highly desirable that the Norris-LaGuardia Act be changed in the public interest.  If that is so, Congress itself might see fit to change that law and repeal the anti-injunction provisions of the Act insofar as suits for violation of collective agreements are concerned, as the House bill under consideration originally provided.  It might, on the other hand, decide that if injunctions are necessary, the whole idea of enforcement of these agreements by private suits should *259 be discarded in favor of enforcement through the administrative machinery of the Labor Board, as Senator Taft provided in his Senate bill.  Or it might decide that neither of these methods is entirely satisfactory and turn instead to a completely new approach.  The question of what change, if any, should be made in the existing law is one of legislative policy properly within the exclusive domain of Congress — it is a question for lawmakers, not law interpreters.” Commentators on our holding found this invitation to legislative action clear, and judicial self-restraint proper.  See Dunau, Three Problems in Labor Arbitration, 55 Va. L. Rev. 427 , 464-465 (1969); Wellington & Albert, Statutory Interpretation and the Political Process: A Comment on Sinclair v. Atkinson, 72 Yale L. J. 1547, 1565-1566 (1963).  Bills were introduced in Congress seeking to effect a legislative change.

 That is doubtless true.  But the harshness and effectiveness of injunctive relief- — and opposition to “government by injunction” — were the precise reasons for the congressional prohibition in the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  The effect of the Avco decision is, indeed, to highlight the limited remedial powers of federal courts.  But if the Congress is unhappy with these powers as this Court defined them, then the Congress may act; this Court should not.  The members of the majority have simply decided that they are more sensitive to the “realization of an important goal of our national labor policy” than the Congress or their predecessors on this Court. The correct interpretation of the Taft-Hartley Act, and even the goals of “our national labor policy,” are less important than the proper division of functions between the branches of our Federal Government.  The Court would do well to remember the words of John Adams, written in the Declaration of Rights in the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: “The judicial [department] shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers, or either of them: to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men.” I dissent.  MR. Justice White dissents for the reasons stated in the majority opinion in Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, <citedDecision>370 U. S. 195</citedDecision> (1962).  Other members of the Court have drawn the distinction between constitutional and statutory matters, and indicated that the correction of this Court’s errors in statutory interpretation is best left to Congress.  For example, Mr. Justice Douglas noted in dissent in Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 133-134 (1965): “An error in interpreting a federal statute may be easily remedied.  If this Court has failed to perceive the intention of Congress, or has interpreted a statute in such a manner as to thwart the legislative purpose, Congress may change it.  The lessons of experience are not learned by judges alone.” See also United Gas Improvement Co. v. Continental Oil Co., 381 U. S. 392, 406 (1965) (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Apparently, however, some members of the Court are willing to give greater weight to stare decisis in constitutional than in statutory matters.  See, e. g., Orozco v. Texas, 394 U. S. 324, 327-328 (1969) (Harlan, J., concurring).
