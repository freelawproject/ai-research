 2 This alternative creates an unacceptably high risk of losing the contents of the vehicle, and is a principal basis for the Court’s automobile exception to the warrant requirement.  See Chambers, supra, at 51, n. 9 .  In many cases, however, the police will, prior to searching the car, have cause to arrest the occupants and bring them to the station for booking.  In this situation, the police can ordinarily seize the automobile and bring it to the station.  Because the vehicle is now in the exclusive control of the authorities, any subsequent search cannot be justified by the mobility of the car. Rather, an immediate warrantless search of the vehicle is permitted because of the second major justification for the automobile exception: the diminished expectation of privacy in an automobile.  Because an automobile presents much of its contents in open view to police officers who legitimately stop it on a public way, is used for travel, and is subject to significant gov *831 ernment regulation, this Court has determined that the intrusion of a warrantless search of an automobile is constitutionally less significant than a warrantless search of more private areas.  See Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753, 761</citedDecision> (1979) (collecting cases).  This justification has been invoked for warrantless automobile searches in circumstances where the exigency of mobility was clearly not present.  See, e. g., South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364, 367-368 (1976); Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, at 441-442 .  By focusing on the defendant’s reasonable expectation of privacy, this Court has refused to require a warrant in situations where the process of obtaining such a warrant would be more intrusive than the actual search itself.  Cf. Katz v. United States, supra. A defendant may consider the seizure of the car a greater intrusion than an immediate search.  See Chambers, supra, at 51-52 .  Therefore, even where police can bring both the defendant and the automobile to the station safely and can house the car while they seek a warrant, the police are permitted to decide whether instead to conduct an immediate search of the car. In effect, the warrantless search is permissible because a warrant requirement would not provide significant protection of the defendant’s Fourth Amendment interests.  B The majority’s rule is flatly inconsistent with these established Fourth Amendment principles concerning the scope of the automobile exception and the importance of the warrant requirement.  Historically, the automobile exception has been limited to those situations where its application is compelled by the justifications described above.  Today, the majority makes no attempt to base its decision on these justifications.  This failure is not surprising, since the traditional rationales for the automobile exception plainly do not support extending it to the search of a container found inside a vehicle.  *832 The practical mobility problem — deciding what to do with both the car and the occupants if an immediate search is not conducted — is simply not present in the case of movable containers, which can easily be seized and brought to the magistrate.  See Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 762-766</citedDecision> , and nn. 10, 14.  The lesser-expectation-of-privacy rationale also has little force.  A container, as opposed to the car itself, does not reflect diminished privacy interests.  See <citedDecision>id., at 762, 764-765</citedDecision> .  Moreover, the practical corollary that this Court has recognized — that depriving occupants of the use of a car may be a greater intrusion than an immediate search — is of doubtful relevance here, since the owner of a container will rarely suffer significant inconvenience by being deprived of its use while a warrant is being obtained.  Ultimately, the majority, unable to rely on the justifications underlying the automobile exception, simply creates a new “probable cause” exception to the warrant requirement for automobiles.  We have soundly rejected attempts to create such an exception in the past, see Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971), and we should do so again today.  In purported reliance on Carroll v. United States, supra, the Court defines the permissible scope of a search by reference to the scope of a probable-cause search that a magistrate could authorize.  Under Carroll , however, the mobility of an automobile is what is critical to the legality of a warrantless search.  Of course, Carroll properly confined the search to the probable-cause limits that would also limit a magistrate, but it did not suggest that the search could be as broad as a magistrate could authorize upon a warrant.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 After all, what justifies the warrantless search is not probable cause alone, but probable cause coupled with the mobility of the automobile.  Because the scope of a warrantless search should depend on the scope of the justification for dispensing with a warrant, the entire premise of the majority’s opinion fails to support its conclusion.  The majority’s rule masks the startling assumption that a policeman’s determination of probable cause is the functional equivalent of the determination of a neutral and detached magistrate.  This assumption ignores a major premise of the warrant requirement — the importance of having a neutral and detached magistrate determine whether probable cause exists.  See supra, at 828-829.  The majority’s explanation that the scope of the warrantless automobile search will be “limited” to what a magistrate could authorize is thus inconsistent with our cases, which firmly establish that an on- *834 the-spot determination of probable cause is never the same as a decision by a neutral and detached magistrate.  C Our recent decisions in United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977), <citedDecision>Arkansas</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Sanders, supra,</citedDecision> and Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 (1981), clearly affirm that movable containers are different from automobiles for Fourth Amendment purposes.  In Chadwick , the Court drew a constitutional distinction between luggage and automobiles in terms of substantial differences in expectations of privacy.  433 U. S., at 12 .  Moreover, the Court held that the mobility of such containers does not justify dispensing with a warrant, since federal agents had seized the luggage and safely transferred it to their custody under their exclusive control.  <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> explicitly held that “the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies to personal luggage taken from an automobile to the same degree it applies to such luggage in other locations.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 766</citedDecision> .  And Robbins reaffirmed the <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> rationale as applied to wrapped packages found in the unlocked luggage compartment of a vehicle.  453 U. S., at 425 .  3 In light of these considerations, I conclude that any movable container found within an automobile deserves precisely the same degree of Fourth Amendment warrant protection that it would deserve if found at a location outside the automobile.  See Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 763-765</citedDecision> , and n. 13; Chadwick, supra, at 17, n. 1 (Brennan, J., concurring).  Chadwick , as the majority notes, “reaffirmed the general principle that closed packages and containers may not be *835 searched without a warrant.” Ante, at 812.  Although there is no need to describe the exact contours of that protection in this dissenting opinion, it is clear enough that closed, opaque containers — regardless of whether they are “worthy” or are always used to store personal items — are ordinarily fully protected.  Cf. <citedDecision>Sanders, supra, at 764, n. 13</citedDecision> .  4 Here, because respondent Ross had placed the evidence in question in a closed paper bag, the container could be seized, but not searched, without a warrant.  No practical exigencies required the warrantless searches on the street or at the station: Ross had been arrested and was in custody when both searches occurred, and the police succeeded in transporting the bag to the station without inadvertently spilling its contents.  5 II In announcing its new rule, the Court purports to rely on earlier automobile search cases, especially Carroll v. United States.  The Court’s approach, however, far from being “faithful to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that the Court has followed with substantial consistency throughout our history,” ante, at 824, is plainly contrary to the letter and the spirit of our prior automobile search cases. Moreover, the new rule produces anomalous and unacceptable consequences.  *836 A The majority’s argument that its decision is supported by our decisions in Carroll and Chambers is misplaced.  The Court in Carroll upheld a warrantless search of an automobile for contraband on the basis of the impracticability of securing a warrant in cases involving the transportation of contraband goods.

 In a footnote, the majority suggests that “practical considerations” militate against securing containers found during an automobile search and taking them to the magistrate.  Ante, at 821, n. 28.  The Court confidently remarks: “[Pjrohibiting police from opening immediately a container in which the object of the search is most likely to be found and instead forcing them first to comb the entire vehicle would actually exacerbate the intrusion on privacy interests.  Moreover, until the container itself was opened the police could never be certain that the contraband was not secreted in a yet undiscovered portion of the vehicle.” Ibid. The vehicle would have to be seized while a warrant was obtained, a requirement inconsistent with Carroll and Chambers.  Ante, at 821, n. 28.  This explanation is unpersuasive.  As this Court explained in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> and as the majority today implicitly concedes, the burden to police departments of seizing a package or personal luggage simply does not compare to the burden of seizing and safeguarding automobiles.  Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 765, n. 14</citedDecision> ; ante, at 811, and n. 16.  Other aspects of the Court’s explanation are also implausible.  The search will not always require a “combing” of the entire vehicle, since police may be looking for a particular item and may discover it promptly.  If, instead, they are looking more generally for evidence of a crime, the immediate opening of the container will not protect the defendant’s privacy; whether or not it contains contraband, the police will continue to search for new evidence.  Finally, the defendant, not the police, should be afforded the choice whether he prefers the immediate opening of his suitcase or other container to the delay incident to seeking a warrant.  Cf. <citedDecision>Sanders, supra, at 764, n. 12</citedDecision> .  The more rea *839 sonable presumption, if a presumption is to replace the defendant’s consent, is surely that the immediate search of a closed container will be a greater invasion of the defendant’s privacy interests than a mere temporary seizure of the container.  8 B Finally, the majority’s new rule is theoretically unsound and will create anomalous and unwarranted results.  These consequences are readily apparent from the Court’s attempt to reconcile its new rule with the holdings of Chadwick and Sanders.  9 The Court suggests that probable cause to search only a container does not justify a warrantless search of an automobile in which it is placed, absent reason to believe that the contents could be secreted elsewhere in the vehicle.  This, the majority asserts, is an indication that the new rule is carefully limited to its justification, and is not inconsistent with Chadwick and Sanders.  But why is such a container more private, less difficult for police to seize and store, or in any other relevant respect more properly subject to the war *840 rant requirement, than a container that police discover in a probable-cause search of an entire automobile?  10 This rule plainly has peculiar and unworkable consequences: the Government “must show that the investigating officer knew enough but not too much, that he had sufficient knowledge to establish probable cause but insufficient knowledge to know exactly where the contraband was located.” 210 U. S. App. D. C. 342, 384, 655 F. 2d 1159, 1201 (1981) (en banc) (Wilkey, J., dissenting).  Alternatively, the majority may be suggesting that Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> may be explained because the connection of the container to the vehicle was incidental in these two cases. That is, because police had pre-existing probable cause to seize and search the containers, they were not entitled to wait until the item was placed in a vehicle to take advantage of the automobile exception.  Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971); 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 519-525 (1978).  I wholeheartedly agree that police cannot employ a pretext to escape Fourth Amendment prohibitions and cannot rely on an exigency that they could easily have avoided.  This interpretation, however, might well be an exception that swallows up the majority’s rule.  In neither Chadwick nor <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> did the Court suggest that the delay of the police was a pretext for taking advantage of the automobile exception.  For all that appears, the Government may have had legitimate reasons for not searching as soon as they had probable cause.  In any event, asking police to rely *841 on such an uncertain line in distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate searches for containers in automobiles hardly indicates that the majority’s approach has brought clarification to this area of the law. Ante, at 804; see Robbins, 453 U. S., at 435 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  11 I — I I — J HH The Court today ignores the clear distinction that Chadwick established between movable containers and automobiles.  It also rejects all of the relevant reasoning of <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> 12 and offers a substitute rationale that appears inconsistent with the result.  See supra, at 832.  <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> is therefore effectively overruled.  And the Court unambiguously overrules “the disposition” of Robbins, ante, at 824, though it gingerly avoids stating that it is overruling the case itself.  The only convincing explanation I discern for the majority’s broad rule is expediency: it assists police in conducting *842 automobile searches, ensuring that the private containers into which criminal suspects often place goods will no longer be a Fourth Amendment shield.  See ante, at 820.  “When a legitimate search is under way,” the Court instructs us, “nice distinctions between .  .  .

 Seizures of automobiles can be distinguished because of the greater interest of defendants in continuing possession of their means of transportation; in the case of automobiles, a seizure is more likely to be a greater intrusion than an immediate search.  See Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42, 51-52 (1970).  Both cases would appear to fall within the majority’s new rule.  In United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977), federal agents had probable cause to search a footlocker.  Although the footlocker had been placed in the trunk of a car and the occupants were about to depart, the Court refused to rely on the automobile exception to uphold the search.  (It is true that the United States did not argue in this Court that the search was justified pursuant to that exception, but the theory was hardly so novel that this Court could not have responsibly relied upon it.) In Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1979), too, the suitcase was mobile and police had probable cause to search it; it was carried in an automobile for several blocks before the automobile was stopped and the suitcase was seized and searched.  Again, however, this Court invalidated the search.  In a footnote, the Court appears to suggest a more pragmatic rationale for distinguishing Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> — that no practical problems comparable to those engendered by a general search of a vehicle would arise if the official suspicion is confined to a particular piece of luggage.  Ante, at 816, n. 21.  This suggestion is illogical.  A general search might disclose only a single item worth searching; conversely, pre-existing suspicion might attach to a number of items later placed in a car. Surely the protection of the warrant requirement cannot depend on a numerical count of the items subject to search.  Unless one of these alternative explanations is adopted, the Court’s attempt to distinguish the holdings in Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> is not only unpersuasive but appears to contradict the Court’s own theory.  The Court suggests that in each case, the connection of the container to the vehicle was simply coincidental, and notes that the police did not have probable cause to search the entire vehicle.  But the police assuredly did have probable cause to search the vehicle for the container.  The Court states that the scope of the permitted warrantless search is determined only by what a magistrate could authorize.  Ante, at 823.  Once police found that container, according to the Court’s own rule, they should have been entitled to search at least the container without a warrant.  There was probable cause to search and the car was mobile in each case. The Court suggests that it rejects “some of the reasoning in Sanders.” Ante, at 824.  But the Court in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> unambiguously stated: “[W]e hold that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies to personal luggage taken from an automobile to the same degree it applies to such luggage in other locations.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 766</citedDecision> .  The Court today instead adopts the reasoning of the opinion of The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Stevens, who refused to join the majority opinion because of the breadth of its rationale.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Of course, efficiency and promptness can never be substituted for due process and adherence to the Constitution.  Is not a dictatorship the most “efficient” form of government?  The Court purports to restrict its rule to areas that the police have probable cause to search, as “defined by the object of the search and the *843 places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.” Ante, at 824.  I agree, of course, that the probable-cause component of the automobile exception must be strictly construed.  I fear, however, that the restriction that the Court emphasizes may have little practical value.  See 210 U. S. App. D. C. 342, 351, n. 21, 655 F. 2d 1159, 1168, n. 21 (1981) (en banc).  If police open a container within a car and find contraband, they may acquire probable cause to believe that other portions of the car, and other containers within it, will contain contraband.
