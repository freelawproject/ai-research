**Dissenting Opinion**
 In other words, we need not, in the first instance, decide what the Due Process Clause forbids Nevada to do, but merely what the Full Faith and Credit Clause compels New York to do.  One of the wisest of our constitutional commentators has warned us to beware the “constricting necessitari-anism” of deeming the two questions to be one and the same: “In a problem so fraught with infelicities whatever mediation is devised, there is wisdom in confining pronouncements closely to what is imperative in the particular case. It is not logically necessary to deny Nevada’s mastery within her own boundaries in order to deny her power of projection beyond them.  Freedom of home manufacture and consumption does not necessarily entail freedom of export.  Only if it is inexorable that what is meant by ‘jurisdiction’ must be either wholly absent or wholly unlimited need frailty in sister states be conditioned on total impotence at home.” T. R. Powell, And Repent at Leisure, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 930 , 936.  Were we compelled to reach the question, I would by no means be ready to hold that Nevada, in connection with a valid divorce proceeding, had no power to adjudicate an incident so inextricably knit to the marriage status as is support.  I would agree with Judge Fuld, dissenting below, that the denial of power to Nevada rests on the “erroneous premise that a mere incident of the marital status, which ‘in itself furnishes no foundation for a cause of action’... is the equivalent of an independent right.” 1 Nor does it help to label Mrs. Vanderbilt’s claim to support a “property” right and therefore an in *430 personam, rather than an in rem, matter.  If it is due process for Nevada to adjudicate the marriage status of a domiciliary without personal service over the absent spouse (as it clearly is, see Williams v. North Carolina, I, <citedDecision>317 U. S. 287</citedDecision> ), I see no reason why Nevada cannot, at least for the purposes of her own law, also adjudicate the incidents of that status.  I do not think, however, that this forecloses the issue before us.  I revert, therefore, to what, for me, is the real question in this case: must New York respect Nevada's decree insofar as it purports to adjudicate the question of support?  The answer to this question, I think, turns squarely on an issue of New York law, namely, whether Mrs. Vanderbilt was domiciled in New York at the time of the divorce.  If Mrs. Vanderbilt was a New York domiciliary at the time of the divorce, the situation would seem to me to be as follows: New York’s law and policy is that the right of a married woman domiciled in New York to support survives an ex parte divorce, whether obtained in New York or elsewhere.  The only question under the Full Faith and Credit Clause is whether New York is compelled to disregard her own law and policy in favor of the law of Nevada on the question of the survival of support rights subsequent to an ex parte divorce.  My answer to this question is “no.” The interest of New York in her domiciliaries seems to me to be of sufficient weight to justify allowing her to apply her own' policy on the question of what effect ex parte divorces will be given as against the surviving support rights of her own domi-ciliaries.
