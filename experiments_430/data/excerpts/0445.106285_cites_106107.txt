 It said: “[W]e have no hesitation in saying that were a State affirmatively to sanction such police incursion into privacy it would run counter to the guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment.” At p. 28.  Nevertheless, after declaring that the “security of one’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police” is “implicit in 'the concept of ordered liberty’ and as such enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause,” cf. Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 (1937), and announcing that it “stoutly adhere [d]” to the Weeks decision, the Court decided that the Weeks exclusionary rule would not then be imposed upon the States as “an essential ingredient of the right.” 338 U. S., at 27-29 .  The Court’s reasons for not considering essential to the *651 right to privacy, as a curb imposed upon the States by the Due Process Clause, that which decades before had been posited as part and parcel of the Fourth Amendment’s limitation upon federal encroachment of individual privacy, were bottomed on factual considerations.  While they are not basically relevant to a decision that the exclusionary rule is an essential ingredient of the Fourth Amendment as the right it embodies is vouchsafed against the States by the Due Process Clause, we will consider the current validity of the factual grounds upon which Wolf was based.  The Court in Wolf first stated that “[t]he contrariety of views of the States” on the adoption of the exclusionary rule of Weeks was “particularly impressive” (at p. 29) ; and, in this connection, that it could not “brush aside the experience of States which deem the incidence of such conduct by the police too slight to call for a deterrent remedy ... by overriding the [States’] relevant rules of evidence.” At pp. 31-32.  While in 1949, prior to the Wolf case, almost two-thirds of the States were opposed to the use of the exclusionary rule, now, despite the Wolf case, more than half of those since passing upon it, by their own legislative or judicial decision, have wholly or partly adopted or adhered to the Weeks rule.  See Elkins v. United States, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 206</citedDecision> , Appendix, pp. 224-232 (1960).  Significantly, among those now following the rule is California, which, according to its highest court, was “compelled to reach tha(t conclusion because other remedies have completely failed to secure compliance with the constitutional provisions .  .  .  .” People v. Cohan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445 , 282 P. 2d 905, 911 (1955).  In connection with this California case, we note that the second basis elaborated in Wolf in support of its failure to enforce the exclusionary doctrine against the States was that “other means of protection” have been afforded “the *652 right to privacy.” 7 338 U. S., at 30 .  The experience of California that such other remedies have been worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other States.  The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been *653 recognized by this Court since Wolf .  See Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 137 (1954).  Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the “weighty testimony” of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13 , 150 N. E. 585 (1926).  There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the Weeks exclusionary rule in New York, had said that “[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax.” 242 N. Y., at 22 , 150 N. E., at 588 .  However, the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court. These include the recent discarding of the “silver platter” doctrine which allowed federal judicial use.  of evidence seized in violation of the Constitution by state agents, <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra; the relaxation of the formerly strict requirements as to standing to challenge the use of evidence thus seized, so that now the procedure of exclusion, “ultimately referable to constitutional safeguards;” is available to anyone even “legitimately on [the] premises” unlawfully searched, Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, 266-267 (1960); and, finally, the formulation of a method to prevent state use of evidence unconstitutionally seized by federal agents, Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 (1956).  Because there can be no fixed formula, we are admittedly met with “recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches,” but less is not to be expected when dealing with a Constitution, and, at any rate, “ [r] easonableness is in the first instance for the [trial court] ... to determine.” United States v. Rabinowits, 339 U. S. 56, 63 (1950).  It, therefore, plainly appears that the factual considerations supporting the failure of the Wolf Court to include the Weeks exclusionary rule when it recognized the enforceability of the right to privacy against the States in 1949, while not basically relevant to the constitutional consideration, could not, in any analysis, now be deemed controlling.  *654 III. Some five years after Wolf , in answer to a plea made here Term after Term that we overturn its doctrine on applicability of the Weeks exclusionary rule, this Court indicated that such should not be done until the States had “adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the [Weeks] rule.” Irvine v. California, supra, at 134 .  There again it was said: “Never until June of 1949 did this Court hold the basic search-and-seizure prohibition in any way applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Ibid. And only last Term, after again carefully re-examining the Wolf doctrine in <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, the Court pointed out that “the controlling principles” as to search and seizure and the problem of admissibility “seemed clear” (at p. 212) until the announcement in Wolf “that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not itself require state courts to adopt the exclusionary rule” of the Weeks case. At p. 213.  At the same time, the Court pointed out, “the underlying constitutional doctrine which Wolf established .  .  .  that the Federal Constitution .  .  .
**Lead Opinion**
 We hold that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, 'inadmissible in a state court. IV. Since the Fourth Amendment's right of privacy has been declared enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth, it is enforceable against them by the same sanction of exclusion as is used against the Federal Government.  Were it otherwise, then just as without the Weeks rule the assurance against unreasonable federal searches and seizures would be “a form of words,” valueless and undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of inestimable human liberties, so too, without that rule the freedom from state invasions of privacy would be so ephemeral and so neatly severed from its conceptual nexus with the freedom from all brutish means of coercing evidence as not to merit this Court’s high regard as a freedom “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” At the time that the Court held in Wolf that the Amendment was applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause, the cases of this Court, as we have seen, had steadfastly held that as.  to federal officers the Fourth Amendment included the exclusion of the evidence seized in violation of its provisions.  Even Wolf “stoutly adhered” to that proposition.  The right to privacy, when conceded operatively enforceable against the States, was not susceptible of destruction by avulsion of the sanction upon which its protection and enjoyment had always been deemed dependent under the Boyd, Weeks and Silverthorne cases. Therefore, in extending the substantive protections of due process to all constitutionally unreasonable searches — state or federal — it was *656 logically and constitutionally necessary that the exclusion doctrine — an essential part of the right to privacy — be also insisted upon as an essential ingredient of the right newly recognized by the Wolf case. In short, the admission of the new constitutional right by Wolf could not consistently tolerate denial of its most important constitutional privilege, namely, the exclusion of the evidence which an accused had been forced to give by reason of the unlawful seizure.  To hold otherwise is to grant the right but in reality to withhold its privilege and enjoyment.  Only last year the Court itself recognized that the purpose of the exclusionary rule “is to deter — to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way — by removing the incentive to disregard it.” <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 217.  Indeed, we are aware of no restraint, similar to that rejected today, conditioning the enforcement of any other basic constitutional right.  The right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and particularly reserved to the people, would stand in marked contrast to all other rights declared as “basic to a free society.” Wolf v. Colorado, supra, at 27 .  This Court has not hesitated to enforce as strictly against the States as it does against the Federal Government the rights of free speech and of a free press, the rights to notice and to a fair, public trial, including, as it does, the right not to be convicted by use of a coerced confession, however logically relevant it be, and without regard to its reliability.  Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534 (1961).  And nothing could be more certain than that when a coerced confession is involved, “the relevant rules of evidence” are overridden without regard to “the incidence of such conduct by the police,” slight or frequent.  Why should not the sanie rule apply to what is tantamount to coerced testimony by way of unconstitutional seizure of goods, papers, effects, documents, etc.?

 The philosophy of each Amendment and of each freedom is complementary to, although not dependent upon, that of the other in its sphere of influence — the very least that together they assure in either sphere is that no man is to be convicted on unconstitutional evidence.  Cf. Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 173 (1952).  Y. Moreover, our holding that the exclusionary rule is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments is not only the logical dictate of prior cases, but it also makes very good sense.  There is no war between the Constitution and common sense.  Presently, a federal prosecutor may make no use of evidence illegally seized, but a State’s attorney across the street may, although he supposedly is operating under the enforceable prohibitions of the same Amendment.  Thus the State, by admitting evidence unlawfully seized, serves to encourage disobedience to the Federal Constitution which it is bound to uphold.  Moreover, as was said in <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> , “[t'Jhe very essence of a healthy federalism depends upon the avoidance of needless conflict between *658 state and federal courts.” <citedDecision>364 U. S., at 221</citedDecision> .  Such a conflict, hereafter needless, arose this very Term, in Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U. S. 381 (1961), in which, and in spite of the promise made by Rea , we gave full recognition to our practice in this regard by refusing to restrain a federal officer from testifying in a state court as to evidence unconstitutionally seized by him in the performance of his duties.  Yet the double standard recognized until today hardly put such a thesis into practice.  In non-exclusionary States, federal officers, being human, were by it invited to and did, as our cases indicate, step across the street to the State’s attorney with their unconstitutionally seized evidence.  Prosecution on the basis of that evidence was then had in a state court in utter disregard of the enforceable Fourth Amendment.  If the fruits of an unconstitutional search had been inadmissible in both state and federal courts, this inducement to evasion would have been sooner eliminated.  There would be no need to reconcile such cases as Rea and Schnettler , each pointing up the hazardous uncertainties of our heretofore ambivalent approach.  Federal-state cooperation in the solution of crime under constitutional standards will be promoted, if only by recognition of their now mutual obligation to respect the same fundamental criteria in their approaches.  “However much in a particular case insistence upon such rules may appear as a technicality that inures to the benefit of a guilty person, the history of the criminal law proves that tolerance of shortcut methods in law enforcement impairs its enduring effectiveness.” Miller v. United States, 357 U. S. 301, 313 (1958).  Denying shortcuts to only one of two cooperating law enforcement agencies tends naturally to breed legitimate suspicion of “working arrangements” whose results are equally tainted.  Byars v. United States, 273 U. S. 28 (1927); Lustig v. United States, 338 U. S. 74 (1949).  *659 There are those who say, as did Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, that under our constitutional exclusionary doctrine “[t]he criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered.” People v. Defore, 242 N. Y., at 21 , 150 N. E., at 587 , In some cases this will undoubtedly be the result.  9 But, as was said in <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> , “there is another consideration — the imperative of judicial integrity.” <citedDecision>364 U. S., at 222</citedDecision> .  The criminal goes free, if he must, but it is the law that sets him free. Nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the chartei of its own existence.  As Mr. Justice Brandéis, dissenting, said in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 485 (1928): “Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.  ... If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.” Nor can it lightly be assumed that, as a practical matter, adoption of the exclusionary rule fetters law enforcement.  Only last year this Court expressly considered that contention and found that “pragmatic evidence of a sort” to the contrary was not wanting.  <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 218.  The Court noted that “The federal courts themselves have operated under the exclusionary rule of Weeks for almost half a cen *660 tury; yet it has not been suggested.  either that the Federal Bureau of Investigation 10 has thereby been rendered ineffective, or that the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts has thereby been disrupted.  Moreover, the experience of the states is impressive.  .  .  .

**Concurrence Opinion**
*661 Mr. Justice Black, concurring. For nearly fifty years, since the decision of this Court in Weeks v. United States, 1 federal courts have refused to permit the introduction into evidence against an accused of his papers and effects obtained by “unreasonable searches and seizures” in violation of the Fourth Amendment. In Wolf v. Colorado, decided in 1948, however, this Court held that “in a prosecution in a State court for a State crime the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure.” 2 I concurred in that holding on these grounds: “For reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in Adam-son v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 68 , I agree with the conclusion of the Court that the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition of 'unreasonable searches and seizures’ is enforceable against the states. Consequently, I should be for reversal of this case if I thought the Fourth Amendment not only prohibited 'unreasonable searches and seizures,’ but also, of itself, barred the use of evidence so unlawfully obtained. But I agree with what appears to be a plain implication of the Court’s opinion that the federal exclusionary rule is not a command of the Fourth Amendment but is a judicially created rule of evidence which Congress might negate.” 3 1 am still not persuaded that the Fourth Amendment, standing alone, would be enough to bar the introduction into evidence against an accused of papers and effects seized from him in violation of its commands. For the Fourth Amendment does not itself contain any provision expressly precluding the use of such evidence, and I am *662 extremely doubtful that such a provision could properly be inferred from nothing more than the basic command against unreasonable searches and seizures. Reflection on the problem, however, in the light of cases coming before the Court since Wolf, has led me to conclude that when the Fourth Amendment’s ban against unreasonable searches and seizures is considered together with the Fifth Amendment’s ban against compelled self-incrimination, a constitutional basis emerges which not only justifies but actually requires the exclusionary rule. The close interrelationship between the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, as they apply to this problem, 4 has long been recognized and, indeed, was expressly made the ground for this Court’s holding in Boyd v. United States. 5 There the Court fully discussed this relationship and declared itself “unable to perceive that the seizure of a man’s private books and papers to be used in evidence against him is substantially different from compelling him to be a witness against himself.” 6 It was upon this ground that Mr. Justice Rutledge largely relied in his dissenting opinion in the Wolf case. 7 And, although I rejected the argument at that time, its force has, for me at least, become compelling with the more thorough understanding of the problem brought on by recent cases. In the final analysis, it seems to me that the Boyd doctrine, though perhaps not required by the express language of the Constitution strictly construed, is amply justified from an historical standpoint, soundly based in reason, *663 and entirely consistent with what I regard to be the proper approach to interpretation of our Bill of Rights — an approach well set out by Mr. Justice Bradley in the Boyd case: “[Constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed. A close and literal construction deprives them of half their efficacy, and leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if it consisted more in sound than in substance. It is the duty of the courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.” 8 The case of Rochin v. California , 9 which we decided three years after the Wolf case, authenticated, I think, the soundness of Mr. Justice Bradley’s and Mr. Justice Rutledge’s reliance upon the interrelationship between the Fourth and Fifth Amendments as requiring the exclusion of unconstitutionally seized evidence. In the Rochin case, three police officers, acting with neither a judicial warrant nor probable cause, entered Rochin’s home for the purpose of conducting a search and broke down the door to a bedroom occupied by Rochin and his wife. Upon their entry into the room, the officers saw Rochin pick up and swallow two small capsules. They immediately seized him and^ took him in handcuffs to a hospital where the capsules *664 were recovered by use of a stomach pump. Investigation showed that the capsules contained morphine and evidence of that fact was made the basis of his conviction of a crime in a state court. When the question of the validity of that conviction was brought here, we were presented with an almost perfect example of the interrelationship between the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Indeed, every member of this Court who participated in the decision of that case recognized this interrelationship and relied on it, to some extent at least, as justifying reversal of Rochin’s conviction. The majority, though careful not to mention the Fifth Amendment’s provision that “[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,” showed at least that it was not unaware that such a provision exists, stating: “Coerced confessions offend the community’s sense of fair play and decency. ... It would be a stultification of the responsibility which the course of constitutional history has cast upon this Court to hold that in order to convict a man the police cannot extract by force what is in his mind but can extract what is in his stomach.” 10 The methods used by the police thus were, according to the majority, “too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation,” 11 and the case was reversed on the ground that these methods had violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that the treatment accorded Rochin was of a kind that “shocks the conscience,” “offend [s] ‘a sense of justice’ ” and fails to “respect certain decencies of civilized conduct.” 12 I concurred in the reversal of the Rochin case, but on the ground that the Fourteenth Amendment made the Fifth Amendment’s provision against self-incrimination *665 applicable to the States and that, given a broad rather than a narrow construction, that provision barred the introduction of this “capsule” evidence just as much as it would have forbidden the use of words Rochin might have been coerced to speak. 13 In reaching this conclusion I cited and relied on the Boyd case, the constitutional doctrine of which was, of course, necessary to my disposition of the case. At that time, however, these views were very definitely in the minority for only Mr. Justice Douglas and I rejected the flexible and uncertain standards of the “shock-the-conscience test” used in the majority opinion. 14 Two years after Rochin, in Irvine v. California, 15 we were again called upon to consider the validity of a conviction based on evidence which had been obtained in a manner clearly unconstitutional and arguably shocking to the conscience. The five opinions written by this Court in that case demonstrate the utter confusion and uncertainty that had been brought about by the Wolf and Rochin decisions. In concurring, Mr. Justice Clark emphasized the unsatisfactory nature of the Court’s “shock-the-conscience test,” saying that this “test” “makes for such uncertainty and unpredictability that it would be impossible to foretell — other than by' guesswork — just how brazen the invasion of the intimate privacies of one’s home must be in order to shock itself into the protective arms of the Constitution. In truth, the practical result of this ad hoc approach is simply that when five Justices are sufficiently revolted by local police action, a conviction is overturned and a guilty man may go free.” 16 *666 Only one thing emerged with complete clarity from the Irvine case — that is that seven Justices rejected the “shock-the-conscienee” constitutional standard enunciated in the Wolf and Rochin cases. But even this did not lessen the confusion in this area of the law because the continued existence of mutually inconsistent precedents together with the Court’s inability to settle upon a majority opinion in the Irvine case left the situation at least as uncertain as it had been before. 17 Finally, today, we clear up that uncertainty. As I understand the Court’s opinion in this case, we again reject the confusing “shock-the-conseience” standard of the Wolf and Rochin cases and, instead, set aside this state conviction in reliance upon the precise, intelligible and more predictable constitutional doctrine enunciated in the Boyd case. I fully agree with Mr. Justice Bradley’s opinion that the two Amendments upon which the Boyd doctrine rests are of vital importance in our constitutional scheme of liberty and that both are entitled to a liberal rather than a niggardly interpretation. The courts of the country are entitled to know with as much certainty as possible what scope they cover. The Court’s opinion, in my judgment, dissipates the doubt and uncertainty in this field of constitutional law and I am persuaded, for this and other reasons stated, to depart from my prior views, to accept the Boyd doctrine as controlling in this state case and to join the Court’s judgment and opinion which are in accordance with that constitutional doctrine. 232 U. S. 383 , decided in 1914. 338 U. S. 25, 33 . Id., at 39-40 . The interrelationship between the Fourth and the Fifth Amendments in this area does not, of course, justify a narrowing in the interpretation of either of these Amendments with respect to areas in which they operate separately.

In the latter case, decided in 1954, Mr. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority, said (at p. 134): “We think that the Wolf decision should not be overruled, for the reasons so persuasively stated therein.” Compare Schwartz v. Texas, 344 U. S. 199 , and Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 , in which the Wolf case was discussed and in no way disapproved.  And see Pugach v. Dollinger, 365 U. S. 458 , which relied on Schwartz .  Actually, only four members of the majority support this reasoning.  See pp. 685-686, infra.  Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; Elkins v. United States, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 206</citedDecision> ; Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253 .  My Brother Stewart concurs in the Court’s judgment on grounds which have nothing to do with Wolf .
**Combined Opinion**
 The Court in Wolf first stated that "[t]he contrariety of views of the States" on the adoption of the exclusionary rule of Weeks was "particularly impressive" (at p. 29); and, in this connection, that it could not "brush aside the experience of States which deem the incidence of such conduct by the police too slight to call for a deterrent remedy .  .  .  by overriding the [States'] relevant rules of evidence." At pp. 31-32.  While in 1949, prior to the Wolf case, almost two-thirds of the States were opposed to the use of the exclusionary rule, now, despite the Wolf case, more than half of those since passing upon it, by their own legislative or judicial decision, have wholly or partly adopted or adhered to the Weeks rule.  See Elkins v. United States, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 206</citedDecision> , Appendix, pp. 224-232 (1960).  Significantly, among those now following the rule is California, which, according to its highest court, was "compelled to reach that conclusion because other remedies have completely failed to secure compliance with the constitutional provisions .  .  .  ." People v. Cahan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445 , 282 P. 2d 905, 911 (1955).  In connection with this California case, we note that the second basis elaborated in Wolf in support of its failure to enforce the exclusionary doctrine against the States was that "other means of protection" have been afforded "the *652 right to privacy."
**Combined Opinion**
 The experience of California that such other remedies have been worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other States.  The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been *653 recognized by this Court since Wolf .  See Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 137 (1954).  Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the "weighty testimony" of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13 , 150 N. E. 585 (1926).  There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the Weeks exclusionary rule in New York, had said that "[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax." 242 N. Y., at 22 , 150 N. E., at 588 .  However, the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court. These include the recent discarding of the "silver platter" doctrine which allowed federal judicial use of evidence seized in violation of the Constitution by state agents, <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra ; the relaxation of the formerly strict requirements as to standing to challenge the use of evidence thus seized, so that now the procedure of exclusion, "ultimately referable to constitutional safeguards," is available to anyone even "legitimately on [the] premises" unlawfully searched, Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, 266-267 (1960); and, finally, the formulation of a method to prevent state use of evidence unconstitutionally seized by federal agents, Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 (1956).  Because there can be no fixed formula, we are admittedly met with "recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches," but less is not to be expected when dealing with a Constitution, and, at any rate, "[r]easonableness is in the first instance for the [trial court] .  .  .  to determine." United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56, 63 (1950).  It, therefore, plainly appears that the factual considerations supporting the failure of the Wolf Court to include the Weeks exclusionary rule when it recognized the enforceability of the right to privacy against the States in 1949, while not basically relevant to the constitutional consideration, could not, in any analysis, now be deemed controlling.  *654 III. Some five years after Wolf , in answer to a plea made here Term after Term that we overturn its doctrine on applicability of the Weeks exclusionary rule, this Court indicated that such should not be done until the States had "adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the [ Weeks ] rule." Irvine v. California, supra, at 134 .  There again it was said: "Never until June of 1949 did this Court hold the basic search-and-seizure prohibition in any way applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment." Ibid. And only last Term, after again carefully re-examining the Wolf doctrine in <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra , the Court pointed out that "the controlling principles" as to search and seizure and the problem of admissibility "seemed clear" (at p. 212) until the announcement in Wolf "that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not itself require state courts to adopt the exclusionary rule" of the Weeks case. At p. 213.  At the same time, the Court pointed out, "the underlying constitutional doctrine which Wolf established .  .  .  that the Federal Constitution .  .  .

 Were it otherwise, then just as without the Weeks rule the assurance against unreasonable federal searches and seizures would be "a form of words," valueless and undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of inestimable human liberties, so too, without that rule the freedom from state invasions of privacy would be so ephemeral and so neatly severed from its conceptual nexus with the freedom from all brutish means of coercing evidence as not to merit this Court's high regard as a freedom "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty." At the time that the Court held in Wolf that the Amendment was applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause, the cases of this Court, as we have seen, had steadfastly held that as to federal officers the Fourth Amendment included the exclusion of the evidence seized in violation of its provisions.  Even Wolf "stoutly adhered" to that proposition.  The right to privacy, when conceded operatively enforceable against the States, was not susceptible of destruction by avulsion of the sanction upon which its protection and enjoyment had always been deemed dependent under the Boyd, Weeks and Silverthorne cases. Therefore, in extending the substantive protections of due process to all constitutionally unreasonable searchesstate or federalit was *656 logically and constitutionally necessary that the exclusion doctrinean essential part of the right to privacybe also insisted upon as an essential ingredient of the right newly recognized by the Wolf case. In short, the admission of the new constitutional right by Wolf could not consistently tolerate denial of its most important constitutional privilege, namely, the exclusion of the evidence which an accused had been forced to give by reason of the unlawful seizure.  To hold otherwise is to grant the right but in reality to withhold its privilege and enjoyment.  Only last year the Court itself recognized that the purpose of the exclusionary rule "is to deterto compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available wayby removing the incentive to disregard it." <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 217.  Indeed, we are aware of no restraint, similar to that rejected today, conditioning the enforcement of any other basic constitutional right.  The right to privacy, no less important than any other right carefully and particularly reserved to the people, would stand in marked contrast to all other rights declared as "basic to a free society." Wolf v. Colorado, supra, at 27 .  This Court has not hesitated to enforce as strictly against the States as it does against the Federal Government the rights of free speech and of a free press, the rights to notice and to a fair, public trial, including, as it does, the right not to be convicted by use of a coerced confession, however logically relevant it be, and without regard to its reliability.  Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534 (1961).  And nothing could be more certain than that when a coerced confession is involved, "the relevant rules of evidence" are overridden without regard to "the incidence of such conduct by the police," slight or frequent.
**Combined Opinion**
 The philosophy of each Amendment and of each freedom is complementary to, although not dependent upon, that of the other in its sphere of influencethe very least that together they assure in either sphere is that no man is to be convicted on unconstitutional evidence.  Cf. Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 173 (1952).  V. Moreover, our holding that the exclusionary rule is an essential part of both the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments is not only the logical dictate of prior cases, but it also makes very good sense.  There is no war between the Constitution and common sense.  Presently, a federal prosecutor may make no use of evidence illegally seized, but a State's attorney across the street may, although he supposedly is operating under the enforceable prohibitions of the same Amendment.  Thus the State, by admitting evidence unlawfully seized, serves to encourage disobedience to the Federal Constitution which it is bound to uphold.  Moreover, as was said in <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> , "[t]he very essence of a healthy federalism depends upon the avoidance of needless conflict between *658 state and federal courts." <citedDecision>364 U. S., at 221</citedDecision> .  Such a conflict, hereafter needless, arose this very Term, in Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U. S. 381 (1961), in which, and in spite of the promise made by Rea , we gave full recognition to our practice in this regard by refusing to restrain a federal officer from testifying in a state court as to evidence unconstitutionally seized by him in the performance of his duties.  Yet the double standard recognized until today hardly put such a thesis into practice.  In non-exclusionary States, federal officers, being human, were by it invited to and did, as our cases indicate, step across the street to the State's attorney with their unconstitutionally seized evidence.  Prosecution on the basis of that evidence was then had in a state court in utter disregard of the enforceable Fourth Amendment.  If the fruits of an unconstitutional search had been inadmissible in both state and federal courts, this inducement to evasion would have been sooner eliminated.  There would be no need to reconcile such cases as Rea and Schnettler , each pointing up the hazardous uncertainties of our heretofore ambivalent approach.

Miller v. United States, 357 U. S. 301, 313 (1958).  Denying shortcuts to only one of two cooperating law enforcement agencies tends naturally to breed legitimate suspicion of "working arrangements" whose results are equally tainted.  Byars v. United States, 273 U. S. 28 (1927); Lustig v. United States, 338 U. S. 74 (1949).  *659 There are those who say, as did Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, that under our constitutional exclusionary doctrine "[t]he criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered." People v. Defore, 242 N. Y., at 21 , 150 N. E., at 587 .  In some cases this will undoubtedly be the result.  [9] But, as was said in <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> , "there is another considerationthe imperative of judicial integrity." <citedDecision>364 U. S., at 222</citedDecision> .  The criminal goes free, if he must, but it is the law that sets him free. Nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the charter of its own existence.  As Mr. Justice Brandeis, dissenting, said in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 485 (1928): "Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.  .  .  .  If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy." Nor can it lightly be assumed that, as a practical matter, adoption of the exclusionary rule fetters law enforcement.  Only last year this Court expressly considered that contention and found that "pragmatic evidence of a sort" to the contrary was not wanting.  <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 218.  The Court noted that "The federal courts themselves have operated under the exclusionary rule of Weeks for almost half a century; *660 yet it has not been suggested either that the Federal Bureau of Investigation [10] has thereby been rendered ineffective, or that the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts has thereby been disrupted.  Moreover, the experience of the states is impressive.  .  .  .  The movement towards the rule of exclusion has been halting but seemingly inexorable."

 All of this material, appellantand a friend of herssaid were odds and ends belonging to a recent boarder, a man who had left suddenly for New York and had been detained there.  As the Supreme Court of Ohio read the statute under which appellant is charged, she is guilty of the crime whichever story is true.  The Ohio Supreme Court sustained the conviction even though it was based on the documents obtained in the lawless search.  For in Ohio evidence obtained by an unlawful search and seizure is admissible in a criminal prosecution at least where it was not taken from the "defendant's person by the use of brutal or offensive force against defendant." State v. Mapp, 170 Ohio St. 427 , 166 N. E. 2d, at 388, syllabus 2; State v. Lindway, 131 Ohio St. 166 , 2 N. E. 2d 490 .  This evidence would have been inadmissible in a federal prosecution.  Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 ; Elkins v. United States, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 206</citedDecision> .  For, as stated in the former decision, "The effect of the Fourth Amendment is to put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints .  .  .  ." Id., 391-392.  It was therefore held that evidence obtained (which in that case was documents and correspondence) from a home without any warrant was not admissible in a federal prosecution.

 338 U. S. 42 -44.  The truth is that trespass actions against officers who make unlawful searches and seizures are mainly illusory remedies.  Without judicial action making the exclusionary rule applicable to the States, Wolf v. Colorado in practical effect reduced the guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures to "a dead letter," as Mr. Justice Rutledge said in his dissent.  See 338 U. S., at 47.  Wolf v. Colorado, supra , was decided in 1949.  The immediate result was a storm of constitutional controversy which only today finds its end.  I believe that this is an appropriate case in which to put an end to the asymmetry which Wolf imported into the law. See *671 Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 ; Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra ; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 .  It is an appropriate case because the facts it presents showas would few other cases the casual arrogance of those who have the untrammelled power to invade one's home and to seize one's person.  It is also an appropriate case in the narrower and more technical sense.  The issues of the illegality of the search and the admissibility of the evidence have been presented to the state court and were duly raised here in accordance with the applicable Rule of Practice.  [4] The question was raised in the notice of appeal, the jurisdictional statement and in appellant's brief on the merits.  [5] It is true that argument was mostly directed to another issue in the case, but that is often the fact.  See Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 535-540 .  Of course, an earnest advocate of a position always believes that, had he only an additional opportunity for argument, his side would win. But, subject to the sound discretion of a court, all argument must at last come to a halt.  This is especially so as to an issue about which this Court said last year that "The arguments of its antagonists and of its proponents have been so many times marshalled as to require no lengthy elaboration here." <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, 216.  Moreover, continuance of Wolf v. Colorado in its full vigor breeds the unseemly shopping around of the kind revealed in Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U. S. 381 .  Once evidence, inadmissible in a federal court, is admissible in *672 a state court a "double standard" exists which, as the Court points out, leads to "working arrangements" that undercut federal policy and reduce some aspects of law enforcement to shabby business.  The rule that supports that practice does not have the force of reason behind it.  Memorandum of MR. JUSTICE STEWART.  Agreeing fully with Part I of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN'S dissenting opinion, I express no view as to the merits of the constitutional issue which the Court today decides.  I would, however, reverse the judgment in this case, because I am persuaded that the provision of § 2905.34 of the Ohio Revised Code, upon which the petitioner's conviction was based, is, in the words of MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, not "consistent with the rights of free thought and expression assured against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment."

[9]  As is always the case, however, state procedural requirements governing assertion and pursuance of direct and collateral constitutional challenges to criminal prosecutions must be respected.

 In the latter case, decided in 1954, Mr. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority, said (at p. 134): "We think that the Wolf decision should not be overruled, for the reasons so persuasively stated therein." Compare Schwartz v. Texas.  344 U. S. 199 , and Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 , in which the Wolf case was discussed and in no way disapproved.  And see Pugach v. Dollinger, 365 U. S. 458 , which relied on Schwartz .  [10]  Actually, only four members of the majority support this reasoning.  See pp. 685-686, infra.  [11] Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; Elkins v.
