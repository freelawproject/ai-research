**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Blackmun, concurring in the result.  I concur in the result.  The conclusion the Court reaches is not unexpected when one notes the extraordinary expansion of the concept of habeas corpus effected in recent years.  See Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S. 546 (1941); Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283 (1944); Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963); Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968); Carajus v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234 (1968); Nelson v. George, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 224</citedDecision> (1970).  Cf. Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U. S. 487 (1971).  A trend of this kind, once begun, easily assumes startling proportions.  The present case is but one more step, with the Alabama warden now made the agent of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  I do not go so far as to say that on the facts of this case the result is necessarily wrong.  I merely point out that we have come a long way from the traditional notions of the Great Writ.  The common-law scholars of the past hardly would recognize what the Court has developed, see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *131-134, and they would, I suspect, conclude that it is not for the better.
