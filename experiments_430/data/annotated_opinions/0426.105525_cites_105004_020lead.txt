 See, e. g., Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 100-102; Davis, Military Law (3d ed. 1915), 478-479; Dudley, Military Law and the Procedures of Courts-Martial (2d ed. 1908), 413-414; 14 Op. Atty. Gen. 22; 16 id., 48; Dig. Op. JAG (1912) 151; id. (1901) 56, 563; id. (1895) 76, 325-326, 599-600; id. (1880) 49, 211, 384.  Cf. Walker v. Chief Quarantine Officer, 69 F. Supp. 980, 987 .  Article 2 (10) of the UCMJ, 50 U. S. C. § 552 (10), provides that in time of war persons serving with or accompanying the armed forces in the field are subject to court-martial and military law. We believe that Art. 2 (10) sets forth the maximum historically recognized extent of military jurisdiction over civilians under the concept of “in the field.” The Government does not attempt — and quite appropriately so — to support military jurisdiction over Mrs. Smith or Mrs. Covert under Art. 2 (10).  Even during time of war the Constitution must be observed.  Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, at 120 , declares: “The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances.  No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.” Also see Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., 251 U. S. 146, 156 ; United States v. Commodities Trading Corp., 339 U. S. 121, 125 .  Madsen v. Kinsella, <citedDecision>343 U. S. 341</citedDecision> , is not controlling here.  It concerned trials in enemy territory which had been conquered and held by force of arms and which was being governed at the time by our military forces.  In such areas the Army commander can establish military or civilian commissions as an arm of the occupation to try everyone in the occupied area, whether they are connected with the Army or not.

R. 4080, 81st Cong., 1st Sess.; Beets v. Hunter, 75 F. Supp. 825 , rev’d on other grounds, 180 F. 2d 101 , cert. denied, 339 U. S. 963 ; Shapiro v. United States, 107 Ct. Cl. 650, 69 F. Supp. 205 .

The officer who convenes the court-martial also has final authority to determine whether charges will be brought in the first place and to pick the board of inquiry, the prosecutor, the defense counsel, and the law officer who serves as legal adviser to the court-martial.
