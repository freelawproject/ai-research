<p id="b99-6">The Court’s opinion manifests a natural difficulty in reaching its conclusion. Constitutional issues are likely to arise whenever Congress draws on the taxing power not to raise revenue but to regulate conduct. This is so, of course, because of the distribution of legislative power as between the Congress and the State Legislatures in the regulation of conduct.</p>
<p id="b99-7">To review in detail the decisions of this Court, beginning with <em>Veazie Bank </em>v. <em>Fenno, </em>8 Wall. 533, dealing with this ambivalent type of revenue enactment, would be to rehash the familiar. Two generalizations may, however, safely be drawn from this series of cases. Congress may make an oblique use of the taxing power in relation to activities with which Congress may deal directly, as for instance, commerce between the States. Thus, if the dissenting views of Mr. Justice Holmes in <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Dagenhart, </em>247 U. S. 251, 277, had been the decision of the Court, as they became in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Darby, </em>312 U. S. 100, the effort to deal with the problem of child labor through an assertion of the taxing power <page-number citation-index="1" label="38">*38</page-number>in the statute considered in <em>Child Labor Tax Case, </em>259 U. S. 20, would by the latter case have been sustained. However, when oblique use is made of the taxing power as to matters which substantively are not within the powers delegated to Congress, the Court cannot shut its eyes to what is obviously, because designedly, an attempt to control conduct which the Constitution left to the responsibility of the States, merely because Congress wrapped the legislation in the verbal cellophane of a revenue measure.</p>
<p id="b100-4">Concededly the constitutional questions presented by such legislation are difficult. On the one hand, courts should scrupulously abstain from hobbling congressional choice of policies, particularly when the vast reach of the taxing power is concerned. On the other hand, to allow what otherwise is excluded from congressional authority to be brought within it by casting legislation in the form of a revenue measure could, as so significantly expounded in the <em>Child Labor Tax Case, supra, </em>offer an easy way for the legislative ■ imagination to control “any one of the great number of subjects of public interest, jurisdiction of which the States have never parted with . . . .” <em>Child Labor Tax Case, </em>at 38. I say “significantly” because Mr. Justice Holmes and two of the Justices who had joined his dissent in <em>Hammer </em>v. <em>Dagenhart, </em>McKenna and Brandeis, JJ., agreed with the opinion in the <em>Child Labor Tax Case. </em>Issues of such gravity affecting the balance of powers within our federal system are not susceptible of comprehensive statement by smooth formulas such as that a tax is nonetheless a tax although it discourages the activities taxed, or that a tax may be imposed although it may effect ulterior ends. No such phrase, however fine and well-worn, enables one to decide the concrete case.</p>
<p id="b100-5">What is relevant to judgment here is that, even if the history of this legislation as it went through Congress <page-number citation-index="1" label="39">*39</page-number>did not give one the libretto to the song, the context of the circumstances which brought forth this enactment — sensationally exploited disclosures regarding gambling in big cities and small, the relation of this gambling to corrupt politics, the impatient public response to these disclosures, the feeling of ineptitude or paralysis on the part of local law-enforcing agencies — emphatically supports what was revealed on the floor of Congress, namely, that what was formally a means of raising revenue for the Federal Government was essentially an effort to check if not to stamp out professional gambling.</p>
<p id="b101-6">A nominal taxing measure must be found an inadmissible intrusion into a domain of legislation reserved for the States not merely when Congress requires that such a measure is to be enforced through a detailed scheme of administration beyond the obvious fiscal needs, as in the <em>Child Labor Tax Case, supra. </em>That is one ground for holding that Congress was constitutionally disrespectful of what is reserved to the States. Another basis for deeming such a formal revenue measure inadmissible is presented by this case. In addition to the fact that Congress was concerned with activity beyond the authority of the Federal Government, the enforcing provision of this enactment is designed for the systematic confession of crimes with a view to prosecution for such crimes under State law.</p>
<p id="b101-7">It is one thing to hold that the exception, which the Fifth Amendment makes to the duty of a witness to give his testimony when relevant to a proceeding in a federal court, does not include the potential danger to that witness of possible prosecution in a State court, <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>161 U. S. 591, 606, and, conversely, that the Fifth Amendment does not enable States to give immunity from use in federal courts of testimony given in a State court. <em>Feldman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>322 U. S. 487. <page-number citation-index="1" label="40">*40</page-number>It is a wholly different thing to hold that Congress, which cannot constitutionally grapple directly with gambling in the States, may compel self-incriminating disclosures for the enforcement of State gambling laws, merely because it does so under the guise of a revenue measure obviously passed not for revenue purposes. The motive of congressional legislation is not for our scrutiny, provided only that the ulterior purpose is not expressed in ways which negative what the revenue words on their face express and which do not seek enforcement of the formal revenue purpose through means that offend those standards of decency in our civilization against which due process is a barrier.</p>
<p id="b102-4">I would affirm this judgment.</p>
<judges id="b102-5">Mr. Justice Douglas, while not joining in the entire opinion, agrees with the views expressed herein that this tax is an attempt by the Congress to control conduct which the Constitution has left to the responsibility of the States.</judges>
