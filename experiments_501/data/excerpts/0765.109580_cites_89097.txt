 This relationship, at this particular point of the marginal sea, is too close to the vital interest of the Nation in its own boundaries to allow it to be governed by any law but the 'supreme Law of the Land.’ ” 389 U. S., at 293 .  We are fortified in our conclusion that Bonelli’s equal-footing analysis was unsound by the fact that its author has likewise rejected it.  The dissenting opinion of our Brother Marshall, post, p. 382, would sustain the result reached in Bonelli but on a ground explicitly avoided in the Bonelli opinion.  The "mystery” or "puzzle” to which our Brother refers, post, at 384, turns out to be nonexistent; in rejecting Bonelli’s equal-footing analysis, we are simply refusing to be more Roman than the Romans.  The dissent’s own abandonment of Bonelli’s ratio decidendi is anything but a ringing endorsement of the rule of stare decisis.  We think that the insistence of our dissenting Brethren that “federal common law” should be applied to a determination of title in this case, albeit not for the same reason expounded in Bonelli, misapprehends the meaning and significance of the term “common law” as it is used in several of our old cases. In the generic sense of the term, the “common law” has been defined as: “ ‘the body of those principles and rules of action, relating to the government and security of persons and property, which derive their authority solely from usages and customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts recognizing, affirming and enforcing such usages and customs; and, in this sense, particularly the ancient unwritten law of England.’ ” Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Call Pub. Co., 181 U. S. 92, 102 (1901) (citing Black’s Law Dictionary).  It is in this descriptive sense that the term is used in the two principal quotations relied upon in the dissenting opinion, New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 , 717 (1836), and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, <citedDecision>23 Wall. 46, 68</citedDecision> (1874).  In the passage from New Orleans , the Court *381 simply summarized the accepted British common-law doctrine of accretion.  In <citedDecision>Lovingston</citedDecision> , the Court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois which had rested upon the proper rule of common law, without any indication that this rule was not the law of Illinois.  In light of the treatment of the subject in such later cases as Barney v. Keokuk, Packer v. Bird, Shively v. Bowlby , and Joy v. St. Louis , all discussed in the text, no “rule” requiring the application of “federal common law” to questions of riparian ownership may be deduced from New Orleans and <citedDecision>Lovingston</citedDecision> .  See post, at 387-388.

 It is undisputed that “the quality of being riparian” is perhaps “the land’s 'most valuable feature’ and is part and parcel of the ownership of the land itself.” Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 414 U. S., at 326 , quoting Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S., at 293 .  Cf. New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 , 717 (1836), In the natural course, however, a riparian boundary tends to move, a fact reflected in the common-law doctrines of accretion, avulsion, erosion, and reliction.  Prior to today’s ruling, federal grantees of riparian land, and holders under them, correctly understood that their titles incorporated boundaries whose precise location would depend on the movements of the water and on the federal common law. There can be no doubt that the federal grantee’s expectation that his grant would be interpreted according to federal law and his belief that federal law would recognize boundary shifts occasioned by changes in the course of the water bordering his land were well founded.  One hundred forty years ago, this Court found it obvious that whoever had title to the land bordering water would have title to new land formed by alluvial deposits on the existing upland: “The question is well settled at common law, that the person whose land is bounded by a stream of water, which changes its course gradually by alluvial formations, shall still hold by the same boundary, including the accumulated soil.  No other rule can be applied on just principles.  Every proprietor whose land is thus bounded is subject to loss, by the same means which may add to his territory: and as he is without remedy for his loss, in this way, he cannot be held accountable for his gain.” Ibid, (emphasis added).  This statement of the law was quoted by the Court in County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, <citedDecision>23 Wall. 46, 68</citedDecision> (1874).  *387 The Court in <citedDecision>County of St. Clair</citedDecision> went on to note: “The riparian right to future alluvion is a vested right.  It is an inherent and essential attribute of the original property.” Ibid, (emphasis added).  Similarly, in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1 (1894), 6 the Court said: “The rule, everywhere admitted, that where the land encroaches upon the water by gradual and imperceptible degrees, the accretion or alluvion belongs to the owner of the land, is equally applicable to lands bounding on tide waters or on fresh waters, and to the King or the State as to private persons; and is independent of the law governing the title in the soil covered by the water.” Id., at 35 (emphasis added).  Thus, the right to such additions 7 was part of the title which passed with the federal grant, cf. 3 American Law of Property § 15.27, p. 859 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952), and was protected by federal law. By holding that state law now governs the impact of changes in the course of the bordering water on a federal riparian grant, the Court denies that “a question which concerns the validity and effect of an act done by the United States” is “necessarily a federal question.” Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296 U. S. 10, 22 (1935).  As far as federal law is concerned, a federal riparian grant *388 is now understood to have incorporated a fixed rather than ambulatory boundary.  Ante, at 376.  The rule of New Orleans v. United States, supra, and <citedDecision>County of St. Clair</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Lovingston, supra,</citedDecision> is discarded along with Bonelli and Hughes .  The cases the Court concludes compel this dramatic shift do not even support it.  Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498 (1839), 8 was an action of ejectment brought against the commander of a United States military post to recover part of the post.  The plaintiff claimed under a state registration certificate.  As the majority notes, the Court rejected that argument with the following language: “We hold the true principle to be this, that whenever the question in any Court, state or federal, is, whether a title to land which had once been the property of the United States has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws of the United States; but that whenever, according to those laws, the title shall have passed, then that property, like all other property in the state, is subject to state legislation; so far as that legislation is consistent with the admission that the title passed and vested according to the laws of the United States.” Id., at 517 (emphasis added).  The italicized language, on which the majority opinion makes no comment, explains why state law cannot control this case. Denial of the riparian holder’s federal common-law rights to a changing boundary is not “consistent with the admission that the title .  .

 Cited ante, at 374, 379.  The language in Pollard’s Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. 212 (1845), on which the majority heavily relies to prove that Congress had no such power, see ante, at 372-374, was dismissed as dictum by the Shively Court. See 152 U. S., at 28 .  The majority also quotes the Shively Court’s statement that federal grants “ ‘leave the question of the use of the shores by the owners of uplands to the sovereign control of each State.’ ” Ante, at 379, quoting 152 U. S., at 58 .  It is clear from the context that by “shores” the Shively Court meant the land below the high-water mark.  The State, as owner of that land, controls, it.  The Court did not suggest that the State was free to diminish the title of the upland owner by denying his right to an ambulatory boundary if the “shores” recede or the uplands grow.  The majority’s assertion that the rule of New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 (1836), and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, <citedDecision>23 Wall. 46</citedDecision> (1874), is merely a description of the English common law, ante, at 380-381, n. 8, is belied by the Shively Court’s affirmation of the independence of the riparian holder’s rights from the law governing the lands beneath the water.  The majority chooses not to discuss this aspect of Shivély.  Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 342, 343 (1906), cited ante, at 377, 380, does contain language which supports the conclusions reached by the majority.  That case, however, did not involve lands in which a grantee of the United States held or claimed title.  The land in that case was granted by Spain.  Congress confirmed the grant, but by so doing it added nothing to the title conferred by Spain.  See Joy v. St. Louis, 122 P. 524 (ED Mo. 1903), aff’d, 201 U. S. 332 (1906); United States v. Washington, 294 F. 2d 830, 833 (CA9 1961), cert. denied, 369 U. S. 817 (1962).
