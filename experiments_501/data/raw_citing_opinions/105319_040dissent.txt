<p id="b510-5">These cases have arisen in three principal fields: (a) commercial law; (b) insurance; and (c) workmen's compensation. As a statistical matter, in 21 cases of direct conflict the Court held for the forum 10 times and for the sister State 11 times.</p>
<p id="b510-6">(a) In commercial law a number of cases have involved statutory assessment against out-of-state shareholders under the laws of the State of incorporation of an insolvent corporation. The Court’s consistent position has <page-number citation-index="1" label="417">*417</page-number>been that the law of the incorporating State must be given effect by the forum. <em>E. g., Converse </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="97605"><a href="/opinion/97605/converse-v-hamilton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Converse v. Hamilton">Hamilton, supra.</a></span> </em>That law is deemed to create a transitory cause of action based on the contractual relation between the corporation and the shareholder by which the shareholder is held to have consented to reasonable state regulation. The Court has relied on the fact that in each case a judicial proceeding in the incorporating State had previously passed upon the necessity and amount of the assessment, and that, although shareholders in the forum were not parties to such a proceeding, their interest was adequately represented by other shareholders. Personal defenses, such as the nonexistence of the shareholder relation, may still be asserted. Cf. <em><span class="citation" data-id="103559"><a href="/opinion/103559/pink-v-a-a-a-highway-express-inc/" aria-description="Citation for case: Pink v. A. A. A. Highway Express, Inc.">Pink</a></span> </em>v. <em>A. A. A. Highway Express, Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="103559"><a href="/opinion/103559/pink-v-a-a-a-highway-express-inc/#208" aria-description="Citation for case: Pink v. A. A. A. Highway Express, Inc.">314 U. S., at 208</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b511-5">When the commercial context is not that of shareholder-corporation but simple contract, the Court has found less need for uniformity and accordingly has given greater leeway to the forum on a showing of substantial interest in the contract, <em>e. g., </em>that one of the parties is a resident of the forum or that the contract is to be performed within its borders. The Court has spoken of the presumed acceptance of the forum’s laws by a corporation doing business in the forum. <em>National Mutual Building &amp; Loan Association </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="96057"><a href="/opinion/96057/national-mut-building-and-loan-assn-v-brahan/" aria-description="Citation for case: National Mut. Building and Loan Assn. v. Brahan">Brahan, supra.</a></span> </em>In other cases the argument has been narrower, for instance that the forum can control an incidental item of damages such as interest. <em>Klaxon Co. </em>v. <em>Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., supra. </em>Occasionally reliance has rested on ordinary conflict of laws doctrine. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="97184"><a href="/opinion/97184/olmsted-v-olmsted/" aria-description="Citation for case: Olmsted v. Olmsted">Olmsted</a></span> </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="97184"><a href="/opinion/97184/olmsted-v-olmsted/" aria-description="Citation for case: Olmsted v. Olmsted">Olmsted, supra</a></span> </em>(holding that the forum can exclusively control disposition of land within its borders).</p>
<p id="b511-6">(b) The insurance cases reflect considerations similar to those in the commercial cases. The Court has found in fraternal benefit societies an “indivisible unity” among the members and a resultant need for uniform construe<page-number citation-index="1" label="418">*418</page-number>tion of rights and duties in the common fund. <em>E. g., Order of United Commercial Travelers </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="104443"><a href="/opinion/104443/order-of-united-commercial-travelers-of-america-v-wolfe/" aria-description="Citation for case: Order of United Commercial Travelers of America v. Wolfe">Wolfe, supra.</a></span> </em>Hence the law of the society’s home State (and bylaws adopted under it) has prevailed. The Court has been able to draw support from decisions of the home State validating either the practice under question or one similar to it. (The cases have involved increase of dues, presumption of death from long absence, <em>ultra vires </em>certificates, and time limitation on bringing suit.) In an analogous situation, the forum has prevailed on the question whether an individual is in fact an assessable member of a mutual insurance company (rather than a mere policyholder), on the ground that the interpretation and legal effect of the contract is peculiarly within the competence and sphere of interest of the forum. <em><span class="citation" data-id="103559"><a href="/opinion/103559/pink-v-a-a-a-highway-express-inc/" aria-description="Citation for case: Pink v. A. A. A. Highway Express, Inc.">Pink</a></span> </em>v. <em>A. A. A. Highway Express, Inc., supra.</em></p>
<p id="b512-4">As to ordinary insurance contracts, the forum has had a much wider scope. The Court has balanced the interests of the competing jurisdictions, including factors such as the residence of the insured, where premiums were paid or payable, where the policy was applied for and delivered, where the insured died, what law the policy itself provided should govern, and whether loan agreements and new policies were ancillary to the initial policy. The forum has been permitted to protect its residents against insurance companies, but the Court has required the forum to have more than a casual interest. It has not been sufficient, for example, that the forum was the State of initial issue of the policy on which a defaulted loan was obtained, <em>New York Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="98214"><a href="/opinion/98214/new-york-life-insurance-v-head/" aria-description="Citation for case: New York Life Insurance v. Head">Head, supra,</a></span> </em>or the place of issue of a converted policy and the residence at death of the insured, <em>Aetna Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="100526"><a href="/opinion/100526/aetna-life-insurance-v-dunken/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aetna Life Insurance v. Dunken">Dunken, supra,</a></span> </em>or the place where suit has been brought, <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="102712"><a href="/opinion/102712/john-hancock-mutual-life-insurance-v-yates/" aria-description="Citation for case: John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance v. Yates">Yates, supra.</a></span> </em>On the other hand, the forum would succeed if it asserted a strong local policy requiring an insur<page-number citation-index="1" label="419">*419</page-number>able interest, see <em><span class="citation" data-id="103543"><a href="/opinion/103543/griffin-v-mccoach/" aria-description="Citation for case: Griffin v.

Duel">Duel, supra.</a></span></em></p>
<p id="b513-5">(c) In workmen’s compensation cases the Court has likewise adopted an interests-weighing approach. The relevant considerations have been: the place of the employment contract; the residence of the parties; the place of injury; the possibility of the workman becoming a public charge in the State seeking to award compensation, see <em><span class="citation" data-id="102404"><a href="/opinion/102404/alaska-packers-assn-v-industrial-accident-commn-of-cal/" aria-description="Citation for case: Alaska Packers Assn. v.

McCartin">McCartin, supra;</a></span> </em>the State’s interest in the bodily safety and economic protection of workers within it; the difference between a defense (which if rejected results in irremediable liability) and a cause of action (which if not allowed in one State can be pursued in another), see <em>Bradford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="8148918"><a href="/opinion/8186989/bradford-electric-light-co-v-clapper/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper">Clapper, supra;</a></span> </em>the amount of work to be performed in a State, see <em><span class="citation" data-id="104391"><a href="/opinion/104391/cardillo-v-liberty-mutual-insurance/" aria-description="Citation for case: Cardillo v. Liberty Mutual Insurance">Cardillo</a></span> </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra; </em>and the policy of determinate liability and prompt remedy underlying workmen’s compensation acts. The Court first enunciated the rule that the forum must permit a defense based on the exclusiveness of the sister-state statute where the only contact of the forum was that it was the place of injury. <em>Bradford Electric Light Co. </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="8148918"><a href="/opinion/8186989/bradford-electric-light-co-v-clapper/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper">Clapper, supra.</a></span> </em>Conversely, the Court held that the place of contract could award compensation though the injury occurred elsewhere. <em><span class="citation" data-id="102404"><a href="/opinion/102404/alaska-packers-assn-v-industrial-accident-commn-of-cal/" aria-description="Citation for case: Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm&#x27;n of Cal.">Alaska Packers Association</a></span> </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Comm’n, supra. </em>Subsequently, the Court held that the forum could prevail, even though the parties resided and the contract was entered in another State whose statute was exclusive, if <page-number citation-index="1" label="420">*420</page-number>the injury occurred in the forum and enforcement of the defense of the outside statute was deemed “obnoxious” to the forum’s policy. <em>Pacific Employers Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Comm’n, supra.</em></p>
<p id="A9X">In applying to the immediate situation the fair guidance offered by the past decisions of the Court regarding full faith and credit, a number of considerations become apparent: <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (1) Unlike the other workmen’s compensation cases — or, for that matter, any of the cases in which the forum has prevailed in a conflict between the forum and the outside law — the interest of the forum here is solely dependent on the occurrence of the injury within its borders. No rights of Arkansas residents are involved, since none of the parties is an Arkansan; the workman was removed immediately to a Missouri hospital and has, so far as appears, remained in Missouri. What <page-number citation-index="1" label="421">*421</page-number>might be regarded as the societal interest of Arkansas in the protection of the bodily safety of workers within its borders is an interest equally true of any jurisdiction where a workman is injured and exactly the sort of interest which New Hampshire had in <em><span class="citation" data-id="8148918"><a href="/opinion/8186989/bradford-electric-light-co-v-clapper/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bradford Electric Light Co. v.

And if <em><span class="citation" data-id="8148918"><a href="/opinion/8186989/bradford-electric-light-co-v-clapper/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bradford Electric Light Co. v.

It should not be cast aside on the presupposition that full faith and credit need not be given to a sister-state workmen's compensation statute if the law of the forum happens to be more favorable to the claimant. (3) Furthermore, the new provision of <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. § 1738</span> cannot be disregarded. In 1948 Congress for the first time dealt with the full faith and credit effect to be given statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The absence of such a provision was used by-Mr. Justice Stone to buttress the Court’s opinions both in <em>Alaska Packers, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102404"><a href="/opinion/102404/alaska-packers-assn-v-industrial-accident-commn-of-cal/#547" aria-description="Citation for case: Alaska Packers Assn. v.

See Reese, Full Faith and Credit to Statutes: The Defense of Public Policy, 19 U. of Chi. L. Rev. 339, 343 <em>et seq.</em></p>
<p id="b516-4">There is, however, a readily available alternative short of overruling <em><span class="citation" data-id="8148918"><a href="/opinion/8186989/bradford-electric-light-co-v-clapper/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper">Clapper</a></span> </em>which dispenses with the difficulties inherent in applying the Full Faith and Credit Clause. This alternative proceeds along the following lines:</p>
<p id="b516-5">Missouri’s workmen’s compensation statute is in terms applicable and exclusive as to workmen injured outside the State under Missouri employment contracts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hogan <page-number citation-index="1" label="423">*423</page-number>(the subcontractor here) was a Missouri employer and had a Missouri employment contract with Carroll (the injured workman). Thus when Carroll sought workmen’s compensation in Arkansas (where he was hurt), Hogan and his insurer could have relied on the Missouri statute and the <em><span class="citation" data-id="8148918"><a href="/opinion/8186989/bradford-electric-light-co-v-clapper/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper">Clapper</a></span> </em>case as a defense. They did not, presumably since Arkansas workmen’s compensation cost them no more than Missouri’s and they had an opportunity to recoup from the prime contractor as a third party under Arkansas law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b517-5">But Lanza (the prime contractor) was not a Missouri employer, nor does the record disclose that he had a Missouri employment contract either with Hogan or Carroll. The basic contract between Lanza and Hogan was on a Louisiana letterhead and is a contract for work apparently to be performed exclusively in Arkansas. Hogan promised to furnish workmen and “It is further understood that . . . Hogan . . . will carry the necessary insurance on his men in according [sic] with the rules of the state of Arkansas.” The supplemental contract for the par<page-number citation-index="1" label="424">*424</page-number>ticular work on which Carroll was injured consisted of a letter bid by Hogan to Lanza and a letter reply authorizing Hogan to proceed. From the point of view of choice of law, the various aspects of the contract combine to make it governed either by Arkansas or Louisiana — but not Missouri — law. Cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Great Lakes Pipe Line Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="3534006"><a href="/opinion/3556834/johnson-v-great-lakes-pipe-line-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: Johnson v.

Great Lakes Pipe Line Co.">215 S. W. 2d 460</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b518-4">The Missouri workmen’s compensation statute provides that “Where a third person is liable to the employee . . . for the injury or death, the employer shall be subro-gated . . . and- the recovery by such employer shall not be limited to the amount payable as compensation to such employee . . . .” Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, § 287.150. The Missouri Supreme Court has read this provision as allowing a common-law action by a worker against a negligent third party, <em>e. g., Schumacher </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em><span class="citation" data-id="8020251"><a href="/opinion/8062537/schumacher-v-leslie/" aria-description="Citation for case: Schumacher v. Leslie">360 Mo. 1238</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="1519305"><a href="/opinion/1519305/schumacher-v-leslie/" aria-description="Citation for case: Schumacher v. Leslie">232 S. W. 2d 913</a></span>, on the theory that the worker may secure common-law recovery against anyone “ ‘upon whom no liability could be entailed under the Act,’ ” <span class="citation" data-id="8020251"><a href="/opinion/8062537/schumacher-v-leslie/#1246" aria-description="Citation for case: Schumacher v. Leslie">360 Mo., at 1246</a></span>, 232 S. W. 2d, at 918.</p>
<p id="b518-5">But the Missouri Supreme Court has held that a prime contractor is not liable as a third party for his negligence to an employee of a subcontractor. <em>Bunner </em>v. <em>Patti, </em><span class="citation" data-id="3526916"><a href="/opinion/3551998/bunner-v-patti/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bunner v. Patti">343 Mo. 274</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="3526916"><a href="/opinion/3551998/bunner-v-patti/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bunner v. Patti">121 S. W. 2d 153</a></span>; see also <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Boaz-Kiel Construction Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="1512170"><a href="/opinion/1512170/new-amsterdam-casualty-co-v-boaz-kiel-const-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Boaz-Kiel Const. Co.">115 F. 2d 950</a></span> (C. A. 8th Cir.). And this because prime contractors are subject to liability under the workmen’s compensation statute, which states: “Any person who has work done under contract on or about his premises which is an operation of the usual business which he there carries on shall be deemed an employer and shall be liable under this chapter to such contractor, his subcontractors, and their employees, when injured or killed on or about the premises of the employer .... [T]he immediate contractor . . . shall be liable as an employer of the employees of his subcontractors. . . . No such employer shall be liable ... if <page-number citation-index="1" label="425">*425</page-number>the employee was insured by his immediate or any intermediate employer.” Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, § 287.040.</p>
<p id="b519-5">The rationale of the Missouri decisions prohibiting a negligence action against a prime contractor is this: a person clearly subject to statutory liability cannot be sued as a third party. Cf. <em>Schumacher </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em><span class="citation" data-id="8020251"><a href="/opinion/8062537/schumacher-v-leslie/#1247" aria-description="Citation for case: Schumacher v. Leslie">360 Mo. 1238, 1247</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="1519305"><a href="/opinion/1519305/schumacher-v-leslie/#918" aria-description="Citation for case: Schumacher v. Leslie">232 S. W. 2d 913, 918</a></span>. But the Missouri rule has only been applied in cases where three preconditions were present: (a) all parties were subject to the Missouri workmen’s compensation act; (b) the prime and subcontractor were doing business in Missouri; and (c) the injury took place on a project in Missouri.</p>
<p id="b519-6">Under the circumstances of the case before us, there is no basis for finding that Missouri would deem Lanza to be a Missouri employer and as such subject to liability for Missouri workmen’s compensation. His contract had no Missouri ties other than the bare fact that the subcontractor was a Missouri resident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> And there is no indication that Lanza has ever done business in Missouri. Furthermore, Missouri requires that a defendant in a negligence suit who relies on the exclusiveness of the workmen’s compensation statute must plead and prove as an affirmative defense that the parties are subject to it, <em>Kemper </em>v. <em>Gluck, </em><span class="citation" data-id="3535655"><a href="/opinion/3557934/kemper-v-gluck/" aria-description="Citation for case: Kemper v. Gluck">327 Mo. 733</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="3535655"><a href="/opinion/3557934/kemper-v-gluck/" aria-description="Citation for case: Kemper v. Gluck">39 S. W. 2d 330</a></span>, a burden which Lanza certainly has not met. See <em>State ex rel. St. Louis Car Co. </em>v. <em>Hostetter, </em><span class="citation" data-id="3529409"><a href="/opinion/3553697/state-ex-rel-st-louis-car-co-v-hostetter/" aria-description="Citation for case: State Ex Rel.

St. Louis Car Co. v. Hostetter">131 S. W. 2d 558</a></span>. Thus there is no warrant for believing that the Missouri courts would refuse to allow suit against him as an ordinary third party. Presumably, then, Carroll could sue Lanza under either Missouri or Arkansas law for his negli<page-number citation-index="1" label="426">*426</page-number>gence. Accordingly,, the constitutional question presented should not be passed on.</p>
<p id="b520-4">But we ought not to rest on the initial determination of Missouri law here. In a number of the full faith and credit cases this Court has remanded for further consideration of state law. <em>E. g., Klaxon Co. </em>v. <em>Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., supra; Griffin </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="103543"><a href="/opinion/103543/griffin-v-mccoach/" aria-description="Citation for case: Griffin v.

<p id="b514-5"> Stated shortly, the facts of this case are: Carroll, a Missourian, entered into a Missouri employment contract with Hogan, who operated a Missouri painting company. Hogan in turn contracted with Lanza, a Louisiana electrical contractor, to do painting on a federal project in Arkansas for which Lanza had a government contract. While on the job in Arkansas, Carroll was injured. Hogan’s insurer voluntarily began to pay workmen’s compensation to Carroll pursuant to Missouri law, though no formal proceedings or award were had. Thereafter, Carroll brought suit against Lanza in an Arkansas state court, alleging that his injury was caused by the negligence of Lanza’s employees. Since there was diversity of citizenship, Lanza removed the case to federal court. He then moved for summary judgment, claiming that the Missouri workmen’s compensation law, to which Carroll was subject, afforded an exclusive remedy. The court rejected this contention and rendered an $18,000 judgment for Carroll. <span class="citation" data-id="1902687"><a href="/opinion/1902687/carroll-v-lanza/" aria-description="Citation for case: Carroll v.

<p id="b515-5"> Concededly the <em>Pacific Employers </em>case narrowed what was said in <em><span class="citation" data-id="8148918"><a href="/opinion/8186989/bradford-electric-light-co-v-clapper/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper">Clapper</a></span>. </em>The Court there found the conjunction of four factors decisive in upholding the California Supreme Court’s determination that the Massachusetts statute was “obnoxious” to the public policy of California: (1) medical services were rendered in California and directly reimbursable from the California award; if California could not make an award, its residents would be remitted to Massachusetts and Massachusetts remedies to recover for their services; (2) bodily safety and economic protection of workers within its boundaries is a relevant interest of the forum; (3) the California statute provided: “No contract, rule, or regulation shall exempt the employer from liability ....”; (4) Congress had not yet passed legislation prescribing the full faith and credit effect to be given to statutes.</p>
<p id="b515-6">The distinctions between that case and the one now at bar are to be noted. Of course we are not deciding this case as an isolated instance. But we are passing on the elements of this situation and not of some other situation. The decision here will govern other cases of the same type. The circumstances of this case define the content of the type. That is the essence of the theory of balancing the societal interests of the forum State against those of a sister State. It is that which lies behind the statement that “the full faith and credit clause is not an inexorable and unqualified command,” <em>Pink </em>v. <em>A. A. A.
