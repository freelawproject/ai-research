 10 Thus, appellants’ objection is to *621 the rate of the Montana tax, and even then, their only complaint is that the amount the State receives in taxes far exceeds the value of the services provided to the coal mining industry.  In objecting to the tax on this ground, appellants may be assuming that the Montana tax is, in fact, intended to reimburse the State for the cost of specific services furnished to the coal mining industry.  Alternatively, appellants could be arguing that a State’s power to tax an activity connected to interstate commerce cannot exceed the value of the services specifically provided to the activity.  Either way, the premise of appellants’ argument is invalid.  Furthermore, appellants have completely misunderstood the nature of the inquiry under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test.  The Montana Supreme Court held that the coal severance tax is “imposed for the general support of the government.” -Mont., at-, 615 P. 2d, at 856 , and we have no reason to question this characterization of the Montana tax as a general revenue tax. 11 Consequently, in reviewing appellants’ contentions, we put to one side those cases in which the Court reviewed challenges to “user” fees or “taxes” that were designed and defended as a specific charge imposed by the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportation or other facilities and services.  See, e. g., Evans *622 ville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972); Clark v. Paul Cray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939); Ingels v. Morf, <citedDecision>300 U. S. 290</citedDecision> (1937).  12 This Court has indicated that States have considerable latitude in imposing general revenue taxes.  The Court has, for example, consistently rejected claims that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands as a barrier against taxes that are “unreasonable” or “unduly burdensome.” See, e. g., Pittsburgh v. Alco Parking Corp., 417 U. S. 369 (1974); Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40 (1934); Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Co. v. Smith, 255 U. S. 44 (1921).  Moreover, there is no requirement under the Due Process Clause that the amount of general revenue taxes collected from a particular activity must be reasonably related to the value of the services provided to the activity.  Instead, our consistent rule has been: “Nothing is more familiar in taxation than the imposition of a tax upon a class or upon individuals who enjoy no direct benefit from its expenditure, and who are not responsible for the condition to be remedied.  “A tax is not an assessment of benefits.  It is, as we *623 have said, a means of distributing the burden of the cost of government.

 Reply Brief for Appellants 8.  At oral argument before the Montana Supreme Court, appellants’ counsel suggested that a tax of “perhaps twelve and a half to fifteen percent of the value of the coal” would be constitutional.  — Mont., at —, 615 P. 2d, at 851 .  Contrary to appellants’ suggestion, the fact that 50% of the proceeds of the severance tax is paid into a trust fund does not undermine the Montana court’s conclusion that the tax is a general revenue tax. Nothing in the Constitution prohibits the people of Montana from choosing to allocate a portion of current tax revenues for use by future generations.  As the Court has stated, “such imposition, although termed a tax, cannot be tested by standards which generally determine the validity of taxes.” Interstate Transit, Inc. v. Lindsey, 283 U. S. 183, 190 (1931).  Because such charges are purportedly assessed to reimburse the State for costs incurred in providing specific quantifiable services, we have required a showing, based on factual evidence in the record, that “the fees charged do not appear to be manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered ...” Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S., at 599 .  See id., at 598-600 ; <citedDecision>Ingels</citedDecision> v. Morf, <citedDecision>300 U. S., at 296-297</citedDecision> .  One commentator has suggested that these “user” charges “are not true revenue measures and .  .  .  the considerations applicable to ordinary tax measures do not apply.” P. Hartman, State Taxation of Interstate Commerce 20, n. 72 (1953).  Instead, “user” fees “partak[e] ... of the nature of a rent charged by the State, based upon its proprietary interest in its public property, [rather] than of a tax, as that term is thought of in a technical sense.” Id., at 122.  See generally id., at 122-130.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice White, concurring. This is a very troublesome case for me, and I join the Court’s opinion with considerable doubt and with the realization that Montana’s levy on consumers in other States may in the long run prove to be an intolerable and unacceptable burden on commerce. Indeed, there is particular force in the argument that the tax is here and now unconstitutional. Montana collects most of its tax from coal lands owned by the Federal Government and hence by all of the people of this country, while at the same time sharing equally and directly with the Federal Government all of the royalties reserved under the leases the United States has negotiated on its land in the State of Montana. This share is intended to compensate the State for the burdens that coal mining may impose upon it. Also, as Justice- Blackmun cogently points out, post, at 643, n. 9, another 40% of the federal revenue from mineral leases is indirectly returned to the States through a reclamation fund. In addition, there is statutory provision for federal grants to areas affected by increased coal production. But this very fact gives me pause and counsels withholding our hand, at least for now. Congress has the power to protect interstate commerce from intolerable or even undesirable burdens. It is also very much aware of the Nation’s energy needs;'of the Montana tax, and of the trend in the energy-rich States to aggrandize their position and perhaps lessen the tax burdens on their own citizens by imposing unusually high taxes on mineral extraction. Yet, Congress is so far content to let -the matter rest, and we are counseled by the Executive Branch through the Solicitor General not to overturn the Montana tax as inconsistent with either the Commerce Clause *638 ■ or federal statutory policy in the field of energy or otherwise. The constitutional authority and the machinery to thwart efforts such as those of Montana, if thought unacceptable, are available to Congress, and surely Montana and other similarly situated States do not have the political power to impose their will on the rest of the country. As I presently see it, therefore, the better part of both wisdom and valor is to respect the judgment of the other branches of the Government. I join the opinion and the judgment of the Court.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 In General Motors, the question before the Court was the validity of an unapportioned tax on the gross receipts of a corporation in interstate commerce.  The Court concluded that there was a sufficient nexus to uphold the tax. 377 U. S., at 448 .  See id., at 449-450 (BrenNAN, J., dissenting).  In Postal Telegraph-Cable Co., a telegraph company engaged in interstate commerce challenged both an annual license tax and an annual tax of $2 for each telegraph pole that the company maintained in the city of Richmond, Va. The Court sustained the validity of the license tax on the ground that it was simply a nondiscriminatory “exercise of the police power ... for revenue purposes.” 249 U. S., at 257 .  In contrast, the pole tax was subjected to stricter scrutiny; the Court stated that while interstate commerce must pay its way, the authority remains in the courts, “on proper application, to determine whether, under the conditions prevailing in a given case, the charge made is reasonably proportionate to the service to be rendered and the liabilities involved, or whether it is a disguised attempt to impose a burden on interstate commerce.” Id., at 260 .  The Court has continued to scrutinize carefully taxes on interstate commerce that are designed to reimburse the State for the particular costs imposed by that commerce.  See, e. g„ Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972); Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939); Ingels v. Morf, <citedDecision>300 U. S. 290</citedDecision> (1937).  In analyzing such taxes, it has required that there be factual evidence in the record that “the fees charged do not appear to be manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered.” Clark, 306 U. S., at 599 .  The Court concludes that this test has no bearing here because the Montana Supreme Court held that the coal severance tax was “ ‘imposed for the *648 general support of the government.’ ” Ante, at 621.  In fact, however, the matter is not nearly so clear as the Court suggests.  The Montana court also implied that the tax was designed at least in part to compensate the State for the special costs attributable to coal mining,-Mont., at-, -, 615 P. 2d, at 850, 855 , as have appellees here.  Brief for Appellees 1-3, 26-27.  Indeed, the stated objectives of the 1975 amendment were to: “(a) preserve or modestly increase revenues going to the general fund, (b) to respond to current social impacts attributable to coal development, and (c) to invest in the future, when new energy technologies reduce our dependence on coal and mining activity may decline.” Statement to Accompany the Report of the Free Joint Conference Committees on Coal Taxation 1 (1975).
