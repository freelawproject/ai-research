 334 F. 2d 331 (1964); petition for writ of certiorari denied, 381 U. S. 951 (1965).  On November 5, 1965, the United States District Court, as directed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ( 334 F. 2d 331 (1964)), heard petitioner’s claim on the merits.  It dismissed his petition on the ground that he had failed to show a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.  Petitioner appealed in circumstances hereinafter related.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the appeal.  On March 20, 1967, a petition for a writ of certiorari was filed here.  We granted the petition, 389 U. S. 896 (1967), to consider whether, because of facts to which we later refer, the Court of Appeals’ dismissal conformed to our holding in Nowakowski v. Maroney, <citedDecision>386 U. S. 542</citedDecision> (1967).  But first we must consider the State’s contention that this case is now moot because petitioner has been unconditionally released from custody.  Petitioner applied to the United States District Court for a writ of habeas corpus in June 1963.  He was in custody at that time.  On March 6, 1967, petitioner’s sentence expired, 2 and he was discharged from the parole status in which he had been since October 4, 1964.  We issued our writ of certiorari on October 16, 1967 ( 389 U. S. 896 ).  *237 The issue presented, then, is whether the expiration of petitioner’s sentence, before his application was finally adjudicated and while it was awaiting appellate review, terminates federal jurisdiction with respect to the application.

 28 U. S. C. § 1915 .  The State opposed petitioner’s application for leave to appeal in forma pauperis and moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was without merit.  Petitioner filed a reply in July 1966 in which he opposed the State’s motion to dismiss and in which he renewed his plea for leave to appeal in forma pauperis.  On February 3, 1967, the Court of Appeals entered the following order: “Application for Leave to Proceed in Forma Pauperis.  Application denied.  Motion to dismiss appeal granted.” Rehearing was thereafter denied.  It is this action of the Court of-Appeals that brings into issue our decision in Nowakowski v. Maroney, <citedDecision>386 U. S. 542</citedDecision> (April 10, 1967).  In <citedDecision>Nowakowski</citedDecision> , we held that “when a district judge grants ... a certificate [of probable cause], the court of appeals must grant an appeal in forma pauperis (assuming the requisite showing of poverty), and proceed to a disposition of the appeal in accord with its ordinary procedure.” At 543.  Although <citedDecision>Nowakowski</citedDecision> was decided after the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner’s appeal, its holding applies to a habeas corpus proceeding which, like this one, was not concluded at the time <citedDecision>Nowakowski</citedDecision> was decided.  Cf. Eskridge v. Washington Prison Board, 357 U. S. 214 (1958); see also Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 628 , n. 13 and 639, n. 20 (1965); Tehan v. Shott, 382 U. S. 406, 416 (1966).  Respondent argues that the denial of the motion to proceed in forma pauperis by the Court of Appeals in this case and the dismissal of the appeal were permissible because the Court had before it the entire District Court record and because respondent’s motion to dismiss and *242 petitioner’s reply contained some argument on the merits.  Nothing in the order entered by the Court of Appeals, however, indicates that the appeal was duly considered on its merits as <citedDecision>Nowakowski</citedDecision> requires in cases where a certificate of probable cause has been granted.  Although <citedDecision>Nowakowski</citedDecision> does not necessarily require that the Court of Appeals give the parties full opportunity to submit briefs and argument in an appeal which, despite the issuance of the certificate of probable cause, is frivolous, enough must appear to demonstrate the basis for the court’s summary action.  Anything less than this, as we held in <citedDecision>Nowakowski</citedDecision> , would negate the office of the certificate of probable cause.  Indeed, it appears that since <citedDecision>Nowakowski</citedDecision> , the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has accorded this effect to that ruling.  The State informs us that “it appears to be the policy of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit that in cases where habeas corpus appeals have been dismissed, reargument will be granted and the appeal reinstated where the time to apply for certiorari had not expired prior to the decision in NowakowskiBrief for respondent 22-23.  Accordingly, the judgment below is vacated and the case is remanded to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  Mr. Justice Marshall took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. The New York Court of Appeals amended its remittitur to reflect that it had passed on petitioner’s constitutional claim.  11 N. Y. 2d 969, 183 N. E. 2d 697 (1962).  It appears that petitioner was on bail after conviction until this Court denied his earlier petition for a writ of certiorari.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring. Although we joined the per curiam decision in Parker v. Ellis, 362 U. S. 574 , we are now persuaded that what the Court there decided was wrong insofar as it held that even though a man be in custody when he initiates *243 a habeas corpus proceeding, the statutory power of the federal courts to proceed to a final adjudication of his claims depends upon his remaining in custody. Consequently we concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court. Mr. Justice Harlan also notes that his views upon the issue discussed in his separate concurring opinion in Parker, id., at 576 , have not changed.
