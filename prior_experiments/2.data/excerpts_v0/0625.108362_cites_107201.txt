Passage 1:
er slaves and their descendants should be forever free. To keep that promise, "Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation." Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra, at 440. We can only conclude that Congress was wholly within its powers under § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment in creating a statutory cause of action for Negro citizens who have been the victims of conspiratorial, racially discriminatory private action aimed at depriving them of the basic rights that the law secures to all free men.

Our cases have firmly established that the right of interstate travel is constitutionally protected, does not necessarily rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, and is assertable against private as well as governmental interference. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629-631; id., at 642-644 (concurring opinion); United States *106 v. Guest, <targetCase>383 U.S. 745</targetCase>, 757-760 and n. 17; Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78, 97; Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 79-80; Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 44, 48-49; Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 492 (Taney, C.J., dissenting). The "right to pass freely from State to State" has been explicitly recognized as "among the rights and privileges of National citizenship." Twining v. New Jersey, supra, at 97. That right, like other rights of national citizenship, is within the power of Congress to protect by appropriate legislation. E. g., United States v. Guest, supra, at 759; United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. 299, 314-315; Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651; Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U.S. 112, 285-287 (concurring and dissenting opinion).
The complaint in this case alleged that the petitioners "were travelling upon the federal, state and local highways in and about" DeKalb, Kemper County, Mississippi. Kemper County is on the Mississippi-Alabama border. One of the results of the conspiracy, according to the complaint

[10]  The motivation requirement introduced by the word "equal" into the portion of § 1985 (3) before us must not be confused with the test of "specific intent to deprive a person of a federal right made definite by decision or other rule of law" articulated by the plurality opinion in Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91, 103, for prosecutions under 18 U.S. C. § 242. Section 1985 (3), unlike § 242, contains no specific requirement of "wilfulness." Cf. Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 187. The motivation aspect of § 1985 (3) focuses not on scienter in relation to deprivation of rights but on invidiously discriminatory animus.
