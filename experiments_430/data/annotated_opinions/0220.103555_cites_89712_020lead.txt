 It includes all steps taken or which may be taken in the state court or by its officers from the institution to the close of the final process.  It applies to appellate as well as to original proceedings; and is independent of the doctrine of res judicata.  It applies alike to action by the court and by its ministerial officers; applies not only to an execution issued on a judgment, but to any proceeding supplemental or ancillary taken with a view to making the suit or judgment effective.” However, the opinion cites the Wells Fargo and Essanay Film cases in a footnote dealing with “the recognized exceptions to § 265.” 296 U. S. 403, n. 19 .  The foundation of these cases is thus very doubtful.  However, we need not under *137 take to reexamine them here since, in any event, they do not govern the cases at bar.  7 Fourth.  We come, then, to the so-called “relitigation” cases, the first of which is Dial v. Reynolds, <citedDecision>96 U. S. 340</citedDecision> .  The facts of the case are simple: Cooper was indebted to Staatsman.  To secure these debts he executed a mortgage deed of trust under which Dial was trustee.  Asserting title in himself to the property covered by the mortgage, Reynolds brought ejectment against Cooper in the federal court. On writ of error this Court set aside a judgment in Reynolds’ favor and held title to be in Cooper.  Cooper v. Reynolds, 10 Wall. 308, 321 .  Reynolds thereafter dismissed his ejectment action in the federal court and brought a new action against Cooper in a Tennessee state court based upon the claim thus previously litigated.  Dial and Staatsman, joining Cooper as a party defendant, filed suit in the federal court to foreclose the mortgage and to enjoin Reynolds from further prosecuting his action in the state court. The lower court sustained Reynolds’ demurrer, and this Court affirmed.  It held that the “gravamen” of the bills was an injunction to prevent Reynolds from proceeding in the state court. “Such an injunction, except under the Bankrupt Act, no court of the United States can grant.  With this exception, it is expressly forbidden by law.” <citedDecision>96 U. S. at 341</citedDecision> .  8 *138 Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co., 247 U. S. 214 , was not a “relitigation” case. The Texas federal district court, in a suit brought by various carriers, granted a preliminary injunction restraining the state Attorney General from proceeding to assess fines and penalties upon them for complying with an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.  The Attorney General nevertheless instituted proceedings in a state court to enjoin the carriers from complying with the Commission’s order, and a supplemental bill was filed in the federal court to stay the proceedings.  The district' court issued the injunction, and this Court dismissed an appeal under § 266, holding that the injunction below was not based upon the unconstitutionality of the Texas state statutes, but was granted merely to protect its jurisdiction until the suit brought by the carriers was finally settled.  The case obviously does not rule ours. Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, 255 U. S. 356 , held that a federal district court, having rendered a decree in a class suit brought in behalf of all the members of a certain class of beneficiaries in a fraternal association, may enjoin members of the class, found to be bound by the decree, from prosecuting suits in the state courts which would relitigate questions settled by such decree.  The opinion of Mr. Justice Day contains no reference to either the Act of March 2, 1793, or to <citedDecision>Dial</citedDecision> v. Reynolds.  The opinion is devoted almost entirely to a discussion of whether the former decree is res judicata in the state suits.  Having determined this question in the affirmative, the Court disposed of the remaining — § 265 — question in one sentence, citing only one case in support of its conclusion, Looney v. Eastern *139 Texas R. Co., supra, which, as we have seen, was not a relitigation case. 9 255 U. S. at 367 .  Fifth.  We find, therefore, that apart from Congressional authorization, only one “exception” has been imbedded in § 265 by judicial construction, to wit, the res cases. The fact that one exception has found its way into § 265 is no justification for making another.  Furthermore, the res exception, having its roots in the same policy from which sprang § 265, has had an uninterrupted and firmly established acceptance in the decisions.  The rule of the res cases was unequivocally on the books when Congress reenacted the original § 5 of the Act of 1793, first by the Revised Statutes of 1874 and later by the Judicial Code in 1911.

 The latter suit was removed to the federal circuit court which cancelled the notes and enjoined the further prosecution of the state action at law. The report of the proceeding in this Court states merely that “the court being of opinion that a circuit court of the United States had not jurisdiction to enjoin proceedings in a state court, reversed the decree.” In his Commentaries on American Law (1826) vol. 1, p. 386, Chancellor Kent, stating that the decision in the case “is not to be contested,” refers to it as illustrative of a situation “in which any control by the federal over the state courts, other than by means of the established appellate jurisdiction, has equally been prevented.” Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 625 , holding that a federal court sitting in bankruptcy could not discharge the lien of a prior attachment made under state law, was the first case which expressly relied upon the Act of 1793.  In Orton v. Smith, 18 How. 263, 266 , the Court held it error to enjoin a state action to establish title to certain land.  “The courts of the United States have no such power over suitors in a state court.” The extent to which a federal court’s exclusive control over the res may require use of the injunction to effectuate its decrees in rem is illustrated by Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U. S. 188 ; Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U. S. 93 ; and Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234, 241 .  Cf. Ex parte Baldwin, 291 U. S. 610, 615 .  For similar reasons we need not here consider cases like Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 , and Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273 , with which compare Hale v. Bimco Trading Co., 306 U. S. 375, 378 .  The Court also held that in a foreclosure proceeding the complainant cannot join a third person who claims adversely to the mortgagor and mortgagee, and that consequently there was a misjoinder of parties.  <citedDecision>96 U. S. at 341</citedDecision> .  These grounds for decision were, of course, alternative, and either alone was sufficient to dispose of the case. However, they were entirely separate and distinct, and there *138 is no basis for any inference that the Court might have upheld an injunction if Reynolds had been properly joined.  Nor need we consider common-law refinements in actions for ejectment, for the Court went explicitly on its duty to obey the Act of 1793.  Root v. Woolworth, 150 U. S. 401 , is erroneously regarded as illustrating a “relitigation” exception to § 265.  The case holds merely that courts of equity have jurisdiction to “effectuate their own decrees by injunctions or writs of assistance in order to avoid the relitigation of questions once settled between the same parties.” 150 U. S. at 411-12 .  The Court did not uphold a federal injunction against a state suit to relitigate a claim already settled by a previous federal decree — no such state suit had been brought.  Consequently, there was no occasion to consider the applicability of § 265.
