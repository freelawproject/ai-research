 publicly displays any book .  .  .  containing or advocating, advising or teaching the doctrine that organized government should be overthrown by force, violence or any unlawful means." [6] Does the teacher who carries a copy of the Communist Manifesto on a public street thereby advocate criminal anarchy?  It is no answer to say that the statute would not be applied in such a case. We cannot gainsay the potential effect of this obscure wording on "those with a conscientious and scrupulous regard for such undertakings." Baggett v. Bullitt, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 360, 374</citedDecision> .  Even were it certain that the definition referred to in § 105 was solely Penal Law § 160, the scope of § 105 still remains indefinite.  The teacher cannot know the extent, if any, to which a "seditious" utterance must transcend mere statement about abstract doctrine, the extent to which it must be intended to and tend to indoctrinate or incite to action in furtherance of the defined doctrine.  The crucial consideration is that no teacher can know just where the line is drawn between "seditious" and nonseditious utterances and acts.  Other provisions of § 105 also have the same defect of vagueness.  Subdivision 1 (a) of § 105 bars employment of any person who "by word of mouth or writing wilfully and deliberately advocates, advises or teaches the doctrine" of forceful overthrow of government.  This provision is plainly susceptible of sweeping and improper application.

 propriety of adopting the doctrine contained therein"?  We do not have the benefit of a judicial gloss by the New York courts enlightening us as to the scope of this complicated plan.  [9] In light of the intricate administrative machinery for its enforcement, this is not surprising.  The very intricacy of the plan and the uncertainty as to the scope of its proscriptions make it a highly efficient in terrorem mechanism.  It would be a bold teacher who would not stay as far as possible from utterances or acts which might jeopardize his living by enmeshing him in this intricate machinery.  The uncertainty as to the utterances and acts proscribed increases that caution in "those who believe the written law means what it says." <citedDecision>Baggett</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bullitt, supra, at 374</citedDecision> .  The result must be to stifle "that free play of the spirit which all teachers ought especially to cultivate and practice .  .  .  ." [10] That probability is enhanced by the provisions requiring an *602 annual review of every teacher to determine whether any utterance or act of his, inside the classroom or out, came within the sanctions of the laws.  For a memorandum warns employees that under the statutes "subversive" activities may take the form of "[t]he writing of articles, the distribution of pamphlets, the endorsement of speeches made or articles written or acts performed by others," and reminds them "that it is a primary duty of the school authorities in each school district to take positive action to eliminate from the school system any teacher in whose case there is evidence that he is guilty of subversive activity.

 For "[t]he threat of sanctions may deter .  .  .  almost as potently as the actual application of sanctions." N. A. A. C. P. v. Button, supra, at 433 .  The danger of that chilling effect upon the exercise of vital First Amendment rights must be guarded against by sensitive tools which clearly inform teachers what is being proscribed.  See Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359, 369 ; Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, 368 U. S. 278 ; <citedDecision>Baggett</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bullitt, supra</citedDecision> .  The regulatory maze created by New York is wholly lacking in "terms susceptible of objective measurement." Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, supra, at 286.  It has the quality of "extraordinary ambiguity" found to be fatal to the oaths considered in Cramp and <citedDecision>Baggett</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bullitt</citedDecision> .  "[M]en of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.  .  .  ." <citedDecision>Baggett</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bullitt, supra, at 367</citedDecision> .  Vagueness of wording is aggravated by prolixity and profusion of statutes, regulations, and administrative machinery, and by manifold cross-references to interrelated enactments and rules.  We therefore hold that § 3021 of the Education Law and subdivisions 1 (a), 1 (b) and 3 of § 105 of the Civil Service Law as implemented by the machinery created pursuant to § 3022 of the Education Law are unconstitutional.  *605 IV. Appellants have also challenged the constitutionality of the discrete provisions of subdivision 1 (c) of § 105 and subdivision 2 of the Feinberg Law, which make Communist Party membership, as such, prima facie evidence of disqualification.  The provision was added to subdivision 1 (c) of § 105 in 1958 after the Board of Regents, following notice and hearing, listed the Communist Party of the United States and the Communist Party of the State of New York as "subversive" organizations.  Subdivision 2 of the Feinberg Law was, however, before the Court in Adler and its constitutionality was sustained.  But constitutional doctrine which has emerged since that decision has rejected its major premise.

 However, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit correctly said in an earlier stage of this case, ".  .  .  the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless *606 of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected." Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 345 F. 2d 236, 239 .  Indeed, that theory was expressly rejected in a series of decisions following Adler .  See Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 ; Slochower v. Board of Education, 350 U. S. 551 ; Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, supra ; <citedDecision>Baggett</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bullitt, supra</citedDecision> ; Shelton v. Tucker, supra ; Speiser v. Randall, supra ; see also Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232 ; Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 .  In Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 404 , we said: "It is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege." We proceed then to the question of the validity of the provisions of subdivision 1 (c) of § 105 and subdivision 2 of § 3022, barring employment to members of listed organizations.  Here again constitutional doctrine has developed since Adler .  Mere knowing membership without a specific intent to further the unlawful aims of an organization is not a constitutionally adequate basis for exclusion from such positions as those held by appellants.  In Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11 , we said, "Those who join an organization but do not share its unlawful purposes and who do not participate in its unlawful activities surely pose no threat, either as citizens or as public employees." Id., at 17 .

 And also on the same day my Brother BRENNAN himself cited Garner with approval in Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513 (1958).  Since that time the Adler line of cases has been cited again and again with approval: Shelton v. Tucker, 364 *625 U. S. 479 (1960), in which both Adler and Beilan were quoted with approval, and Garner and Lerner were cited in a like manner; likewise in Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, 368 U. S. 278 (1961), Adler was quoted twice with approval; and, in a related field where the employee was discharged for refusal to answer questions as to his loyalty after being ordered to do so, Nelson v. Los Angeles County, 362 U. S. 1 (1960), the Court cited with approval all of the cases which today it says have been rejected, i.  e., Garner, Adler, Beilan and Lerner .  Later Konigsberg v. State Bar, 366 U. S. 36 (1961), likewise cited with approval both Beilan and Garner .  And in our decision in In re Anastaplo, 366 U. S. 82 (1961), Garner, Beilan and Lerner were all referred to.  Finally, only three Terms ago my Brother WHITE relied upon Cramp , which in turn cited Adler with approval twice.  See Baggett v. Bullitt, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 360</citedDecision> (1964).  In view of this long list of decisions covering over 15 years of this Court's history, in which no opinion of this Court even questioned the validity of the Adler line of cases, it is strange to me that the Court now finds that the "constitutional doctrine which has emerged since .  .  .  has rejected [ Adler 's] major premise." With due respect, as I read them, our cases have done no such thing.  III. The majority also finds that Adler did not pass upon § 3021 of the Education Law, nor subdivision 3 of § 105 of the Civil Service Law, nor upon the vagueness questions of subdivisions 1 (a), 1 (b) and 1 (c) of § 105.

 .  directs the Board of Regents to adopt and enforce rules and regulations for the elimination of persons barred from employment in the public school system or any college or institution of higher education owned by the State of New York or any political subdivision thereof, by reason of violation of any of the provisions of Section 105 of the Civil Service Law or Section 3021 of the New York State Education Law." [6]  Penal Law §§ 160-161 are to be replaced effective September 1, 1967, by a single provision entitled "criminal advocacy." [7]  The New York State Legislative Committee on Public Employee Security Procedures, in describing this provision, noted: "In disqualifying for employment those who advocate or teach the `doctrine' of the violent overthrow of government, [§ 105] is to be distinguished from the language of the Smith Act ( 18 U. S. C. §§ 371 , 2385), which has been construed by the Supreme Court to make it criminal to incite to `action' for the forcible overthrow of government, but not to teach the `abstract doctrine' of such forcible overthrow.  Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 (1957)." 1958 N. Y. State Legis. Annual 70, n. 1.  [8]  Compare the Smith Act, 18 U. S. C. § 2385 , which punishes one who "prints, publishes, edits, issues, circulates, sells, distributes, or publicly displays any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of" unlawful overthrow, provided he is shown to have an "intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any such government." [9]  This is not a case where abstention pending state court interpretation would be appropriate, <citedDecision>Baggett</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bullitt, supra,</citedDecision> at 375-379: Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 489-490 .  [10] Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 195 (Frankfurter, J., concurring).  [11]  Whether or not loss of public employment constitutes "punishment," cf. United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303 , there can be no doubt that the repressive impact of the threat of discharge will be no less direct or substantial.  [12]  See Lazarsfeld & Thielens, The Academic Mind 92-112, 192-217; Biddle, The Fear of Freedom 155 et seq.; Jahoda & Cook, Security Measures and Freedom of Thought: An Exploratory Study of the Impact of Loyalty and Security Programs, 61 Yale L. J. 295 (1952).  See generally, MacIver, Academic Freedom in Our Time; Hullfish, Educational Freedom in an Age of Anxiety; Konvitz, Expanding Liberties 86-108; Morris, Academic Freedom and Loyalty Oaths, 28 Law & Contemp.  Prob. 487 (1963).  [13]  In light of our disposition, we need not consider appellants' contention that the burden placed on the employee of coming forward with substantial rebutting evidence upon proof of membership in a listed organization is constitutionally impermissible.
