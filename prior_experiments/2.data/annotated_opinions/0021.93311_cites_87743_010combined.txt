**Combined Opinion**
The power to borrow the $11,400 would not have been nugatory, unaccompanied by the power to issue negotiable bonds therefor. Merrill v. Monticello, 138 U.S. 673 , 687; Williams v. Davidson, 43 Texas, 1 , 33, 34; City of Cleburne v. Railroad Company, 66 Texas, 461 ; 1 Dillon on Municipal Corp. 4th ed. § 89, and notes; § 91, n. 2; § 126, n. 1; §§ 507, 507 a. The confining of the power in the present case to a borrowing of money for general purposes on the credit of the city, limits it to the power to borrow money for ordinary governmental purposes, such as are generally carried out with revenues derived from taxation; and the presumption is that the grant of the power was intended to confer the right to borrow money in anticipation of the receipt of revenue taxes, and not to plunge the municipal corporation into a debt on which interest must be paid at the rate of ten per centum per annum, semi-annually, for at least ten years. It is easy for the legislature to confer upon a municipality, when it is constitutional to do so, the power to issue negotiable bonds; and, under the well-settled rule that any doubt as to the existence of such power ought to be determined against its existence, it ought not to be held to exist in the present case. A review of the cases on this subject in this court will be useful. In Rogers v. Burlington, <targetCase>3 Wall. 654</targetCase> , 666, in 1865, it was held that the statutory power granted to the city of Burlington, *183 Iowa, "to borrow money for any public purpose," gave authority to the city to borrow money to aid a railroad company in building a road for public travel and transportation, and that, as a means of borrowing money to accomplish such object, the city might issue its bonds to be sold by the railroad company to raise the money. Bonds were issued and loaned to the company. They were coupon bonds in the usual form, and were secured by first-mortgage bonds of the company. Suit was brought by a bona fide holder for value, to recover against the city on the coupons, and the case came up on a demurrer to the petition. The demurrer was sustained by the Circuit Court and judgment rendered for the city; but this court reversed that judgment. In the opinion of this court, as to the power to issue the negotiable bonds, it was said: "Common experience shows that the issuing of bonds by a municipal corporation as material aid in the construction of a railroad, is merely a customary and convenient mode of borrowing money to accomplish the object; and it cannot make any difference, so far as respects the present question, whether the bonds, as issued by the defendants, were sold in the market by their officers, or were first delivered to the company, and were by their agents sold for the same purpose." Chief Justice Chase and Justices Grier, Miller and Field dissented. Justice Field delivered a dissenting opinion, in which his three associates concurred, and which stated, as to the authority of the city to issue the bonds, that there was no such authority, either in the charter of the city or in any other legislation of the State; that the authority conferred was to borrow money; that no money was borrowed, but the bonds of the city were loaned; and that borrowing money and loaning credit were not convertible terms. In Mitchell v. <targetCase>Burlington</targetCase>, 4 Wall. 270 , the case of <targetCase>Rogers</targetCase> v. Burlington, supra , was affirmed. But in Police Jury v. Britton, 15 Wall. 566 , (when Justices Wayne, Nelson and Grier had left the bench, and Justices Strong, Bradley and Hunt had come upon it, Chief Justice Chase and Justices Clifford, Swayne, Miller, Davis and Field *184 remaining,) it was held that the trustees or representative officers of a parish, county or other local jurisdiction, invested with the usual powers of administration in specific matters, and the power of levying taxes to defray the necessary expenditures of the jurisdiction, have no implied authority to issue negotiable securities, payable in future, of such a character as to be unimpeachable in the hands of bona fide holders, for the purpose of raising money or funding a previous indebtedness. In the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Bradley, it is stated that the police jury of the parish of Tensas, Louisiana, which issued the negotiable bonds in question in that case, had no express authority to issue them; that the power could not be implied from the ordinary powers of local administration and police which were conferred upon the boards and trustees of political districts; that it was one thing for county and parish trustees to have the power to incur obligations for work actually done in behalf of the county or parish, and to give proper vouchers therefor, and a totally different thing to have the power of issuing unimpeachable paper obligations, which might be multiplied to an indefinite extent; and that, although the authority for such bodies to issue negotiable paper might be implied in some cases from other and express powers granted, those implications should not be extended beyond the fair inferences to be gathered from the circumstances of each case. In Claiborne County v. Brooks, 111 U.S. 400 , it was held that the power to issue commercial paper was foreign to the objects of the creation of the political divisions of counties and townships, and was not to be conceded to such organizations unless by virtue of express legislation or by very strong implication from such legislation; and that the power conferred by statutes of Tennessee upon a county, to erect a court-house, jail and other necessary county buildings, did not authorize the issue of commercial paper as evidence of or security for a debt contracted for the construction of such a building. The opinion in the case was delivered by Mr. Justice Bradley; and the case of Police Jury v. Britton, 15 Wall. 566 , was cited and approved, although the unsuccessful *185 party cited as authority the case of Rogers v. Burlington, <targetCase>3 Wall. 654</targetCase> . In Concord v. Robinson, 121 U.S. 165 , it was held that a grant to a municipal corporation of power to appropriate moneys in aid of the construction of a railroad, accompanied by a provision directing the levy and collection of taxes to meet such appropriation, and prescribing no other mode of payment, did not authorize the issuing of negotiable bonds in payment of such appropriation. The opinion of this court was delivered by Mr. Justice Harlan, and the case of Claiborne County v. Brooks, 111 U.S. 400 , was cited and approved. In Kelley v. Milan, 127 U.S. 139 , and Norton v. Dyersburg, 127 U.S. 160 , it was held that the power granted to a municipal corporation to become a stockholder in a railroad company did not carry with it the power to issue negotiable bonds in payment of the subscription, unless the latter power was expressly or by reasonable implication conferred by statute. In the opinion in the case of Norton v. Dyersburg , the case of Claiborne County v. Brooks, 111 U.S. 400 , was cited with approval. In Young v. Clarendon Township, 132 U.S. 340 , it was held to be settled law that a municipality has no power to issue its bonds in aid of a railroad, except by legislative permission; and in the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Lamar, the cases of Claiborne County v. Brooks and of Kelley v. Milan were cited and approved. In Hill v. Memphis, 134 U.S. 198 , 203, the opinion of the court being delivered by Mr. Justice Field, it was held that the power conferred by a statute on a municipal corporation to subscribe for the stock of a railroad company did not include the power to issue negotiable bonds representing a debt, in order to pay for that subscription; and it was said that that rule was well settled.
**Combined Opinion**
To borrow money, and to give a bond or obligation therefor which may circulate in the market as a negotiable security, freed from any equities that may be set up by the maker of it, are, in their nature and in their legal effect, essentially different transactions. In the present case, all that can be contended for is, that the town had the power to contract a loan, under certain specified restrictions and limitations. Nowhere in the statute is there any express power given to issue negotiable bonds as evidence of such loan. Nor can such power be implied, because the existence of it is not necessary to carry out any of the purposes of the municipality. It is true that there is a considerable number of cases, many of which are cited in the brief of counsel for plaintiff in error, which hold a contrary doctrine. But the view taken by this court in the cases above cited and others seems to us more in keeping with the well recognized and settled principles of the law of municipal corporations." We, therefore, must regard the cases of <targetCase>Rogers</targetCase> v. <targetCase>Burlington</targetCase> and Mitchell v. <targetCase>Burlington</targetCase> , as overruled in the particular referred to, by later cases in this court. See 1 Dillon's Mun. Cor. 4th ed. §§ 507, 507 a. The case of Dwyer v. Hackworth, 57 Tex. 245 , is relied upon by the plaintiff.

Special Laws of Texas, pp. 14 and 23. Under the authority conferred by this charter the city council in 1879 passed an ordinance, entitled, "An ordinance to provide for the issue and sale of fifteen thousand dollars in coupon bonds of the city, to borrow money for general purposes." Bonds, negotiable in form, and to the full amount authorized by the ordinance, were issued by the city in 1879, and the coupons held by the German-American Bank were from the bonds so issued. The court does not hold that the issuing of these bonds was in violation of the constitution of Texas adopted in 1876. But it does hold that, while the city, under its power to borrow, could give to the lender non-negotiable paper as a "voucher" for the repayment of the money borrowed, it could not legally issue negotiable instruments or bonds as evidence of the loan. This view is conceded to be in conflict with Rogers v. Burlington, <targetCase>3 Wall. 654</targetCase> , and Mitchell v. <targetCase>Burlington</targetCase>, 4 Wall. 270 . But it is said that later *190 adjudications of this court have, in effect, overruled those cases. We cannot give our assent to the doctrine announced in the present case. Nor  we submit with some confidence  is that doctrine sustained by any decision of this court which has been cited. What was the case of <targetCase>Rogers</targetCase> v. <targetCase>Burlington</targetCase> ? Besides the general powers appertaining to municipal corporations, the city of Burlington had express power, by its charter, "to borrow money for any public purpose," the matter being first submitted to popular vote. The people having voted, by the requisite majority, in favor of issuing and lending $75,000 in the bonds of the city to a particular railroad company, bonds for that amount, negotiable in form, were issued. The court held the construction of a railroad to be a public purpose, within the meaning of the charter of the city, and that it made no difference whether the bonds were sold in the market by the officers of the municipality, or were first delivered to the company and sold by its agents for the same purpose. "Technically speaking," the court observed, "it may be said that the transaction, as between the company and the defendants, was, in form, a contract of lending; but as between the defendants and the persons who purchased the bonds in the market it was undeniably a contract of borrowing money; and the same remark applies to the transaction in its practical and legal effect upon all subsequent holders of the securities who have since become such for value, and in the usual course of business." The minority dissented, not upon the ground that an express power in a municipal corporation to borrow money did not give authority to execute negotiable instruments for the money borrowed  although that question was upon the very face of the case  but upon the ground that the transaction was not one of borrowing money. Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the minority, said: "Here the authority conferred is to borrow money; yet no money was borrowed, but the bonds of the city were lent. Borrowing money and lending credit are not convertible terms. The two things which they indicate are essentially distinct and different." Mr. Justice Miller, *191 in a separate dissenting opinion, called attention to the fact that the Supreme Court of Iowa had then recently held the bonds, involved in that suit, to be void, upon the ground that the transaction "was a loan of credit, and not a borrowing of money." The principle announced in <targetCase>Rogers</targetCase> v. <targetCase>Burlington</targetCase> was applied in Mitchell v. <targetCase>Burlington</targetCase>, 4 Wall. 270 . The cases, decided since <targetCase>Rogers</targetCase> v. <targetCase>Burlington</targetCase> , which have been cited, in the opinion of the court, as announcing the doctrine that an express power given to a municipal corporation to borrow money does not authorize the execution of negotiable instruments for the money so borrowed, are: Police Jury v. Britton, 15 Wall. 566 , 570, 572; Claiborne County v. Brooks, 111 U.S. 400 , 406; Concord v. Robinson, 121 U.S. 165 , 167; Kelley v. Milan, 127 U.S. 139 , 150; Norton v. Dyersburg, 127 U.S. 160 , 175; Young v. Clarendon, 132 U.S. 340 ; Hill v. Memphis, 134 U.S. 198 , 203; and Merrill v. Monticello, 138 U.S. 673 , 686, 687. In Police Jury v. Britton , it appeared that a police jury, in a parish of Louisiana, charged with the supervision and repair of roads, bridges, causeways, dikes, levees and other highways, was prohibited by statute from contracting any debt or pecuniary liability without fully providing in the ordinance creating the debt the means of paying the principal and interest of the debt so contracted. And the question arose as to whether it could rightfully issue negotiable bonds to take the place of certain orders previously given by it for work done on levees in the parish. The case involved no question as to the scope and effect of an express power in the parish to borrow money. Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, after observing that the police jury had no express authority to issue bonds, and that, if it existed, it must be implied from the general powers of local administration with which they were invested, said: "We have, therefore, the question directly presented in this case whether the trustees or representative officers of a parish, county or other local jurisdiction, invested with the usual powers of administration in specific matters, and the power of levying taxes to defray the necessary expenditures of the jurisdiction, have an implied authority to *192 issue negotiable securities, payable in future, of such a character as to be unimpeachable in the hands of bona fide holders, for the purpose of raising money or funding a previous indebtedness?" This question was answered in the negative.
**Combined Opinion**
The power has frequently been implied from other express powers granted. Thus, it has been held that the power to borrow money implies the power to issue the ordinary securities for its repayment, whether in the form of notes or bonds payable in future. " It thus appears that Police Jury v. Britton distinctly declares that case not to be within the rule that an express power to borrow money carries with it authority to issue negotiable securities for the amount borrowed. In Claiborne County v. Brooks , the question was whether the power in a county to contract for the erection of a court-house implied authority to issue negotiable bonds of a commercial character in payment for the work. The court, speaking again by Mr. Justice Bradley, held that it did not, and said: "Our opinion is, that mere political bodies, constituted as counties are, for the purpose of local police and administration, and having the power of levying taxes to defray all public charges created, whether they are or are not formally invested with corporate capacity, have no power or authority to make and utter commercial paper of any kind, unless such power is expressly conferred upon them by law, or clearly implied from some other power expressly given, which cannot be fairly exercised without it "  referring to the same clauses in the opinion in Police Jury v. Britton , above quoted, as embodying a distinct expression of the views of the court. In Concord v. Robinson , it was decided that "the grant to a municipal corporation of power to appropriate moneys in aid of the construction of a railroad, accompanied by a provision directing the levy and collection of taxes to meet such appropriation, and prescribing no other mode of payment," did not imply authority to issue negotiable bonds on account of such *193 appropriation; in Kelley v. Milan , that "a municipal corporation, in order to exercise the power of becoming a stockholder in a railroad corporation, must have such power expressly conferred upon it by a grant from the legislature, and that even the power to subscribe for such stock does not carry with it the power to issue negotiable bonds in payment of the subscription, unless the power to issue such bonds is expressly or by reasonable implication conferred by statute;" in Norton v. Dyersburg , that "the mere authority given to a municipality to subscribe for stock in a railroad company did not carry with it the implied power to issue bonds therefor, especially where, as in the present case, special provisions were made for paying the subscription by taxation;" in Young v. Clarendon Township , authority to make the municipal bonds there involved was conceded, and the case turned upon the question, whether their execution was not subject to the restrictions and directions of the act which authorized them to be issued; and in Hill v. Memphis , that "the power to subscribe for stock does not of itself include the power to issue bonds of a town in payment of it," and that "the inability of municipal corporations to issue negotiable paper for their indebtedness, however incurred, unless authority for that purpose is expressly given or necessarily implied for the execution of other express powers, has been approved in repeated decisions of this court." It thus appears that in no one of the above cases, decided since <targetCase>Rogers</targetCase> v. <targetCase>Burlington</targetCase> ; was there any question as to negotiable securities being issued under an express power to borrow money; and that some of them concede that such a power carries with it authority to give a negotiable paper for money borrowed. The case which seems to be much relied upon to support the present judgment is Merrill v. Monticello . But we submit that it does not sustain the broad doctrine that negotiable securities may not be issued in execution of an express power to borrow money. What could or could not be done, under such a power, was not a question involved in that case. The question was whether authority in the town of Monticello to issue negotiable bonds could be implied, not from an express, *194 but from an implied power to borrow money. After observing that, under the laws of Indiana, the proposition that a town has an implied authority to borrow money, or contract a loan, under the conditions, and in the manner expressly prescribed, was not to be controverted, the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Lamar, said: "But this only brings us back to the question, Does the implied power to borrow money or contract a loan carry with it a further implication of power to issue funding negotiable bonds, for that amount, and sell them in open market?" The question in that case, as framed by the court, clearly shows that it was only considering whether an authority in a municipal corporation to issue negotiable securities could be implied from a power to borrow which was itself to be implied from other powers granted.
**Combined Opinion**
It is City of Savannah v. Kelly, 108 U.S. 184 , 190. A railroad corporation, whose principal and beginning point was that city, issued its negotiable bonds upon which to raise money to pay debts for construction, and for future improvements. The city, owning some of the capital stock of the corporation, guaranteed the payment of those bonds. The bonds, so guaranteed, were put upon the market and sold. The question was as to the authority of the city to make this guaranty under the power conferred upon it by an act of the legislature, *195 "to obtain money on loan, on the faith and credit of said city, for the purposes of contributing to works of internal improvements." Mr. Justice Matthews, speaking for the court, said that the fact that the money "was not advanced directly to the city, but, upon its assurance of repayment, to the railroad company, is not a departure even from the letter of the law, much less from its meaning; nor does the fact that the money was advanced partly on the credit of the railroad company diminish the presumed reliance of the purchaser upon that of the city, with which it was joined. It is difficult to conceive of language more comprehensive than that employed, to embrace every form of security in which the faith and credit of the city might be embodied; and that in such cases it is not important to the character of the transaction that the money is obtained in the first instance by the railroad company, upon the credit of the city, was directly ruled in Rogers v. Burlington, <targetCase>3 Wall. 654</targetCase> , and affirmed in Town of Venice v. Murdock, 92 U.S. 494 ." Of course, if the city of Savannah, having the power "to obtain money on loan," could guarantee negotiable bonds, issued by the railroad company for the purpose of raising money to be contributed to works of internal improvement in which the city was interested, the city could have made the loan directly upon its own negotiable bonds. It is, perhaps, proper to say that our views find support in the admirable commentaries of Judge Dillon on the Law of Municipal Corporations. The court refers to sections 507 and 507 a of those Commentaries. But those sections do not, in any degree, support the conclusion reached in this case. The doctrine which the learned author declares, in those sections, to be alike unsound and dangerous, is, "that a public or municipal corporation possesses the implied power to borrow money for its ordinary purposes, and as incidental thereto the power to issue commercial securities, that is, paper which cuts off defences when it is in the hands of a holder for value acquired before it is due." But Judge Dillon, while agreeing that the power to issue commercial paper, unimpeachable in the hands of a bona fide holder, is not among the ordinary incidental powers of a public municipal corporation, and must be conferred *196 expressly, or by fair implication, says, after a careful review of the authorities: "Express power to borrow money, perhaps, in all cases, but especially if conferred to effect objects for which large or unusual sums are required, as, for example, subscriptions to aid railways and other public improvements, will ordinarily be taken, if there be nothing in the legislation to negative the inference, to include the power (the same as if conferred upon a corporation organized for pecuniary profit) to issue negotiable paper with all the incidents of negotiability."
