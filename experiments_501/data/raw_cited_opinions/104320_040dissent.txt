<p id="Aif">dissenting.</p>
<p id="b796-9">Petitioner, Hust, a fireman and watertender on the S. S. Mark Hanna, brought an action in an Oregon Circuit <page-number citation-index="1" label="739">*739</page-number>Court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against the respondent, the Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc. The suit was under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, the Jones Act, § 33.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It sought damages against the respondent as employer. As § 33 shows on its face, a seaman has the advantages of the Federal Employers’ Liability Act only against his employer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment of the Supreme Court of Oregon denying petitioner the right to recover in this action would then be correct unless the respondent is petitioner’s employer or unless congressional legislation since the Merchant Marine Act grants petitioner a right of recovery against respondent even though the employer-employee relationship does not exist.</p>
<p id="b797-4">The S. S. Mark Hanna, a Liberty ship, was owned by the United States. So far as appears from the record, it had never belonged to anyone else. Its operation was under the direction of the War Shipping Administration. In order to carry out its responsibilities, the Administration employed respondent as its General Agent to conduct the business of certain ships assigned to respondent for handling. From the excerpts from the contract, set out <page-number citation-index="1" label="740">*740</page-number>below, we think it clear that this was a conventional agency contract under which respondent managed certain matters connected with the ship for the United States. We think it clear, as did the Supreme Court of Oregon, that so far as the crew is concerned the respondent only procured the members, such as Hust, and made them available to the Master, a United States agent, for employment by said Master for the account of the United States.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Such a contract makes the United States the <page-number citation-index="1" label="741">*741</page-number>employer under the Merchant Marine Act, not the Master and not respondent, the General Agent. This is an action under the Merchant Marine Act and the question of liability of the respondent for any negligence under any other statute or rule of law, admiralty or otherwise, is not before us.</p>
<p id="b799-4">Since 1920, employees of the United States upon merchant vessels of the United States have had a right of action in admiralty against the vessels in all cases where the employees would have had a right if the vessel were privately owned or operated. This came from § 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This right of action was enforceable exclusively in admiralty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> There was no right to a trial and assessment of damages by a jury.</p>
<p id="b799-5">When the War Shipping Administration became the operator of practically the entire American merchant marine, doubts sometimes arose as to whether a particular vessel was a “merchant” vessel, operated by the United States or not. Therefore to clarify this situation and to assure all “employees of the United States through the War Shipping Administration” all “rights” for “injuries” applicable to seamen “employed on privately owned and operated American vessels,” Congress enacted an act to clarify the law relating to functions of the Administra<page-number citation-index="1" label="742">*742</page-number>tion. Provisions from the first section which are important here are set out below.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b800-6">As will be seen by an examination of the reports of the House and Senate<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> in connection with the specific requirement of the first section, <em>supra, </em>for enforcement of these rights, Congress declared its purpose in no uncertain terms to grant the power to enforce these rights only through the Suits in Admiralty Act. That is, the seaman could not submit his claim to a jury.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It will be noted that the words “right” and “status” are used with care, so that <page-number citation-index="1" label="743">*743</page-number>it is plain Congress intended to give all Administration seamen rights under the Merchant Marine Act and remedies under the Suits in Admiralty Act.</p>
<p id="b802-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="744">*744</page-number>As there might be instances where a seaman was an employee of the Administration but his boat was not a merchant vessel of the United States, the Clarification <page-number citation-index="1" label="745">*745</page-number>Act of March 24, 1943, was made retroactive to October 1, 1941.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Probably other compensation for injuries may have existed prior to the enactment of this Act.</p>
<p id="b803-4">It is said by the Court that if a seaman employed by the United States is limited to the remedies of the Suits in Admiralty Act for recovery in tort, the holding in <em>Emergency Fleet Corp. </em>v. <em>Lustgarten, </em>280 U. S. 320, is restored as a rule of law. The <em>Lustgarten </em>case was overruled by <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Roosevelt S. S. Co., </em>317 U. S. 575, 578. We think that this misconceives the effect of the <em>Brady </em>case. We do not think the requirement that seamen, employees of the United States, must seek their remedy against their employer under the Suits in Admiralty Act has any relation to the <em>Lustgarten </em>or <em>Brady </em>cases.</p>
<p id="b803-5">Lustgarten, a seaman, sought recovery at law for a tort against the Navigation Company, an agent of the United States. It was held that he could only recover under <page-number citation-index="1" label="746">*746</page-number>the Suits in Admiralty Act. In the <em>Brady </em>case, under a petition of a visitor to the boat to recover against a similar agent, it was held a cause of action in tort at law would lie. The <em>Lustgarten </em>case was overruled. The only effect of the <em>Brady </em>decision was to hold that actions could be maintained against agents of the United States at common law for the agent’s own torts. The case had nothing whatever to do with the right to recover against employers under the Jones Act. The opinion said, 317 U. S. at 577, “The sole question here is whether the Suits in Admiralty Act makes private operators such as respondent non-suable for their torts.” “The liability of an agent for his own negligence has long been embedded in the law.” <em>Id., </em>at 580. “But it is a <em>non sequitur </em>to say that because the Act takes away the remedy of libel <em>in rem </em>in all cases involving government vessels and restricts the remedies against the United States and its wholly owned corporations, it must be presumed to have abolished all right to proceed against all other parties.” <em>Id., </em>at 582. “The question is not whether the Commission had authority to delegate to respondent responsibilities for managing and operating the vessel as its agent. It is whether respondent can escape liability for a negligent exercise of that delegated power if we assume that by contract it will be exonerated or indemnified for any damages it must pay.” <em>Id., </em>at 583-84. The case was then sent back to the Circuit Court of Appeals to determine whether a cause of action against the agent was established. All that was meant or said in <em>Brady </em>about <em>Lustgarten </em>was that the <em>Lustgarten </em>case was in error in saying that a seaman could not sue an agent for the agent’s own tort. The <em>Brady </em>final statement on <em>Lustgarten </em>was, “Our conclusion, however, is that that position is untenable and that the <em>Lustgarten </em>case so far as it would prevent a private operator from being sued under the circumstances of this case <page-number citation-index="1" label="747">*747</page-number>must be considered as no longer controlling.” <em>Id., </em>at 578. There is no reason here why the petitioner should not sue respondent for its alleged tort. What petitioner is attempting is to hold respondent liable as employer for negligence of petitioner’s fellow servants, of petitioner’s superiors or the Master under the Merchant Marine Act. This it cannot do under this record.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b805-4">It is suggested that the respondent may be in the position of an employer, as a charterer or owner pro <em>hac vice. </em>But a charterer or owner pro <em>hac vice, </em>who is also an employer, is one who takes over “the exclusive possession, command, and navigation of the vessel.” <em>Reed </em>v. <em>United States, </em>11 Wall. 591, 600. That is a bareboat charter. Under the contract in this case, the respondent had no <page-number citation-index="1" label="748">*748</page-number>such authority. As we have pointed out above, and as the contract shows, he acted for the United States under its command and then only in certain matters not connected with actual navigation.</p>
<p id="b806-5">The Court does not challenge the respondent’s assertion that the Merchant Marine Act requires the employer-employee relationship. It is said, “But it does not follow from the fact that Hust was technically the Government’s employee that he lost all remedies against the operating ‘agent’ for such injuries as he incurred.” Certainly Hust did not lose his remedies against the agent for the agent’s torts. He still has those remedies but petitioner wishes to hold the agent as an employer. There is here no “disruption” of the normal and past relationship between seaman and employer. This Court errs, we think, in suggesting any seaman has been deprived of any right by the Clarification Act of 1943 under the construction of the Oregon Supreme Court. No seaman ever had a right of recovery under the Merchant Marine Act except against his employer. That the seaman still has.</p>
<p id="b806-6">What the Clarification Act does and what it obviously was intended to do, see notes 7 and 9, <em>supra, </em>was to continue the policy of requiring seamen who were employees of the United States to continue to vindicate those rights through the Suits in Admiralty Act. Congress has been generous in permitting seamen to recover in court against the United States for torts. It felt that the traditional proceeding in admiralty offered the best opportunity for justice to all such injured seamen when they were employees of the United States.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b806-7">A convenient summary of the attitude of the administrative agencies toward this problem is found in a letter of the War Shipping Administration to the National Labor <page-number citation-index="1" label="749">*749</page-number>Relations Board of October 20, 1942.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Such administrative determination is entitled to weight.</p>
<p id="b807-4">We think that the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court should be affirmed.</p>

<p id="b800-10"> This purpose is made plain by a few excerpts from the reports.</p>
<p id="b800-11">S. Rep. No. 62,78th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 5-6,11,14:</p>
<blockquote id="b800-12">“Seamen employed as Government employees on vessels owned by, or bareboat-chartered to, the War Shipping Administration are sometimes precluded from enforcing against the United States the rights and benefits in case of death, injury, illness, detention, and so on that would be available to them if employed by private employers, except under the Suits in Admiralty Act. If they were private employees, rights to redress for death, injury, or illness could be prosecuted under the Jones Act and the general maritime law. These same rights may be asserted against the <page-number citation-index="1" label="743">*743</page-number>United States as the employer under the Suits in Admiralty Act providing the vessel involved is a merchant vessel. In case of public vessels the seaman must rely for compensation upon the Administrator’s policy recognizing contractual liability which this legislation recognizes. Present-day operating conditions often make uncertain in some cases whether the vessel is a merchant or a public vessel. As a consequence, even though the vessels are generally merchant vessels and not public vessels, there are some cases in which the aforementioned rights of such seamen are in doubt. In addition to these rights which, at times, are uncertain for the reasons mentioned, the seamen who are employees of the United States probably have rights under the United States Employees’ Compensation Act in the event of injury or death. Such compensation benefits are not presently enjoyed by seamen under private employment. Thus vital differences in these rights are made to depend upon whether the seaman happens to be employed aboard a vessel time-chartered to the War Shipping Administration or owned by or bareboatchartered to the War Shipping Administration. Since seamen constantly change from one vessel to another, their rights for death, injury, or illness also constantly change, depending upon the relationship of the War Shipping Administration to the vessel. This fluctuation and lack of uniformity of rights leads to dependency of vital rights upon chance with a result of confusion and inequities. The bill is designed to remove this confusion and these inequities. The bill does not affect seamen employed on vessels time-chartered to the War Shipping Administration where the vessels are supplied with crews employed by the company from which the vessel is chartered. As to them their status and the status of the Government employees mentioned will be made uniform.</blockquote>

Such seamen will have the right to enforce claims for these benefits according to the procedure of the Suits in Admiralty Act, except that claims with respect to social-security benefits shall be prosecuted in accordance with the procedure provided in the social-security law. . . .</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b801-6">“The provision of the Suits in Admiralty Act that suit lies thereunder only if the ship involved is employed as a merchant vessel or a tugboat is waived for the purposes of section 1 so <page-number citation-index="1" label="744">*744</page-number>that the claim may be enforced regardless of the nature of the vessel on which the seaman is serving as an employee of the War Shipping Administration. To prevent unnecessary or premature litigation against the United States, it is required that before suit there shall be an administrative disallowance of the same in accord with rules or regulations to be prescribed by the Administrator, War Shipping Administration.”</blockquote>
<p id="b802-5">H. Rep. No. 107,78th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 3,21:</p>
<blockquote id="b802-6">“The basic scope and philosophy of the measure is to preserve private rights of seamen while utilizing the merchant marine to the utmost for public wartime benefit. Except in rare cases the ships themselves are being operated as merchant vessels, and are therefore subject to the Suits in Admiralty Act. Granting seamen rights to sue under that act is therefore entirely consistent with the underlying pattern of the measure. This should follow even in the extraordinary case where vessels might otherwise technically be classed as public vessels.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b802-7">“The various rights and remedies under statute and general maritime law with respect to death, injury, illness, and other casualty to seamen, have been rather fully set forth hereinabove. Under clause 2 of section 1 (a) these substantive rights would be governed by existing law relating to privately employed seamen. The only modification thereof arises from the remedial provision that they shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act. This procedure is appropriate in view of the fact that the suits will be against the Government of the United States. In such a suit no provision is made for a jury trial as may otherwise be had in a proceeding such as one under the Jones Act for reasons set forth in the letter of the Attorney General (September 14,1942). The provision of the Suits in Admiralty Act that suit lies thereunder only if the ship involved is employed as a merchant vessel or a tugboat is waived for the purposes of section 1 so that the claim may be enforced regardless of the nature of the vessel on which the seaman is serving as an employee of the War Shipping Administration. To prevent unnecessary or premature litigation against the United States, it is required that before suit there shall be an administrative disallowance of the same in accord with rules or regulations to be prescribed by the Administrator, War Shipping Administration.”</blockquote>
