**Combined Opinion**
Because the Pearce presumption "may operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus . . . block a legitimate response to criminal conduct," United States v. Goodwin, supra, at 373, we have limited its application, like that of "other `judicially created means of effectuating the rights secured by the [Constitution],' " to circumstances "where its `objectives are thought most efficaciously served,' " Texas v. McCullough, supra, at 138, quoting Stone v. Powell, 428 U.S. 465 , 482, 487 (1976). Such circumstances are those in which there is a "reasonable likelihood," United States v. Goodwin, supra, at 373, that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority. Where there is no such reasonable likelihood, the burden remains upon the defendant to prove actual vindictiveness, *800 see Wasman v. United States, 468 U.S. 559 , 569 (1984). In Colten v. Kentucky, <targetCase>407 U.S. 104</targetCase> (1972), for example, we refused to apply the presumption when the increased sentence was imposed by the second court in a two-tiered system which gave a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor in an inferior court the right to trial de novo in a superior court. We observed that the trial de novo represented a "completely fresh determination of guilt or innocence" by a court that was not being "asked to do over what it thought it had already done correctly." Id., at 117. If the de novo trial resulted in a greater penalty, we said that "it no more follows that such a sentence is a vindictive penalty . . . than that the inferior court imposed a lenient penalty."
