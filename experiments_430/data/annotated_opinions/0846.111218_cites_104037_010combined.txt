 Such a restraint may result as readily from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are otherwise independent." Id., at 227 .  The majority attempts to explain Yellow Cab by suggesting that it dealt only with unlawful acquisition of subsidiaries.  Ante, at 761-762.  But the Court mentioned acquisitions only as an additional consideration separate from the passage *780 quoted above, [1] and more important, the Court explicitly held that restraints imposed by the corporate parent on the affiliates that it already owned in themselves violated § 1.  [2] At least three cases involving the motion picture industry also recognize that affiliated corporations may combine or conspire within the meaning of § 1.  In United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., <citedDecision>323 U. S. 173</citedDecision> (1944), as the Court recognizes, ante, at 762, n. 6, the only conspirators were affiliated corporations.  The majority's claim that the case involved only unlawful acquisitions because of the Court's comments concerning divestiture of the affiliates cannot be squared with the passage immediately following that cited by the majority, which states that there had been unlawful conduct going beyond the acquisition of subsidiaries: "That principle is adequate here to justify divestiture of all interest in some of the affiliates since their acquisition was part of the fruits of the conspiracy.  But the relief need not, and under these facts should not, be so restricted [to divestiture].  The fact that the companies were affiliated induced joint action and agreement.  Common control was one of the instruments in bringing about unity of purpose and unity of action and in making the conspiracy effective.  If that affiliation continues, *781 there will be tempting opportunity for these exhibitors to continue to act in combination against the independents." <citedDecision>323 U. S., at 189-190</citedDecision> (emphasis supplied).  Similarly, in Schine Chain Theatres, Inc. v. United States, 334 U. S. 110 (1948), the Court held that concerted action by parents and subsidiaries constituted an unlawful conspiracy.  [3] That was also the holding in United States v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100, 109 (1948).  The majority's observation that in these cases there were alternative grounds that could have been used to reach the same result, ante, at 763, n. 8, disguises neither the fact that the holding that actually appears in these opinions rests on conspiracy between affiliated entities, nor that today's holding is inconsistent with what was actually held in these cases. In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211 (1951), the Court's holding was plain and unequivocal: "Respondents next suggest that their status as `mere instrumentalities of a single manufacturing-merchandizing unit' makes it impossible for them to have conspired in a manner forbidden by the Sherman Act.  But this suggestion runs counter to our past decisions that common ownership and control does not liberate corporations from the impact of the antitrust laws.  E. g. United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218 .  The rule is especially applicable where, as here, respondents hold themselves out as competitors."

[27] For example, in Yellow Cab the Court read the complaint as alleging that integration had assisted the parent in excluding competing manufacturers from the marketplace, 332 U. S., at 226-227 , leading the Court to conclude that "restraint of interstate trade was not only effected by the combination of the appellees but was the primary object of the combination." Id., at 227 .  Similarly, in Crescent Amusement the Court noted that corporate affiliation between exhibitors enhanced their buying power and "was one of the instruments in .  .  .  making the conspiracy effective" in excluding independents from the market.  <citedDecision>323 U. S., at 189-190</citedDecision> .  Thus, in both cases the Court found that the affiliation enhanced the ability of the parent corporation to exclude the competition of third parties, and hence raised entry *794 barriers faced by actual and potential competitors.  When conduct restrains trade not merely by integrating affiliated corporations but rather by restraining the ability of others to compete, that conduct has competitive significance drastically different from procompetitive integration.  [28] In these cases, the affiliation assisted exclusionary conduct; it was not the competitive equivalent of unilateral integration but instead generated power to restrain marketwide competition.  There are other ways in which corporate affiliation can operate to restrain competition.  A wholly owned subsidiary might market a "fighting brand" or engage in other predatory behavior that would be more effective if its ownership were concealed than if it was known that only one firm was involved.  A predator might be willing to accept the risk of bankrupting a subsidiary when it could not afford to let a division incur similar risks.

 It came into existence only for that purpose." In Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1 (1911), and United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106 (1911), the trust or holding company device brought together previously independent firms to lessen competition and achieve monopoly power.  Although the Court in the latter case suggested that the contracts between affiliated companies, and not merely the original combination, could be viewed as the conspiracy, id., at 184 , the Court left no doubt that "the combination in and of itself" was a restraint of trade and a monopolization, id., at 187 .  [5]  Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, post, at 779, 788, n. 18, our point is not that Yellow Cab found only the initial acquisition illegal; our point is that the illegality of the initial acquisition was a predicate for its holding that any postacquisition conduct violated the Act.  [6]  When discussing the fact that some of the affiliated Chicago operating companies did not compete to obtain exclusive transportation contracts held by another of the affiliated companies, the Court stated: "[T]he fact that the competition restrained is that between affiliated corporations cannot serve to negative the statutory violation where, as here, the affiliation is assertedly one of the means of effectuating the illegal conspiracy not to compete.  " 332 U. S., at 229 (emphasis added).  The passage quoted in text is soon followed by a cite to United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., <citedDecision>323 U. S. 173, 189</citedDecision> (1944).  Crescent Amusement found violations of §§ 1 and 2 by film exhibitors affiliated (in most cases) by 50 percent ownership.  The exhibitors used the monopoly power they possessed in certain towns to force film distributors to give them favorable terms in other towns.  The Court found it unnecessary to view the distributors as part of the conspiracy, id., at 183, so the Court plainly viewed the affiliated entities themselves as the conspirators.  The Crescent Amusement Court, however, in affirming an order of divestiture, noted that such a remedy was appropriate when "creation of the combination is itself the violation." Id., at 189.  This suggests that both Crescent Amusement and Yellow Cab, which cited the very page on which this passage appears, stand for a narrow rule based on the original illegality of the affiliation.  The dissent misconstrues a later passage in Crescent Amusement stating that divestiture need not be limited to those affiliates whose "acquisition was part of the fruits of the conspiracy," <citedDecision>323 U. S., at 189</citedDecision> .  See post, at 780-781.  This meant only that divestiture could apply to affiliates other than those who were driven out of business by the practices of the original conspirators and who were then acquired illegally to increase the combination's monopoly power.  See <citedDecision>323 U. S., at 181</citedDecision> .  It did not mean that affiliates acquired for lawful purposes were subject to divestiture.  [7] Appalachian Coals does state that the key question is whether there is an unreasonable restraint of trade or an attempt to monopolize.  "If there is, the combination cannot escape because it has chosen corporate form; and, if there is not, it is not to be condemned because of the absence of corporate integration." 288 U. S., at 377 .  Appalachian Coals, however, validated a cooperative selling arrangement among independent entities.  The statement that intracorporate relationships would be subject to liability under § 1 is thus dictum.

 As the first word of the sentence indicates, the Court's following statement: "Similarly, any affiliation or integration flowing from an illegal conspiracy cannot insulate the conspirators from the sanctions which Congress has imposed," 332 U. S., at 227 , expresses a separate if related point.  [2]  "[B]y preventing the cab operating companies under their control from purchasing cabs from manufacturers other than CCM, the appellees deny those companies the opportunity to purchase cabs in a free, competitive market.  The Sherman Act has never been thought to sanction such a conspiracy to restrain the free purchase of goods in interstate commerce." Id., at 226-227 (footnote omitted).  [3]  "[T]he combining of the open and closed towns for the negotiation of films for the circuit was a restraint of trade and the use of monopoly power in violation of § 1 and § 2 of the Act.  The concerted action of the parent company, its subsidiaries, and the named officers and directors in that endeavor was a conspiracy which was not immunized by reason of the fact that the members were closely affiliated rather than independent.  See United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218, 227 ; United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., <citedDecision>323 U. S. 173</citedDecision> ." 334 U. S., at 116.  [4]  In Kiefer-Stewart, Seagram unsuccessfully argued that Yellow Cab was confined to cases concerning unlawful acquisitions, see Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1950, No. 297, p. 21.  Thus the Kiefer-Stewart Court considered and rejected exactly the same argument embraced by today's majority.  [5]  "The fact that there is common ownership or control of the contracting corporations does not liberate them from the impact of the antitrust laws.  E. g., Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, [340 U. S.,] at 215.  Nor do we find any support in reason or authority for the proposition that agreements between legally separate persons and companies to suppress competition among themselves and others can be justified by labeling the project a `joint venture.'
