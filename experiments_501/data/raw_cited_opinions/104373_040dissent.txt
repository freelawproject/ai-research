<p id="b87-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="29">*29</page-number>I cannot believe that the great author of those words, or the men who made them law, could have joined in this decision. Neither so high nor so impregnable today as yesterday is the wall raised between church and state by Virginia’s great statute of religious freedom and the First Amendment, now made applicable to all the states by the Fourteenth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> New Jersey’s statute sustained is the first, if indeed it is not the second breach to be made by this Court’s action. That a third, and a fourth, and still others will be attempted, we may be sure. For just as <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>281 U. S. 370, has opened the way by oblique ruling<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for this decision, so will the two make wider the breach for a third. Thus with time the most solid freedom steadily gives way before continuing corrosive decision.</p>
<p id="b87-4">This case forces us to determine squarely for the first time<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> what was “an establishment of religion” in the First Amendment’s conception; and by that measure to decide whether New Jersey’s action violates its command. The facts may be stated shortly, to give setting and color to the constitutional problem.</p>
<p id="b87-5">By statute New Jersey has authorized local boards of education to provide for the transportation of children “to and from school other than a public school” except one <page-number citation-index="1" label="30">*30</page-number>operated for profit wholly or in part, over established public school routes, or by other means when the child lives “remote from any school.”<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The school board of Ewing Township has provided by resolution for “the transportation of pupils of Ewing to the Trenton and Pennington High Schools and Catholic Schools by way of public carrier . ...”<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b88-6">Named parents have paid the cost of public conveyance of their children from their homes in Ewing to three public high schools and four parochial schools outside the district.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Semiannually the Board has reimbursed the parents from public school funds raised by general taxation. Religion is taught as part of the curriculum-in each <page-number citation-index="1" label="31">*31</page-number>of the four private schools, as appears affirmatively by the testimony of the superintendent of parochial schools in the Diocese of Trenton.</p>
<p id="b89-4">The Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey, reversing the Supreme Court’s decision, 132 N. J. L. 98, 39 A. 2d 75, has held the Ewing board’s action not in contravention of the state constitution or statutes or of the Federal Constitution. 133 N. J. L. 350, 44 A. 2d 333. We have to consider only whether this ruling accords with the prohibition of the First Amendment implied in the due process clause of the Fourteenth.</p>
<p id="b89-5">I.</p>
<p id="b89-6">Not simply an established church, but any law respecting an establishment of religion is forbidden. The Amendment was broadly but not loosely phrased. It is the compact and exact summation of its author’s views formed during his long struggle for religious freedom. In Madison’s own words characterizing Jefferson’s Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, the guaranty he put in our national charter, like the bill he piloted through the Virginia Assembly, was “a Model of technical precision, and perspicuous brevity.”<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Madison could not have confused “church” and “religion,” or “an established church” and “an establishment of religion.”</p>
<p id="b89-7">The Amendment’s purpose was not to strike merely at the official establishment of a single sect, creed or religion, outlawing only a formal relation such as had prevailed in England and some of the colonies. Necessarily it was to uproot all such relationships. But the object was broader than separating church and state in this narrow sense. It was to create a complete and permanent separation of the <page-number citation-index="1" label="32">*32</page-number>spheres of religious activity and civil authority by comprehensively forbidding every form of public aid or support for religion. In proof the Amendment’s wording and history unite with this Court’s consistent utterances whenever attention has been fixed directly upon the question.</p>
<p id="b90-5">“Religion” appears only once in the Amendment. But the word governs two prohibitions and governs them alike. It does not have two meanings, one narrow to forbid “an establishment” and another, much broader, for securing “the free exercise thereof.” “Thereof” brings down “religion” with its entire and exact content, no more and no less, from the first into the second guaranty, so that Congress and now the states are as broadly restricted concerning the one as they are regarding the other.</p>
<p id="b90-6">No one would claim today that the Amendment is constricted, in “prohibiting the free exercise” of religion, to securing the free exercise of some formal or creedal observance, of one sect or of many. It secures all forms of religious expression, creedal, sectarian or nonsectarian, wherever and however taking place, except conduct which trenches upon the like freedoms of others or clearly and presently endangers the community’s good order and security.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For the protective purposes of this phase of the basic freedom, street preaching, oral or by distribution of <page-number citation-index="1" label="33">*33</page-number>literature, has been given “the same high estate under the First Amendment as . . . worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits.”<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> And on this basis parents have been held entitled to send their children to private, religious schools. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, </em>268 U. S. 510. Accordingly, daily religious education commingled with secular is “religion” within the guaranty’s comprehensive scope. So are religious training and teaching in whatever form. The word connotes the broadest content, determined not by the form or formality of the teaching or where it occurs, but by its essential nature regardless of those details.</p>
<p id="b91-4">“Religion” has the same broad significance in the twin prohibition concerning “an establishment.” The Amendment was not duplicitous. “Religion” and “establishment” were not used in any formal or technical sense. The prohibition broadly forbids state support, financial or other, of religion in any guise, form or degree. It outlaws all use of public funds for religious purposes.</p>
<p id="b91-5">II.</p>
<p id="b91-6">No provision of the Constitution is more closely tied to or given content by its generating history than the religious clause of the First Amendment. It is at once the refined product and the terse summation of that history. The history includes not only Madison’s authorship and the proceedings before the First Congress, but also the long and intensive struggle for religious freedom in America, more especially in Virginia,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of which the Amend<page-number citation-index="1" label="34">*34</page-number>ment was the direct culmination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In the documents of the times, particularly of Madison, who was leader in the Virginia struggle before he became the Amendment’s sponsor, but also in the writings of Jefferson and others and in the issues which engendered them is to be found irrefutable confirmation of the Amendment’s sweeping content.</p>
<p id="b92-6">For Madison, as also for Jefferson, religious freedom was the crux of the struggle for freedom in general. Remonstrance, Par. 15, Appendix hereto. Madison was coauthor with George Mason of the religious clause in Virginia’s great Declaration of Rights of 1776. He is credited with changing it from a mere statement of the principle of tolerance to the first official legislative pronouncement that freedom of conscience and religion are inherent rights of the individual.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He sought also to have the Declara<page-number citation-index="1" label="35">*35</page-number>tion expressly condemn the existing Virginia establishment.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But the forces supporting it were then too strong.</p>
<p id="b93-4">Accordingly Madison yielded on this phase but not for long. At once he resumed the fight, continuing it before succeeding legislative sessions. As a member of the General Assembly in 1779 he threw his full weight behind Jefferson’s historic Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom. That bill was a prime phase of Jefferson’s broad program of democratic reform undertaken on his return from the Continental Congress in 1776 and submitted for the General Assembly’s consideration in 1779 as his proposed revised Virginia code.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With Jefferson’s departure for Europe in 1784, Madison became the Bill’s prime <page-number citation-index="1" label="36">*36</page-number>sponsor.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Enactment failed in successive legislatures from its introduction in June, 1779, until its adoption in January, 1786. But during all this time the fight for religious freedom moved forward in Virginia on various fronts with growing intensity. Madison led throughout, against Patrick Henry’s powerful opposing leadership until Henry was elected governor in November, 1784.</p>
<p id="b94-6">The climax came in the legislative struggle of 1784-1785 over the Assessment Bill. See Supplemental Appendix hereto. This was nothing more nor less than a taxing measure for the support of religion, designed to revive the payment of tithes suspended since 1777. So long as it singled out a particular sect for preference it incurred the active and general hostility of dissentient groups. It was broadened to include them, with the result that some subsided temporarily in their opposition.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> As altered, the bill gave to each taxpayer the privilege of designating which church should receive his share of the tax. In default of designation the legislature applied it to pious uses.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But what is of the utmost significance here, “in <page-number citation-index="1" label="37">*37</page-number>its final form the bill left the taxpayer the option of giving his tax to education.”<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b95-4">Madison was unyielding at all times, opposing with all his vigor the general and nondiscriminatory as he had the earlier particular and discriminatory assessments proposed. The modified Assessment Bill passed second reading in December, 1784, and was all but enacted. Madison and his followers, however, maneuvered deferment of final consideration until November, 1785. And before the Assembly reconvened in the fall he issued his historic Memorial and Remonstrance.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b95-5">This is Madison’s complete, though not his only, interpretation of religious liberty.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It is a broadside attack upon all forms of “establishment” of religion, both general and particular, nondiscriminatory or selective. Reflecting not only the many legislative conflicts over the Assessment Bill and the Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom but also, for example, the struggles for religious incorporations and the continued maintenance of the glebes, the Remonstrance is at once the most concise and the most accurate statement of the views of the First Amendment’s author concerning what is “an establishment of religion.” Because it behooves us in the dimming distance of time not <page-number citation-index="1" label="38">*38</page-number>to lose sight of what he and his coworkers had in mind when, by a single sweeping stroke of the pen, they forbade an establishment of religion and secured its free exercise, the text of the Remonstrance is appended at the end of this opinion for its wider current reference, together with a copy of the bill against which it was directed.</p>
<p id="b96-5">The Remonstrance, stirring up a storm of popular protest, killed the Assessment Bill.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It collapsed in committee shortly before Christmas, 1785. With this, the way was cleared at last for enactment of Jefferson’s Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom. Madison promptly drove it through in January of 1786, seven years from the time it was first introduced. This dual victory substantially ended the fight over establishments, settling the issue against them. See note 33.</p>
<p id="b96-6">The next year Madison became a member of the Constitutional Convention. Its work done, he fought valiantly to secure the ratification of its great product in Virginia as elsewhere, and nowhere else more effectively.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Madison was certain in his own mind that under the Constitution “there is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion”<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and that “this subject is, for the honor of America, perfectly free and <page-number citation-index="1" label="39">*39</page-number>unshackled. The government has no jurisdiction over it . . . .”<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Nevertheless he pledged that he would work for a Bill of Rights, including a specific guaranty of religious freedom, and Virginia, with other states, ratified the Constitution on this assurance.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b97-4">Ratification thus accomplished, Madison was sent to the first Congress. There he went at once about performing his pledge to establish freedom for the nation as he had done in Virginia. Within a little more than three years from his legislative victory at home he had proposed and secured the submission and ratification of the First Amendment as the first article of our Bill of Rights.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b97-5">All the great instruments of the Virginia struggle for religious liberty thus became warp and woof of our constitutional tradition, not simply by the course of history, but by the common unifying force of Madison’s life, thought and sponsorship. He epitomized the whole of that tradition in the Amendment’s compact, but nonetheless comprehensive, phrasing.</p>
<p id="b97-6">As the Remonstrance discloses throughout, Madison opposed every form and degree of official relation between religion and civil authority. For him religion was a wholly private matter beyond the scope of civil power <page-number citation-index="1" label="40">*40</page-number>either to restrain or to support.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Denial or abridgment of religious freedom was a violation of rights both of conscience and of natural equality. State aid was no less obnoxious or destructive to freedom and to religion itself than other forms of state interference. “Establishment” and “free exercise” were correlative and coextensive ideas, representing only different facets of the single great and fundamental freedom. The Remonstrance, following the Virginia statute’s example, referred to the history of religious conflicts and the effects of all sorts of establishments, current and historical, to suppress religion’s free exercise. With Jefferson, Madison believed that to tolerate any fragment of establishment would be by so much to perpetuate restraint upon that freedom. Hence he sought to tear out the institution not partially but root and branch, and to bar its return forever.</p>
<p id="b98-5">In no phase was he more unrelentingly absolute than in opposing state support or aid by taxation. Not even “three pence” contribution was thus to be exacted from any citizen for such a purpose. Remonstrance, Par. 3.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="41">*41</page-number>Tithes had been the lifeblood of establishment before and after other compulsions disappeared. Madison and his coworkers made no exceptions or abridgments to the complete separation they created. Their objection was not to small tithes. It was to any tithes whatsoever. “If it were lawful to impose a small tax for religion, the admission would pave the way for oppressive levies.”<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Not the amount but “the principle of assessment was wrong.” And the principle was as much to prevent “the interference of law in religion” as to restrain religious intervention in political matters.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In this field the authors of our freedom would not tolerate “the first experiment on our liberties” or “wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled the question in precedents.” Remonstrance, Par. 3. Nor should we.</p>
<p id="b99-4">In view of this history no further proof is needed that the Amendment forbids any appropriation, large or small, from public funds to aid or support any and all religious exercises. But if more were called for, the debates in the First Congress and this Court’s consistent expressions, whenever it has touched on the matter directly,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> supply it.</p>
<p id="b100-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="42">*42</page-number>By contrast with the Virginia history, the congressional debates on consideration of the Amendment reveal only sparse discussion, reflecting the fact that the essential issues had been settled.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Indeed the matter had become so well understood as to have been taken for granted in all but formal phrasing. Hence, the only enlightening reference shows concern, not to preserve any power to use public funds in aid of religion, but to prevent the Amendment from outlawing private gifts inadvertently by virtue of the breadth of its wording.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In the <page-number citation-index="1" label="43">*43</page-number>margin are noted also the principal decisions in which expressions of this Court confirm the Amendment’s broad prohibition.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b102-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="44">*44</page-number>III.</p>
<p id="b102-5">Compulsory attendance upon religious exercises went out early in the process of separating church and state, together with forced observance of religious forms and ceremonies.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Test oaths and religious qualification for office followed later.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> These things none devoted to our great tradition of religious liberty would think of bringing back. Hence today, apart from efforts to inject religious training or exercises and sectarian issues into the public schools, the only serious surviving threat to maintaining that complete and permanent separation of religion and civil power which the First Amendment commands is through use of the taxing power to support religion, religious establishments, or establishments having a religious foundation whatever their form or special religious function.</p>
<p id="b102-6">Does New Jersey’s action furnish support for religion by use of the taxing power? Certainly it does, if the test remains undiluted as Jefferson and Madison made it, that money taken by taxation from one is not to be used or given to support another’s religious training or belief, or indeed one’s own.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Today as then the furnishing of “con<page-number citation-index="1" label="45">*45</page-number>tributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves” is the forbidden exaction; and the prohibition is absolute for whatever measure brings that consequence and whatever amount may be sought or given to that end.</p>
<p id="b103-4">The funds used here were raised by taxation. The Court does not dispute, nor could it, that their use does in fact give aid and encouragement to religious instruction. It only concludes that this aid is not “support” in law. But Madison and Jefferson were concerned with aid and support in fact, not as a legal conclusion “entangled in precedents.” Remonstrance, Par. 3. Here parents pay money to send their children to parochial schools and funds raised by taxation are used to reimburse them. This not only helps the children to get to school and the parents to send them. It aids them in a substantial way to get the very thing which they are sent to the particular school to secure, namely, religious training and teaching.</p>
<p id="b103-5">Believers of all faiths, and others who do not express their feeling toward ultimate issues of existence in any creedal form, pay the New Jersey tax. When the money so raised is used to pay for transportation to religious schools, the Catholic taxpayer to the extent of his proportionate share pays for the transportation of Lutheran, Jewish and otherwise religiously affiliated children to receive their non-Catholic religious instruction. Their parents likewise pay proportionately for the transportation of Catholic children to receive Catholic instruction. Each thus contributes to “the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves” in so far as their religions differ, as do others who accept no creed without regard to those differences. Each <page-number citation-index="1" label="46">*46</page-number>thus pays taxes also to support the teaching of his own religion, an exaction equally forbidden since it denies “the comfortable liberty” of giving one’s contribution to the particular agency of instruction he approves.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b104-6">New Jersey’s action therefore exactly fits the type of exaction and the kind of evil at which Madison and Jefferson struck. Under the test they framed it cannot be said that the cost of transportation is no part of the cost of education or of the religious instruction given. That it is a substantial and a necessary element is shown most plainly by the continuing and increasing demand for the state to assume it. Nor is there pretense that it relates only to the secular instruction given in religious schools or that any attempt is or could be made toward allocating proportional shares as between the secular and the religious instruction. It is precisely because the instruction is religious and relates to a particular faith, whether one or another, that parents send their children to religious schools under the <em>Pierce </em>doctrine. And the very purpose of the state’s contribution is to defray the cost of conveying the pupil to the place where he will receive not simply secular, but also and primarily religious, teaching and guidance.</p>
<p id="b104-7">Indeed the view is sincerely avowed by many of various faiths,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> that the basic purpose of all education is or should be religious, that the secular cannot be and should not be separated from the religious phase and emphasis. Hence, <page-number citation-index="1" label="47">*47</page-number>the inadequacy of public or secular education and the necessity for sending the child to a school where religion is taught. But whatever may be the philosophy or its justification, there is undeniably an admixture of religious with secular teaching in all such institutions. That is the very reason for their being. Certainly for purposes of constitutionality we cannot contradict the whole basis of the ethical and educational convictions of people who believe in religious schooling.</p>
<p id="b105-4">Yet this very admixture is what was disestablished when the First Amendment forbade “an establishment of religion.” Commingling the religious with the secular teaching does not divest the whole of its religious permeation and emphasis or make them of minor part, if proportion were material. Indeed, on any other view, the constitutional prohibition always could be brought to naught by adding a modicum of the secular.</p>
<p id="b105-5">An appropriation from the public treasury to pay the cost of transportation to Sunday school, to weekday special classes at the church or parish house, or to the meetings of various young people’s religious societies, such as the Y. M. C. A., the Y. W. C. A., the Y. M. H. A., the Epworth League, could not withstand the constitutional attack. This would be true, whether or not secular activities were mixed with the religious. If such an appropriation could not stand, then it is hard to see how one becomes valid for the same thing upon the more extended scale of daily instruction. Surely constitutionality does not turn on where or how often the mixed teaching occurs.</p>
<p id="b105-6">Finally, transportation, where it is needed, is as essential to education as any other element. Its cost is as much a part of the total expense, except at times in amount, as the cost of textbooks, of school lunches, of athletic equipment, of writing and other materials; indeed of all other <page-number citation-index="1" label="48">*48</page-number>items composing the total burden. Now as always the core of the educational process is the teacher-pupil relationship. Without this the richest equipment and facilities would go for naught. See <em>Judd </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>278 N. Y. 200, 212, 15 N. E. 2d 576, 582. But the proverbial Mark Hopkins conception no longer suffices for the country’s requirements. Without buildings, without equipment, without library, textbooks and other materials, and without transportation to bring teacher and pupil together in such an effective teaching environment, there can be not even the skeleton of what our times require. Hardly can it be maintained that transportation is the least essential of these items, or that it does not in fact aid, encourage, sustain and support, just as they do, the very process which is its purpose to accomplish. No less essential is it, or the payment of its cost, than the very teaching in the classroom or payment of the teacher’s sustenance. Many types of equipment, now considered essential, better could be done without.</p>
<p id="b106-6">For me, therefore, the feat is impossible to select so indispensable an item from the composite of total costs, and characterize it as not aiding, contributing to, promoting or sustaining the propagation of beliefs which it is the very end of all to bring about. Unless this can be maintained, and the Court does not maintain it, the aid thus given is outlawed. Payment of transportation is no more, nor is it any the less essential to education, whether religious or secular, than payment for tuitions, for teachers’ salaries, for buildings, equipment and necessary materials. Nor is it any the less directly related, in a school giving religious instruction, to the primary religious objective all those essential items of cost are intended to achieve. No rational line can be drawn between payment for such larger, but not more necessary, items and payment for transportation. The only line that can be so drawn is one between more dollars and less. Certainly in this <page-number citation-index="1" label="49">*49</page-number>realm such a line can be no valid constitutional measure. <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>319 U. S. 105; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>323 U. S. 516.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Now, as in Madison’s time, not the amount but the principle of assessment is wrong. Remonstrance, Par. 3.</p>
<p id="b107-4">IV.</p>
<p id="b107-5">But we are told that the New Jersey statute is valid in its present application because the appropriation is for a public, not a private purpose, namely, the promotion of education, and the majority accept this idea in the conclusion that all we have here is “public welfare legislation.” If that is true and the Amendment’s force can be thus destroyed, what has been said becomes all the more pertinent. For then there could be no possible objection tó more extensive support of religious education by New Jersey.</p>
<p id="b107-6">If the fact alone be determinative that religious schools are engaged in education, thus promoting the general and individual welfare, together with the legislature’s decision that the payment of public moneys for their aid makes their work a public function, then I can see no possible basis, except one of dubious legislative policy, for the state’s refusal to make full appropriation for support of private, religious schools, just as is done for public <page-number citation-index="1" label="50">*50</page-number>instruction. There could not be, on that basis, valid constitutional objection.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b108-5">Of course paying the cost of transportation promotes the general cause of education and the welfare of the individual. So does paying all other items of educational expense. And obviously, as the majority say, it is much too late to urge that legislation designed to facilitate the opportunities of children to secure a secular education serves no public purpose. Our nation-wide system of public education rests on the contrary view, as do all grants in aid of education, public or private, which is not religious in character.</p>
<p id="b108-6">These things are beside the real question. They have no possible materiality except to obscure the all-pervading, inescapable issue. <em>Cf. Cochran </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra. </em>Stripped of its religious phase, the case presents no substantial federal question. <em>Ibid. </em>The public function argument, by casting the issue in terms of promoting the general cause of education and the welfare of the individual, ignores the religious factor and its essential connection with the transportation, thereby leaving out the only vital element in the case. So of course do the “public welfare” and “social legislation” ideas, for they come to the same thing.</p>
<p id="b109-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="51">*51</page-number>We have here then one substantial issue, not two. To say that New Jersey’s appropriation and her use of the power of taxation for raising the funds appropriated are not for public purposes but are for private ends, is to say that they are for the support of religion and religious teaching. Conversely, to say that they are for public purposes is to say that they are not for religious ones.</p>
<p id="b109-4">This is precisely for the reason that education which includes religious training and teaching, and its support, have been made matters of private right and function, not public, by the very terms of the First Amendment. That is the effect not only in its guaranty of religion’s free exercise, but also in the prohibition of establishments. It was on this basis of the private character of the function of religious education that this Court held parents entitled to send their children to private, religious schools. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Society of Sisters, supra. </em>Now it declares in effect that the appropriation of public funds to defray part of the cost of attending those schools is for a public purpose. If so, I do not understand why the state cannot go farther or why this case approaches the verge of its power.</p>
<p id="b109-5">In truth this view contradicts the whole purpose and effect of the First Amendment as heretofore conceived. The “public function”—“public welfare”—“social legislation” argument seeks, in Madison’s words, to “employ Religion [that is, here, religious education] as an engine of Civil policy.” Remonstrance, Par. 5. It is of one piece with the Assessment Bill’s preamble, although with the vital difference that it wholly ignores what that preamble explicitly states.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b110-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="52">*52</page-number>Our constitutional policy is exactly the opposite. It does not deny the value or the necessity for religious training, teaching or observance. Rather it secures their free exercise. But to that end it does deny that the state can undertake or sustain them in any form or degree. For this reason the sphere of religious activity, as distinguished from the secular intellectual liberties, has been given the twofold protection and, as the state cannot forbid, neither can it perform or aid in performing the religious function. The dual prohibition makes that function altogether private. It cannot be made a public one by legislative act. This was the very heart of Madison’s Remonstrance, as it is of the Amendment itself.</p>
<p id="b110-6">It is not because religious teaching does not promote the public or the individual’s welfare, but because neither is furthered when the state promotes religious education, that the Constitution forbids it to do so. Both legislatures and courts are bound by that distinction. In failure to observe it lies the fallacy of the “public function”— “social legislation” argument, a fallacy facilitated by easy transference of the argument’s basing from due process unrelated to any religious aspect to the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="b110-7">By no declaration that a gift of public money to religious uses will promote the general or individual welfare, or the cause of education generally, can legislative bodies overcome the Amendment’s bar. Nor may the courts sustain their attempts to do so by finding such consequences for appropriations which in fact give aid to or promote religious uses. Cf. <em>Norris </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>294 U. S. 587, 590; <em>Hooven &amp; Allison Co. </em>v. <em>Evatt, </em>324 U. S. 652, 659; <em>Akins </em>v. <em>Texas, </em>325 U. S. 398, 402. Legislatures are free to make, <page-number citation-index="1" label="53">*53</page-number>and courts to sustain, appropriations only when it can be found that in fact they do not aid, promote, encourage or sustain religious teaching or observances, be the amount large or small. No such finding has been or could be made in this case. The Amendment has removed this form of promoting the public welfare from legislative and judicial competence to make a public function. It is exclusively a private affair.</p>
<p id="b111-4">The reasons underlying the Amendment’s policy have not vanished with time or diminished in force. Now as when it was adopted the price of religious freedom is double. It is that the church and religion shall live both within and upon that freedom. There cannot be freedom of religion, safeguarded by the state, and intervention by the church or its agencies in the state’s domain or dependency on its largesse. Madison’s Remonstrance, Par. 6, 8.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The great condition of religious liberty is that it be maintained free from sustenance, as also from other interferences, by the state. For when it comes to rest upon that secular foundation it vanishes with the resting. <em>Id., </em>Par. 7, 8.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Public money devoted to payment of religious costs, educational or other, brings the quest for more. It brings too the struggle of sect against sect for the larger share or for any. Here one by numbers alone will benefit most, there another. That is precisely the history of societies which have had an established religion and dissident <page-number citation-index="1" label="54">*54</page-number>groups. <em>Id., </em>Par. 8, 11. It is the very thing Jefferson and Madison experienced and sought to guard against, whether in its blunt or in its more screened forms. <em>Ibid. </em>The end of such strife cannot be other than to destroy the cherished liberty. The dominating group will achieve the dominant benefit; or all will embroil the state in their dissensions. <em>Id., </em>Par. II.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b112-6">Exactly such conflicts have centered of late around providing transportation to religious schools from public funds.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> The issue and the dissension work typically, in Madison’s phrase, to “destroy that moderation and harmony which the forbearance of our laws to intermeddle with Religion, has produced amongst its several sects.” <em>Id., </em>Par. 11. This occurs, as he well knew, over measures <page-number citation-index="1" label="55">*55</page-number>at. the very threshold of departure from the principle. <em>Id., </em>Par. 3, 9, 11.</p>
<p id="b113-4">In these conflicts wherever success has been obtained it has been upon the contention that by providing the transportation the general cause of education, the general welfare, and the welfare of the individual will be forwarded; hence that the matter lies within the realm of public function, for legislative determination.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> State courts have divided upon the issue, some taking the view that only the individual, others that the institution receives the benefit.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> A few have recognized that this dichotomy is false, that both in fact are aided.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b114-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="56">*56</page-number>The majority here does not accept in terms any of those views. But neither does it deny that the individual or the school, or indeed both, are benefited directly and substantially.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> To do so would cut the ground from under the public function—social legislation thesis. On the contrary, the opinion concedes that the children are aided by being helped to get to the religious schooling. By converse necessary implication‘as well as by the absence of express denial, it must be taken to concede also that the school is helped to reach the child with its religious teaching. The religious enterprise is common to both, as is the interest in having transportation for its religious purposes provided.</p>
<p id="b114-6">Notwithstanding the recognition that this two-way aid is given and the absence of any denial that religious teaching is thus furthered, the Court concludes that the aid so given is not “support” of religion. It is rather only support of education as such, without reference to its religious content, and thus becomes public welfare legislation. To this elision of the religious element from the case is added gloss in two respects, one that the aid extended partakes of the nature of a safety measure, the other that failure to provide it wrould make the state unneutral in religious matters, discriminating against or hampering such children concerning public benefits all others receive.</p>
<p id="b115-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="57">*57</page-number>As will be noted, the one gloss is contradicted by the facts of record and the other is of whole cloth with the “public function” argument’s excision of the religious factor.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> But most important is that this approach, if valid, supplies a ready method for nullifying the Amendment’s guaranty, not only for this case and others involving small grants in aid for religious education, but equally for larger ones. The only thing needed will be for the Court again to transplant the “public welfare—public function” view from its proper nonreligious due process bearing to First Amendment application, holding that religious education is not “supported” though it may be aided by the appropriation, and that the cause of education generally is furthered by helping the pupil to secure that type of training.</p>
<p id="b115-4">This is not therefore just a little case over bus fares. In paraphrase of Madison, distant as it may be in its present form from a complete establishment of religion, it differs from it only in degree; and is the first step in that direction. <em>Id., </em>Par. 9.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Today as in his time “the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only ... for the support of any one [religious] establishment, may force him” to pay more; or “to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever.” And now, as then, “either ... we must say, that the will of the Legislature is the only measure of their authority; and that in the plenitude of this authority, they may sweep away all our fundamental rights; or, that they are bound to leave this particular right untouched and sacred.” Remonstrance, Par. 15.</p>
<p id="b115-5">The realm of religious training and belief remains, as the Amendment made it, the kingdom of the individual <page-number citation-index="1" label="58">*58</page-number>man and his God. It should be kept inviolately private, not “entangled ... in precedents”<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> or confounded with what legislatures legitimately may take over into the public domain.</p>
<p id="b116-6">V.</p>
<p id="b116-7">No one conscious of religious values can be unsympathetic toward the burden which our constitutional separation puts on parents who desire religious instruction mixed with secular for their children. They pay taxes for others’ children’s education, at the same time the added cost of instruction for their own. Nor can one happily see benefits denied to children which others receive, because in conscience they or their parents for them desire a different kind of training others do not demand.</p>
<p id="b116-8">But if those feelings should prevail, there would be an end to our historic constitutional policy and command. No more unjust or discriminatory in fact is it to deny attendants at religious schools the cost of their transportation than it is to deny them tuitions, sustenance for their teachers, or any other educational expense which others receive at public cost. Hardship in fact there is which none can blink. But, for assuring to those who undergo it the greater, the most comprehensive freedom, it is one written by design and firm intent into our basic law.</p>
<p id="b116-9">Of course discrimination in the legal sense does not exist. The child attending the religious school has the same right as any other to attend the public school. But he foregoes exercising it because the same guaranty which assures this freedom forbids the public school or any agency of the <page-number citation-index="1" label="59">*59</page-number>state to give or aid him in securing the religious instruction he seeks.</p>
<p id="b117-4">Were he to accept the common school, he would be the first to protest the teaching there of any creed or faith not his own. And it is precisely for the reason that their atmosphere is wholly secular that children are not sent to public schools under the <em>Pierce </em>doctrine. But that is a constitutional necessity, because we have staked the very existence of our country on the faith that complete separation between the state and religion is best for the state and best for religion. Remonstrance, Par. 8, 12.</p>
<p id="b117-5">That policy necessarily entails hardship upon persons who forego the right to educational advantages the state can supply in order to secure others it is precluded from giving. Indeed this may hamper the parent and the child forced by conscience to that choice. But it does not make the state unneutral to withhold what the Constitution forbids it to give. On the contrary it is only by observing the prohibition rigidly that the state can maintain its neutrality and avoid partisanship in the dissensions inevitable when sect opposes sect over demands for public moneys to further religious education, teaching or training in any form or degree, directly or indirectly. Like St. Paul’s freedom, religious liberty with a great price must be bought. And for those who exercise it most fully, by insisting upon religious education for their children mixed with secular, by the terms of our Constitution the price is greater than for others.</p>
<p id="b117-6">The problem then cannot be cast in terms of legal discrimination or its absence. This would be true, even though the state in giving aid should treat all religious instruction alike. Thus, if the present statute and its application were shown to apply equally to all religious schools <page-number citation-index="1" label="60">*60</page-number>of whatever faith,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> yet in the light of our tradition it could not stand. For then the adherent of one creed still would pay for the support of another, the childless taxpayer with others more fortunate. Then too there would seem to be no bar to making appropriations for transportation and other expenses of children attending public or other secular schools, after hours in separate places and classes for their exclusively religious instruction. The person who embraces no creed also would be forced to pay for teaching what he does not believe. Again, it was the furnishing of “contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves” that the fathers outlawed. That consequence and effect are not removed by multiplying to all-inclusiveness the sects for which support is exacted. The Constitution requires, not comprehensive identification of state with religion, but complete separation.</p>
<p id="b118-6">VI.</p>
<p id="b118-7">Short treatment will dispose of what remains. Whatever might be said of some other application of New Jersey’s statute, the one made here has no semblance of bearing as a safety measure or, indeed, for securing expeditious conveyance. The transportation supplied is by public conveyance, subject to all the hazards and delays of the highway and the streets incurred by the public generally in going about its multifarious business.</p>
<p id="b118-8">Nor is the case comparable to one of furnishing fire or police protection, or access to public highways. These things are matters of common right, part of the general <page-number citation-index="1" label="61">*61</page-number>need for safety.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Certainly the fire department must not stand idly by while the church burns. Nor is this reason why the state should pay the expense of transportation or other items of the cost of religious education.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b119-4">Needless to add, we have no such case as <em>Green </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>253 U. S. 233, or <em>Carmichael </em>v. <em>Southern Coal Co., </em>301 U. S. 495, which dealt with matters wholly unrelated to the First Amendment, involving only situations where the “public function” issue was determinative.</p>
<p id="b119-5">I have chosen to place my dissent upon the broad ground I think decisive, though strictly speaking the case might be decided on narrower issues. The New Jersey statute might be held invalid on its face for the exclusion of chil<page-number citation-index="1" label="62">*62</page-number>dren who attend private, profit-making schools.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> I cannot assume, as does the majority, that the New Jersey courts would write off this explicit limitation from the statute. Moreover, the resolution by which the statute was applied expressly limits its benefits to students of public and Catholic schools.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> There is no showing that there are no other private or religious schools in this populous district.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> I do not think it can be assumed there were none.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> But in the view I have taken, it is unnecessary to limit grounding to these matters.</p>
<p id="b121-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="63">*63</page-number>Two great drives are constantly in motion to abridge, in the name of education, the complete division of religion and civil authority which our forefathers made. One is to introduce religious education and observances into the public schools. The other, to obtain public funds for the aid and support of various private religious schools. See Johnson, The Legal Status of Church-State Relationships in the United States (1934); Thayer, Religion in Public Education (1947); Note (1941) 50 Yale L. J. 917. In my opinion both avenues were closed by the Constitution. Neither should be opened by this Court. The matter is not one of quantity, to be measured by the amount of money expended. Now as in Madison’s day it is one of principle, to keep separate the separate spheres as the First Amendment drew them; to prevent the first experiment upon our liberties; and to keep the question from becoming entangled in corrosive precedents. We should not be less strict to keep strong and untarnished the one side of the shield of religious freedom than we have been of the other.</p>
<p id="b121-4">The judgment should be reversed.</p>
<p id="b121-5">APPENDIX.</p>
<p id="b121-6">MEMORIAL AND REMONSTRANCE AGAINST RELIGIOUS ASSESSMENTS.</p>
<p id="b121-7">To the Honorable the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>
<p id="A_l">A Memorial and Remonstrance.</p>
<p id="b121-10">We, the subscribers, citizens of the said Commonwealth, having taken into serious consideration, a Bill printed by order of the last Session of General Assembly, entitled <em>“A </em><page-number citation-index="1" label="64">*64</page-number>Bill establishing a provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion,” and conceiving that the same, if finally armed with the sanctions of a law, will be a dangerous abuse of power, are bound as faithful members of a free State, to remonstrate against it, and to declare the reasons by which we are determined. We remonstrate against the said Bill,</p>
<p id="b122-6">1. Because we hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, “that Religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator and the Manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence.”<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Religion then of every man must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man; and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate. This right is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unalienable ; because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds, cannot follow the dictates of other men: It is unalienable also; because what is here a right towards men, is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage, and such only, as he believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent both in order of time and degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society. Before any man can be considered as a member of Civil Society, he must be considered as a subject of the Governor of the Universe: And if a member of Civil Society, who enters into any subordinate Association, must always do it with a reservation of his duty to the general authority; much more must every man who becomes a member of any particular Civil Society, do it with a saving of his allegiance to the Universal Sovereign. We maintain therefore that in matters of Religion, no man’s right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society, and that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance. <page-number citation-index="1" label="65">*65</page-number>True it is, that no other rule exists, by which any question which may divide a Society, can be ultimately determined, but the will of the majority; but it is also true, that the majority may trespass on the rights of the minority.</p>
<p id="b123-4">2. Because if religion be exempt from the authority of the Society at large, still less can it be subject to that of the Legislative Body. The latter are but the creatures and vicegerents of the former. Their jurisdiction is both derivative and limited: it is limited with regard to the coordinate departments, more necessarily is it limited with regard to the constituents. The preservation of a free government requires not merely, that the metes and bounds which separate each department of power may be invariably maintained; but more especially, that neither of them be suffered to overleap the great Barrier which defends the rights of the people. The Rulers who are guilty of such an encroachment, exceed the commission from which they derive their authority, and are Tyrants. The People who submit to it are governed by laws made neither by themselves, nor by an authority derived from them, and are slaves.</p>
<p id="b123-5">3. Because, it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties. We hold this prudent jealousy to be the first duty of citizens, and one of [the] noblest characteristics of the late Revolution. The freemen of America did not wait till usurped power had strengthened itself by exercise, and entangled the question in precedents. They saw all the consequences in the principle, and they avoided the consequences by denying the principle. We revere this lesson too much, soon to forget it. Who does not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects? That the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence <page-number citation-index="1" label="66">*66</page-number>only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?</p>
<p id="b124-6">4. Because, the bill violates that equality which ought to be the basis of every law, and which is more indispensible, in proportion as the validity or expediency of any law is more liable to be impeached. If “all men are by nature equally free and independent,”<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> all men are to be considered as entering into Society on equal conditions; as relinquishing no more, and therefore retaining no less, one than another, of their natural rights. Above all are they to be considered as retaining an <em>“equal </em>title to the free exercise of Religion according to the dictates of conscience”<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whilst we assert for ourselves a freedom to embrace, to profess and to observe the Religion which we believe to be of divine origin, we cannot deny an equal freedom to those whose minds have not yet yielded to the evidence which has convinced us. If this freedom be abused, it is an offence against God, not against man: To God, therefore, not to men, must an account of it be rendered. As the Bill violates equality by subjecting some to peculiar burdens; so it violates the same principle, by granting to others peculiar exemptions. Are the Quakers and Menonists the only sects who think a compulsive support of their religions unnecessary and unwarantable? Can their piety alone be intrusted with the care of public worship? Ought their Religions to be endowed above all others, with extraordinary privileges, by which proselytes may be enticed from all others? We think too favorably of the justice and good sense of these denominations, to believe that they either covet preeminencies over their fellow citizens, or that they will be seduced by them, from the common opposition to the measure.</p>
<p id="b125-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="67">*67</page-number>5. Because the bill implies either that the Civil Magistrate is a competent Judge of Religious truth; or that he may employ Religion as an engine of Civil policy. The first is an arrogant pretension falsified by the contradictory opinions of Rulers in all ages, and throughout the world: The second an unhallowed perversion of the means of salvation.</p>
<p id="b125-6">6. Because the establishment proposed by the Bill is not requisite for the support of the Christian Religion. To say that it is, is a contradiction to the Christian Religion itself; for every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers of this world: it is a contradiction to fact; for it is known that this Religion both existed and flourished, not only without the support of human laws, but in spite of every opposition from them; and not only during the period of miraculous aid, but long after it had been left to its own evidence, and the ordinary care of Providence: Nay, it is a contradiction in terms; for a Religion not invented by human policy, must have preexisted and been, supported, before it was established by human policy. It is moreover to weaken in those who profess this Religion a pious confidence in its innate excellence, and the patronage of its Author; and to foster in those who still reject it, a suspicion that its friends are too conscious of its fallacies, to trust it to its own merits.</p>
<p id="b125-7">7. Because experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation. During almost fifteen centuries, has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What have been its fruits? More or less in all places, pride and indolence in the Clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution. Enquire of the Teachers of Christianity for the ages in which it appeared in its greatest lustre; those of every sect, point to the ages prior <page-number citation-index="1" label="68">*68</page-number>to its incorporation with Civil policy. Propose a restoration of this primitive state in which its Teachers depended on the voluntary rewards of their flocks; many of them predict its downfall. On which side ought their testimony to have greatest weight, when for or when against their interest?</p>
<p id="b126-6">8. Because the establishment in question is not necessary for the support of Civil Government. If it be urged as necessary for the support of Civil Government only as it is a means of supporting Religion, and it be not necessary for the latter purpose, it cannot be necessary for the former. If Religion be not within [the] cognizance of Civil Government, how can its legal establishment be said to be necessary to civil Government? What influence in fact have ecclesiastical establishments had on Civil Society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of Civil authority; in many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been seen the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty, may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure &amp; perpetuate it, needs them not. Such a government will be best supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his Religion with the same equal hand which protects his person and his property; by neither invading the equal rights of any Sect, nor suffering any Sect to invade those of another.</p>
<p id="b126-7">9. Because the proposed establishment is a departure from that generous policy, which, offering an asylum to the persecuted and oppressed of every Nation and Religion, promised a lustre to our country, and an accession to the number of its citizens. What a melancholy mark is the Bill of sudden degeneracy? Instead of holding forth an asylum to the persecuted, it is itself a signal <page-number citation-index="1" label="69">*69</page-number>of persecution. It degrades from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority. Distant as it may be, in its present form, from the Inquisition it differs from it only in degree. The one is the first step, the other the last in the career of intolerance. The magnanimous sufferer under this cruel scourge in foreign Regions, must view the Bill as a Beacon on our Coast, warning, him to seek some other haven, where liberty and philanthrophy in their due extent may offer a more certain repose from his troubles.</p>
<p id="b127-4">10. Because, it will have a like tendency to banish our Citizens. The allurements presented by other situations are every day thinning their number. To superadd a fresh motive to emigration, by revoking the liberty which they now enjoy, would be the same species of folly which has dishonoured and depopulated flourishing kingdoms.</p>
<p id="b127-5">11. Because, it will destroy that moderation and harmony which the forbearance of our laws to intermeddle with Religion, has produced amongst its several sects. Torrents of blood have been spilt in the old world, by vain attempts of the secular arm to extinguish Religious discord, by proscribing all difference in Religious opinions. Time has at length revealed the true remedy. Every relaxation of narrow and rigorous policy, wherever it has been tried, has been found to assuage the disease. The American Theatre has exhibited proofs, that equal and compleat liberty, if it does not wholly eradicate it, sufficiently destroys its malignant influence on the health and prosperity of the State. If with the salutary effects of this system under our own eyes, we begin to contract the bonds of Religious freedom, we know no name- that will too severely reproach our folly. At least let warning be taken at the first fruits of the threatened innovation. The very appearance of the Bill has transformed that “Chris<page-number citation-index="1" label="70">*70</page-number>tian forbearance,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> love and charity,” which of late mutually prevailed, into animosities and jealousies, which may not soon be appeased. What mischiefs may not be dreaded should this enemy to the public quiet be armed with the force of a law?</p>
<p id="b128-4">12. Because, the policy of the bill is adverse to the diffusion of the light of Christianity. The first wish of those who enjoy this precious gift, ought to be that it may be imparted to the whole race of mankind. Compare the number of those who have as yet received it with the number still remaining under the dominion of false Religions; and how small is the former! Does the policy of the Bill tend to lessen the disproportion? No; it at once discourages those who are strangers to the light of [revelation] from coming into the Region of it; and countenances, by example the nations who continue in darkness, in shutting out those who might convey it to them. Instead of levelling as far as possible, every obstacle to the victorious progress of truth, the Bill with an ignoble and unchristian timidity would circumscribe it, with a wall of defence, against the encroachments of error.</p>
<p id="b128-5">13. Because attempts to enforce by legal sanctions, acts obnoxious to so great a proportion of Citizens, tend to enervate the laws in general, and to slacken the bands of Society. If it be difficult to execute any law which is not generally deemed necessary or salutary, what must be the case where it is deemed invalid and dangerous? and what may be the effect of so striking an example of impotency in the Government, on its general authority.</p>
<p id="b128-6">14. Because a measure of such singular magnitude and delicacy ought not to be imposed, without the clearest evidence that it is called for by a majority of citizens: and no satisfactory method is yet proposed by which the voice of the majority in this case may be determined, or its influence secured. “The people of the respective counties <page-number citation-index="1" label="71">*71</page-number>are indeed requested to signify their opinion respecting the adoption of the Bill to the next Session of Assembly.” But the representation must be made equal, before the voice either of the Representatives or of the Counties, will be that of the people. Our hope is that neither of the former will, after due consideration, espouse the dangerous principle of the Bill. Should the event disappoint us, it will still leave us in full confidence, that a fair appeal to the latter will reverse the sentence against our liberties.</p>
<p id="b129-4">15. Because, finally, “the equal right of every citizen to the free exercise of his Religion according to the dictates of conscience” is held by the same tenure with all our other rights. If we recur to its origin, it is equally the gift of nature; if we weigh its importance, it cannot be less dear to us; if we consult the Declaration of those rights which pertain to the good people of Virginia, as the “basis and foundation of Government,” <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it is enumerated with equal solemnity, or rather studied emphasis. Either then, we must say, that the will of the Legislature is the only measure of their authority; and that in the plenitude of this authority, they may sweep away all our fundamental rights; or, that they are bound to leave this particular right untouched and sacred: Either we must say, that they may controul the freedom of the press, may abolish the trial by jury, may swallow up the Executive and Judiciary Powers of the State; nay that they may despoil us of our very right of suffrage, and erect themselves into an independent and hereditary assembly: or we must say, that they have no authority to enact into law the Bill under consideration. We the subscribers say, that the General Assembly of this Commonwealth have no such authority: And that no effort may be omitted on our part against so dangerous an usurpation, we oppose to it, this remonstrance; earnestly praying, as we are in duty <page-number citation-index="1" label="72">*72</page-number>bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe, by illuminating those to whom it is addressed, may on the one hand, turn their councils from every act which would affront his holy prerogative, or violate the trust committed to them: and on the other, guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his [blessing, may reldound to their own praise, and may establish more firmly the liberties, the prosperity, and the Happiness of the Commonwealth.</p>
<p id="b130-6">II Madison, 183-191.</p>
<p id="b130-7">SUPPLEMENTAL APPENDIX.</p>
<p id="b130-8">A BILL ESTABLISHING A PROVISION FOR TEACHERS OF THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.</p>
<p id="b130-9">Whereas the general diffusion of Christian knowledge hath a natural tendency to correct the morals of men, restrain their vices, and preserve the peace of society; which cannot be effected without a competent provision for learned teachers, who may be thereby enabled to devote their time and attention to the duty of instructing such citizens, as from their circumstances and want of education, cannot otherwise attain such knowledge; and it is judged that such provision may be made by the Legislature, without counteracting the liberal principle heretofore adopted and intended to be preserved by abolishing all distinctions of pre-eminence amongst the different societies or communities of Christians;</p>
<p id="b130-10"><em>Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly, </em>That for the support of Christian teachers, per centum on the amount, or in the pound on the sum payable for tax on the property within this Commonwealth, is hereby assessed, and shall be paid by every person chargeable with the said tax at the time the same shall become due; and the Sheriffs of the several Counties shall have power to levy and collect the same in the same manner and under <page-number citation-index="1" label="73">*73</page-number>the like restrictions and limitations, as are or may be prescribed by the laws for raising the Revenues of this State.</p>

<p id="b93-6"> Jefferson was chairman of the revising committee and chief draftsman. Corevisers were Wythe, Pendleton, Mason and Lee. The first enacted portion of the revision, which became known as Jefferson’s Code, was the statute barring entailments. Primogeniture soon followed. Much longer the author was to wait for enactment of the Bill for Religious Freedom; and not until after his death was the corollary bill to be accepted in principle which he considered most important of all, namely, to provide for common education at public expense. See V Jefferson, 153. However, he linked this with disestablishment as corollary prime parts in a system of basic freedoms. I Jefferson, 78.</p>
<p id="b93-7">Jefferson, and Madison by his sponsorship, sought to give the Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom as nearly constitutional status as they could at the time. Acknowledging that one legislature could not “restrain the acts of succeeding Assemblies . . . and that therefore to declare this act irrevocable would be of no effect in law,” the Bill’s concluding provision as enacted nevertheless asserted: “Yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter passed to repeal the present or to narrow its operation, such act will be an infringement of natural right.” 1 Randall, 220.</p>

<p id="b98-7">Madison’s one exception concerning restraint was for “preserving public order.” Thus he declared in a private letter, IX Madison, 484, 487, written after the First Amendment was adopted: “The tendency to a usurpation on one side or the other, or to a corrupting coalition or alliance between them, will be best guarded agst. by an entire abstinance of the Govt, from interference in any way whatever, beyond the necessity of preserving public order, &amp; protecting each sect agst. trespasses on its legal rights by others.” Cf. note 9.</p>

<p id="b100-6"> See text <em>supra </em>at notes 24, 25. Madison, of course, was but one of many holding such views, but nevertheless agreeing to the common understanding for adoption of a Bill of Rights in order to remove all doubt engendered by the absence of explicit guaranties in the original Constitution.</p>
<p id="b100-7">By 1791 the great fight over establishments had ended, although some vestiges remained then and later, even in Virginia. The glebes, for example, were not sold there until 1802. Cf. Eckenrode, 147. Fixing an exact date for “disestablishment” is almost impossible, since the process was piecemeal. Although Madison failed in having the Virginia Bill of Rights declare explicitly against establishment in 1776, cf. note 14 and text <em>supra, </em>in 1777 the levy for support of the Anglican clergy was suspended. It was never resumed. Eckenrode states: “This act, in effect, destroyed the establishment. Many dates have been given for its end, but it really came on January 1, 1777, when the act suspending the payment of tithes became effective. This was not seen at the time. . . . But in freeing almost half of the taxpayers from the burden of the state religion, the state religion was at an end. Nobody could be forced to support it, and an attempt to levy tithes upon Anglicans alone would be to recruit the ranks of dissent.” P. 53. See also pp. 61, 64. The question of assessment however was revived “with far more strength than ever, in the summer of 1784.” <em>Id., </em>64. It would seem more factual therefore to fix the time of disestablishment as of December, 1785 January, 1786, when the issue in large was finally settled.</p>
</footnote>
<footnote label="34">
<p id="b100-8"> At one point the wording was proposed: “No religion shall be established by law, nor shall the equal rights of conscience be infringed.” 1 Annals of Congress 729. Cf. note 27. Representative Huntington of Connecticut feared this might be construed to prevent <page-number citation-index="1" label="43">*43</page-number>judicial enforcement of private pledges. He stated “that he feared . . . that the words might be taken in such latitude as to be extremely hurtful to the cause of religion. He understood the amendment to mean what had been expressed by the gentleman from Virginia; but others might find it convenient to put another construction upon it. The ministers of their congregations to the Eastward were maintained by the contributions of those who belonged to their society; the expense of building meeting-houses was contributed in the same manner. These things were regulated by by-laws. If an action was brought before a Federal Court on any of these cases, the person who had neglected to perform his engagements could not be compelled to do it; for a support of ministers or building of places of worship might be construed into a religious establishment.” 1 Annals of Congress 730.</p>
<p id="b101-5">To avoid any such possibility, Madison suggested inserting the word “national” before “religion,” thereby not only again disclaiming intent to bring about the result Huntington feared but also showing unmistakably that “establishment” meant public “support” of religion in the financial sense. 1 Annals of Congress 731. See also IX Madison, 484-487.</p>

<p id="b101-6"> The decision most closely touching the question, where it was squarely raised, is <em>Quick Bear </em>v. <em>Leupp, </em>210 U. S. 50. The Court distinguished sharply between appropriations from public funds for the support of religious education and appropriations from funds held in trust by the Government essentially as trustee for private individuals, Indian wards, as beneficial owners. The ruling was that the latter could be disbursed to private, religious schools at the designation of those patrons for paying the cost of their education. But it was stated also that such a use of public moneys would violate both the First Amendment and the specific statutory declaration involved, namely, that “it is hereby declared to be the settled policy of the Government to hereafter make no appropriation whatever for education in any sectarian school.” 210 U. S. at 79. Cf. <em>Ponce </em>v. <em>Roman Catholic Apostolic </em>Church, 210 U. S. 296, 322. And see <em>Bradfield </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>175 U.

<p id="b108-7"> If it is part of the state’s function to supply to religious schools or their patrons the smaller items of educational expense, because the legislature may say they perform a public function, it is hard to see why the larger ones also may not be paid. Indeed, it would seem even more proper and necessary for the state to do this. For if one class of expenditures is justified on the ground that it supports the general cause of education or benefits the individual, or can be made to do so by legislative declaration, so even more certainly would be the other. To sustain payment for transportation to school, for textbooks, for other essential materials, or perhaps for school lunches, and not for what makes all these things effective for their intended end, would be to make a public function of the smaller items and their cumulative effect, but to make wholly private in character the larger things without which the smaller could have no meaning or use.</p>

In both courts, as here, the judges split, one of three dissenting in the Supreme Court, three of nine in the Court of Errors and Appeals. The division is typical. See the cases cited in note 49.</p>

<p id="b113-6"> Some state courts have sustained statutes granting free transportation or free school books to children attending denominational schools on the theory that the aid was a benefit to the child rather than to the school. See <em>Nichols </em>v. <em>Henry, </em>301 Ky. 434, 191 S. W. 2d 930, with which compare <em>Sherrard </em>v. <em>Jefferson County Board of Education, </em>294 Ky. 469, 171 S. W. 2d 963; <em>Cochran </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>168 La. 1030, 123 So. 664, aff’d, 281 U. S. 370; <em>Borden </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>168 La. 1005, 123 So. 655; <em>Board of Education v. Wheat, </em>174 Md. 314, 199 A. 628; <em>Adams </em>v. <em>St. Mary’s County, </em>180 Md. 550, 26 A. 2d 377; <em>Chance </em>v. <em>State Textbook R. &amp; P. Board, </em>190 Miss. 453, 200 So. 706. See also <em>Bowker </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>73 Cal. App. 2d 653, 167 P. 2d 256. Other courts have held such statutes unconstitutional under state constitutions as aid to the schools. <em>Judd </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>278 N. Y. 200, 15 N. E. 2d 576, but see note 47 <em>supra; Smith </em>v. <em>Donahue, </em>202 App. Div. 656, 195 N. Y. S. 715; <em>State ex rel. Traub </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>36 Del. 181, 172 A. 835; <em>Gurney </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>190 Okla. 254, 122 P. 2d 1002; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Consolidated School District, </em>17 Wash. 2d 61, 135 P. 2d 79; <em>Van Straten </em>v. <em>Milquet, </em>180 Wis. 109, 192 N. W. 392. And cf. <em>Hlebanja </em>v. <em>Brewe, 58 </em>S. D. 351, 236 N. W. 296. And since many state constitutions have provisions forbidding the appropriation of public funds for private purposes, in these and other cases the issue whether the statute was for a “public” or “private” purpose has been present.

Madison’s entire thesis, as reflected throughout the Remonstrance and in his other writings, as well as in his opposition to the final form of the Assessment Bill, see note 43, was altogether incompatible with acceptance of general and “nondiscriminatory” support.

<p id="b119-6"> The protections are of a nature which does not require appropriations specially made from the public treasury and earmarked, as is New Jersey’s here, particularly for religious institutions or uses. The First Amendment does not exclude religious property or activities from protection against disorder or the ordinary accidental incidents of community life. It forbids support, not protection from interference or destruction.</p>
<p id="b119-7">It is a matter not frequently recalled that President Grant opposed tax exemption of religious property as leading to a violation of the principle of separation of church and state. See President Grant's Seventh Annual Message to Congress, December 7, 1875, in IX Messages and Papers of the Presidents (1897) 4288-4289. Garfield, in a letter accepting the nomination for the presidency said: “. . . it would be unjust to our people, and dangerous to our institutions, to apply any portion of the revenues of the nation, or of the States, to the support of sectarian schools. The separation of the Church and the State in everything relating to taxation should be absolute.” II The Works of James Abram Garfield (ed. by Hinsdale, 1883) 783.</p>

<footnote label="57">
<p id="b119-8"> Neither do we have here a case of rate-making by which a public utility extends reduced fares to all school children, including patrons of religious schools. Whether or not legislative compulsion upon a private utility to extend such an advantage would be valid, or its extension by a municipally owned system, we are not required to consider. In the former instance, at any rate, and generally if not always in the latter, the vice of using the taxing power to raise funds for the support of religion would not be present.</p>
</footnote>
<footnote label="58">
<p id="b120-6"> It would seem at least a doubtfully sufficient basis for reasonable classification that some children should be excluded simply because the only school feasible for them to attend, fin view of geographic or other situation, might be one conducted in whole <em>or in part </em>for profit. Cf. note 5.</p>

<p id="b120-7"> See note 7 <em>supra. </em>The resolution was as follows, according to the school board’s minutes read in proof: “The transportation committee recommended the transportation of pupils of Ewing to the Trenton and Pennington High Schools <em>and Catholic Schools </em>by way of public carrier as in recent years. On Motion of Mr. Ralph Ryan and Mr. M. French the same was adopted.” (Emphasis added.) The New Jersey court’s holding that the resolution was within the authority conferred by the state statute is binding on us. <em>Reinman </em>v. <em>Little Rock, </em>237 U. S. 171, 176; <em>Hadacheck </em>v. <em>Sebastian, </em>239 U. S. 394, 414.</p>

<p id="b120-9"> In <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>323 U. S. 516, 530, it was said that the preferred place given in our scheme to the great democratic freedoms secured by the First Amendment gives them “a sanctity and a sanction not permitting dubious intrusions.” Cf. Remonstrance, Par. 3, 9. And in other cases it has been held that the usual presumption of constitutionality will not work to save such legislative excursions in this field. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Carolene Products Co., </em>304 U. S. 144, 152, note 4; see Wechsler, Stone and the Constitution (1946) 46 Col. L. Rev. 764, 795 <em>et seq.</em></p>
<p id="b120-10">Apart from the Court’s admission that New Jersey’s present action approaches the verge of her power, it would seem that a statute, ordinance or resolution which on its face singles out one sect only by name for enjoyment of the same advantages as public schools or their stu<page-number citation-index="1" label="63">*63</page-number>dents, should be held discriminatory on its face by virtue of that fact alone, unless it were positively shown that no other sects sought or were available to receive the same advantages.</p>
