 “[I]n referring to decisions holding state laws pre-empted by the NLRA, care must be taken to distinguish pre-emption based on federal protection of the conduct in question .  .  .  from that based predominantly on the primary jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board .  .  .  , although the two are often not easily separable.” Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., <citedDecision>394 U. S. 369</citedDecision> , 383 n. 19 (1969).  Each of these distinct aspects of labor law pre-emption has had its own history in our decisions, to which we now turn.  We consider first pre-emption based predominantly on the primary jurisdiction of the Board.  This line of preemption analysis was developed in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra, and its history was recently summarized in Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 290-291 (1971): “ [Y] arying approaches were taken by the Court in initially grappling i with this pre-emption problem.  Thus, for example, some early cases suggested the true distinction lay between judicial application of general common law, which was permissible, as opposed to state rules specifically designed to regulate *139 labor relations, which were pre-empted.  See, e. g., Automobile Workers v. Russell, 356 U. S. 634, 645 (1958).  Others made pre-emption turn on whether the States purported to apply a remedy not provided for by the federal scheme, e. g., Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 348 U. S. 468, 479-480 (1955), while in still others the Court undertook a thorough scrutiny of the federal Act to ascertain whether the state courts had, in fact, arrived at conclusions inconsistent with its provisions, e. g., Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd., 336 U. S. 245 (1949).

 ‘For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act *147 prohibits,’ Garner v. Teamsters Union, 346 U. S. 485, 500 .” Id., at 259-260.  Although many of our past decisions concerning conduct left by Congress to the free play of economic forces address the question in the context of union and employee activities, self-help is of course also the prerogative of the employer because he, too, may properly employ economic weapons Congress meant to be un-regulable.  Mr. Justice Harlan concurring in H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S., at 109 , stated the obvious: “[T]he Act as presently drawn does not contemplate that unions will always be secure and able to achieve agreement even when their economic position is weak, or that strikes and lockouts will never result from a bargaining impasse.  It cannot be said that the Act forbids an employer ... to rely ultimately on its economic strength to try to secure what it cannot obtain through bargaining.” “[Rjesort to economic weapons should more peaceful measures not avail” is the right of the employer as well as the employee, American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S., at 317, 8 and the State may not prohibit the use of such weapons or “add to an employer’s federal legal obligations in collective bargaining” any more than in the case of employees.  Cox, supra, n. 4, at 1365.  See, e. g., Beasley v. Food Fair of North Carolina, 416 U. S. 653 (1974).  Whether self-help economic activities are employed by employer or union, the crucial inquiry regarding pre-emption is the same: whether “the exercise *148 of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act’s processes.” <citedDecision>Railroad Trainmen</citedDecision> v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., <citedDecision>394 U. S., at 380</citedDecision> .  Ill There is simply no question that the Act’s processes would be frustrated in the instant case were the State’s ruling permitted to stand.  The employer in this case invoked the Wisconsin law because it was unable to overcome the Union tactic with its own economic self-help means.  9 Although it did employ economic weapons putting pressure on the Union when it terminated the pre *149 vious agreement, supra, at 134, it apparently lacked sufficient economic strength to secure its bargaining demands under “the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy,” Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S., at 260 .  10 But the economic weakness of the affected party cannot justify state aid contrary to federal law for, as we have developed, “the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is not a grudging exception [under] .  .  .

 “The premise is .  .  .  that Congress judged whether the conduct was illicit or legitimate, and that ‘legitimate' connotes, not simply that federal law is neutral, but that the conduct is to be assimilated to the large residual area in which a regime of free collective bargaining — ‘economic warfare,’ if you prefer — is thought to be the course of regulatory wisdom.” It is true, of course, that the seeds of the Garmon “primary jurisdiction of the NLRB” approach to labor law pre-emption are also contained within the Garner opinion.  See, in addition to the textual quotation, Gamer, 346 U. S., at 490-491 .  Although Mr. Justice Harlan took issue with the statement in Garmon that States may “be powerless to act when the underlying activities are clearly ‘neither protected nor prohibited’ by the federal Act,” 359 U. S., at 253 (concurring in result), his later opinions make plain that the point of disagreement concerned the use of the term “protected” rather than the substantive concept.  “In the context of labor relations law, this word is fraught with ambiguity, ‘Protected conduct’ may, for example,, refer to employee conduct which the States may not prohibit, ... or to conduct against which the employer may not retaliate.” Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., <citedDecision>394 U. S. 369</citedDecision> , 382 n. 17 (19.69).  Indeed, Mr. Justice Harlan thereafter expressly adopted the Garmon formulation.  Hanna Mining v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S., at 187 , It has been suggested that rather than “protected,” ‘[p]ermitted activities’ would be better shorthand for this category of employee conduct because it may be — indeed is — protected against state, but not employer interference.” Cox, supra, n. 4, at 1346 (footnote omitted).  “[T]he Taft-Hartley Act was, to a marked degree, the result of conflict and compromise between strong contending forces and deeply held views on the .  .  .  appropriate balance to be struck between the uncontrolled power of management and labor to further their respective interests.” Carpenters Union v. NLRB, 357 U.‘ S. 93, 99-100 (1958).
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Powell, with whom The Chief Justice joins, concurring.  The Court correctly identifies the critical inquiry with respect to pre-emption as whether “the exercise of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act’s processes.” Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., <citedDecision>394 U. S. 369, 380</citedDecision> (1969).  See ante, at 147-148.  This is equally true whether the self-help activities *156 are those of the employer or the Union.  I agree with the Court that the Wisconsin law, as applied in this case, is pre-empted since it directly curtails the self-help capability of the Union and its members, resulting in a significant shift in the balance of free economic bargaining power struck by Congress.  I write to make clear my understanding that the Court’s opinion does not, however, preclude the States from enforcing, in the context of a labor dispute, “neutral” state statutes or rules of decision: state laws that are not directed toward altering the bargaining positions of employers or unions but which may have an incidental effect on relative bargaining strength.  Except where Congress has specifically provided otherwise, the States generally should remain free to enforce, for example, their law of torts or of contracts, and other laws reflecting neutral public policy.  * See Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1337 , 1355-1356 (1972).
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Stevens, with whom Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Rehnquist join, dissenting. If the partial strike activity in this case were protected, or even arguably protected, by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, the Court’s conclusion would be supported by San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 . But in Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 336 U. S. 245 (Briggs-Strait on), the Court rejected the argument that comparable activity was protected by § 7. And as I understand the Court’s holding today, it as *157 sumes that this activity remains unprotected. 1 Moreover, if such activity were prohibited, or arguably prohibited, by § 8 of the Act, the Court's conclusion would also be supported by Garmon . But ever since NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , it has been clear that this activity is not even arguably prohibited. If Congress had focused on the problems presented by partial strike activity, and had enacted special legislation dealing with this subject matter, but left the form of the activity disclosed by this record unregulated, the Court's conclusion would be supported by Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 . But this is not such a case. Despite the numerous statements in the Court’s opinion about Congress’ intent to leave partial strike activity wholly unregulated, I have found no legislative expression of any such intent nor any evidence that Congress has scrutinized such activity. 2 *158 If this Court had previously held that the no-man’s land in which conduct is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited by federal law is nevertheless preempted by an unexpressed legislative intent, I would follow such a holding. But none of the cases reviewed in the Court’s opinion so holds. 3 Ever since 1949, when Briggs-Stratton was decided, the rule has been that partial strike activity within that area may be regulated by the States. If adherence to the rule of Briggs-Stratton would per *159 mit the States substantially to disrupt the balance Congress has struck between union and employer, I would readily join in overruling it. But I am not persuaded that partial strike activity is so essential to the bargaining process that the States should not be free to make it illegal. 4 Stability and predictability in the law are enhanced when the Court resists the temptation to overrule its prior decisions. 5 It is particularly inappropriate to do so when the Court is purporting to implement the intent of Congress with respect to an issue that Congress has yet to address. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 , 671 n. 14. Finally, I am not nearly as sanguine as the Court about the likelihood that this decision will clarify or harmonize a fairly confused area of the law. In sum, I would adhere to prior precedent which is directly in point. I recognize that there is some ambiguity in the Court’s discussion, ante, at 152-153, which first implies that the employer may take any appropriate disciplinary action, including discharge, since the union activity is unprotected by § 7, and then immediately casts doubt on this assurance to the employer by indicating that some economic weapons may be used in reprisal even if the activity is protected. The ambiguity of the Court’s rationale is inconsistent with its assumption that the employer is wholly free to use economic self-help without fear of committing an unfair labor practice. In all events, while I recognize that I may be misreading the Court’s opinion, I assume that its holding rests on the predicate that the concerted refusal to work overtime in this case, like the partial strike activity in Briggs-Stratton, is unprotected by § 7. A scholar who has criticized Briggs-Stratton has observed: “The omission of a federal prohibition against 'quickie’ strikes certainly could not have implied a desire that unions be free to embrace the tactic without restraint; congressional silence almost surely is attributable to the happy circumstance that no prohibition is urgently required because American labor unions have almost unanimously *158 fected such tactics.” Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L, Rev. 1337, 1347 (1972). The Union argues that Congress focused upon partial strike activity during passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136 , relying upon a provision passed by the House, but rejected in the Conference Committee, that declared unlawful “any sit-down strike or other concerted interference with an employer’s operations conducted by remaining on the employer’s premises.” H. R. 3020, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., § 12 (a)(3)(A) (1947). See H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 27-28, 43-44 (1947); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38-39, 42-43, 58-59 (1947). The concerted refusal to work overtime in this ease does not involve “concerted interference with an employer’s operations conducted by remaining on the employer’s premises.” In NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , the Court held that the partial strike activity in that case did not violate the union’s duty to bargain in good faith; in other words, even though the activity was not protected by § 7, it was not prohibited by § 8. Contrary to the Court’s implication, ante, at 141, the case did not hold that the States could not prohibit such activity, but only that the NLRB had not been authorized to do so. Congress’ failure to grant power over such activity to the NLRB hardly amounts to withdrawal of the same power from the States. The Court’s quotation, Ibid., from Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181, 187 , when read in context, is nothing more than a reference to a statement in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 , which poses, but does not answer, the question whether pre-emption extends to activity that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited. See n. 2, supra. I cannot agree with the Court’s conclusion that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, overruled today, numbers among those that have been eroded rather than preserved. See ante, at 151-154, and n. 12. The decision in Insurance Agents, supra, is readily distinguishable. See n. 3, supra. It is true that Briggs-Stratton has been limited to its facts insofar as it sanctions judicial determination whether conduct arguably protected by § 7 or prohibited by § 8 is actually protected or prohibited. Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 291 ; San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra, at 245 n. 4; see Insurance Agents, supra, at 492-494 , and nn. 22, 23. But the rule established in Garmon , and reaffirmed in Lockridge , is fully consistent with the conclusion that the States may regulate conduct that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.

Since Briggs-Stratton is today overruled, and as we hold further that the Union's refusal to work overtime is peaceful conduct constituting activity which must be free of regulation by the States if the congressional intent in enacting the comprehensive federal law of labor relations is not to be frustrated, the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is Reversed.
