**Combined Opinion**
*525 Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court. In Frank v. Maryland, 359 U. S. 360 , this Court upheld, by a five-to-four vote, a state court conviction of a homeowner who refused to permit a municipal health inspector to enter and inspect his premises without a search warrant.  In Eaton v. Price, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 263</citedDecision> , a similar conviction was affirmed by an equally divided Court. Since those closely divided decisions, more intensive efforts at all levels of government to contain and eliminate urban blight have led to increasing use of such inspection techniques, while numerous decisions of this Court have more fully defined the Fourth Amendment's effect on state and municipal action.  E. g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 ; Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 .  In view of the growing nationwide importance of the problem, we noted probable jurisdiction in this case and in See v. City of Seattle, post, p. 541, to re-examine whether administrative inspection programs, as presently authorized and conducted, violate Fourth Amendment rights as those rights are enforced against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  385 U. S. 808 .  Appellant brought this action in a California Superior Court alleging that he was awaiting trial on a criminal charge of violating the San Francisco Housing Code by refusing to permit a warrantless inspection of his residence, and that a writ of prohibition should issue to the criminal court because the ordinance authorizing such inspections is unconstitutional on its face.  The Superior Court denied the writ, the District Court of Appeal affirmed, and the Supreme Court of California denied a petition for hearing.  Appellant properly raised and had considered by the California courts the federal constitutional questions he now presents to this Court. Though there were no judicial findings of fact in this prohibition proceeding, we shall set forth the parties’ factual allegations.
**Combined Opinion**
 They informed appellant that he was required by law to permit an inspection under § 503 of the Housing Code: “Sec.  503 Right to Enter Building.  Authorized employees of the City departments or City agencies, so far as may be necessary for the performance of their duties, shall, upon presentation of proper credentials, have the right to enter, at reasonable times, any building, structure, or premises in the City to perform any duty imposed upon them by the Municipal Code.” *527 Appellant nevertheless refused the inspectors access to his apartment without a search warrant.  Thereafter, a complaint was filed charging him with refusing to permit a lawful inspection in violation of § 507 of the Code. 2 Appellant was arrested on December 2 and released on bail. When his demurrer to the criminal complaint was denied, appellant filed this petition for a writ of prohibition.  Appellant has argued throughout this litigation that § 503 is contrary to the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments in that it authorizes municipal officials to enter a private dwelling without a search warrant and without probable cause to believe that a violation of the Housing Code exists therein.  Consequently, appellant contends, he may not be prosecuted under § 507 for refusing to permit an inspection unconstitutionally authorized by § 503.  Relying on Frank v. Maryland, Eaton v. <citedDecision>Price</citedDecision> , and decisions in other States, 3 the District *528 Court of Appeal held that § 503 does not violate Fourth Amendment rights because it “is part of a regulatory scheme which is essentially civil rather than criminal in nature, inasmuch as that section creates a right of inspection which is limited in scope and may not be exercised under unreasonable conditions.” Having concluded that Frank v. Maryland , to the extent that it sanctioned such warrantless inspections, must be overruled, we reverse.  I.  The Fourth Amendment provides that, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” The basic purpose of this Amendment, as recognized in countless decisions of this Court, is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.  The Fourth Amendment thus gives concrete expression to a right of the people which “is basic to a free society.” Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 27 .  As such, the Fourth Amendment is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 30 .  Though there has been general agreement as to the fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment, translation of the abstract prohibition against “unreasonable searches and seizures” into workable guidelines for the decision of particular cases is a difficult task which has for many years divided the members of this Court. Nevertheless, one governing principle, justified by history and by current experience, has consistently been followed: except in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper con *529 sent is “unreasonable” unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant.  See, e. g., Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483 ; United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48 ; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 ; Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20 .  As the Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10 , 14: “The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home is also a grave concern, not only to the individual but to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance.  When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or government enforcement agent.” In Frank v. Maryland , this Court upheld the conviction of one who refused to permit a warrantless inspection of private premises for the purposes of locating and abating a suspected public nuisance.  Although Frank can arguably be distinguished from this case on its facts, 4 the Frank opinion has generally been interpreted as carving out an additional exception to the rule that warrantless searches are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  See <citedDecision>Eaton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Price, supra.</citedDecision> The District Court of Appeal so interpreted Frank in this case, and that ruling is the core of appellant’s challenge here.  We proceed to a re-examination of the factors which *530 persuaded the Frank majority to adopt this construction of the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition against unreasonable searches.  To the Frank majority, municipal fire, health, and housing inspection programs “touch at most upon the periphery of the important interests safeguarded by the Fourteenth Amendment’s protection against official intrusion,” 359 U. S., at 367 , because the inspections are merely to determine whether physical conditions exist which do not comply with minimum standards prescribed in local regulatory ordinances.  Since the inspector does not ask that the property owner open his doors to a search for “evidence of criminal action” which may be used to secure the owner’s criminal conviction, historic interests of “self-protection” jointly protected by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments 5 are said not to be involved, but only the less intense “right to be secure from intrusion into personal privacy.” Id., at 365 .  We may agree that a routine inspection of the physical condition of private property is a less hostile intrusion than the typical policeman’s search for the fruits and instrumentalities of crime.  For this reason alone, Frank differed from the great bulk of Fourth Amendment cases which have been considered by this Court. But we cannot agree that the Fourth Amendment interests at stake in these inspection cases are merely “peripheral.”.  It is surely anomalous to say that the individual and his private property are fully protected by the Fourth Amendment only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior.
**Combined Opinion**
 The warrant procedure is designed to guarantee that a decision to search private property is justified by a reasonable governmental interest.  But reasonableness is still the ultimate standard.  If a valid public interest justifies the intrusion contemplated, then there is probable cause to issue a suitably restricted search warrant.  Cf. Oklahoma Press Pub. Co. v. Walling, 327 U. S. 186 .  Such an approach neither endangers time-honored doctrines applicable to criminal investigations nor makes a nullity of the probable cause requirement in this area.  It merely gives full recognition to the competing public and private interests here at stake and, in so doing, best fulfills the historic purpose behind the constitutional right to be free from unreasonable government invasions of privacy.  See <citedDecision>Eaton</citedDecision> v. Price, <citedDecision>364 U. S., at 273-274</citedDecision> (opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan).  III. Since our holding emphasizes the controlling standard of reasonableness, nothing we say today is intended to foreclose prompt inspections, even without a warrant, that the law has traditionally upheld in emergency situations.  See North American Cold Storage Co. v. City of Chicago, 211 U. S. 306 (seizure of unwholesome food); Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11 (compulsory smallpox vaccination); Compagnie Francaise v. Board of Health, 186 U. S. 380 (health quarantine); Kroplin v. Truax, 119 Ohio St. 610 , 165 N. E. 498 (summary destruction of tubercular cattle).  On the other hand, in the .case of most routine area inspections, there is no compelling urgency to inspect at a particular time or on a particular day. Moreover, most citizens allow inspections of their property without a warrant.  Thus, as a practical matter and in light of the Fourth Amendment’s requirement that a warrant specify the property to be searched, it seems likely that warrants should normally be sought only after entry is refused unless *540 there has been a citizen complaint or there is other satisfactory reason for securing immediate entry.  Similarly, the requirement of a warrant procedure does not suggest any change in what seems to be the prevailing local policy, in most situations, of authorizing entry, but not entry by force, to inspect.  IV. In this case, appellant has been charged with a crime for his refusal to permit housing inspectors to enter his leasehold without a warrant.
**Combined Opinion**
 It is so ordered.  [For dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Clark, see post, p. 546.] 1 The inspection was conducted pursuant to § 86 (3) of the San Francisco Municipal Code, which provides that apartment house operators shall pay an annual license fee in part to defray the cost of periodic inspections of their buildings.  The inspections are to be made by the Bureau of Housing Inspection “at least once a year and as often thereafter as may be deemed necessary.” The permit of occupancy, which prescribes the apartment units which a building may contain, is not issued until the license is obtained.  2 “Sec.  507 PENALTY FOR Violation.  Any person, the owner or his authorized agent who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects, or refuses to comply with, or who resists or opposes the execution of any of the provisions of this Code, or any order of the Superintendent, the Director of Public Works, or the Director of Public Health made pursuant to this Code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars ($500.00), or by imprisonment, not exceeding six (6) months or by both such fine and imprisonment, unless otherwise provided in this Code, and shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for every day such violation, disobedience, omission, neglect or refusal shall continue.” 3 Givner v. State, 210 Md. 484 , 124 A. 2d 764 (1956); City of St. Louis v. Evans, 337 S. W. 2d 948 (Mo. 1960); State ex rel. Eaton v. Pnce, 168 Ohio St. 123 , 151 N. E. 2d 523 (1958), aff’d by an equally divided Court, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 263</citedDecision> (1960).  See also State v. Rees, 258 Iowa 813 , 139 N. W. 2d 406 (1966); Commonwealth v. Hadley, 351 Mass. 439 , 222 N. E. 2d 681 (1966), appeal docketed Jan. 5, 1967, No. 1179, Misc., O. T. 1966; People v. Laverne, 14 N. Y. 2d 304, 200 N. E. 2d 441 (1964).  4 In Frank , the Baltimore ordinance required that the health inspector “have cause to suspect that a nuisance exists in any house, cellar or enclosure” before he could demand entry without a warrant, a requirement obviously met in Frank because the inspector observed extreme structural decay and a pile of rodent feces on the appellant’s premises.  Section 503 of the San Francisco Housing Code has no such “cause” requirement, but neither did the Ohio ordinance at issue in <citedDecision>Eaton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Price</citedDecision> , a case which four Justices thought was controlled by Frank.  <citedDecision>364 U.
