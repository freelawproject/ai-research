 With few exceptions, the operating companies had once been independent and had come under Markin's control by acquisition or merger.  The complaint alleged conspiracies under §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act among Markin, Checker, and five corporations in the operating system.  The Court stated that even restraints in a vertically integrated enterprise were not "necessarily" outside of the Sherman Act, observing that an unreasonable restraint " may result as readily from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are otherwise independent.  Similarly, any affiliation or integration flowing from an illegal conspiracy cannot insulate the conspirators from the sanctions which Congress has imposed.  The corporate interrelationships of the conspirators, in other words, are not determinative of the applicability of the Sherman Act.  That statute is aimed at substance rather than form.  See Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, <citedDecision>288 U. S. 344, 360-361, 376-377</citedDecision> .  " And so in this case, the common ownership and control of the various corporate appellees are impotent to liberate the alleged combination and conspiracy from the impact of the Act.  The complaint charges that the restraint of interstate trade was not only effected by the combination of the appellees but was the primary object *761 of the combination.  The theory of the complaint .  .  .  is that `dominating power' over the cab operating companies `was not obtained by normal expansion .

 It has long been clear that a pattern of acquisitions may itself create a combination illegal under § 1, especially when an original anticompetitive purpose is evident from the affiliated corporations' subsequent conduct.  [4] The Yellow Cab passage is most fairly read in light of this settled rule.  In Yellow Cab, the affiliation of the defendants was irrelevant because the original acquisitions were themselves illegal.  [5] An affiliation "flowing from an illegal conspiracy" would not avert sanctions.  Common ownership and control were irrelevant because restraint of trade was "the primary object of the combination," which was created in a " `deliberate, *762 calculated' " manner.  Other language in the opinion is to the same effect.  [6] The Court's opinion relies on Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, <citedDecision>288 U. S. 344</citedDecision> (1933); however, examination of that case reveals that it gives very little support for the broad doctrine Yellow Cab has been thought to announce.  On the contrary, the language of Chief Justice Hughes speaking for the Court in Appalachian Coals supports a contrary conclusion.  After observing that "[t]he restrictions the Act imposes are not mechanical or artificial," <citedDecision>288 U. S., at 360</citedDecision> , he went on to state: *763 "The argument that integration may be considered a normal expansion of business, while a combination of independent producers in a common selling agency should be treated as abnormal  that one is a legitimate enterprise and the other is not  makes but an artificial distinction.  The Anti-Trust Act aims at substance." <citedDecision>Id., at 377</citedDecision> .  [7] As we shall see, infra, at 771-774, it is the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine itself that "makes but an artificial distinction" at the expense of substance.  The ambiguity of the Yellow Cab holding yielded the one case giving support to the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine.  [8] In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211 (1951), the Court held that two wholly owned subsidiaries of a liquor distiller were guilty under § 1 of the Sherman Act for jointly refusing to supply a wholesaler who declined to abide by a maximum resale pricing scheme.  The Court offhandedly dismissed the defendant's argument *764 that "their status as `mere instrumentalities of a single manufacturing-merchandizing unit' makes it impossible for them to have conspired in a manner forbidden by the Sherman Act." Id., at 215.  With only a citation to Yellow Cab and no further analysis, the Court stated that the "suggestion runs counter to our past decisions that common ownership and control does not liberate corporations from the impact of the antitrust laws" and stated that this rule was "especially applicable" when defendants "hold themselves out as competitors."

 Nothing in this record indicates any meaningful difference between Regal's operations as a division and its later operations as a separate corporation.  Certainly nothing suggests that Regal was a greater threat to competition as a subsidiary of Copperweld than as a division of Lear Siegler.  Under either arrangement, Regal might have acted to bar a new competitor from entering the market.  In one case it could have relied on economic power from other quarters of the Lear Siegler corporation; instead it drew on the strength of its separately incorporated parent, Copperweld.  From the standpoint of the antitrust laws, there is no reason to treat one more harshly than the other.  As Chief Justice Hughes cautioned, "[r]ealities must dominate the judgment." Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, <citedDecision>288 U. S., at 360</citedDecision> .  [23] D Any reading of the Sherman Act that remains true to the Act's distinction between unilateral and concerted conduct will necessarily disappoint those who find that distinction arbitrary.  It cannot be denied that § 1's focus on concerted *775 behavior leaves a "gap" in the Act's proscription against unreasonable restraints of trade.  See post, at 789.  An unreasonable restraint of trade may be effected not only by two independent firms acting in concert; a single firm may restrain trade to precisely the same extent if it alone possesses the combined market power of those same two firms.  Because the Sherman Act does not prohibit unreasonable restraints of trade as such  but only restraints effected by a contract, combination, or conspiracy  it leaves untouched a single firm's anticompetitive conduct (short of threatened monopolization) that may be indistinguishable in economic effect from the conduct of two firms subject to § 1 liability.  We have already noted that Congress left this "gap" for eminently sound reasons.

 See post, at 780-781.  This meant only that divestiture could apply to affiliates other than those who were driven out of business by the practices of the original conspirators and who were then acquired illegally to increase the combination's monopoly power.  See 323 U. S., at 181 .  It did not mean that affiliates acquired for lawful purposes were subject to divestiture.  [7] Appalachian Coals does state that the key question is whether there is an unreasonable restraint of trade or an attempt to monopolize.  "If there is, the combination cannot escape because it has chosen corporate form; and, if there is not, it is not to be condemned because of the absence of corporate integration." <citedDecision>288 U. S., at 377</citedDecision> .  Appalachian Coals, however, validated a cooperative selling arrangement among independent entities.  The statement that intracorporate relationships would be subject to liability under § 1 is thus dictum.  The statement may also envision merely the limited rule in Yellow Cab pertaining to acquisitions that are themselves anticompetitive.  [8]  In two cases decided soon after Yellow Cab on facts similar to Crescent Amusement, see n. 6, supra, affiliated film exhibitors were found to have conspired in violation of § 1.  Schine Chain Theatres, Inc. v. United States, 334 U. S. 110 (1948); United States v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100 (1948).  Griffith simply assumed that the companies were capable of conspiring with each other; Schine cited Yellow Cab and Crescent Amusement for the proposition, 334 U. S., at 116.
