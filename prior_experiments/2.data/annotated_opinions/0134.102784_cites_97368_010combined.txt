**Combined Opinion**
More than twenty-five years ago we set forth the applicable principle in these words, after referring to the cases where the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment had been broadly described: [1] "But it was recognized in the cases cited, as in many others, that freedom of contract is a qualified and not an absolute right. There is no absolute freedom to do as one wills or to contract as one chooses. The guaranty of liberty does not withdraw from legislative supervision that wide department of activity which consists of the making of contracts, or deny to government the power to provide restrictive safeguards. Liberty implies the absence of arbitrary restraint, not immunity from reasonable regulations and prohibitions imposed in the interests of the community." Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co. v. McGuire, <targetCase>219 U.S. 549</targetCase> , 567. This power under the Constitution to restrict freedom of contract has had many illustrations. [2] That it may be exercised in the public interest with respect to contracts *393 between employer and employee is undeniable. Thus statutes have been sustained limiting employment in underground mines and smelters to eight hours a day ( Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366 ); in requiring redemption in cash of store orders or other evidences of indebtedness issued in the payment of wages ( Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, 183 U.S. 13 ); in forbidding the payment of seamen's wages in advance ( Patterson v. Bark Eudora, 190 U.S. 169 ); in making it unlawful to contract to pay miners employed at quantity rates upon the basis of screened coal instead of the weight of the coal as originally produced in the mine ( McLean v. Arkansas, 211 U.S. 539 ); in prohibiting contracts limiting liability for injuries to employees ( Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co. v. McGuire, supra ); in limiting hours of work of employees in manufacturing establishments ( Bunting v. Oregon, 243 U.S. 426 ); and in maintaining workmen's compensation laws ( New York Central R. Co. v. White, 243 U.S. 188 ; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, 243 U.S. 219 ). In dealing with the relation of employer and employed, the legislature has necessarily a wide field of discretion in order that there may be suitable protection of health and safety, and that peace and good order may be promoted through regulations designed to insure wholesome conditions of work and freedom from oppression.
