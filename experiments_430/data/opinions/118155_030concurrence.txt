<p id="b282-5">I wholly agree with the Court’s conclusion that <em>Halper’s </em>test for whether a sanction is “punitive” was ill considered and unworkable. <em>Ante, </em>at 101-102. Indeed, it was the absurdity of trying to force the <em>Halper </em>analysis upon the Montana tax scheme at issue in <em>Department of Revenue of Mont </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1087946"><a href="/opinion/1087946/department-of-revenue-of-mont-v-kurth-ranch/" aria-description="Citation for case: Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch">511 U. S. 767</a></span> (1994), that prompted me to focus on the prior question whether the Double Jeopardy Clause even contains a multiple-punishments prong. See <span class="citation" data-id="1087946"><a href="/opinion/1087946/department-of-revenue-of-mont-v-kurth-ranch/#802" aria-description="Citation for case: Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch"><em>id., </em>at 802-803</a></span>. That evaluation led me to the conclusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive prosecution, not successive punishment, and that we should therefore “put the <em>Halper </em>genie back in the bottle.” <span class="citation" data-id="1087946"><a href="/opinion/1087946/department-of-revenue-of-mont-v-kurth-ranch/#803" aria-description="Citation for case: Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch"><em>Id., </em>at 803-805</a></span>. Today’s opinion uses a somewhat different bottle than I would, returning the law to its state immediately prior to <em>Halper </em>— which acknowledged a constitutional prohibition of multiple punishments but required successive criminal prosecutions. So long as that requirement is maintained, our multiple-punishments jurisprudence essentially duplicates what I believe to be the correct double jeopardy law, and will be as harmless in the future as it was <em>pre-Halper. </em>Accordingly, I am pleased to concur.</p>
