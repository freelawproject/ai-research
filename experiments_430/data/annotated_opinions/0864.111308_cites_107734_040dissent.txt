 21 Services of this kind are precisely those with which citizens are more “familiarly and minutely conversant.” The Federalist No. 46, p. 316 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).  State and local officials of course must be intimately familiar with these services and sensitive to their quality as well as cost.  Such *579 officials also know that their constituents and the press respond to the adequacy, fair distribution, and cost of these services.  It is this kind of state and local control and accountability that the Framers understood would insure the vitality and preservation of the federal system that the Constitution explicitly requires.  See National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 847-852 .  V Although the Court’s opinion purports to recognize that the States retain some sovereign power, it does not identify even a single aspect of state authority that would remain when the Commerce Clause is invoked to justify federal regulation.  In Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968), overruled by National League of Cities and today reaffirmed, the Court sustained an extension of the FLSA to certain hospitals, institutions, and schools.  Although the Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> was comparatively narrow, Justice Douglas, in dissent, wrote presciently that the Court’s reading of the Commerce Clause would enable “the National Government [to] devour the essentials of state sovereignty, though that sovereignty is attested by the Tenth Amendment.” <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 205</citedDecision> .  Today’s decision makes Justice Douglas’ fear once again a realistic one.  As I view the Court’s decision today as rejecting the basic precepts of our federal system and limiting the constitutional role of judicial review, I dissent.  National League of Cities , following some changes in the composition of the Court, had overruled Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968).  Unlike National League of Cities , the rationale of <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> had not been repeatedly accepted by our subsequent decisions.  Justice O’Connor, the only new Member of the Court since our decision in National League of Cities , has joined the Court in reaffirming its principles.  See Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678 (1982), and FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775 (1982) (O’Connor, J., dissenting in part).  As one commentator noted, stare decisis represents “a natural evolution from the very nature of our institutions.” Lile, Some Views on the Rule of Stare Decisis, 4 Va. L. Rev. 95 , 97 (1916).  In National League of Cities , we referred to the sphere of state sovereignty as including “traditional governmental functions,” a realm which is, of course, difficult to define with precision.  But the luxury of precise definitions is one rarely enjoyed in interpreting and applying the general provisions of our Constitution.  Not surprisingly, therefore, the Court’s attempt to demonstrate the impossibility of definition is unhelpful.

 [Additionally,] the proportion of people actually involved from the total population tends to be greater, the lower the level of govern *576 ment, and this, of course, better approximates the citizen participation ideal.” ACIR, Citizen Participation in the American Federal System 95 (1980).  Moreover, we have witnessed in recent years the rise of numerous special interest groups that engage in sophisticated lobbying, and make substantial campaign contributions to some Members of Congress.  These groups are thought to have significant influence in the shaping and enactment of certain types of legislation.  Contrary to the Court’s view, a “political process” that functions in this way is' unlikely to safeguard the sovereign rights of States and localities.  See n. 9, supra. The opinion of the Court in National League of Cities makes clear that the very essence of a federal system of government is to impose “definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.” 426 U. S., at 842 .  See also the Court’s opinion in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 547, n. 7 (1975).  As Justice Douglas observed in his dissent in <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 203</citedDecision> , extension of the FLSA to the States could “disrupt the fiscal policy of the States and threaten their autonomy in the regulation of health and education.” In Long Island R. Co. the unanimous Court recognized that “[t]his Court’s emphasis on traditional governmental functions and traditional aspects of state sovereignty was not meant to impose a static historical view of state functions generally immune from federal regulation.” 455 U. S.. at 686.
