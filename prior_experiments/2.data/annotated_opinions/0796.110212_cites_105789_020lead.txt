1 She explained that her cooperation with the Government was based on assurances that she would be given *43 lenient treatment. 2 She then described, in considerable detail, her role and that of her husband in the heroin distribution conspiracy. After hearing this testimony, the District Court ruled that Mrs. Trammel could testify in support of the Government’s case to any act she observed during the marriage and to any communication “-made in the presence of a third person”; however, confidential communications between petitioner and his wife were held to, be privileged and inadmissible. The motion to sever was denied. At trial, Elizabeth Trammel testified within the limits of the court’s pretrial ruling; her testimony, as the Government concedes, constituted virtually its entire case against petitioner. He was found guilty on both the substantive and conspiracy charges and sentenced to an indeterminate term of years pursuant to the Federal Youth Corrections Act, 18 U. S. C. § 5010 (b). 3 In the Court of Appeals petitioner’s only claim of error was that the admission of the adverse testimony of his wife, over his objection, contravened this Court’s teaching in Hawkins v. United <targetCase>States, supra</targetCase>, and therefore constituted reversible error. The Court of Appeals rejected this contention. It concluded that Hawkins did not prohibit “the voluntary testimony of a spouse who appears as an unindicted co-conspirator under grant of immunity from the Government in return for her-testimony.” 583 F. 2d 1166, 1168 (CA10 1978). II The privilege claimed by petitioner has ancient roots. Writing in 1628, Lord Coke observed that “it hath beene resolved *44 by the Justices that a wife cannot be produced either against or for her husband.” 1 E. Coke, A Commentarie upon Little-ton 6b (1628). See, generally, 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2227 (McNaughton rev. 1961).
