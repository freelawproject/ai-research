 In that connection it will be recalled that Hope contended for a rate base of $66,000,000 computed on reproduction cost new.  The Commission points out that if that rate base were accepted, Hope’s average rate of return for the four-year period from 1937-1940 would amount to 3.27%.  During that period Hope earned an annual average return of about 9%.  on the average investment.  It asked for no rate increases.  Its properties were well maintained and operated.  As the Commission says, such a modest rate of 3.27% suggests an “inflation of the base on which the rate has been computed.” Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 290, 312</citedDecision> .  Cf. Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., supra, p. 164.  The incongruity between the actual operations and the return computed on the basis of reproduction cost suggests that the Commission was wholly justified in rejecting the latter as the measure of the rate base.  In view of this disposition of the controversy we need not stop to inquire whether the failure of the Commission to add the $17,000,000 of well-drilling and other costs to *606 the rate base was consistent with the prudent investment theory as developed and applied in particular cases. Only a word need be added respecting depletion and depreciation.  We held in the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. case that there was no constitutional requirement “that the owner who embarks in a wasting-asset business of limited life shall receive at the end more than he has put into it.” 315 U. S. p. 593.  The Circuit Court of Appeals did not think that that rule was applicable here because Hope was a utility required to continue its service to the public and not scheduled to end its business on a day certain as was stipulated to be true of the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. But that distinction is quite immaterial.  The ultimate exhaustion of the supply is inevitable in the case of all natural gas companies.
