While sentencing discretion permits consideration of a wide range of information relevant to the assessment of punishment, see Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241, 245-249 (1949), we have recognized it must not be exercised with the purpose of punishing a successful appeal. Pearce, 395 U. S., at 723-725.

Because the Pearce presumption "may operate in the
