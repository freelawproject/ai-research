<p id="b271-6">The Government administratively imposed monetary penalties and occupational debarment on petitioners for violation of federal banking statutes, and later criminally indicted them for essentially the same conduct. We hold that the <page-number citation-index="1" label="96">*96</page-number>Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not a bar to the later criminal prosecution because the administrative proceedings were civil, not criminal. Our reasons for so holding in large part disavow the method of analysis used in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/#448" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b272-4">During the early and mid-1980’s, petitioner John Hudson was the chairman and controlling shareholder of the First National Bank of Tipton (Tipton) and the First National Bank of Hammon (Hammon).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the same period, petitioner Jack Rackley was president of Tipton and a member of the board of directors of Hammon, and petitioner Larry Baresel was a member of the board of directors of both Tipton and Hammon.</p>
<p id="b272-5">An examination of Tipton and Hammon led the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to conclude that petitioners had used their bank positions to arrange a series of loans to third parties in violation of various federal banking statutes and regulations. According to the OCC, those loans, while nominally made to third parties, were in reality made to Hudson in order to enable him to redeem bank stock that he had pledged as collateral on defaulted loans.</p>
<p id="b272-6">On February 13,1989, OCC issued a “Notice of Assessment of Civil Money Penalty.” The notice alleged that petitioners had violated <span class="citation no-link">12 U. S. C. §§ 84</span>(a)(1) and 375b (1982 ed.) and <span class="citation no-link">12 CFR §§ 31.2</span>(b) and 215.4(b) (1986) by causing the banks with which they were associated to make loans to nominee borrowers in a maimer that unlawfully allowed Hudson to receive the benefit of the loans. App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a. The notice also alleged that the illegal loans resulted in losses to Tipton and Hammon of almost $900,000 and contributed to the failure of those banks. <em><span class="citation no-link">Id.,</span> </em>at 97a. However, the notice contained no allegation of any harm to the Govern<page-number citation-index="1" label="97">*97</page-number>ment as a result of petitioners’ conduct. “After taking into account the size of the financial resources and the good faith of [petitioners], the gravity of the violations, the history of previous violations and other matters as justice may require, as required by <span class="citation no-link">12 U. S. C. §§ 93</span>(b)(2) and 504(b),” OCC assessed penalties of $100,000 against Hudson and $50,000 each against Raekley and Baresel. <em><span class="citation no-link">Id.,</span> </em>at 89a. On August 31, 1989, OCC also issued a “Notice of Intention to Prohibit Further Participation” against each petitioner. <em><span class="citation no-link">Id.,</span> </em>at 99a. These notices, which were premised on the identical allegations that formed the basis for the previous notices, informed petitioners that OCC intended to bar them from further participation in the conduct of “any insured depository institution.” <em><span class="citation no-link">Id.,</span> </em>at 100a.</p>
<p id="b273-5">In October 1989, petitioners resolved the OCC proceedings against them by each entering into a “Stipulation and Consent Order.” These consent orders provided that Hudson, Baresel, and Raekley would pay assessments of $16,500, $15,000, and $12,500 respectively. <em><span class="citation no-link">Id.,</span> </em>at 130a, 140a, 135a. In addition, each petitioner agreed not to “participate in any manner” in the affairs of any banking institution without the written authorization of the OCC and all other relevant regulatory agencies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em><span class="citation no-link">Id.,</span> </em>at 131a, 141a, 136a.</p>
<p id="b273-6">In August 1992, petitioners were indicted in the Western District of Oklahoma in a 22-eount indictment on charges of conspiracy, <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. §371</span>, misapplication of bank funds, §§656 and 2, and making false bank entries, §1005.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The violations charged in the indictment rested on the same lend<page-number citation-index="1" label="98">*98</page-number>ing transactions that formed the basis for the prior administrative actions brought by OCC. Petitioners moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy grounds, but the District Court denied the motions. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s holding on the nonparticipation sanction issue, but vacated and remanded to the District Court on the money sanction issue. <span class="citation" data-id="660724"><a href="/opinion/660724/united-states-v-john-c-hudson-larry-baresel-and-jack-butler-rackley/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

That court held, following <em>HaVper, </em>that the actual fines imposed by the Government were not so grossly disproportional to the proved damages to the Government as to render the sanctions “punishment” for double jeopardy purposes. We granted certiorari, <span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./520/1165/">520 U.

Halper">Halper</a></span>.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We now affirm, but for different reasons.</p>
<p id="b274-5">The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no “person [shall] be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” We have long recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the imposition of <page-number citation-index="1" label="99">*99</page-number>all additional sanctions that could, “‘in common parlance,’” be described as punishment. <em>United States ex rel.

<p id="b275-5">Whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is, at least initially, a matter of statutory construction. <span class="citation" data-id="102987"><a href="/opinion/102987/helvering-v-mitchell/#399" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v.

Even in those eases where the legislature “has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect,” <span class="citation" data-id="110331"><a href="/opinion/110331/united-states-v-ward/#248" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b275-6">In making this latter determination, the factors listed in <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Mendoza-Martinez, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106534"><a href="/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/#168" aria-description="Citation for case: Kennedy v.

<p id="b276-5">Our opinion in <em>United States </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Halper">Halper</a></span> </em>marked the first time we applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to a sanction without first determining that it was criminal in nature. In that case, Irwin Halper was convicted of, <em>inter alia, </em>violating the criminal false claims statute, <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 287</span>, based on his submission of 65 inflated Medicare claims each of which overcharged the Government by $9. He was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and fined $5,000. The Government then brought an action against Halper under the civil False Claims Act, <span class="citation no-link">31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3731</span> (1982 ed., Supp. II). The remedial provisions of the False Claims Act provided that a violation of the Act rendered one “liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $2,000, an amount equal to 2 times the amount of damages the Government sustains because of the act of that person, and costs of the civil action.” <em><span class="citation no-link">Id.,</span> </em>§ 3729. Given Halper’s 65 separate violations of the Act, he appeared to be liable for a penalty of $130,000, despite the fact he actually defrauded the Government of less than $600. However, the District Court, concluded that a penalty of this magnitude would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause in light of Halper’s previous criminal conviction. While explicitly recognizing that the statutory damages provision of the Act “was not itself a criminal punishment,” the District Court nonetheless concluded that application of the full penalty to Halper would constitute a second “punishment” in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/#438" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b276-6">On direct appeal, this Court affirmed. As the <em><span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Halper">Halper</a></span> </em>Court saw it, the imposition of “punishment” of any kind was <page-number citation-index="1" label="101">*101</page-number>subject to double jeopardy constraints, and whether a sanction constituted “punishment” depended primarily on whether it served the traditional “goals of punishment,” namely, “retribution and deterrence.” <span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/#448" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Halper"><em>Id., </em>at 448</a></span>. Any sanction that was so “overwhelmingly disproportionate” to the injury caused that it could not “fairly be said <em>solely </em>to serve [the] remedial purpose” of compensating the Government for its loss, was thought to be explainable only as “serving either retributive or deterrent purposes.” See <span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/#448" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Halper"><em>id., </em>at 448-449</a></span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p id="b277-5">The analysis applied by the <em><span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Halper">Halper</a></span> </em>Court deviated from our traditional double jeopardy doctrine in two key respects. First, the <em><span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Halper">Halper</a></span> </em>Court bypassed the threshold question: whether the successive punishment at issue is a “criminal” punishment. Instead, it focused on whether the sanction, regardless of whether it was civil or criminal, was so grossly disproportionate to the harm caused as to constitute “punishment.” In so doing, the Court elevated a single <em><span class="citation" data-id="106534"><a href="/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez">Kennedy</a></span> </em>factor — whether the sanction appeared excessive in relation to its nonpunitive purposes — to dispositive status. But as we emphasized in <em><span class="citation" data-id="106534"><a href="/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez">Kennedy</a></span> </em>itself, no one factor should be considered controlling as they “may often point in differing directions.” <span class="citation" data-id="106534"><a href="/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/#169" aria-description="Citation for case: Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez">372 U. S., at 169</a></span>. The second significant departure in <em><span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Halper">Halper</a></span>. </em>was the Court’s decision to “asses[s] the character of the actual sanctions imposed,” <span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/#447" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Halper">490 U. S., at 447</a></span>, rather than, as <em><span class="citation" data-id="106534"><a href="/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez">Kennedy</a></span> </em>demanded, evaluating the “statute on its face” to determine whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction, <span class="citation" data-id="106534"><a href="/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/#169" aria-description="Citation for case: Kennedy v.

<p id="b277-6">We believe that Halper’s deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> AlS subsequent <page-number citation-index="1" label="102">*102</page-number>eases have demonstrated, <em>Hamper’s </em>test for determining whether a particular sanction is “punitive,” and thus subject to the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause, has proved unworkable. We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect. See <em>Department of Revenue of Mont. </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1087946"><a href="/opinion/1087946/department-of-revenue-of-mont-v-kurth-ranch/#777" aria-description="Citation for case: Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch">511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14</a></span> (1994); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ursery, </em><span class="citation" data-id="118052"><a href="/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/#284" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ursery">518 U. S. 267, 284-285, n. 2</a></span> (1996).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> If a sanction must be “solely” remedial <em>(i. e., </em>entirely nonde-terrent) to avoid implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause, then no civil penalties are beyond the scope of the Clause. Under <em>Halper’s </em>method of analysis, a court must also look at the “sanction actually imposed” to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated. Thus, it will not be possible to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is violated until a defendant has proceeded through a trial to judgment. But in those eases where the civil proceeding follows the criminal proceeding, this approach flies in the face of the notion that the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the government from even <em>“attempting </em>a second time to punish criminally.” <em>Helvering, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102987"><a href="/opinion/102987/helvering-v-mitchell/#399" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v.

<p id="b278-5">Finally, it should be noted that some of the ills at which <em><span class="citation" data-id="112259"><a href="/opinion/112259/united-states-v-halper/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Halper">Halper</a></span> </em>was directed are addressed by other constitutional <page-number citation-index="1" label="103">*103</page-number>provisions. The Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses already protect individuals from sanctions which are downright irrational. <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="105285"><a href="/opinion/105285/williamson-v-lee-optical-of-oklahoma-inc/" aria-description="Citation for case: Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.">348 U. S. 483</a></span> (1955). The Eighth Amendment protects against excessive civil fines, including forfeitures. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112902"><a href="/opinion/112902/alexander-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Alexander v.

United States">509 U. S. 602</a></span> (1993). The additional protection afforded by extending double jeopardy protections to proceedings heretofore thought to be civil is more than offset by the confusion created by attempting to distinguish between “punitive” and “nonpunitive” penalties.</p>
<p id="b279-5">Applying traditional double jeopardy principles to the facts of this ease, it is clear that the criminal prosecution of these petitioners would not. violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. It is evident that Congress intended the OCC money penalties and debarment sanctions imposed for violations of <span class="citation no-link">12 U. S. C. §§ 84</span> and 375b to be civil in nature. As for the money penalties, both §§ 93(b)(1) and 504(a), which authorize the imposition of monetary penalties for violations of §§ 84 and 375b respectively, expressly provide that such penalties are “civil.” While the provision authorizing debarment contains no language explicitly denominating the sanction as civil, we think it significant that the authority to issue debarment orders is conferred upon the “appropriate Federal banking agencies].” §§ 1818(e)(1)-(3). That such authority was conferred upon administrative agencies is prima facie evidence that Congress intended to provide for a civil sanction. See <span class="citation" data-id="102987"><a href="/opinion/102987/helvering-v-mitchell/#402" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v.

Ward">Ward</a></span> </em>test, we find-that there is little evidence, much less the clearest proof that we require, suggesting that either OCC money penalties or debarment sanctions are “so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal despite Congress’ intent to the contrary.” <span class="citation" data-id="118052"><a href="/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/#290" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ursery"><em>Ursery, supra, </em>at 290</a></span>. First, neither money penalties nor debarment has historically been viewed as punishment. We have long recognized that “revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted,” such as a debarment, “is characteristically free of the punitive criminal element.” <em>Helvering, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102987"><a href="/opinion/102987/helvering-v-mitchell/#399" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v. Mitchell">303 U. S., at 399</a></span>, and n. 2. Similarly, “the payment of fixed or variable sums of money [is a] sanction which ha[s] been recognized as enforeible by civil proceedings since the original revenue law of 1789.” <span class="citation" data-id="102987"><a href="/opinion/102987/helvering-v-mitchell/#400" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v.

<p id="b280-4">Second, the sanctions imposed not an tive disability or restraint,” as that term is normally understood. While petitioners have been prohibited from further participating in the banking industry, this is “certainly nothing approaching the 'infamous punishment’ of imprisonment.” <em>Flemming </em>v. <em>Nestor, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106087"><a href="/opinion/106087/flemming-v-nestor/#617" aria-description="Citation for case: Flemming v.

The provisions under which the money penalties were imposed, <span class="citation no-link">12 U. S. C. §§ 93</span>(b) and 504, allow for the assessment of a penalty against any person “who violates” any of the underlying banking statutes, without regard to the violator’s state of mind. “Good faith” is considered by OCC in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed, § 93(b)(2), but a penalty ean be imposed even in the absence of bad faith. The fact that petitioners’ “good faith” was considered in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed in this case is irrelevant, as we look only'to “the statute on its face” to determine whether a penalty is criminal in nature. <em>Kennedy, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106534"><a href="/opinion/106534/kennedy-v-mendoza-martinez/#169" aria-description="Citation for case: Kennedy v.

Similarly, while debarment may be imposed for a “willful” disregard “for the safety or soundness of [an] insured depository institution,” <page-number citation-index="1" label="105">*105</page-number>willfulness is not a prerequisite to debarment; it is sufficient that the disregard for the safety and soundness of the institution was “continuing." § 1818(e)(1)(C)(ii).</p>
<p id="b281-4">Fourth, the conduct for which OCC sanctions are imposed may also be criminal (and in this ease formed the basis for petitioners’ indictments). This fact is insufficient to render the money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, <span class="citation" data-id="118052"><a href="/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/#292" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ursery">518 U. S., at 292</a></span>, particularly in the double jeopardy context, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dixon, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112906"><a href="/opinion/112906/united-states-v-dixon/#704" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Dixon">509 U. S. 688, 704</a></span> (1993) (rejecting “same-conduct” test for double jeopardy purposes).</p>
<p id="b281-5">Finally, we recognize that the imposition of both money penalties and debarment sanctions will deter others from emulating petitioners’ conduct, a traditional goal of criminal punishment. But the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence “may serve civil as well as criminal goals.” <span class="citation" data-id="118052"><a href="/opinion/118052/united-states-v-ursery/#292" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ursery"><em>Ursery, supra, </em>at 292</a></span>; see also <em>Bennis </em>v. <em>Michigan, </em><span class="citation" data-id="118005"><a href="/opinion/118005/bennis-v-michigan/#452" aria-description="Citation for case: Bennis v. Michigan">516 U. S. 442, 452</a></span> (1996) (“[Forfeiture . . . serves a deterrent purpose distinct from any punitive purpose”). For example, the sanctions at issue here, while intended to deter future wrongdoing, also serve to promote the stability of the banking industry. To hold that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions “criminal” for double jeopardy purposes would severely undermine the Government’s ability to engage in effective regulation of institutions sueh as banks.</p>
<p id="b281-6">In sum, there simply is very little showing, to say nothing of the “clearest proof ” required by <em><span class="citation" data-id="110331"><a href="/opinion/110331/united-states-v-ward/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Ward">Ward</a></span>, </em>that OCC money penalties and debarment sanctions are criminal.. The Double Jeopardy Clause is therefore no obstacle to their trial on the pending indictments, and it may proceed.</p>
