 Whether in such a case the statute could be constitutionally so applied is a question not presented by the record.  But if, as is assumed, the power has been effectively exercised, the New York will is the implement of its exercise, made effective as a will by New York law whose aid the decedent invoked for the exercise and enjoyment of the property right conferred on him by the Massachusetts will. Its exercise is a subject over which the sovereign power of taxation extends.  Admittedly, under prevailing notions of choice of law in the courts of these two states, the law of the donor’s domicile, here Massachusetts, may be looked to in New *664 York in determining whether, in some respects' at least, there has been a valid and effective execution of the power of appointment.  Sewall v. Wilmer, 132 Mass. 131 ; Hogarth-Swann v. Weed, 274 Mass. 125, 130 , 174 N.E. 314 ; Hillen v. Iselin, 144 N. Y. 365, 378 , 39 N. E. 368 ; In re New York Life Ins. & Trust Co., 209 N. Y. 585 , 103 N. E. 315 .  But a transfer which has in fact been effected byrecourse in part to the law of New York is not free of taxation there because the power might have been exercised elsewhere or by some other mode, or because it may be necessary for the transferee to invoke the laws of Massachusetts in order to acquire control of the property.  A transfer in one state of a chose in action or a share of stock may be taxed there even though the transferee in order to enjoy its benefits must depend in part upon the law of the state of the debtor or of the corporation.  Blodgett v. Silberman, <citedDecision>277 U. S. 1, 10-17</citedDecision> .  Here the relationship of the power to Massachusetts does not leave New York without sufficient control over the donee and his exercise of the power to support its constitutional authority to tax. For the fact remains that he, as a resident enjoying the protection of New York's laws and owing to it the duty of financial support, has disposed of wealth by a will executed and probated in New York with the same result as if he had owned the property.  This transmission of wealth at death by a resident is not a forbidden source of revenue to the state.  Wachovia Trust Co. v. Doughton, supra, on which respondents rely, denied the constitutional power of a state to tax the effective exercise of a testamentary power in circumstances like the present.  The only grounds for the decision were that the intangibles held in trust in another state, which were the subject of the power, had no situs in the state where the domiciled testator had exercised the power by his will; that its exercise was subject to the laws *665 of Massachusetts where the will donating the power and establishing the trust had been probated, and that no “right” exercised by the donee was conferred by the state of his domicile where it was exercised.  The conclusion there reached and the reasons advanced in its support cannot be reconciled with the decision and the reasoning of the Bullen , the McCanless and the Elliott cases. It is plain that if appropriate emphasis be placed on-the orderly administration of justice rather than blind adherence to conflicting precedents, the Wachovia case must be overruled.  There is no reason why the state should continue to be deprived of revenue from a subject which from the beginning has been within the reach of its taxing power; a subject over which we cannot say the state’s control has been curtailed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

 See Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 , footnote 1; and cf. Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376, 387 .  The Wachovia case should be and now is overruled and the constitutional power of New York to levy the present tax is sustained.  Reversed.  Me. Justice Robeets concurs in the result only because he considers himself bound by the decisions in Curry v. McCanless, 307 U. S. 357 , and Graves v. Elliott, 307 U. S. 383 .  Otherwise he would vote to affirm.  1 See Orr v. Gilman, 183 U. S. 278 ; Chanler v. Kelsey, 205 U. S. 466 ; Bullen v. Wisconsin, 240 U. S. 625 ; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, 276 U. S. 260, 271 ; cf.
