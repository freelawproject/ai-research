Thus in Stoll v. Gottlieb, 1938, 305 U.S. 165 , 172, 59 S.Ct. 134 , 138, it was said: 'Courts to determine the rights of parties are an integral part of our system of government. It is just as important that there should be a place to end as that there should be a place to begin litigation. After a party has his day in court, with opportunity to present his evidence and his view of the law, a collateral attack upon the decision as to jurisdiction there rendered merely retries the issue previously determined. There is no reason to expect that the second decision will be more satisfactory than the first.' 13 This Court has also held that the doctrine of res judicata must be applied to questions of jurisdiction in cases arising in state courts involving the application of the full faith and credit clause where, under the law of the state in which the original judgment was rendered, such adjudications are not susceptible to collateral attack. 15 14 In Davis v. Davis, 1938, <targetCase>305 U.S. 32</targetCase> , <targetCase>59 S.Ct. 3</targetCase> , 83 L.Ed. 26 , 118 A.L.R. 1518 , the courts of the District of Columbia had refused to give effect to a decree of absolute divorce rendered in Virginia, on the ground that the Virginia court had lacked jurisdiction despite the fact that the defendant had appeared in the Virginia proceedings and had fully litigated the issue of the plaintiff's domicile. This Court held that in failing to give recognition to the Virginia decree, the courts of the District had failed to accord the full faith and credit required by the Constitution. During the course of the opinion, this Court stated: 'As to petitioner's domicil for divorce and his standing to invoke jurisdiction of the Virginia court, its finding that he was a bona fide resident of that State for the required time is binding upon respondent in the courts of the District. She may not say that he was not entitled to sue for divorce in the state court, for she appeared there and by plea put in issue his allegation as to domicil, introduced evidence to show it false, took exceptions to the commissioner's report, and sought to have the court sustain them and uphold her plea. Plainly, the determination of the decree upon that point is effective for all purposes in this litigation.'

See note 1 supra. 19 Justices Brewer, Shiras, and Peckham dissented. Mr. Justice Holmes took no part in the case. 20 Thus, in the Andrews case, before the divorce decree was entered by the South Dakota court, the defendant withdrew her appearance in accordance with a consent agreement. 21 See note 14 supra. 22 But cf. Williams v. North Carolina, 1945, 325 U.S. 226 , 230, 65 S.Ct. 1092 , 1095. 23 Davis v. Davis, 1938, <targetCase>305 U.S. 32</targetCase> , 40, <targetCase>59 S.Ct. 3</targetCase> , 6; Williams v.

207 , 210, 211. 27 Williams v. North Carolina, 1945, 325 U.S. 226 , 65 S.Ct. 1092 . 28 Cf. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 1938, 305 U.S. 165 , 172, 59 S.Ct. 134 , 137. 1 Nor do I regard Davis v. Davis, <targetCase>305 U.S. 32</targetCase> , <targetCase>59 S.Ct. 3</targetCase> , 83 L.Ed. 26 , 118 A.L.R. 1518 , as contrary authority. That case did not depend for its result on the fact that there had been an adjudication of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the divorce enforced, inasmuch as this Court found that the State granting the divorce was in fact that of the domicile. 305 U.S. at page 41, 59 S.Ct. at pages 6, 7. Moreover this Court's citation therein of Andrews v. Andrews, supra, indicates an absence of intention to overrule the holding of that case that opportunity to litigate the issue of domicile does not foreclose inquiry as to the true facts.
