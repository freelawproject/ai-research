 the case is one for the consideration of the Court of Appeals .  .  .  Price v. State, 224 Ga. 306, 307 , 161 S. E. 2d 825, 826 (1968).  The Georgia Court of Appeals then heard the appeal and affirmed the second conviction, rejecting petitioner’s argument, among others, that his retrial for murder constituted double jeopardy.  Price v. State, 118 Ga. App. 207 , 163 S. E. 2d 243 (1968).  The Court of Appeals held that in Brantley v. State, <citedDecision>132 Ga. 573</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>64 S. E. 676</citedDecision> (1909), aff’d, 217 U.. S. 284 (1910), the Georgia Supreme Court had decided this question adversely to petitioner.  The Court of Appeals then quoted from the <citedDecision>Brantley</citedDecision> case’s syllabus: “When a person has been indicted for murder and convicted of voluntary manslaughter, if he voluntarily seeks and obtains a new trial, he is subject to another trial generally for the offense charged in the indictment, and upon such trial he cannot successfully interpose a plea of former acquittal of the crime of murder, or former jeopardy in regard thereto.” 118 Ga. App., at 208 , 163 S. E. 2d, at 244 .  Petitioner sought a rehearing, contending, as he contends here, that <citedDecision>Brantley</citedDecision> was no longer controlling.  He relied on Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957), and *326 United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F., 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 913 (1966).  His contention was rejected.  In deciding that <citedDecision>Brantley</citedDecision> was still a binding precedent as to it, the Georgia Court of Appeals noted that the Georgia Supreme Court had transferred the case to it as involving the application of only “plain and unambiguous” constitutional provisions.  The petitioner’s motion was then denied.  Thereafter the Georgia Supreme Court denied certiorari, and petitioner sought review in this Court. We granted the writ, 395 U. S. 975 (1969), and now reverse.  (1) In United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662, 669 (1896), this Court observed: “The Constitution of the United States, in the Fifth Amendment, declares, ‘nor shall any person be subject [for the same offense] to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.’ The prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy .  .  .  .” (Emphasis added.)

 Under either of these premises, the holding in the Kepner case — that there could be no appeal from an acquittal because such a verdict ended an accused’s jeopardy — was applicable.  The rationale of the Green holding applies here.  The concept of continuing jeopardy implicit in the Ball case 4 would allow petitioner’s retrial for voluntary manslaughter after his first conviction for that offense had been reversed.  But, as the Kepner and Green cases illustrate, this Court has consistently refused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after an acquittal, whether that acquittal is express or implied by a conviction on a lesser included offense when the jury was given a full opportunity 5 to return a verdict on the greater charge.  There is no relevant factual distinction between this case and Green v. United States.  Although the petitioner was not convicted of the greater charge on retrial, whereas Green was, the risk of conviction on the greater charge was the same in both cases, and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is written in terms of potential or risk of trial and conviction, not punishment.  The Georgia courts nonetheless rejected Green as a persuasive authority in favor of reliance on Brantley v. State, <citedDecision>132 Ga. 573</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>64 S. E. 676</citedDecision> (1909), aff’d, 217 U, S. 284 (1910).  The <citedDecision>Brantley</citedDecision> case presented a situation where a defendant’s appeal from a conviction for a *330 lesser included offense ultimately led to retrial and conviction on the greater offense.  After the second conviction had been affirmed on appeal,, the defendant sued out a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Georgia from this Court, contending “that the exemption from second jeopardy is one of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, which the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state to abridge”, 6 that he had “been tried and acquitted by a jury of his country of the crime of murder”, 7 and that “[h]e should never [sic] have been tried a second time only for the offense on which he obtained a new trial .  ...” 8 This Court tersely rejected these contentions as: “absolutely without merit.  It was not a case of twice in jeopardy under any view of the Constitution of the United States.” 217 U. S., at 285.  The <citedDecision>Brantley</citedDecision> case was decided by this Court at a time when, although the Court was actively developing an explication of federal double jeopardy doctrines based on the Fifth Amendment, it took a very restricted approach in reviewing similar state court decisions.  While the <citedDecision>Brantley</citedDecision> holding may have had some vitality at the time the Georgia courts rendered their decisions in this case, it is no longer a viable authority and must now be deemed to have been overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court. 9 *331 (2) One further consideration remains.  Because the petitioner was convicted of the same crime at both the first and second trials, and because he suffered no greater punishment on the subsequent conviction, Georgia submits that the second jeopardy was harmless error when judged by the criteria of Chapman v. California, 386 U. S. 18 (1967), and Harrington v. California, 395 U. S. 250 (1969).  We must reject this contention.  The Double Jeopardy Clause, as we have noted, is cast in terms of the risk or hazard of trial and conviction, not of the ultimate legal consequences of the verdict.  To be charged and to be subjected to a second trial for first-degree murder is an ordeal not to be viewed lightly.  10 Further, and perhaps of more importance, we cannot determine whether or not the murder charge against petitioner induced the jury to find him guilty of the less serious offense of voluntary manslaughter rather than to continue to debate his innocence.  See United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. *332 Wilkins, 348 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 913 (1966).

 5 See People v. Jackson, 20 N. Y. 2d 440, 231 N. E. 2d 722 (1967).  6 Brief for Plaintiff in Error, No. 692, O. T. 1909, p. 2.  7 Id., 5.  8 Ibid. 9 In Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 (1937), this Court refused to overturn a first-degree murder conviction obtained after the State had successfully appealed from a conviction of second-degree murder which was the product of a trial on first-degree murder charges.  The Court ruled that federal double jeopardy standards were not applicable to the States.  Palko was overruled in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969), where this Court determined that the double jeopardy *331 prohibition of the Fifth Amendment should be applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  <citedDecision>Brantley</citedDecision> and PcAko were of the same genre, and <citedDecision>Brantley</citedDecision> necessarily shared Palko’s fate in Benton .  The last of the decisions of the Georgia courts affirming the petitioner’s conviction was rendered on September 24, 1968, well before Benton was decided, But Benton has fully retroactive application, see Waller v. Florida, 397 U. S. 387 , 391 n. 2 (1970), and the Georgia courts’ reliance on the themes of <citedDecision>Brantley</citedDecision> , though understandable, now has no place.  10 There is a significant difference to an accused whether he is being tried for murder or manslaughter.  He has reason for concern as to the consequences in terms of stigma as well as penalty.  He must be prepared to meet not only the evidence of the prosecution and the verdict of the jury but the verdict of the community as well.
