 Indeed, the Senate Subcommittee on Housing and Urban Affairs was informed in hearings held after the Court of Appeals had rendered its decision in this case that § 1982 might well be “a presently valid federal statutory ban against discrimination by private persons in the sale or lease of real property.” 16 The Subcommittee was told, however, that even if this Court should so construe § 1982, the existence of that statute would not “eliminate the need for congressional action” to spell out “responsibility on the part of the federal government to enforce the rights it protects.” 17 The point was made that, in light of the many difficulties *416 confronted by private litigants seeking to enforce such rights on their own.  “legislation is needed to establish federal machinery for enforcement of the rights guaranteed under Section 1982 of Title 42 even if the plaintiffs in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Company should prevail in the United States Supreme Court.” 18 On April 10, 1968, Representative Kelly of New York focused the attention of the House upon the present case and its possible significance.  She described the background of this litigation, recited the text of § 1982, and then added: “When the Attorney General was asked in court about the effect of the old law [§ 1982] as compared with the pending legislation which is being considered on the House floor today, he said that the scope was somewhat different, the remedies and procedures were different, and that the new law was still quite necessary.” 19 Later the same day, the House passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968.  Its enactment had no effect upon § 1982 20 *417 and no effect upon this litigation, 21 but it underscored the vast differences between, on the one hand, a general statute applicable only to racial discrimination in the rental and sale of property and enforceable only by private parties acting on their own initiative, and, on the other hand, a detailed housing law, applicable to a broad range of discriminatory practices and enforceable by a complete arsenal of federal authority.  Having noted these differences, we turn to a consideration of § 1982 itself.  II.  This Court last had occasion to consider the scope of 42 U. S. C. § 1982 in 1948, in Hurd v. Hodge, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 24</citedDecision> .  That case arose when property owners in the District of Columbia sought to enforce racially restrictive covenants against the Negro purchasers of several homes on their block.  A federal district court enforced the restrictive agreements by declaring void the deeds of the Negro purchasers.  It enjoined further attempts to sell or lease them the properties in question and directed them to “remove themselves and all of their personal belongings” from the premises within 60 days.  The *418 Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, 22 and this Court granted certiorari 23 to decide whether § 1982, then § 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, barred enforcement of the racially restrictive agreements in that case. The agreements in <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> covered only two-thirds of the lots of a single city block, and preventing Negroes from buying or renting homes in that specific area would not have rendered them ineligible to do so elsewhere in the city.  Thus, if § 1982 had been thought to do no more than grant Negro citizens the legal capacity to buy and rent property free of prohibitions that wholly disabled them because of their race, judicial enforcement of the restrictive covenants at issue would not have violated § 1982.  But this Court took a broader view of the statute.  Although the covenants could have been enforced without denying the general right of Negroes to purchase or lease real estate, the enforcement of those covenant-s would nonetheless have denied the Negro purchasers “the same right ‘as is enjoyed by white citizens ... to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.’ ” <citedDecision>334 U. S., at 34</citedDecision> .  That result, this Court concluded, was prohibited by *419 § 1982.  To suggest otherwise, the Court said, “is to reject the plain meaning of language.” Ibid. <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> v. Hodge, su-pra, squarely held, therefore, that a Negro citizen who is denied the opportunity to purchase the home he wants “[s]olely because of [his] race and color,” <citedDecision>334 U. S., at 34</citedDecision> , has suffered the kind of injury that § 1982 was designed to prevent.  Accord, Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 79 ; Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 ; Richmond v. Deans, 281 U. S. 704 .  The basic source of the injury in <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> was, of course, the action of private individuals — white citizens who had agreed to exclude Negroes from a residential area.  But an arm of the Government — in that case, a federal court — had assisted in the enforcement of that agreement.  24 Thus <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Hodge, supra,</citedDecision> did not present the question whether purely private discrimination, unaided by any action on the part of government, would violate § 1982 if its effect were to deny a citizen the right to rent or buy property solely because of his race or color.  The only federal court (other than the Court of Appeals in this case) that has ever squarely confronted that question held that a wholly private conspiracy among white citizens to prevent a Negro from leasing a farm violated § 1982.  United States v. Morris, 125 F. 322 .  It is true that a dictum in <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> said that § 1982 was directed only toward “governmental action,” <citedDecision>334 U. S., at 31</citedDecision> , but neither <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> nor any other case *420 before or since has presented that precise issue for adjudication in this Court. 25 Today we face that issue for the first time.  III. We begin with the language of the statute itself.  In plain and unambiguous terms', § 1982 grants to all citizens, without regard to race or color, “the same right” to purchase and lease property “as is enjoyed by white citizens.” As the Court of Appeals in this case evidently recognized, that right can be impaired as effec *421 tively by "those who place property on the market” 26 as by the State itself.  For, even if the State and its agents lend no support to those who wish to exclude persons from their communities on racial grounds, the fact remains that, whenever property “is placed on the market for whites only, whites have a right denied to Negroes.” 27 So long as a Negro citizen who wants to buy or rent a home can be turned away simply because he is not white, he cannot be said to enjoy “the same right ... as is enjoyed by white citizens .  .  .  to .

 .  .  without any qualification and without any restriction whatever 67 Another predicted, as a corollary, that the Act would preclude preferential treatment for white persons in the rental of hotel rooms and in the sale of church pews.  68 Those observations elicited no reply.  On April 6 the Senate, and on April 9 the House, overrode the President's veto by the requisite majorities, 69 and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 became law. 70 *436 In light of the concerns that led Congress to adopt it and the contents of the debates that preceded its passage, it is clear that the Act was designed to do just what its terms suggest: to prohibit all racial discrimination, whether or not under color of law, with respect to the rights enumerated therein — including the right to purchase or lease property.  Nor was the scope of the 1866 Act altered when it was re-enacted in 1870, some two years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.  71 It is quite true that some members of Congress supported the Fourteenth Amendment “in order to eliminate doubt as to the constitutional validity of the Civil Rights Act as applied to the States.” Hurd v. Hodge, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 24, 32-33</citedDecision> .  But it certainly does not follow that the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment or the subsequent readoption of the Civil Rights Act were meant somehow to limit its application to state action.  The legislative history furnishes not the slightest factual basis for any such speculation, and the conditions prevailing in 1870 make it highly implausible.  For by that time most, if not all, of the former Confederate States, then under the control of “reconstructed” legislatures, had formally repudiated racial discrimination, and the focus of congressional concern had clearly shifted from hostile statutes to the activities of groups like the Ku Klux Klan, operating wholly outside the law. 72 *437 Against this background, it would obviously make no sense to assume, without any historical support whatever, that Congress made a silent decision in 1870 to exempt private discrimination from the operation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.  73 “The cardinal rule is that repeals by implication are not favored.” Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503 .  All Congress said in 1870 was that the 1866 law “is hereby re-enacted.” That is all Congress meant.  As we said in a somewhat different setting two Terms ago, “We think that history leaves no doubt that, if we are to give [the law] the scope that its origins dictate, we must accord it a sweep as broad as its language.” United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 801 .

 332 U. S. 789 .  Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 , invalidating a New Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community, or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, “except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected.” See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 12 .  Two of this Court’s early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action.  Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 ; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17.  But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra, actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322 .  See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 797-804 .  And of course the Civil Rights Cases, supra, which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 335 , did not'involve the present statute at all. It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 24, 31</citedDecision> , characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , as having “held” that “[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute .  .  .  [are] directed is governmental action.” 334 U. S., at 31.  But no such statement appears in the Corrigan opinion, and a careful examination of Corrigan reveals that it cannot be read as authority for the proposition attributed to it in <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> .  In Corrigan , suits had been brought to enjoin a threatened violation of certain restrictive covenants in the District of Columbia.  The courts of the District had granted relief, see 55 App. D. C. 30, 299 F. 899 , and the case reached this Court on appeal.  As the opinion in Corrigan specifically recognized, no claim that the covenants could not validly be enforced against the appellants had been raised in the lower courts, and no such claim was properly before this Court. 271 U. S., at 330-331 .  The only question presented for decision was whether the restrictive covenants themselves violated the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and §§ 1977, 1978, and 1979 of the Revised Statutes *421 (now 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981 , 1982, and 1983).  Ibid. Addressing itself to that narrow question, the Court said that none of the provisions relied upon by the appellants prohibited private individuals from “enter[ing] into .  .

Stampp, supra, n. 34, at 145, 171, 185, 198-204; G. Stephenson, Race Distinctions in American Law 116 (1910).  The Court of Appeals in this case seems to have derived such an assumption from language in Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 , and Hurd v. Hodge, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 24, 31</citedDecision> .  See 379 F. 2d 33 , 39-40, 43.  Both of those opinions simply asserted that, at least after its re-enactment in 1870, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was directed only at governmental action.  Neither opinion explained why that was thought to be so, and in each oase the statement was merely dictum.  See n. 25, supra. So it was, for example, that this Court unanimously upheld the power of Congress under the Thirteenth Amendment to make it a crime for one individual to compel another to work in order to discharge a debt.

**Concurrence Opinion**
Me. Justice Douglas, concurring. The Act of April 9, 1866, 14 Stat. 27 , 42 U. S .C. § 1982, provides: “All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, aiid convey real and personal property.” This Act was passed to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment which in § 1 abolished “slavery” and “involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted” and in. § 2 gave Congress power “to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” Enabling a Negro to buy and sell real and personal property is a removal of one of many badges of slavery. “Slaves were not considered men. . . . They could own nothing; they could make no contracts; they could hold no property, nor traffic in property; they could not hire out; they could not legally marry nor constitute families; they could not control their children; they could not appeal from their master; they could be punished at will.” W. Dubois, Black Reconstruction in America 10 (1964) , 1 *445 The true curse of slavery is not what it did to the black man, but what it has done to the white man. For the existence of the institution produced the notion that the white man was of superior character, intelligence, and morality. The blacks were little more than livestock— to be fed and fattened for the economic benefits they could bestow through their labors, and to be subjected to authority, often with cruelty, to make clear who was master and who slave. Some badges of slavery remain today. While the institution has been outlawed, it has remained in the minds and hearts of many white men. Cases which have come to this Court depict a spectacle of slavery unwilling to die. We have seen contrivances by States designed to thwart Negro voting, e. g., Lane, v. Wilson, 307 U. S. 268 . Negroes have been excluded over and again from juries solely on account of their race, e. g., Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U. S. 303 , or have been forced to sit in segregated seats in courtrooms, Johnson v. Virginia, 373 U. S. 61 . They have been made to attend segregated and inferior schools, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 , or been denied entrance to colleges or graduate schools because of their color, e. g., Pennsylvania v. Board of Trusts, 353 U. S. 230 ; Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U. S. 629 . Negroes have been prosecuted for marrying whites, e. g., Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 . They have been forced to live in segregated residential districts, Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60 , and residents of white neighborhoods have denied them entrance, e. g., Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1 . Negroes have been forced to use segregated facilities in going about their daily lives, having been excluded from railway coaches, Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537 ; public parks, New Orleans Park Improvement Assn. v. Detiege, 358 U. S. 54 ; restaurants, Lombard v. Louisiana, 373 U. S. 267 ; public beaches, Mayor of Baltimore v. Dawson, 350 U. S. 877 ; municipal *446 golf courses, Holmes v. City of Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 ; amusement parks, Griffin v. Maryland, 378 U. S. 130 ; buses, Gayle v. Browder, 352 U. S. 903 ; public libraries, Brown v. Louisiana, 383 U. S. 131 . A state court judge in Alabama convicted a Negro woman of contempt of court because she refused to answer him when he addressed her as “Mary,” although she had made the simple request to be called “Miss Hamilton.” Hamilton v. Alabama, 376 U. S. 650 . That brief sampling of discriminatory practices, many of which continue today, stands almost as an annotation to what Frederick Douglass (1817-1895) wrote nearly a century earlier: “Of all the races and varieties of men which have suffered from this feeling, the colored people of this country have endured most. They can resort to no disguises which will enable them to escape its deadly aim. They carry in front the evidence which marks them for persecution. They stand at the extreme point of difference from the Caucasian race, and their African origin can be instantly recognized, though they may be several removes from the typical African race. They may remonstrate like Shylock— ‘Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same summer and winter, as a Christian is?’ — but such eloquence is unavailing. They are Negroes — and that is enough, in the eye of this unreasoning prejudice, to justify indignity and violence. In nearly every department of American life they are confronted by this insidious influence. It fills the air. It meets them at the workshop and factory, when they apply for work. It meets them at the church, at the hotel, at the *447 ballot-box, and worst of all, it meets them in the jury-box. Without crime or offense against law or gospel, the colored man is the Jean Yaljean of American society. He has escaped from the galleys, and hence all presumptions are against him. The workshop denies him work, and the inn denies him shelter; the ballot-box a fair vote, and the jury-box a fair trial. He has ceased to be the slave of an individual, but has in some sense become the slave of society. He may not now be bought and sold like a beast in the market, but he is the trammeled victim of a prejudice, well calculated to repress his manly ambition, paralyze his energies, and make him a dejected and spiritless man, if not a sullen enemy to society, fit to prey upon life and property and to make trouble generally.” 2 Today the black is protected by a host of civil rights laws. But the forces of discrimination are still strong. A member of his race, duly elected by the people to a state legislature, is barred from that assembly because of his views on the Vietnam war. Bond v. Floyd, 385 U. S. 116 . Real estate agents use artifice to avoid selling “white property” to the blacks. 3 The blacks who travel the country, though entitled by law to the facilities for sleeping and dining that are offered all tourists, Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 , may well learn that the “vacancy” sign does not mean what it says, especially if the motel has a swimming pool. On entering a half-empty restaurant they may find “reserved” signs on all unoccupied tables. *448 The black is often barred from a labor union because of his race. 4 He learns that the order directing admission of his children into white schools has not been obeyed “with all deliberate speed/’ Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294, 301 , but has been delayed by numerous stratagems and devices. 5 State laws, at times, have even en *449 couraged discrimination in housing. Reitman v. Mulkey, 387 U. S. 369 . This recital is enough to show how prejudices, once part and parcel of slavery, still persist. The men who sat in Congress in 1866 were trying to remove some of the badges or “customs” 6 of slavery when they enacted § 1982. And, as my Brother Stewart shows, the Congress that passed the so-called Open Housing Act in 1968 did not undercut any of the grounds on which § 1982 rests.

See also Rogers v. Paul, 382 U. S. 198 ; Calhoun v. Latimer, 377 U. S. 263 ; Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 . My Brother Harlan’s listing of some of the “customs” prevailing in the North at the time § 1982 was first enacted shows the extent of organized white discrimination against newly freed blacks. As he states, “ [residential segregation was the prevailing pattern almost everywhere in the North.” Post, at 474-475. Certainly, then, it was “customary.” To suggest, however, that there might be room for argument in this case (post, at 475, n. 65) that the discrimination against petitioners was not in some measure a part and product of this longstanding and widespread customary pattern is to pervert the problem by allowing the legal mind to draw lines and make distinctions that have no place in the jurisprudence of a nation striving to rejoin the human race.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 .  .  The Civil Rights Bill here referred to is analogous in its character to what a law would have been under the original Constitution, declaring that the validity of contracts should not be impaired, and that if any person bound by a contract should refuse to comply with it, under color or pretence that it had been rendered void or invalid by a State law, he should be liable to an action upon it in the courts of the United States, with the addition of a penalty for setting up such an unjust and unconstitutional defence.” Id., at 16-17.  5 In Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , the question was whether the courts of the District of Columbia might enjoin prospective breaches of racially restrictive covenants.  The Court held that it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioners’ argument that the covenant was void because it contravened the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments and their implementing statutes.  The Court reasoned, inter alia, that the statutes, including the immediate predecessor of § 1982, 6 were inapplicable because “they, like the Constitutional Amendment under whose sanction they were enacted, do not in any manner prohibit or invalidate contracts entered into *452 by private individuals in respect to the control and disposition of their own property.” Id., at 331.  7 In Hurd v. Hodge, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 24</citedDecision> , the issue was again whether the courts of the District might enforce racially restrictive covenants.  At the outset of the process of reasoning by which it held that judicial enforcement of such a covenant would violate the predecessor of § 1982, the Court said: “We may start with the proposition that the statute does not invalidate private restrictive agreements so long as the purposes of those agreements are achieved by the parties through voluntary adherence to the terms.  The action toward which the provisions of the statute under consideration is [sic] directed is governmental action.  Such was the holding of Corrigan v. Buckley ....’’ Id., at 31.  8 B. Like the Court, I begin analysis of § 1982 by examining its language.  In its present form, the section provides: “All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.” The Court finds it “plain and unambiguous,” ante, at 420, that this language forbids purely private as well as state-authorized discrimination.  With all respect, I do not find it so. For me, there is an inherent ambiguity in the *453 term “right,” as used in § 1982.
**Combined Opinion**
[17] The point was made that, in light of the many difficulties *416 confronted by private litigants seeking to enforce such rights on their own, "legislation is needed to establish federal machinery for enforcement of the rights guaranteed under Section 1982 of Title 42 even if the plaintiffs in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Company should prevail in the United States Supreme Court." [18] On April 10, 1968, Representative Kelly of New York focused the attention of the House upon the present case and its possible significance.  She described the background of this litigation, recited the text of § 1982, and then added: "When the Attorney General was asked in court about the effect of the old law [§ 1982] as compared with the pending legislation which is being considered on the House floor today, he said that the scope was somewhat different, the remedies and procedures were different, and that the new law was still quite necessary." [19] Later the same day, the House passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968.  Its enactment had no effect upon § 1982 [20] *417 and no effect upon this litigation, [21] but it underscored the vast differences between, on the one hand, a general statute applicable only to racial discrimination in the rental and sale of property and enforceable only by private parties acting on their own initiative, and, on the other hand, a detailed housing law, applicable to a broad range of discriminatory practices and enforceable by a complete arsenal of federal authority.  Having noted these differences, we turn to a consideration of § 1982 itself.  II.  This Court last had occasion to consider the scope of 42 U. S. C. § 1982 in 1948, in Hurd v. Hodge, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 24</citedDecision> .  That case arose when property owners in the District of Columbia sought to enforce racially restrictive covenants against the Negro purchasers of several homes on their block.  A federal district court enforced the restrictive agreements by declaring void the deeds of the Negro purchasers.  It enjoined further attempts to sell or lease them the properties in question and directed them to "remove themselves and all of their personal belongings" from the premises within 60 days.  The *418 Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed, [22] and this Court granted certiorari [23] to decide whether § 1982, then § 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, barred enforcement of the racially restrictive agreements in that case. The agreements in <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> covered only two-thirds of the lots of a single city block, and preventing Negroes from buying or renting homes in that specific area would not have rendered them ineligible to do so elsewhere in the city.  Thus, if § 1982 had been thought to do no more than grant Negro citizens the legal capacity to buy and rent property free of prohibitions that wholly disabled them because of their race, judicial enforcement of the restrictive covenants at issue would not have violated § 1982.  But this Court took a broader view of the statute.  Although the covenants could have been enforced without denying the general right of Negroes to purchase or lease real estate, the enforcement of those covenants would nonetheless have denied the Negro purchasers "the same right `as is enjoyed by white citizens .  .  .  to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.' " <citedDecision>334 U. S., at 34</citedDecision> .  That result, this Court concluded, was prohibited by *419 § 1982.  To suggest otherwise, the Court said, "is to reject the plain meaning of language." Ibid. Hurd v. <citedDecision>Hodge, supra</citedDecision> , squarely held, therefore, that a Negro citizen who is denied the opportunity to purchase the home he wants "[s]olely because of [his] race and color," <citedDecision>334 U. S., at 34</citedDecision> , has suffered the kind of injury that § 1982 was designed to prevent.  Accord, Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 79 ; Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 ; Richmond v. Deans, 281 U. S. 704 .  The basic source of the injury in <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> was, of course, the action of private individualswhite citizens who had agreed to exclude Negroes from a residential area.  But an arm of the Governmentin that case, a federal courthad assisted in the enforcement of that agreement.  [24] Thus <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Hodge, supra</citedDecision> , did not present the question whether purely private discrimination, unaided by any action on the part of government, would violate § 1982 if its effect were to deny a citizen the right to rent or buy property solely because of his race or color.  The only federal court (other than the Court of Appeals in this case) that has ever squarely confronted that question held that a wholly private conspiracy among white citizens to prevent a Negro from leasing a farm violated § 1982.  United States v. Morris, 125 F. 322 .  It is true that a dictum in <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> said that § 1982 was directed only toward "governmental action," <citedDecision>334 U. S., at 31</citedDecision> , but neither <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> nor any other case *420 before or since has presented that precise issue for adjudication in this Court. [25] Today we face that issue for the first time.  III. We begin with the language of the statute itself.  In plain and unambiguous terms, § 1982 grants to all citizens, without regard to race or color, "the same right" to purchase and lease property "as is enjoyed by white citizens." As the Court of Appeals in this case evidently recognized, that right can be impaired as effectively *421 by "those who place property on the market" [26] as by the State itself.  For, even if the State and its agents lend no support to those who wish to exclude persons from their communities on racial grounds, the fact remains that, whenever property "is placed on the market for whites only, whites have a right denied to Negroes." [27] So long as a Negro citizen who wants to buy or rent a home can be turned away simply because he is not white, he cannot be said to enjoy "the same right .  .

 ." [67] Another predicted, as a corollary, that the Act would preclude preferential treatment for white persons in the rental of hotel rooms and in the sale of church pews.  [68] Those observations elicited no reply.  On April 6 the Senate, and on April 9 the House, overrode the President's veto by the requisite majorities, [69] and the Civil Rights Act of 1866 became law. [70] *436 In light of the concerns that led Congress to adopt it and the contents of the debates that preceded its passage, it is clear that the Act was designed to do just what its terms suggest: to prohibit all racial discrimination, whether or not under color of law, with respect to the rights enumerated thereinincluding the right to purchase or lease property.  Nor was the scope of the 1866 Act altered when it was re-enacted in 1870, some two years after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment.  [71] It is quite true that some members of Congress supported the Fourteenth Amendment "in order to eliminate doubt as to the constitutional validity of the Civil Rights Act as applied to the States." Hurd v. Hodge, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 24, 32-33</citedDecision> .  But it certainly does not follow that the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment or the subsequent readoption of the Civil Rights Act were meant somehow to limit its application to state action.  The legislative history furnishes not the slightest factual basis for any such speculation, and the conditions prevailing in 1870 make it highly implausible.  For by that time most, if not all, of the former Confederate States, then under the control of "reconstructed" legislatures, had formally repudiated racial discrimination, and the focus of congressional concern had clearly shifted from hostile statutes to the activities of groups like the Ku Klux Klan, operating wholly outside the law. [72] *437 Against this background, it would obviously make no sense to assume, without any historical support whatever, that Congress made a silent decision in 1870 to exempt private discrimination from the operation of the Civil Rights Act of 1866.  [73] "The cardinal rule is that repeals by implication are not favored." Posadas v. National City Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503 .  All Congress said in 1870 was that the 1866 law "is hereby re-enacted."

 The Civil Rights Bill here referred to is analogous in its character to what a law would have been under the original Constitution, declaring that the validity of contracts should not be impaired, and that if any person bound by a contract should refuse to comply with it, under color or pretence that it had been rendered void or invalid by a State law, he should be liable to an action upon it in the courts of the United States, with the addition of a penalty for setting up such an unjust and unconstitutional defence." Id., at 16-17.  [5] In Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , the question was whether the courts of the District of Columbia might enjoin prospective breaches of racially restrictive covenants.  The Court held that it was without jurisdiction to consider the petitioners' argument that the covenant was void because it contravened the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments and their implementing statutes.  The Court reasoned, inter alia, that the statutes, including the immediate predecessor of § 1982, [6] were inapplicable because "they, like the Constitutional Amendment under whose sanction they were enacted, do not in any manner prohibit or invalidate contracts entered into *452 by private individuals in respect to the control and disposition of their own property." Id., at 331.  [7] In Hurd v. Hodge, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 24</citedDecision> , the issue was again whether the courts of the District might enforce racially restrictive covenants.  At the outset of the process of reasoning by which it held that judicial enforcement of such a covenant would violate the predecessor of § 1982, the Court said: "We may start with the proposition that the statute does not invalidate private restrictive agreements so long as the purposes of those agreements are achieved by the parties through voluntary adherence to the terms.  The action toward which the provisions of the statute under consideration is [ sic ] directed is governmental action.  Such was the holding of Corrigan v. Buckley .  .  .  ."

 [24]  Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 , invalidating a New Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community, or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, "except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected." See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 12 .  [25]  Two of this Court's early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action.  Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 ; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17.  But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra , actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322.  See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 797-804 .  And of course the Civil Rights Cases, supra , which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 335 , did not involve the present statute at all. It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 24, 31</citedDecision> , characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , as having "held" that "[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute .  .  .  [are] directed is governmental action." 334 U. S., at 31.  But no such statement appears in the Corrigan opinion, and a careful examination of Corrigan reveals that it cannot be read as authority for the proposition attributed to it in <citedDecision>Hurd</citedDecision> .  In Corrigan , suits had been brought to enjoin a threatened violation of certain restrictive covenants in the District of Columbia.  The courts of the District had granted relief, see 55 App. D. C. 30, 299 F. 899 , and the case reached this Court on appeal.  As the opinion in Corrigan specifically recognized, no claim that the covenants could not validly be enforced against the appellants had been raised in the lower courts, and no such claim was properly before this Court. 271 U. S., at 330-331 .  The only question presented for decision was whether the restrictive covenants themselves violated the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and §§ 1977, 1978, and 1979 of the Revised Statutes (now 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981 , 1982, and 1983).  Ibid. Addressing itself to that narrow question, the Court said that none of the provisions relied upon by the appellants prohibited private individuals from "enter[ing] into .  .

W. Brock, supra, n. 36, at 115.  [71]  Section 18 of the Enforcement Act of 1870, Act of May 31, 1870, c. 114, § 18, 16 Stat. 144 : " And be it further enacted, That the act to protect all persons in the United States in their civil rights, and furnish the means of their vindication, passed April nine, eighteen hundred and sixty-six, is hereby re-enacted .  .  .  ." [72]  See United States v. Mosley, 238 U. S. 383, 387-388 ; United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 804-805 ; 2 W. Fleming, Documentary History of Reconstruction 285-288 (1907); K. Stampp, supra, n. 34, at 145, 171, 185, 198-204; G. Stephenson, Race Distinctions in American Law 116 (1910).  [73]  The Court of Appeals in this case seems to have derived such an assumption from language in Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 , and Hurd v. Hodge, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 24, 31</citedDecision> .  See 379 F. 2d 33 , 39-40, 43.  Both of those opinions simply asserted that, at least after its re-enactment in 1870, the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was directed only at governmental action.  Neither opinion explained why that was thought to be so, and in each case the statement was merely dictum.  See n. 25, supra. [74]  So it was, for example, that this Court unanimously upheld the power of Congress under the Thirteenth Amendment to make it a crime for one individual to compel another to work in order to discharge a debt.
