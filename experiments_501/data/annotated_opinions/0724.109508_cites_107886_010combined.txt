Jacksonville Terminal Co., <citedDecision>394 U. S. 369</citedDecision> , 383 n. 19 (1969).  Each of these distinct aspects of labor law pre-emption has had its own history in our decisions, to which we now turn.  We consider first pre-emption based predominantly on the primary jurisdiction of the Board.  This line of pre-emption analysis was developed in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra , and its history was recently summarized in Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 290-291 (1971): "[V]arying approaches were taken by the Court in initially grappling with this pre-emption problem.  Thus, for example, some early cases suggested the true distinction lay between judicial application of general common law, which was permissible, as opposed to state rules specifically designed to regulate *139 labor relations, which were pre-empted.  See, e. g., Automobile Workers v. Russell, 356 U. S. 634, 645 (1958).  Others made pre-emption turn on whether the States purported to apply a remedy not provided for by the federal scheme, e. g., Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 348 U. S. 468, 479-480 (1955), while in still others the Court undertook a thorough scrutiny of the federal Act to ascertain whether the state courts had, in fact, arrived at conclusions inconsistent with its provisions, e. g., Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd., 336 U. S. 245 (1949).

 .  to rely ultimately on its economic strength to try to secure what it cannot obtain through bargaining." "[R]esort to economic weapons should more peaceful measures not avail" is the right of the employer as well as the employee, American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S., at 317, [8] and the State may not prohibit the use of such weapons or "add to an employer's federal legal obligations in collective bargaining" any more than in the case of employees.  Cox, supra, n. 4, at 1365.  See, e. g., Beasley v. Food Fair of North Carolina, 416 U. S. 653 (1974).  Whether self-help economic activities are employed by employer or union, the crucial inquiry regarding pre-emption is the same: whether "the exercise *148 of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act's processes." <citedDecision>Railroad Trainmen</citedDecision> v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., <citedDecision>394 U. S., at 380</citedDecision> .  III There is simply no question that the Act's processes would be frustrated in the instant case were the State's ruling permitted to stand.  The employer in this case invoked the Wisconsin law because it was unable to overcome the Union tactic with its own economic self-help means.  [9] Although it did employ economic weapons putting pressure on the Union when it terminated the previous *149 agreement, supra, at 134, it apparently lacked sufficient economic strength to secure its bargaining demands under "the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy," Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S., at 260 .  [10] But the economic weakness of the affected party cannot justify state aid contrary to federal law for, as we have developed, "the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is not a grudging exception [under] .  .  .

Since Briggs-Stratton is today overruled, and as we hold further that the Union's refusal to work overtime is peaceful conduct constituting activity which must be free of regulation by the States if the congressional intent in enacting the comprehensive federal law of labor relations is not to be frustrated, the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is Reversed.  MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.  The Court correctly identifies the critical inquiry with respect to pre-emption as whether "the exercise of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act's processes." Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., <citedDecision>394 U. S. 369, 380</citedDecision> (1969).  See ante, at 147-148.  This is equally true whether the self-help activities *156 are those of the employer or the Union.  I agree with the Court that the Wisconsin law, as applied in this case, is pre-empted since it directly curtails the self-help capability of the Union and its members, resulting in a significant shift in the balance of free economic bargaining power struck by Congress.  I write to make clear my understanding that the Court's opinion does not, however, preclude the States from enforcing, in the context of a labor dispute, "neutral" state statutes or rules of decision: state laws that are not directed toward altering the bargaining positions of employers or unions but which may have an incidental effect on relative bargaining strength.  Except where Congress has specifically provided otherwise, the States generally should remain free to enforce, for example, their law of torts or of contracts, and other laws reflecting neutral public policy.

 [6]  Although Mr. Justice Harlan took issue with the statement in Garmon that States may "be powerless to act when the underlying activities are clearly `neither protected nor prohibited' by the federal Act," 359 U. S., at 253 (concurring in result), his later opinions make plain that the point of disagreement concerned the use of the term "protected" rather than the substantive concept.  "In the context of labor relations law, this word is fraught with ambiguity.  `Protected conduct' may, for example, refer to employee conduct which the States may not prohibit, .  .  .  or to conduct against which the employer may not retaliate." Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., <citedDecision>394 U. S. 369</citedDecision> , 382 n. 17 (1969).  Indeed, Mr. Justice Harlan thereafter expressly adopted the Garmon formulation.  Hanna Mining v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S., at 187 .  It has been suggested that rather than "protected," `[p]ermitted activities' would be better shorthand for this category of employee conduct because it may beindeed isprotected against state, but not employer interference."
