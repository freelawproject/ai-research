 It follows, however, from our conclusion that New York’s program is incompatible with §402 (a) (23), that petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief and an appropriate injunction by the District Court against the payment of federal monies according to the new schedules, should the State not develop a conforming plan within a reasonable period of time.  “We have considered and rejected the argument that a federal court is without power to review state welfare provisions or prohibit the use of federal funds by the States in view of the fact that Congress has lodged in the Department of HEW the power to cut off federal funds for noncompliance with statutory requirements.  We are most reluctant to assume Congress has closed the avenue of effective judicial review to those individuals most directly affected by the administration of its program.  .  .  .  We adhere to King v. Smith, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 309</citedDecision> (1968), which implicitly rejected the argument that the statutory provisions for HEW review of plans should be read to curtail judicial relief and held Alabama’s ‘substitute father’ regulation to be inconsistent with the federal statute.  While <citedDecision>King</citedDecision> did not advert specifically to the remedial problem, the unarticulated premise was that the State had alternative choices of assuming the additional cost of paying benefits to families with substitute fathers or not using federal funds to pay welfare benefits according to a plan that was inconsistent with federal requirements.” <citedDecision>Id., at 420-421</citedDecision> .  Respondent urges that this language is “tantamount to a finding that Congress conditioned the participation of a state in the categorical assistance program on the forfeiture of immunity from suit in a federal forum .  .  .  irrespective of the relief sought, [since] the intent of Congress remains constant.” Brief for Respondent 42-43.  Petitioner contends that this language, coupled with the fact that the Court in Rosado remanded the case to the District *677 Court to “afford New York an opportunity to revise its program .  .

Me. Justice Marshall, with whom Mr. Justice Blackmun joins, dissenting.  The Social Security Act’s categorical assistance programs, including the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD) program involved here, are fundamentally different from most federal legislation.  Unlike the Fair Labor Standards Act involved in last Term’s decision in Employees v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973), or the Federal Employers’ Liability Act-at issue in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), the Social Security Act does not impose federal standards and liability upon all who engage in certain regulated activities, including often-unwilling state agencies.  Instead, the Act seeks to induce state participation in the federal welfare programs by offering federal matching funds in exchange for the State’s voluntary assumption of the Act’s requirements.  I find this basic distinction crucial: it leads me to conclude that by participation in the programs, the States waive whatever immunity they might otherwise have from federal court *689 orders requiring retroactive payment of welfare benefits.  1 In its contacts with the Social Security Act’s assistance programs in recent years, the Court has frequently described the Act as a “scheme of cooperative federalism.” See, e. g., King v. Smith, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 309, 316</citedDecision> (1968); Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U. S. 535, 542 (1972).  While this phrase captures a number of the unique characteristics of these programs, for present purposes it serves to emphasize that the States’ decision to participate in the programs is a voluntary one.  In deciding to participate, however, the States necessarily give up their freedom to operate assistance programs for the needy as they see fit, and bind themselves to conform their programs to the requirements of the federal statute and regulations.  As the Court explained in King v. <citedDecision>Smith, supra, at 316-317</citedDecision> (citations omitted): “States are not required to participate in the program, but those which desire to take advantage of the substantial federal funds available for distribution to needy children [or needy aged, blind or disabled] are required to submit an AFDC [or AABD] plan for the approval of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).  The plan must conform with several requirements of the Social Security Act and with rules and regulations promulgated by HEW.” So here, Illinois elected to participate in the AABD program, and received and expended substantial federal funds in the years at issue.  It thereby obligated itself to comply with federal law, including the require *690 ment of former 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (a) (8) that “such aid or assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals.” In Townsend v. Swank, 404 U. S. 282, 286 (1971), we held that participating States must strictly comply with the requirement that aid be furnished “to all eligible individuals,” and that the States have no power to impose additional eligibility requirements which exclude persons eligible for assistance under federal standards.  Today’s decision, ante, at 659-660, n. 8, properly emphasizes that participating States must also comply strictly with the “reasonable promptness” requirement and the more detailed regulations'adding content to it.  In agreeing to comply with the requirements of the Social Security Act and HEW regulations, I believe that Illinois has also agreed to subject itself to suit in the federal courts to enforce these obligations.  I recognize, of course, that the Social Security Act does not itself provide for a cause of action to enforce its obligations.  As the Court points out, the only sanction expressly provided in the Act for a participating State’s failure to comply with federal requirements is the cutoff of federal funding by the Secretary of HEW.
