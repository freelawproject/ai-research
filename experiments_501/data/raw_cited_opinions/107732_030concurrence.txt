<p id="AoA">concurring in the result.</p>
<p id="b190-7">While I agree with the result and much of the reasoning in the opinion of the Court in this case, I find myself unable to accept what I take to be the holding that the doctrine of <em>in pari delicto </em>has no place in a treble-damage antitrust action. Not only is it unnecessary to pass on such a broad proposition on the facts of this case, as the Court’s opinion reveals, but the holding itself is, in my opinion, incorrect.</p>
<p id="b190-8">I agree that the “complex scope, contents, and effects” of the doctrine as it has grown up in the common law should not be applied mechanically to private antitrust <page-number citation-index="1" label="149">*149</page-number>actions under the relevant federal statutes. On the other hand, I believe that a limited application of the basic principle behind the doctrine of <em>in pari delicto </em>is both proper and desirable in the antitrust field. As the Court notes, <em>ante, </em>at 138, the literal meaning of <em>in pari delicto </em>is of equal fault. I would hold that where a defendant in a private antitrust suit can show that the plaintiff actively participated in the formation and implementation of an illegal scheme, and is substantially equally at fault, the plaintiff should be barred from imposing liability on the defendant.</p>
<p id="b191-4">Such an approach would still require reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case. As this Court’s opinion makes perfectly clear, the mere fact that a party enters into an agreement containing provisions that are violative of the antitrust laws with the intent to make money by operating under the agreement is not in itself sufficient to show that he is equally responsible for the existence of the illegal provisions. <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Union Oil Co., </em>377 U. S. 13 (1964). Furthermore, the Court is certainly correct in concluding that the record is replete with evidence, relating to the tying and exclusive-dealing provisions of the franchise agreement, which indicates, with sufficient probative force to withstand respondents’ motion for summary judgment, that the petitioners did not actively seek out or support all the anticompetitive restraints embodied in the franchise.</p>
<p id="b191-5">However, the inquiry should not stop here. The franchise agreement also contains provisions requiring both resale price maintenance and the observance of territorial restrictions on sales by franchisees. Both of these sets of restrictions are ones which, at least on their face, would ordinarily be expected to benefit the franchisees more than Midas. Both restrict competition between franchisees, not between Midas and other suppliers competing to sell parts to Midas franchisees. If Midas can <page-number citation-index="1" label="150">*150</page-number>make an adequate showing that those provisions were inserted into the franchise agreement at the behest and for the benefit of petitioners and their fellow franchisees, petitioners should, in my opinion, be barred from contending that they were damaged by the existence and enforcement of the provisions.</p>
<p id="b192-4">I agree with the Court that petitioners should not be barred from recovering damages attributable to the enforcement of the tying and exclusive dealing provisions-against them on the sole ground that they participated in the formulation of other anticompetitive provisions in the agreement. Cf. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Mead Service Co., </em>340 U. S. 944 (1951), vacating 184 F. 2d 338 (C. A. 10th Cir. 1950). However, if Midas could show, which it has quite clearly not done at this stage of the litigation, that petitioners actually participated in the formulation of the entire agreement, trading off anticompetitive restraints on their own freedom of action (such as the tying and exclusive dealing provisions) for anticompeti-tive restraints intended for their benefit (such as resale price maintenance or exclusive territories), petitioners should be barred from seeking damages as to the agreement as a whole.</p>
<p id="b192-5">It may be argued that the course I propose unduly complicates private antitrust litigation. A holding that a party who voluntarily enters into an agreement containing provisions that violate the antitrust laws is barred from any recovery on that agreement altogether (as the Court of Appeals has held here) or, at the other extreme, is absolutely free to recover any damages that he can show to stem from his operations under the agreement (as this Court’s opinion seems to hold) would presumably be considerably easier to apply in most cases. It seems to me, however, that neither holding would represent a satisfactory resolution of the difficult problems concerning the administration of the antitrust laws raised by <page-number citation-index="1" label="151">*151</page-number>agreements such as the one involved in the present case.</p>
<p id="b193-4">The reasons for rejecting the approach taken by the Court of Appeals are, as I have said, persuasively set forth in the opinion of the Court. The reasons I see for rejecting the approach taken by this Court are, perhaps, less related to the public interest in eliminating all forms of anticompetitive business conduct and more related to the equities as between the parties. The principle that a wrongdoer shall not be permitted to profit through his own wrongdoing is fundamental in our jurisprudence. The traditional doctrine of <em>in pari delicto </em>is itself firmly based on this principle. I nevertheless agree, because of the strong public interest in eliminating restraints on competition, that many of the refinements of moral worth demanded of plaintiffs by such traditional legal and equitable doctrines as <em>volenti non fit injuria, </em>unclean hands, and many of the variations of <em>in pari delicto </em>should not be applicable in the antitrust field. However, I cannot agree that the public interest requires that a plaintiff who has actively sought to bring about illegal restraints on competition for his own benefit be permitted to demand redress — in the form of treble damages — from a partner who is no more responsible for the existence of the illegality than the plaintiff.</p>
<p id="b193-5">The possible added deterrence to violations of the antitrust laws that would be produced by the Court’s holding may well be equaled, if not surpassed, by the new incentive it will create to commit such violations, for a potential violator will have less to lose if he can attempt to recover his losses from his partner should the scheme not work out to his benefit.</p>
<p id="b193-6">The Court’s opinion appears to seek to minimize the consequences of doing away with the to <em>pari delicto </em>defense by suggesting that a defendant will be able to have the “beneficial byproducts of a restriction” <em>{ante, </em>at 140) to the plaintiff taken into account in the compu<page-number citation-index="1" label="152">*152</page-number>tation of damages. This, of course, is to some extent already true in any antitrust case. Illegal conduct does not <em>per se </em>result in a money judgment for a plaintiff; injury must always be shown. However, a defendant might also be permitted to show that the plaintiff’s financial rewards from some of the illegal provisions of an agreement outweighed the harm suffered from other illegal provisions, and accordingly on some sort of offset theory the plaintiff would recover nothing.</p>
<p id="b194-4">If such an offset approach on the issue of damages is envisioned by the Court, it hardly seems an adequate means of preventing unjust enrichment. First, that approach clearly permits damages to be awarded when injury is shown to outweigh benefit regardless of the nature of the plaintiff’s participation in the scheme. Second, it adds an unnecessarily speculative element to the factual inquiry required in an antitrust case. While a trier of fact may have some difficulty in allocating responsibility between the parties to an agreement, the allocation can be made for the most part on the basis of hard evidence as to the facts surrounding the making of the agreement. The determination of damages in an antitrust suit, however, almost invariably requires a certain amount of speculation, no matter how informed. Cf. <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>RKO Pictures, Inc., </em>327 U. S. 251, 264-266 (1946). Such speculation is ordinarily unavoidable if damages a.re to be provable. Here there is no necessity for permitting additional speculation as to offsetting benefits in order to prevent unjust enrichment because the same goal can be achieved by a factual evaluation of the parties’ respective fault.</p>
<p id="b194-5">For example, it is obviously much easier to determine in this case whether petitioners actively participated in the formulation and implementation of the various illegal provisions of the franchise agreement than it is to decide whether the monetary benefits that petitioners obtained <page-number citation-index="1" label="153">*153</page-number>through the resale price maintenance and exclusive territorial provisions surpassed the losses they suffered from the exclusive dealing and tying arrangements. Since I regard a respective-fault approach as superior to a damage-offset approach on principle, the complications inherent in the latter inquiry merely reinforce my conviction that the Court is being unwise in broadly rejecting the doctrine of <em>in pari delicto.</em></p>
