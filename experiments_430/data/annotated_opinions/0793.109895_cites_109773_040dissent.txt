 Moreover, in terms of the practical operation of the adversary process, there is actually no difference between a so-called “true acquittal” and the termination in this case favorably to respondent.  A While the Double Jeopardy Clause often has the effect of protecting the accused’s interest in the finality of particular favorable determinations, this is not its objective.  For the Clause often permits Government appeals from final judgments favorable to the accused.  See United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332 (1975) (whether or not final judgment was an acquittal, Government may appeal if reversal would not ne *105 cessitate a retrial).  The purpose of the Clause, which the Court today fails sufficiently to appreciate, is to protect the accused against the agony and risks attendant upon undergoing more than one criminal trial for any single offense.  See ibid. A retrial increases the financial and emotional burden that any criminal trial represents for the accused, prolongs the period of the unresolved accusation of -wrongdoing, and enhances the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted.  4 See Arizona v. Washington, <citedDecision>434 U. S. 497, 503-504</citedDecision> (1978); Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187-188 (1957).  Society’s “willingness to limit the Government to a single criminal proceeding to vindicate its very vital interest in enforcement of criminal laws” bespeaks society’s recognition of the gross unfairness of requiring the accused to undergo the strain and agony of more than one trial for any single offense.  United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S. 470, 479 (1971) (opinion of Harlan, J.).  Accordingly, the policies of the Double Jeopardy Clause mandate that the Government be afforded but one complete opportunity to convict an accused and that when the first proceeding terminates in a final judgment favorable to the defendant 5 any retrial be barred.  The rule as to acquittals can only be understood as simply an application of this larger principle.  Judgments of acquittal normally result from jury or bench *106 verdicts of not guilty.  In such cases, the acquittal represents the factfinder’s conclusion that, under the controlling legal principles, the evidence does not establish that the defendant can be convicted of the offense charged in the indictment.

 *108 B The whole premise for today’s retreat from Jenkins and Lee , of course, is the Court’s new theory that a criminal defendant who seeks to avoid conviction on a “ground unrelated to factual innocence” somehow stands on a different constitutional footing from a defendant whose participation in his criminal trial creates a situation in which a judgment of acquittal has to be entered.  This premise is simply untenable.  The rule prohibiting retrials following acquittals does not and could not rest on a conclusion that the accused was factually innocent in any meaningful sense.  If that were the basis for the rule, the decisions that have held that even egregiously erroneous acquittals preclude retrials, see, e. g., Fong Foo v. United States, supra (acquittal entered after three of many prosecution witnesses had testified); Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54, were erroneous.  It is manifest that the reasons that bar a retrial following an acquittal are equally applicable to a final judgment entered on a ground “unrelated to factual innocence.” The heavy personal strain of the second trial is the same in either case. So too is the risk that, though innocent, the defendant may be found guilty at a second trial. If the appeal is allowed in either situation, the Government will, following any reversal, not only obtain the benefit of the favorable appellate ruling but also be permitted to shore up any other weak points of its case and obtain all the other advantages at the second trial that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to forbid.  Moreover, the Government’s interest in retrying a defendant simply cannot vary depending on the ground of the final termination in the accused’s favor.  I reject as plainly erroneous the Court’s suggestion that final judgments not based on innocence deprive the public of “its valued right to 'one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws,’ ” ante, at 100, quoting <citedDecision>Arizona</citedDecision> v. Washington, <citedDecision>434 *109U.  S., at 509</citedDecision> , 6 and therefore differ from “true acquittals.” The Government has the same “complete opportunity” in either situation by virtue of its participation as an adversary at the criminal trial. 7 Equally significant, the distinction between the two is at best purely formal.  Many acquittals are the consequence of rulings of law made on the accused’s motion that are not related to the question of his factual guilt or innocence: e. g., a ruling on the law respecting the scope of the offense or excluding reliable evidence.  Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54, illustrates the point.  *110 In Sanabria, the District Court, acting on the defendant's motions, made a series of erroneous legal rulings which began with an erroneous construction of the indictment and culminated in the exclusion of most of the evidence of defendant’s guilt.  The trial court then granted defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the remaining evidence was insufficient.  Sanabria held that the midtrial termination of the prosecution erected an absolute bar to any further proceedings against the defendant, and we reached that result even though the rulings which led to the acquittal were purely legal determinations, unrelated to any question of defendant’s factual guilt, and had been precipitated entirely by the defendant’s “voluntary choice” to seek a narrow construction of his indictment.

 See also Finch v. United States, 433 U. S. 676 (1977) (applying rule of Jenkins to dismissal entered on basis of stipulated facts); United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564 (1977).  Section 3731 provides that the United States may obtain appellate review of a "dismissal” “except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.” The Court cites with approval Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54; United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., supra; Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141 (1962); Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100 (1904); and United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896).  There are a number of reasons a retrial enhances the risk that “even though innocent, [the criminal defendant] may be found guilty.” Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957).  A retrial affords the Government the opportunity to re-examine the weaknesses of its first presentation in order to strengthen the second.  And, as would any litigant, the Government has been known to take advantage of this opportunity.  It is not uncommon to find that prosecution witnesses change their testimony, not always subtly, at second trials.  See Arizona v. Washington, <citedDecision>434 U. S. 497</citedDecision> , 504 n. 14 (1978), quoting Carsey v. United States, 129 U. S. App. D. C. 205, 208-209, 392 F. 2d 810, 813-814 (1967).  By “final judgment favorable to the accused,” I am, of course, referring to an order terminating all prosecution of the defendant on the ground he “simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged.” See Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, 30 (1977).  Similarly unpersuasive is the Court’s suggestion that its holding is supported by the well-recognized rules that a criminal defendant may twice be tried for the same offense if he either successfully moved for a mistrial at the first trial, see Lee, supra; United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600 (1976), or succeeded in having a conviction set aside on a ground other than the insufficiency of the evidence.  See United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896).  What distinguishes these situations, of course, is that neither involved a final judgment entered for the accused, and that in both the Government could not be said to have had a complete opportunity to convict the accused.  The Court’s suggestion that intervening decisions have somehow undermined Jenkins simply will not wash. Although it is quite true that the author of the Court opinion has stated that he understood Jenkins to embrace a rule that any midtrial termination that is labeled a “dismissal” erects a double jeopardy bar, see ante, at 86 n. 2, quoting Lee, 432 U. S., at 36 (Rehnqtjist, J., concurring), no Court opinion has adopted the position that the label attached to a trial court’s ruling could be determinative.  Indeed, since Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S 377, 392 (1975), which was decided the week after Jenkins , explicitly provides that labels are not to have such talismanic significance, the unanimous Court in Jenkins could scarcely have contemplated that it had announced such a mechanical formula.
