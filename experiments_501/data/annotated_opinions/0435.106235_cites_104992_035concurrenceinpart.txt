 26 U. S. C. §§ 6321-6323 , 6331; Bankruptcy Act, § 64 (a), 11 U. S. C. § 104 (a).  Moreover, R. S. §3466 (1876), now codified in 31 U. S. C. § 191 , pertaining to state insolvency proceedings against debtors, commands that “the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.” We long ago established that the term “debts” in this statute' includes delinquent federal taxes.  Price v. United States, 269 U. S. 492, 499-500 .  And even though the tax claim of the Government may be only a general lien, with notice thereof not yet filed in the proper local office pursuant to 26 U. S. C. § 6323 , we have held that it must be accorded priority over the claims of all prior general lienholders, under R. S., § 3466, 31 U. S. C. § 191 .  United States v. City of New Britain, 347 U. S. 81, 84-85 ; United States v. Gilbert Associates, 345 U. S. 361, 366 ; United States v. Texas, 314 U. S. 480, 488 .  See Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, § 12.103, note 67; id., §§ 54.10-54.56.  See cases cited in Rutkin v. United States, <citedDecision>343 U. S. 130, 137, note 8</citedDecision> .  See also United States v. Bruswitz, 219 F. 2d 59 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Steinberg v. United States, 14 F. 2d 564 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Barker v. United States, 88 Ct. Cl. 468 , 26 F. Supp. 1004 ; Silberman v.

Patterson, Essentials of Insurance Law (2d ed. 1957), § 43, at 186.  I cannot agree with The Chief Justice's assertion that Wilcox has been “thoroughly devitalized” by <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> .  See, e. g., the recent case of United States v. Peelle, 159 F. Supp. 45 (D. C. E. D. N. Y., 1958).  There the Government sought to enforce liens for federal income taxes claimed to be due on items of “income” aggregating *258 $678,461.22, which the taxpayer had embezzled from his corporate employer during the years 1945 through 1949.  The items in question consisted of customers’ payments intended for the corporation, and had been embezzled by the taxpayer and kept by him in secret bank accounts.  In 1951 and 1952, he discharged his indebtedness by making full restitution of the embezzled funds to the corporation.  The corporation, which used the accrual method of accounting, paid deficiencies which the Government determined in its 1945-1949 income tax returns, based on its accrued right to receive the embezzled customers’ payments in those years.  Not satisfied with this, the Government took the position that the payments were taxable twice during the same years — once to the corporation when it accrued the right to receive them, and again to the embezzler when he diverted them into the secret bank accounts.
