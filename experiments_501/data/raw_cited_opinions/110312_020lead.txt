<p id="AHF">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="AL1">This case presents the question whether a regulation of the Public Service Commission of the State of New York violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments because it completely bans promotional advertising by an electrical utility.</p>
<p id="b600-10">I</p>
<p id="b600-11">In December 1973, the Commission, appellee here, ordered electric utilities in New York State to cease all advertising that “promot[es] the use of electricity.” App. to Juris. <page-number citation-index="1" label="559">*559</page-number>Statement 31a. The order was based on the Commission’s finding that “the interconnected utility system in New York State does not have sufficient fuel stocks or sources of supply to continue furnishing all customer demands for the 1973-1974 winter.” <em>Id., </em>at 26a.</p>
<p id="b601-4">Three years later, when the fuel shortage had eased, the Commission requested comments from the public on its proposal to continue the ban on promotional advertising. Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric Corp., the appellant in this case, opposed the ban on First Amendment grounds. App. A10. After reviewing the public comments, the Commission extended the prohibition in a Policy Statement issued on February 25, 1977.</p>
<p id="b601-5">The Policy Statement divided advertising expenses “into two broad categories: promotional — advertising intended to stimulate the purchase of utility services — and institutional and informational, a broad category inclusive of all advertising not clearly intended to promote sales.” <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> App. to Juris. Statement 35a. The Commission declared all promotional advertising contrary to the national policy of conserving energy. It acknowledged that the ban is not a perfect vehicle for conserving energy. For example, the Commission’s order prohibits promotional advertising to develop consumption during periods when demand for electricity is low. By limiting growth in “off-peak” consumption, the ban limits the “beneficial side effects” of such growth in terms of more efficient use of existing powerplants. <em>Id., </em>at 37a. And since oil dealers are not under the Commission’s jurisdiction and <page-number citation-index="1" label="560">*560</page-number>thus remain free to advertise, it was recognized that the ban can achieve only “piecemeal conservationism” Still, the Commission adopted the restriction because it was deemed likely to “result in some dampening of unnecessary growth” in energy consumption. <em>Ibid.</em></p>
<p id="b602-5">The Commission’s order explicitly permitted “informational” advertising designed to encourage <em>“shifts </em>of consumption” from peak demand times to periods of low electricity demand. <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis in orginal). Informational advertising would not seek to increase aggregate consumption, but would invite a leveling of demand throughout any given 24-hour period. The agency offered to review “specific proposals by the companies for specifically described [advertising] programs that meet these criteria.” <em>Id., </em>at 38a.</p>
<p id="b602-6">When it rejected requests for rehearing on the Policy Statement, the Commission supplemented its rationale for the advertising ban. The agency observed that additional electricity probably would be more expensive to produce than existing output. Because electricity rates in New York were not then based on marginal cost,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commission feared that additional power would be priced below the actual cost of generation. The additional electricity would be subsidized by all consumers through generally higher rates. <em>Id., </em>at 57a-58a. The state agency also thought that promotional advertising would give “misleading signals” to the public by appearing to encourage energy consumption at a time when conservation is needed. <em>Id., </em>at 59a.</p>
<p id="b602-7">Appellant challenged the order in state court, arguing that the Commission had restrained commercial speech in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commis<page-number citation-index="1" label="561">*561</page-number>sion’s order was upheld by the trial court and at the intermediate appellate level.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The New York Court of Appeals affirmed. It found little value to advertising in “the noncompetitive market in which electric corporations operate.” <em>Consolidated Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Comm’n, </em>47 N. Y. 2d 94, 110, 390 N. E. 2d 749, 757 (1979). Since consumers “have no choice regarding the source of their electric power,” the court denied that “promotional advertising of electricity might contribute to society’s interest in ‘informed and reliable’ economic decisionmaking.” <em>Ibid. </em>The court also observed that by encouraging consumption, promotional advertising would only exacerbate the current energy situation. <em>Id., </em>at 110, 390 N. E. 2d, at 758. The court concluded that the governmental interest in the prohibition outweighed the limited constitutional value of the commercial speech at issue. We noted probable jurisdiction, 444 U. S. 962 (1979), and now reverse.</p>
<p id="b603-4">The Commission’s order restricts only commercial speech, that is, expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience. <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, </em>425 U. S. 748, 762 (1976); <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U. S. 350, 363-364 (1977); <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>440 U. S. 1, 11 (1979). The First Amendment, as applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, protects commercial speech from unwarranted governmental regulation. <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board, </em>425 U. S., at 761-762. Commercial expression not only serves the economic interest of the speaker, but also assists consumers and furthers the societal interest in the fullest possible <page-number citation-index="1" label="562">*562</page-number>dissemination of information. In applying the First Amendment to this area, we have rejected the “highly paternalistic” view that government has complete power to suppress or regulate commercial speech. “[P]eople will perceive their own best interests if only they are well enough informed, and . . . the best means to that end is to open the channels of communication, rather than to close them. . . .” <em>Id., </em>at 770; see <em>Linmark Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Willingboro, </em>431 U. S. 85, 92 (1977). Even when advertising communicates only an incomplete version of the relevant facts, the First Amendment presumes that some accurate information is better than no information at all. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, supra, </em>at 374.</p>
<p id="b604-5">Nevertheless, our decisions have recognized "the ‘commonsense’ distinction between speech proposing a commercial transaction, which occurs in an area traditionally subject to government regulation, and other varieties of speech.” <em>Ohralik </em>v. <em>Ohio State Bar Assn., </em>436 U. S. 447, 455-456 (1978); see <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, supra, </em>at 381; see also Jackson &amp; Jeffries, Commercial Speech: Economic Due Process and the First Amendment, 65 Ya. L. Rev. 1, 38-39 (1979).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index="1" label="563">*563</page-number>Constitution therefore accords a lesser protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally guaranteed expression. 436 U. S., at 456, 457. The protection available for particular commercial expression turns on the nature both of the expression and of the governmental interests served by its regulation.</p>
<p id="b605-4">The First Amendment’s concern for commercial speech is based on the informational function of advertising. See <em>First National Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U. S. 765, 783 (1978). Consequently, there can be no constitutional objection to the suppression of commercial messages that do not accurately inform the public about lawful activity. The government may ban forms of communication more likely to deceive the public than to inform it, <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Rogers, supra, </em>at 13, 15-16; <em>Ohralik </em>v. <em>Ohio State Bar Assn., supra, </em>at 46A-465, or <page-number citation-index="1" label="564">*564</page-number>commercial speech related to illegal activity, <em>Pittsburgh Press Co. </em>v. <em>Human Relations Comm’n, </em>413 U. S. 376, 388 (1973).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b606-5">If the communication is neither misleading nor related to unlawful activity, the government’s power is more circumscribed. The State must assert a substantial interest to be achieved by restrictions on commercial speech. Moreover, the regulatory technique must be in proportion to that interest. The limitation on expression must be designed carefully to achieve the State’s goal. Compliance with this requirement may be measured by two criteria. First, the restriction must directly advance the state interest involved; the regulation may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government’s purpose. Second, if the governmental interest could be served as well by a more limited restriction on commercial speech, the excessive restrictions cannot survive.</p>
<p id="b606-6">Under the first criterion, the Court has declined to uphold regulations that only indirectly advance the state interest involved. In both <em>Bates </em>and <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board, </em>the Court concluded that an advertising ban could not be imposed to protect the ethical or performance standards of a profession. The Court noted in <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board </em>that “[t]he advertising ban does not directly affect professional standards one way or the other.” 425 U. S., at 769. In <em>Bates, </em>the Court overturned an advertising prohibition that was designed to protect the “quality” of a lawyer’s work. <page-number citation-index="1" label="565">*565</page-number>“Restraints on advertising . . . are an ineffective way of deterring shoddy work.” 433 U. S., at 378.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b607-4">The second criterion recognizes that the First Amendment mandates that speech restrictions be “narrowly drawn.” <em>In re Primus, </em>436 U. S. 412, 438 (1978).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The regulatory technique may extend only as far as the interest it serves. The State cannot regulate speech that poses no danger to the asserted state interest, see <em>First National Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Bellotti, supra, </em>at 794-795, nor can it completely suppress information when narrower restrictions on expression would serve its interest as well. For example, in <em>Bates </em>the Court explicitly did not “foreclose the possibility that some limited supplementation, by way of warning or disclaimer or the like, might be required” in promotional materials. 433 U. S., at 384. See <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board, supra, </em>at 773. And in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Population Services International, </em>431 U. S. 678, 701-702 (1977), we held that the State’s “arguments ... do not justify the total suppression of advertising concerning contraceptives.” This holding left open the possibility that <page-number citation-index="1" label="566">*566</page-number>the State could implement more carefully drawn restrictions. See <em>id., </em>at 712 (Powell, J., concurring in part and in judgment) ; <em>id., </em>at 716-717 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and in judgment).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b608-5">In commercial speech cases, then, a four-part analysis has developed. At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment. For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading. Next, we ask whether the asserted governmental interest is substantial. If both inquiries yield positive answers, we must determine whether the regulation directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.</p>
<p id="b608-6">Ill</p>
<p id="b608-7">We now apply this four-step analysis for commercial speech to the Commission’s arguments in support of its ban on promotional advertising.</p>
<p id="b608-8">A</p>
<p id="b608-9">The Commission does not claim that the expression at issue either is inaccurate or relates to unlawful activity. Yet the New York Court of Appeals questioned whether Central Hudson’s advertising is protected commercial speech. Because appellant holds a monopoly over the sale of electricity in its service area, the state court suggested that the Commission’s order restricts no commercial speech of any worth. The court stated that advertising in a "noncompetitive market” <page-number citation-index="1" label="567">*567</page-number>could not improve the decisionmaking of consumers. 47 N. Y. 2d, at 110, 390 N. E. 2d, at 757. The court saw no constitutional problem with barring commercial speech that it viewed as conveying little useful information.</p>
<p id="b609-4">This reasoning falls short of establishing that appellant’s advertising is not commercial speech protected by the First Amendment. Monopoly over the supply of a product provides no protection from competition with substitutes for that product. Electric utilities compete with suppliers of fuel oil and natural gas in several markets, such as those for home heating and industrial power. This Court noted the existence of interfuel competition 45 years ago, see <em>West Ohio Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Comm’n, </em>294 U. S. 63, 72 (1935). Each energy source continues to offer peculiar advantages and disadvantages that may influence consumer choice. For consumers in those competitive markets, advertising by utilities is just as valuable as advertising by unregulated firms.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b609-5">Even in monopoly markets, the suppression of advertising reduces the information available for consumer decisions and thereby defeats the purpose of the First Amendment. The New York court’s argument appears to assume that the providers of a monopoly service or product are willing to pay for wholly ineffective advertising. Most businesses— even regulated monopolies — are unlikely to underwrite promotional advertising that is of no interest or use to consumers. Indeed, a monopoly enterprise legitimately may wish to inform the public that it has developed new services or terms of doing business. A consumer may need information to aid his decision whether or not to use the monopoly service at all, or how much of the service he should purchase. In the absence of factors that would distort the decision to advertise, we <page-number citation-index="1" label="568">*568</page-number>may assume that the willingness of a business to promote its products reflects a belief that consumers are interested in the advertising.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since no such extraordinary conditions have been identified in this case, appellant’s monopoly position does not alter the First Amendment’s protection for its commercial speech.</p>
<p id="b610-5">B</p>
<p id="b610-6">The Commission offers two state interests as justifications for the ban on promotional advertising. The first concerns energy conservation. Any increase in demand for electricity— during peak or off-peak periods — means greater consumption of energy. The Commission argues, and the New York, court agreed, that the State’s interest in conserving energy is sufficient to support suppression of advertising designed to increase consumption of electricity. In view of our country’s dependence on energy resources beyond our control, no one can doubt the importance of energy conservation. Plainly, therefore, the state interest asserted is substantial.</p>
<p id="b610-7">The Commission also argues that promotional advertising will aggravate inequities caused by the failure to base the utilities’ rates on marginal cost. The utilities argued to the Commission that if they could promote the use of electricity in periods of low demand, they would improve their utilization of generating capacity. The Commission responded that promotion of off-peak consumption also would increase consumption during peak periods. If peak demand were to rise, the absence of marginal cost rates would mean that the rates charged for the additional power would not reflect the true costs of expanding production. Instead, the extra costs would <page-number citation-index="1" label="569">*569</page-number>be borne by all consumers through higher overall rates. Withqut promotional advertising, the Commission stated, this inequitable turn of events would be less likely to occur. The choice among rate structures involves difficult and important questions of economic supply and distributional fairness.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The State’s concern that rates be fair and efficient represents a clear and substantial governmental interest.</p>
<p id="b611-4">C</p>
<p id="b611-5">Next, we focus on the relationship between the State’s interests and the advertising ban. Under this criterion, the Commission’s laudable concern over the equity and efficiency of appellant’s rates does not provide a constitutionally adequate reason for restricting protected speech. The link between the advertising prohibition and appellant’s rate structure is, at most, tenuous. The impact of promotional advertising on the equity of appellant’s rates is highly speculative. Advertising to increase off-peak usage would have to increase peak usage, while other factors that directly affect the fairness and efficiency of appellant’s rates remained constant. Such conditional and remote eventualities simply cannot justify silencing appellant’s promotional advertising.</p>
<p id="b611-6">In contrast, the State’s interest in energy conservation is directly advanced by the Commission order at issue here. There is an immediate connection between advertising and demand for electricity. Central Hudson would not contest the advertising ban unless it believed that promotion would increase its sales. Thus, we find a direct link between the state interest in conservation and the Commission’s order.</p>
<p id="b611-7">D</p>
<p id="b611-8">We come finally to the critical inquiry in this case: whether the Commission’s complete suppression of speech ordinarily protected by the First Amendment is no more extensive than <page-number citation-index="1" label="570">*570</page-number>necessary to further the State’s interest in energy conservation. The Commission’s order reaches all promotional advertising, regardless of the impact of the touted service on overall energy use. But the energy conservation rationale, as important as it is, cannot justify suppressing information about electric devices or services that would cause no net increase in total energy use. In addition, no showing has been made that a more limited restriction on the content of promotional advertising would not serve adequately the State’s interests.</p>
<p id="b612-5">Appellant insists that but for the ban, it would advertise products and services that use energy efficiently. These include the “heat pump,” which both parties acknowledge to be a major improvement in electric heating, and the use of electric heat as a “backup” to solar and other heat sources. Although the Commission has questioned the efficiency of electric heating before this Court, neither the Commission’s Policy Statement nor its order denying rehearing made findings on this issue. In the absence of authoritative findings to the contrary, we must credit as within the realm of possibility the claim that electric heat can be an efficient alternative in some circumstances.</p>
<p id="b612-6">The Commission’s order prevents appellant from promoting electric services that would reduce energy use by diverting demand from less efficient sources, or that would consume roughly the same amount of energy as do alternative sources. In neither situation would the utility’s advertising endanger conservation or mislead the public. To. the extent that the Commission’s order suppresses speech that in no way impairs the State’s interest in energy conservation, the Commission’s order violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments and must be invalidated. See <em>First National Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em>435 U. S. 765 (1978).</p>
<p id="b612-7">The Commission also has not demonstrated that its interest in conservation cannot be protected adequately by more limited regulation of appellant’s commercial expression. To fur<page-number citation-index="1" label="571">*571</page-number>ther its policy of conservation, the Commission could attempt to restrict the format and content of Central Hudson’s advertising. It might, for example, require that the advertisements include information about the relative efficiency and expense of the offered service, both under current conditions and for the foreseeable future. Cf. <em>Banzhaf </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>132 U. S. App. D. C. 14, 405 F. 2d 1082 (1968), cert. denied <em>sub nom. Tobacco Institute, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em>396 U. S. 842 (1969).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the absence of a showing that more limited speech regulation would be ineffective, we cannot approve the complete suppression of Central Hudson’s advertising.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b613-4">IV</p>
<p id="b613-5">Our decision today in no way disparages the national interest in energy conservation. We accept without reservation the argument that conservation, as well as the development of alternative energy sources, is an imperative national goal. Administrative bodies empowered to regulate electric utilities have the authority — and indeed the duty — -to take appropriate action to further this goal. When, however, such action in<page-number citation-index="1" label="572">*572</page-number>volves the suppression of speech, the First and Fourteenth Amendments require that the restriction be no more extensive than is necessary to serve the state interest. In this case, the record before us fails to show that the total ban on promotional advertising meets this requirement.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b614-5">Accordingly, the judgment of the New York Court of Appeals is</p>
<p id="b614-6">
<em>Reversed.</em>
</p>
<footnote label="1">
<p id="b601-6"> The dissenting opinion attempts to construe the Policy Statement to authorize advertising that would result “in a net energy savings” even if the advertising encouraged consumption of additional electricity. <em>Post, </em>at 604-605. The attempted construction fails, however, since the Policy Statement is phrased only in terms of advertising that promotes “the purchase of utility services” and “sales” of electricity. Plainly, the Commission did not intend to permit advertising that would enhance net energy efficiency by increasing consumption of electrical services.</p>

</footnote>
<footnote label="5">
<p id="b604-6"> In an opinion concurring in the judgment, Mr. Justice SteveNS suggests that the Commission's order reaches beyond commercial speech to suppress expression that is entitled to the full protection of the First Amendment. See <em>post, </em>at 580-581. We find no support for this claim in the record of this case. The Commission’s Policy Statement excluded “institutional and informational” messages from the advertising ban, which was restricted to all advertising “clearly intended to promote sales.” App. to Juris. Statement 35a. The complaint alleged only that the “prohibition of promotional advertising by Petitioner is not reasonable regulation of Petitioner’s commercial speech. . . .” <em>Id., </em>at 70a. Moreover, the state-court opinions and the arguments of the parties before this Court also viewed this litigation as involving only commercial speech. Nevertheless, the concurring opinion of Me. Justice SteveNS views the Commission’s order as suppressing more than commercial speech because it would outlaw, for example, advertising that promoted electricity consumption by touting the environmental benefits of such uses. See <em>post, </em>at 581. Ap<page-number citation-index="1" label="563">*563</page-number>parently the opinion would accord full First Amendment protection to all promotional advertising that includes claims “relating to . . . questions frequently discussed and debated by our political leaders.” <em>Ibid.</em></p>
<blockquote id="b605-6">Although this approach responds to the serious issues surrounding our national energy policy as raised in this case, we think it would blur further the line the Court has sought to draw in commercial speech cases. It would grant broad constitutional protection to any advertising that links a product to a current public debate. But many, if not most, products may be tied to public concerns with the environment, energy, economic policy, or individual health and safety. We rule today in <em>Consolidated Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Comm’n, ante, </em>p. 530, that utilities enjoy the full panoply of First Amendment protections for their direct comments on public issues. There is no reason for providing similar constitutional protection when such statements are made only in the context of commercial transactions. In that context, for example, the State retains the power to “insur[e] that the stream of commercial information flow[s] cleanly as well as freely.” <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, </em>425 U. S. 748, 772 (1975). This Court’s decisions on commercial expression have rested on the premise that such speech, although meriting some protection, is of less constitutional moment than other forms of speech. As we stated in <em>Ohralik, </em>the failure to distinguish between commercial and noncommercial speech “could invite dilution, simply by a leveling process, of the force of the [First] Amendment’s guarantee with respect to the latter kind of speech.” 436 U. S., at 456.</blockquote>

<footnote label="6">
<p id="b606-7"> In most other contexts, the First Amendment prohibits regulation based on the content of the message. <em>Consolidated Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Public Service Comm’n, ante, </em>at 537-540. Two features of commercial speech permit regulation of its content. First, commercial speakers have extensive knowledge of both the market and their products. Thus, they are well situated to evaluate the accuracy of their messages and the lawfulness of the underlying activity. <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U. S. 350, 381 (1977). In addition, commercial speech, the offspring of economic self-interest, is a hardy breed of expression that is not “particularly susceptible to being crushed by overbroad regulation.” <em>Ibid.</em></p>

<footnote label="7">
<p id="b607-5"> In <em>Linmark Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Willingboro, </em>431 U. S. 85, 95-96 (1977), we observed that there was no definite connection between the township’s goal of integrated housing and its ban on the use of “For Sale” signs in front of houses.</p>
</footnote>
<footnote label="8">
<p id="b607-6"> This analysis is not an application of the “overbreadth” doctrine. The latter theory permits the invalidation of regulations on First Amendment grounds even when the litigant challenging the regulation has engaged in no constitutionally protected activity. <em>E. g., Kunz </em>v. <em>New York, </em>340 U. S. 290 (1951). The overbreadth doctrine derives from the recognition that unconstitutional restriction of expression may deter protected speech by parties not before the court and thereby escape judicial review. <em>Broadrick </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>413 U. S. 601, 612-613 (1973); see Note, The First Amendment Overbreadth Doctrine, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 844, 853-858 (1970). This restraint is less likely where the expression is linked to “commercial well-being” and therefore is not easily deterred by “over-broad regulation.” <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, supra, </em>at 381.</p>
<p id="b607-7">In this case, the Commission’s prohibition acts directly against the promotional activities of Central Hudson, and to the extent the limitations are unnecessary to serve the State’s interest, they are invalid.</p>
</footnote>
<footnote label="9">
<p id="b608-10"> We review with special care regulations that entirely suppress commercial speech in order to pursue a nonspeech-related policy. In those circumstances, a ban on speech could screen from public view the underlying governmental policy. See <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board, </em>425 U. S., at 780, n. 8 (Stewart, J., concurring). Indeed, in recent years this Court has not approved a blanket ban on commercial speech unless the expression itself was flawed in some way, either because it was deceptive or related to unlawful activity.</p>

<footnote label="10">
<p id="b609-6"> Several commercial speech decisions have involved enterprises subject to extensive state regulation. <em>E. g., Friedman </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>440 U. S. 1, 4-5 (1979) (optometrists); <em>Bates </em>v. <em>State Bar of Arizona, </em>433 U. S. 350 (1977) (lawyers); <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, supra, </em>at 750-752 (pharmacists).</p>

<footnote label="11">
<p id="b610-8"> There may be a greater incentive for a utility to advertise if it can use promotional expenses in determining its rate of return, rather than pass those costs on solely to shareholders. That practice, however, hardly distorts the economic decision whether to advertise. Unregulated businesses pass on promotional costs to consumers, and this Court expressly approved the practice for utilities in <em>West Ohio Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Comrn’n, </em>294 U. S. 63, 72 (1935).</p>

<p id="b613-6"> The Commission also might consider a system of previewing advertising campaigns to insure that they will not defeat conservation policy. It has instituted such a program for approving “informational” advertising under the Policy Statement challenged in this case. See <em>supra, </em>at 560. We have observed that commercial speech is such a sturdy brand of expression that traditional prior restraint doctrine may not apply to it. <em>Virginia Pharmacy Board </em>v. <em>Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, </em>425 U. S., at 771-772, n. 24. And in other areas of speech regulation, such as obscenity, we have recognized that a prescreening arrangement can pass constitutional muster if it includes adequate procedural safeguards. <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>380 U. S. 51 (1965).</p>

<p id="b613-7"> In view of our conclusion that the Commission’s advertising policy violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments, we do not reach appellant’s claims that the agency’s order also violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and that it is both overbroad and vague.</p>

<p id="b614-10"> The Commission order at issue here was not promulgated in response to an emergency situation. Although the advertising ban initially was prompted by critical fuel shortage in 1973, the Commission makes no claim that an emergency now exists. We do not consider the powers that the State might have over utility advertising in emergency circumstances. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Oklahoma Oas &amp; Electric Co., </em>536 P. 2d 887, 895-896 (Okla. 1975).</p>
