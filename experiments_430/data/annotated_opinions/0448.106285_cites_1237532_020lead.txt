**Lead Opinion**
 The Court in Wolf first stated that “[t]he contrariety of views of the States” on the adoption of the exclusionary rule of Weeks was “particularly impressive” (at p. 29) ; and, in this connection, that it could not “brush aside the experience of States which deem the incidence of such conduct by the police too slight to call for a deterrent remedy ... by overriding the [States’] relevant rules of evidence.” At pp. 31-32.  While in 1949, prior to the Wolf case, almost two-thirds of the States were opposed to the use of the exclusionary rule, now, despite the Wolf case, more than half of those since passing upon it, by their own legislative or judicial decision, have wholly or partly adopted or adhered to the Weeks rule.  See Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 , Appendix, pp. 224-232 (1960).  Significantly, among those now following the rule is California, which, according to its highest court, was “compelled to reach tha(t conclusion because other remedies have completely failed to secure compliance with the constitutional provisions .  .  .  .” People v. Cohan, <citedDecision>44 Cal. 2d 434, 445</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>282 P. 2d 905, 911</citedDecision> (1955).  In connection with this California case, we note that the second basis elaborated in Wolf in support of its failure to enforce the exclusionary doctrine against the States was that “other means of protection” have been afforded “the *652 right to privacy.” 7 338 U. S., at 30 .  The experience of California that such other remedies have been worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other States.  The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been *653 recognized by this Court since Wolf .  See Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 137 (1954).  Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the “weighty testimony” of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13 , 150 N. E. 585 (1926).  There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the Weeks exclusionary rule in New York, had said that “[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax.” 242 N. Y., at 22 , 150 N. E., at 588 .
