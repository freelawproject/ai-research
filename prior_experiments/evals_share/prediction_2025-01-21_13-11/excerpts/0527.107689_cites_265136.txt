Case of interest: Nathan Thomas v. W. K. Cunningham, Jr., Superintendent of the Virginia State Penitentiary (1964)
-----------------------
of what the judge thought was the unsettled state of New York law, that petitioner reapply to the state courts. See 28 U.S. C. ยง 2254. Petitioner did so, and apparently at the same time appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The state courts denied relief a second time. The United States Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and ordered a hearing on the merits. 334 F.2d 331 (1964). This Court denied the State's petition for a writ of certiorari. 381 U.S. 951 (1965). The hearing ordered by the Court of Appeals was held by the District Court on November 5, 1965. The petition was dismissed on the merits on May 2, 1966. Petitioner's appeal to the Second Circuit was dismissed on February 3, 1967, and a petition for rehearing was denied on February 21, 1967. A petition for a writ of certiorari was filed here on March 20, 1967, and granted on October 16, 1967, 389 U.S. 896, about seven years after petitioner's conviction.
