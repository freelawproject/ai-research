<p id="AEU">with whom Justice Brennan joins, dissenting.</p>
<p id="b699-8">The jurisdiction of this Court depends upon the existence of a live controversy. We may resolve a particular dispute only if the parties have a real interest in the outcome of that dispute. Otherwise, the case is moot, and must be dismissed. <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>410 U. S. 113, 125 (1973); <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Medical Committee for Human Rights, </em>404 U. S. 403, 407 (1972). In my view, this case should have been dismissed. The parties to this appeal have no adversary interest in the outcome of this case. Their positions would be the same whether the Court approved the Illinois Business Take-Over Act or struck it down. Because the Court finds that the Illinois Act is unconstitutional, there will be no further litigation. However, even if the Court had held that the Illinois Act is constitutional, and had lifted the permanent injunction that now restrains enforcement of the Act against MITE, there would be no basis for continued litigation. The Secretary stated that if the decision below were reversed, he would initiate enforcement proceedings against MITE in <page-number citation-index="1" label="656">*656</page-number>state court, seeking civil and criminal penalties for its failure to comply with the Illinois Act. But a preliminary injunction was in effect at the time the alleged violations, occurred. As I explain below, I believe that this injunction would have barred the Secretary from seeking either civil or criminal penalties for violations of the Act that occurred during that period. MITE would have a complete defense to such an action.</p>
<p id="b700-5">I</p>
<p id="b700-6">The Secretary argues that the case is not moot because the preliminary injunction would not be a complete defense to a state enforcement action. He contends that the preliminary injunction merely barred him from commencing an enforcement action during the period the injunction was in effect. Thus, if this Court had decided that the statute is constitutional and had lifted the permanent injunction, the State would have been able to commence an action seeking penalties for any violations that occurred during the period the preliminary injunction was in effect. In other words, argues the Secretary, the preliminary injunction only provided temporary security. It enabled MITE to go forward with the tender offer — subject to the risk that at some later stage, the constitutionality of the statute would be upheld, and the State would commence enforcement proceedings.</p>
<p id="b700-7">Federal courts undoubtedly have the power to issue a preliminary injunction that restrains enforcement of a state statute, subject to the condition that if the statute is later found to be valid, the State is free to seek penalties for violations that occurred during the period the injunction was in effect. In my view, however, federal courts also have the power to issue a preliminary injunction that offers permanent protection from penalties for violations of the statute that occurred during the period the injunction was in effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Determining <page-number citation-index="1" label="657">*657</page-number>whether a particular injunction provides temporary or permanent protection becomes a question of interpretation.</p>
<p id="b701-5">I believe that in the ordinary case, unless the order contains specific language to the contrary, it should be presumed that an injunction secures permanent protection from penalties for violations that occurred during the period it was in effect; the burden should be on the State to show that the injunction provided only temporary security.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A presumption <page-number citation-index="1" label="658">*658</page-number>in favor of permanent protection is likely to reflect the intentions of the court that granted the motion. In acting upon a request for an injunction, it will recognize that short-term protection is often only marginally better than no protection at all. Parties seek to restrain the enforcement of a state statute, not just because they want short-term protection, but because they desire permanent immunity for actions they take in reliance on the injunction. If they are contemplating action that might violate a state statute, they will take little solace from temporary immunity — when they know that if they decide to act, enforcement proceedings might be initiated at some later stage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b703-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="659">*659</page-number>Here, the preliminary injunction does not expressly state that it provides permanent immunity from penalties for violations of the Illinois Act that may occur during its effective period. The injunction provides only that the Secretary of State is enjoined from “issuing any cease and desist order or notice of hearing or from otherwise invoking, applying, or enforcing the Illinois Business Take-Over Act” against MITE. Record 16. However, I see no reason why the presumption in favor of permanent protection should not be applied here. In this context, as the District Court must have recognized, permanent protection was needed. MITE sought an injunction, not just because it desired protection from enforcement actions during the period it was actually making the tender offer, but also because it desired protection from such actions in the future. The Act provides for substantial civil and criminal penalties. MITE would have been reluctant to go forward with its offer, which entailed considerable expense, if there were some risk that it would be penalized later. Indeed, in the Schedule 14D-1 filed with the SEC, MITE expressly stated that it would not commence the tender offer unless it obtained injunctive relief. It also reserved the right to withdraw its offer if injunctive relief were initially granted, but later withdrawn. See Record, Plaintiff’s Exhibit 14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b704-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="660">*660</page-number>Interpreting the injunction to provide permanent protection also ensures that MITE could never be penalized for acting in reliance on the injunction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> MITE went forward with the tender offer, reasonably believing that the District Court’s order provided complete immunity. Under the circumstances, it would be improper to permit the State to penalize action taken while the injunction was in effect. In the past, this Court has recognized that reasonable reliance on judicial pronouncements may constitute a valid defense to criminal prosecution. See, <em>e. g., Marks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>430 U. S. 188 (1977).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b704-5">In addition to arguing that the preliminary injunction should be interpreted to provide only temporary protection from a state enforcement action, the Secretary argues that resolution of the mootness issue in this case should be controlled by <em>Leroy </em>v. <em>Great Western United Corp., </em>443 U. S. 173 (1979). In that case, Great Western announced its intention to make a tender offer to purchase stock in another corporation. Idaho officials responsible for administering an Idaho statute governing corporate takeovers, see Idaho Code §30-1501 <em>et seq. </em>(1980), objected to the offer and delayed its effective date. Great Western brought an action in <page-number citation-index="1" label="661">*661</page-number>Federal District Court, seeking a declaration that the Idaho takeover law was unconstitutional, and an injunction restraining Idaho officials from enforcing the statute. The District Court granted injunctive relief that enabled Great Western to complete the acquisition. This Court, in reviewing the case, held that the controversy was not moot. “[T]he question whether Great Western has violated Idaho’s statute will remain open unless and until the District Court’s judgment is finally affirmed.” <em>Id., </em>at 178.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b705-5"><em>Leroy </em>v. <em>Great Western United Corp. </em>is easily distinguishable from this case. Unlike MITE, Great Western took actions that might have violated the state takeover statute before it obtained injunctive relief. If this Court had decided that the Idaho statute was valid, Idaho officials might have been able, to seek penalties for those preinjunction violations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Leroy </em>v. <em>Great Western United Corp. </em>can also be distinguished on the ground that the takeover offer in that case was successful. If the Idaho statute had been found to be valid, then Idaho officials would have been able to seek a rescission of the takeover.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, since the acquisition was never completed, Illinois officials could not seek rescission.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b706-6"><page-number citation-index="1" label="662">*662</page-number>Finally, this case does not fall within the exception to the mootness doctrine for cases that “are capable of repetition, yet evading review.” Unless a class action is involved, that exception applies only when the challenged action is too short to be fully litigated before its cessation, and when there is a reasonable expectation or a demonstrated probability that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action in the future. <em>Illinois State Board of Elections </em>v. <em>Socialist Workers Party, </em>440 U. S. 173, 187 (1979); <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>423 U. S. 147, 149 (1975). The second requirement has not been satisfied here. MITE has agreed not to renew its efforts to acquire Chicago Rivet. Thus, unless MITE breaches its agreement,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the State will never again have occasion to prevent MITE from making a takeover offer for Chicago Rivet. In addition, there has been no showing that MITE plans to acquire another corporation with substantial connection to Illinois. Thus, there is no demonstrated probability that the State will have occasion to prevent MITE from making a takeover offer for some other corporation.</p>
<p id="b706-7">HH H-t</p>
<p id="b706-3">The majority disposes of the mootness issue in a short paragraph. It concedes that the only possible basis for continued litigation in this case would be a state action for penalties. It further concedes that the preliminary injunction issued by the District Court may be a complete defense to an action for civil or criminal penalties. It argues, however, that the effect to be given the preliminary injunction should not be reached in this case. Rather, that question should be decided in a state enforcement action, if it is raised as a defense. Thus, contends the majority, the case is not moot.</p>
<p id="b707-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="663">*663</page-number>I am completely unpersuaded by the majority’s facile analysis. In deciding whether a case is moot, the Court must determine whether there is a live controversy. There is a live controversy in this case only if the State could seek penalties from MITE. Here, the State could not seek penalties from MITE. It may be true that the State could file a complaint if this Court were to lift the permanent injunction. However, this fact is not enough to keep the case alive where, as a matter of federal law, the complaint <em>must </em>be dismissed. If the action that the State plans to commence in state court lacks any merit — if MITE has an automatic defense to that action — then there simply is no controversy.</p>
<p id="b707-5">. This case is made more difficult because the Court has never before decided what effect should be given to preliminary injunctions. But the fact that we must decide a novel question does not make the casé any less moot. Certainly, if the Court had already held that a preliminary injunction provides permanent immunity, the case would be moot even though the State could go into state court and seek penalties. Such a suit, which would be clearly frivolous, could not keep the dispute alive.</p>
<p id="b707-6">The Court’s refusal to confront the question whether a preliminary injunction would provide a complete defense is particularly ironic, given its recent decision in <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>455 U. S. 624 (1982). Respondents in that case had pleaded guilty in unrelated Illinois state-court prosecutions for burglary, an offense punishable by imprisonment and a mandatory 3-year parole term. Neither respondent was informed during his plea acceptance hearing that the negotiated sentence included the mandatory parole term. Each respondent completed his prison sentence but was reincarcerated for parole violation. While in custody, they filed petitions for federal habeas corpus, alleging that their guilty pleas were invalid because they were not informed of the mandatory parole requirement. The District Court decided to enter an order declaring the parole term void, and the United States <page-number citation-index="1" label="664">*664</page-number>Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed. By the time the eases reached this Court, both respondents had completed their sentences, and their parole terms had expired. This Court held that the claims for relief were moot. In reaching this conclusion, the Court determined that as a matter of Illinois law, no collateral consequences would flow from the parole revocations. Thus, there would be no point in declaring the parole terms void. In other words, the Court reached out to decide a question of state law in order to hold that the case was moot. Here, by contrast, the Court refuses to confront an important question of <em>federal </em>law— deciding instead that the question should be left to a state court — so that it can avoid holding that the case is moot.</p>

<p id="b708-3">The parties to this appeal have no adversary interest m the resolution of the merits of this controversy. The majority acts without jurisdiction when it addresses the question whether the Illinois Business Take-Over Act is constitutional. Because I believe the case is moot, I would have vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, with instructions that it remand the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss.</p>
<author id="b708-4">Justice Rehnquist,</author>
<p id="Ag">dissenting.</p>
<p id="b708-5">I agree with Justice Marshall that this case does not present a justiciable controversy, but for a different reason.</p>
<p id="b708-6">MITE obtained an injunction in order to effect a cash tender offer for the stock of Chicago Rivet. The injunction restrained the Illinois Secretary of State from interfering with the Chicago Rivet tender offer by enforcing the Illinois Business Take-Over Act against MITE. Three days after the District Court issued a permanent injunction, MITE and Chicago Rivet reached an agreement and MITE withdrew its extant offer. Approximately one month later, MITE announced its decision not to make any tender offer. MITE is <page-number citation-index="1" label="665">*665</page-number>not presently engaging in activity that is regulated by the Illinois statute, and there is no indication that MITE intends to engage in any such activity in the future. Therefore, the facts that gave rise to <em>this controversy </em>over the constitutionality of Illinois’ anti-takeover statutes no longer exist, and it is unlikely that they will be repeated in the future. As the tender offer has met its demise for reasons having nothing to do with the validity of the Illinois statute, the injunction is no longer necessary to accomplish the purposes for which it was obtained. MITE no longer needs an injunction in order to effect a tender offer for the shares of Chicago Rivet or any other corporation subject to the Illinois Act. Nor does MITE need the injunction in order to preclude the Secretary from rescinding a completed tender offer.</p>
<p id="b709-5">Despite these developments which have occurred after the District Court issued the injunction, the Court concludes that the present controversy between the Illinois Secretary of State and MITE over the constitutionality of the Illinois Business Take-Over Act is not moot. According to the Court, the Illinois Secretary of State’s intention to bring an enforcement action against MITE keeps the present controversy alive. The possibility of a future enforcement action, however, is insufficient for me to conclude that the controversy that is before the Court is not moot.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b709-6">This Court has no power over a suit not pending before it. ‘“Our power only extends over and is limited by the conditions of the case now before us.’” <em>Oil Workers </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>361 U. S. 363, 370 (1960), quoting <em>American Book Co. </em>v. <em>Kansas ex rel. Nichols, </em>193 U. S. 49, 52 (1904). A case pending in this Court may not be kept alive simply because similar or identical issues are currently ripe for decision in a controversy between the same parties in another court. See <em>Oil </em><page-number citation-index="1" label="666">*666</page-number><em>Workers </em>v. <em>Missouri, supra, </em>at 370-371; <em>American Book Co. </em>v. <em>Kansas ex rel. Nichols, supra, </em>at 51. <em>A fortiori, </em>this case may not be kept alive simply because there may exist a presently unripened controversy between these same parties over the constitutionality of the same Act. This is so even if our resolution of the merits of the instant case .will resolve certain defenses that MITE could raise in an enforcement action were one to be brought by the Secretary. It follows that this case is not alive simply because a decision on the merits in this case will determine whether or not the Secretary’s threatened enforcement action may ever ripen into a live controversy.</p>
<p id="b710-5">If an enforcement action were brought by the Secretary, “there is no way to know what the outcome of such a proceeding in the [Illinois] courts might be.” <em>Oil Workers </em>v. <em>Missouri, supra, </em>at 371. The Illinois courts may well conclude that the injunction constitutes a defense either on state law grounds or upon the grounds suggested by Justice Marshall in his dissent. The Illinois courts may also agree with MITE that the Business Take-Over Act is pre-empted by the Williams Act or that Illinois’ regulation of interstate tender offers runs afoul of the Commerce Clause. The possibility that this Court might disagree with the Illinois courts’ ultimate resolution of the issues arising in a presently unripe, but threatened, enforcement action hardly justifies the Court’s resolution of important constitutional issues in the abstract posture in- which they are currently presented.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b711-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="667">*667</page-number>The Secretary and MITE dispute the propriety of the injunction issued by the District Court in this case only with respect to a controversy that may ripen in another court. Because the controversy that is before the Court is no longer alive, I would vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and order that court to remand this case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint. See <em>Weinstein </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>423 U. S. 147, 149 (1975); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Munsing wear, Inc., </em>340 U. S. 36, 39 (1950).</p>
<footnote label="1">
<p id="b700-8"> Unless the federal courts can grant preliminary injunctions that provide permanent protection, challenges to questionable state statutes may be de<page-number citation-index="1" label="657">*657</page-number>terred. A state statute may be either repugnant to the Constitution, or pre-empted by some federal law. Parties who wish to engage in conduct proscribed by state statutes may be reluctant to challenge their validity unless they can obtain permanent immunity from penalties. But there is a strong federal interest in encouraging such challenges: the Constitution itself provides that the Constitution and federal statutes shall be “the supreme Law of the Land.” Grants of permanent immunity help ensure that federal law will remain paramount.</p>
<p id="b701-7">Holding that federal courts have power to grant permanent protection would not substantially limit state power. In fact, the impact on state power will be relatively insignificant. A federal court may grant a preliminary injunction prohibiting the enforcement of a state statute only when there is substantial doubt about the validity of the statute, and when the party seeking relief is able to show that he will suffer irreparable injury if an injunction is not granted. It is true that under the rule I propose, if the statute is later determined to be valid, the State will never be able to prosecute the individual that obtained the preliminary injunction for action taken while the injunction was in effect. However, the State will be free to prosecute him for actions occurring either before or after the injunction, and will also be able to prosecute other persons who violated the statute. In other words, the State will be barred only from prosecuting the particular individual who requested the injunction for conduct undertaken during the pendency of the injunction. Moreover, it will be barred from prosecuting that individual, only because there was serious doubt about the constitutionality of the statute, and because he was able to show that he would suffer irreparable injury if an injunction was not granted.</p>

<footnote label="2">
<p id="b701-8"> It might be argued that because a party seeking a preliminary injunction must ordinarily post bond, there should be a presumption in favor of recovery of damages caused by a wrongfully issued preliminary injunction. However, the fact that an injunction bond is ordinarily required does not necessarily imply that the party against whom the injunction was issued is automatically entitled to damages. That party must still prove that dam<page-number citation-index="1" label="658">*658</page-number>ages are appropriate; the injunction bond merely provides security, when the party is able to make such a showing.</p>
<p id="b702-6">It is true that when an injunction bond has been posted, and when the party challenging the injunction has a right to recover damages on the bond, the question whether an injunction was properly issued is not moot. See <em>Liner </em>v. <em>Jafco, Inc., </em>375 U. S. 301 (1964). The District Court record does not reveal that a bond was posted in this case. Even if a bond had been posted, however, this case would probably be moot; I believe that the State would not have a cause of action for damages. If this Court had determined that the injunction was wrongfully entered, the State might argue that it was damaged because it was unable to recover penalties for violations of the Take-Over Act that occurred during the period the preliminary injunction was in effect. Such an argument should not prevail. Lost penalties do not constitute the sort of damages recoverable on a bond. In any event, as I suggest in this dissent, I believe that the preliminary injunction should be interpreted as protecting MITE from penalties. Thus, it should also protect MITE from liability for “damages” sustained by the State because it could not bring an action for penalties.</p>
<p id="b702-7">If a bond had been posted, the State might be able to recover costs or nominal damages on the bond. However, where there is no other basis for challenging the validity of an injunction, the possibility of such recovery is not sufficient to keep a case alive. If it were, then almost no case challenging an injunction could become moot. See <em>Washington Market Co. </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>137 U. S. 62 (1890) (court costs); <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>European Auto Collision, Inc., </em>487 F. 2d 378, 387 (CA2 1973) (nominal damages); <em>Kerrigan </em>v. <em>Boucher, </em>450 F. 2d 487 (CA2 1971) (nominal damages).</p>
