 To obtain a confession, the interrogator must “patiently maneuver himself or his quarry into a position from which the desired objective may be attained.” 23 When normal procedures fail to produce the needed result, the police may resort to deceptive stratagems such as giving false legal advice.  It is important to keep the subject off balance, for example, by trading on his insecurity about himself or his surroundings.  The police then persuade, trick, or cajole him out of exercising his constitutional rights.  Even without employing brutality, the “third degree” or the specific stratagems described above, the very fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on individual liberty and trades on the weakness of individuals.  24 *456 This fact may be illustrated simply by referring to three confession cases decided by this Court in the Term immediately preceding our Escobedo decision.  In Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963), the defendant was a 19-year-old heroin addict, described as a “near mental defective,” id., at 307-310 .  The defendant in Lynumn v. Illinois, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 528</citedDecision> (1963), was a woman who confessed to the arresting officer after being importuned to “cooperate” in order to prevent her children from being taken by relief authorities.  This Court as in those cases reversed the conviction of a defendant in Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963), whose persistent request during his interrogation was to phone his wife or attorney.  25 In other settings, these individuals might have exercised their constitutional rights.  In the incommunicado police-dominated atmosphere, they succumbed.  In the cases before us today, given this background, we concern ourselves primarily with this interrogation atmosphere and the evils it can bring.  In No. 759, Miranda v. Arizona, the police arrested the defendant and took him to a special interrogation room where they secured a confession.  In No. 760, Vignera v. New York, the defendant made oral admissions to the police after interrogation in the afternoop, and then signed an inculpatory statement upon being questioned by an assistant district attorney later the same evening.

 Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 544 (1961); Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1 (1924).  This is so even if there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction, e. g., Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401, 404 (1945); Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532, 540-542 (1897).  Both state and federal courts now adhere to trial procedures which seek to assure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession offered at trial, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964); United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 38 (1951); see also Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 624 (1896).  Appellate review is exacting, see Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199 (1960).  Whether his conviction was in a federal or state court, the defendant may secure a post-conviction hearing based on the alleged involuntary character of his confession, provided he meets the procedural requirements, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963).  In addition, see Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n, 378 U. S. 52 (1964).  See Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 241 (1941); Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 (1944); Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401 (1945); Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315 (1959); Lynumn v. Illinois, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 528</citedDecision> (1963); Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963).  The police also prevented the attorney from consulting with his client.  Independent of any other constitutional proscription, this action constitutes a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel and excludes any statement obtained in its *466 wake.  See People v. Donovan, 13 N. Y. 2d 148, 193 N. E. 2d 628 , 243 N. Y. S. 2d 841 (1963) (Fuld, J.).  In re Groban, 352 U. S. 330, 340-352 (1957) (Black, J., dissenting); Note, 73 Yale L. J. 1000, 1048-1051 (1964); Comment, 31 U. Chi. L. Rev. 313 , 320 (1964) and authorities cited.  See p. 454, supra. Lord Devlin has commented: “It is probable that even today, when there is much less ignorance about these matters than formerly, there is still a general belief that you must answer all questions put to you by a policeman, or at least that it will be the worse for you if you do not.” Devlin, The Criminal Prosecution in England 32 (1958).  In accord with our decision today, it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation.

 See People v. Dorado, 62 Cal. 2d 338, 354 , 398 P. 2d 361, 371 , 42 Cal. Rptr. 169, 179 (1965).  In accordance with our holdings today and in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 492 , Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958) and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 (1958) are not to be followed.  In quoting the above from the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brandéis we, of course, do not intend to pass on the constitutional questions involved in the Olmstead case. Schaefer, Federalism and State Criminal Procedure, 70 Harv. L. Rev. 1 , 26 (1956).  Miranda, Vignera, and Westover were identified by eyewitnesses.  Marked bills from the bank robbed were found in Westover’s car. Articles stolen from the victim as well as from several other robbery victims were found in Stewart’s home at the outset of the investigation.  Dealing as we do here with constitutional standards in relation to statements made, the existence of independent corroborating evidence produced at trial is, of course, irrelevant to our decisions.  Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 518-519 (1963); Lynumn v. *482 Illinois, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 528, 537-538</citedDecision> (1963); Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 541 (1961); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199, 206 (1960).  See, e. g., Report and Recommendations of the [District of Columbia] Commissioners’ Committee on Police Arrests for Investigation (1962); American Civil Liberties Union, Secret Detention by the Chicago Police (1959).  An extreme example of this practice occurred in the District of Columbia in 1958.  Seeking three “stocky” young Negroes who had robbed a restaurant, police rounded up 90 persons of that general description.  Sixty-three were held overnight *483 before being released for lack of evidence.  A man not among the 90 arrested was ultimately charged with the crime.
