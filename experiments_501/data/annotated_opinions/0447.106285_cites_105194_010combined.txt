 ." People v. Cahan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445 , 282 P. 2d 905, 911 (1955).  In connection with this California case, we note that the second basis elaborated in Wolf in support of its failure to enforce the exclusionary doctrine against the States was that "other means of protection" have been afforded "the *652 right to privacy." [7] 338 U. S., at 30 .  The experience of California that such other remedies have been worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other States.  The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been *653 recognized by this Court since Wolf .  See Irvine v. California, <citedDecision>347 U. S. 128, 137</citedDecision> (1954).  Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the "weighty testimony" of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13 , 150 N. E. 585 (1926).  There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the Weeks exclusionary rule in New York, had said that "[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax." 242 N. Y., at 22 , 150 N. E., at 588 .  However, the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court. These include the recent discarding of the "silver platter" doctrine which allowed federal judicial use of evidence seized in violation of the Constitution by state agents, Elkins v. United States, supra ; the relaxation of the formerly strict requirements as to standing to challenge the use of evidence thus seized, so that now the procedure of exclusion, "ultimately referable to constitutional safeguards," is available to anyone even "legitimately on [the] premises" unlawfully searched, Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, 266-267 (1960); and, finally, the formulation of a method to prevent state use of evidence unconstitutionally seized by federal agents, Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 (1956).  Because there can be no fixed formula, we are admittedly met with "recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches," but less is not to be expected when dealing with a Constitution, and, at any rate, "[r]easonableness is in the first instance for the [trial court] .  .  .  to determine." United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56, 63 (1950).  It, therefore, plainly appears that the factual considerations supporting the failure of the Wolf Court to include the Weeks exclusionary rule when it recognized the enforceability of the right to privacy against the States in 1949, while not basically relevant to the constitutional consideration, could not, in any analysis, now be deemed controlling.  *654 III. Some five years after Wolf , in answer to a plea made here Term after Term that we overturn its doctrine on applicability of the Weeks exclusionary rule, this Court indicated that such should not be done until the States had "adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the [ Weeks ] rule." <citedDecision>Irvine</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>California, supra, at 134</citedDecision> .  There again it was said: "Never until June of 1949 did this Court hold the basic search-and-seizure prohibition in any way applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> And only last Term, after again carefully re-examining the Wolf doctrine in Elkins v. United States, supra , the Court pointed out that "the controlling principles" as to search and seizure and the problem of admissibility "seemed clear" (at p. 212) until the announcement in Wolf "that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not itself require state courts to adopt the exclusionary rule" of the Weeks case. At p. 213.  At the same time, the Court pointed out, "the underlying constitutional doctrine which Wolf established .  .  .  that the Federal Constitution .  .  .

 .  .  It would be a stultification of the responsibility which the course of constitutional history has cast upon this Court to hold that in order to convict a man the police cannot extract by force what is in his mind but can extract what is in his stomach." [10] The methods used by the police thus were, according to the majority, "too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation," [11] and the case was reversed on the ground that these methods had violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in that the treatment accorded Rochin was of a kind that "shocks the conscience," "offend[s] `a sense of justice' " and fails to "respect certain decencies of civilized conduct." [12] I concurred in the reversal of the Rochin case, but on the ground that the Fourteenth Amendment made the Fifth Amendment's provision against self-incrimination *665 applicable to the States and that, given a broad rather than a narrow construction, that provision barred the introduction of this "capsule" evidence just as much as it would have forbidden the use of words Rochin might have been coerced to speak.  [13] In reaching this conclusion I cited and relied on the Boyd case, the constitutional doctrine of which was, of course, necessary to my disposition of the case. At that time, however, these views were very definitely in the minority for only MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and I rejected the flexible and uncertain standards of the "shock-the-conscience test" used in the majority opinion.  [14] Two years after Rochin , in <citedDecision>Irvine</citedDecision> v. California , [15] we were again called upon to consider the validity of a conviction based on evidence which had been obtained in a manner clearly unconstitutional and arguably shocking to the conscience.  The five opinions written by this Court in that case demonstrate the utter confusion and uncertainty that had been brought about by the Wolf and Rochin decisions.  In concurring, MR. JUSTICE CLARK emphasized the unsatisfactory nature of the Court's "shock-the-conscience test," saying that this "test" "makes for such uncertainty and unpredictability that it would be impossible to foretellother than by guessworkjust how brazen the invasion of the intimate privacies of one's home must be in order to shock itself into the protective arms of the Constitution.  In truth, the practical result of this ad hoc approach is simply that when five Justices are sufficiently revolted by local police action, a conviction is overturned and a guilty man may go free." [16] *666 Only one thing emerged with complete clarity from the <citedDecision>Irvine</citedDecision> casethat is that seven Justices rejected the "shock-the-conscience" constitutional standard enunciated in the Wolf and Rochin cases. But even this did not lessen the confusion in this area of the law because the continued existence of mutually inconsistent precedents together with the Court's inability to settle upon a majority opinion in the <citedDecision>Irvine</citedDecision> case left the situation at least as uncertain as it had been before.  [17] Finally, today, we clear up that uncertainty.  As I understand the Court's opinion in this case, we again reject the confusing "shock-the-conscience" standard of the Wolf and Rochin cases and, instead, set aside this state conviction in reliance upon the precise, intelligible and more predictable constitutional doctrine enunciated in the Boyd case. I fully agree with Mr. Justice Bradley's opinion that the two Amendments upon which the Boyd doctrine rests are of vital importance in our constitutional scheme of liberty and that both are entitled to a liberal rather than a niggardly interpretation.  The courts of the country are entitled to know with as much certainty as possible what scope they cover.  The Court's opinion, in my judgment, dissipates the doubt and uncertainty in this field of constitutional law and I am persuaded, for this and other reasons stated, to depart from my prior views, to accept the Boyd doctrine as controlling in this state case and to join the Court's judgment and opinion which are in accordance with that constitutional doctrine.  MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.  Though I have joined the opinion of the Court, I add a few words.

The State made no attempt to prove its existence, issuance or contents, either at the trial or on the hearing of a preliminary motion to suppress.  The Supreme Court of Ohio said: "There is, in the record, considerable doubt as to whether there ever was any warrant for the search of defendant's home.  .  .

In the latter case, decided in 1954, Mr. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority, said (at p. 134): "We think that the Wolf decision should not be overruled, for the reasons so persuasively stated therein." Compare Schwartz v. Texas.  344 U. S. 199 , and Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 , in which the Wolf case was discussed and in no way disapproved.  And see Pugach v. Dollinger, 365 U. S. 458 , which relied on Schwartz .  [10]  Actually, only four members of the majority support this reasoning.  See pp. 685-686, infra.
