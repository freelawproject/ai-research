Plaintiff8 John Doe, James Doe and David Doe bring\\nthis action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly\\nsituated, pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal\\nRules of Civil Procedure.  The class consists of all\\njuveniles who are currently, have been or will be In the\\nfuture confined In the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish\\nPrison.\\n20.  The members of the class are so numerous that\\njoinder of all members Is Impracticable.  In addition, there\\nare questions of law and fact common to the members of the\\nplaintiff class regarding practices of the defendants, and\\nthe claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims\\nof the members of the plaintiff class.  Named plaintiffs and\\nthis counsel will fairly and adequately protect the\\ninterests of the members of the class.\\n21.  By their policies, the defendants have acted and\\n8\\n\\ncontinue to act  in a manner generally applicable to the\\nclass, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or\\ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class\\nas a whole.\\n22.  The injuries suffered by the named plaintiffs and\\nthe members of the plaintiff class are a result of the\\npolicies and practices of defendants and are capable of\\nrepetition, yet may evade review, thereby making class\\nrelief appropriate.\\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\\nConditions of Confinement Allegations\\nJuvenile Detention and the Physical Plant\\n23.  The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office operates\\nseveral secure parish prison facilities in New Orleans,\\nLouisiana.\\n24.  Juveniles are incarcerated in the facility located\\nat 2622 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana.  This\\nfacility is referred to as the Conchetta Facility.  This\\nfacility was not constructed as a separate detention center\\nfor juveniles.  The Conchetta Facility does not provide the\\nenvironment, programs or services that an appropriate\\njuvenile detention center should provide.\\n25.  Defendants incarcerate plaintiffs in dormitories\\non the first, second and third floors of the facility.  Each\\ndormitory consists of a series of triple tier bunk beds\\naround the perimeter of the foom with tables and benches\\n9\\n\\nbolted to the floor in the middle of the room.  There are 5\\ntoilets and 4 showers per dorm.\\n26.  Defendants fail to maintain an environment free\\nfrom vermin and roach infestation.  Juveniles eat in their\\nliving units and store leftovers and commissary items in\\ndirect proximity to their beds, further exacerbating the\\nvermin and roach infestation problems.\\n27.  Defendants fail to provide plaintiffs with\\nadequate basic supplies and appropriate clothing such as\\npillows, bed sheets, deodorant, socks, shoes, underwear and\\nseasonally appropriate clothing to enable plaintiffs to\\nmaintain personal hygiene.  Defendants only provide\\nplaintiffs with a toothbrush, toothpaste, a cup, soap and\\none uniform.  Soap, toilet paper, toothpaste, and\\ntoothbrushes are frequently unavailable.  Plaintiffs are\\nrequired to purchase or otherwise provide themselves with\\nbasic supplies not provided or not available from\\ndefendants.  No exceptions are made for juveniles who cannot\\nafford to purchase or otherwise obtain these basic supplies.\\n28.  Laundry practices in the Conchetta Facility are\\ninadequate to ensure the return of clothing.  As a result,\\njuveniles do not turn in their dirty clothes for laundering\\nand launder them in toilets and sinks.\\n29.  Ventilation, heating, and cooling in the Conchetta\\nFacility are inadequate.  Juveniles often suffer in\\noppressively cold or hot conditions.  The problem is\\n10\\n\\ncompounded by the fact that juveniles are not Issued\\nseasonally appropriate clothing.\\n30.  Defendants do not provide juveniles In the\\nConchetta Facility with meals adequate in quantity and\\nquality.  Food service and food transport practices are\\nunsanitary.  Food is frequently stored on the floor next to\\ndirty linens and garbage awaiting service.\\nSupervision by Staff\\n31.  Defendants have not implemented or promulgated\\nrules and regulations for the proper handling and treatment\\nof children who are detained in the Conchetta Facility.\\nTraining and Supervision of Staff\\n32.  Defendants do not employ Conchetta Facility\\npersonnel who are trained in identifying and responding to\\nproblems of juveniles.  Defendants' failure to employ\\nadequately trained staff results in lack of attention to\\nplaintiffs' problems during confinement, lack of appropriate\\nassessment of plaintiffs' physical, mental, emotional and\\nspiritual needs and lack of remedial programming.  Such\\nfailure subjects plaintiffs to serious harm from\\ninstitutional personnel, other detainees and themselves as\\nwell as neglect for their general well-being.\\n33.  Defendants do not hire program personnel who can\\nrespond to and provide for the needs of plaintiffs in the\\n11\\n\\nConchetta Facility.\\n34.  Defendants do not adequately supervise Conchetta\\nFacility personnel who are responsible for the care of\\nplaintiffs in the Conchetta Facility.\\nClassification\\n35.  Defendants have failed to develop and implement a\\nclassification system for children incarcerated in the\\nConchetta Facility.  As a result, children are arbitrarily\\nand inappropriately housed.\\n36.  Defendants also house on a separate tier children\\nfrom court8 of juvenile jurisdiction other than Orleans\\nParish.\\nMental Health, Dental, and Medical Care\\n37.  Defendants fail to provide adequate medical,\\ndental, or psychological screening or examination for\\nplaintiffs when plaintiffs are taken into custody.\\nDefendants fail to provide regular dental, medical, or\\nmental health services to plaintiffs.  Defendants' suicide\\nintervention and prevention measures are inadequate to\\nappropriately handle suicidal acts and gestures of juveniles\\nin the Conchetta Facility.\\nOvercrowding\\n38.  The Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison is\\n12\\n\\noften overcrowded and fails to provide an adequate\\nenvironment for its juvenile detainees.  Consequently, many\\njuveniles suffer forced idleness.  Juveniles are confined in\\ntheir housing unit all day for months on end with absolutely\\nnothing to do.  Moreover, the level of danger increases\\nsince staff are undertrained and do not monitor properly.\\nAs a result, juveniles act out, become aggressive, fight,\\nand eventually spend long amounts of time in segregation.\\nEducation\\n39.  Defendants do not provide children with any\\nappropriate educational program.  Children go to school\\napproximately 5 hours per week.  Children who are on\\ndisciplinary lock-down do not receive any educational\\nprogram.\\nSpecial Education\\n40.  Defendants fail to properly identify and assess\\nchildren with special education needs and fail to provide\\nappropriate special education and related services to\\nchildren while in the Conchetta Facility.\\nProgramming\\n41.  Defendants do not provide children with any\\nappropriate indoor or outdoor activities while at the\\nConchetta Facility.  Defendants subject plaintiff children\\n13\\n\\nto long periods of forced idleness.  The only activities\\navailable to children in the Conchetta Facility are\\ntelevision, cards, and limited physical exercise.  Exercise\\nconsists of, at best, a one hour period five times per week\\nduring which the only available activity is basketball or\\nmilitary drill type calisthenics.  Basketball consists of a\\nseries of five on five games in which the winning team\\ncontinues to play and the losing team must leave the court.\\nThus, only a few juveniles will engage in the one activity\\navailable during an unrestricted activity period.\\nCalisthenics under military drill type conditions are the\\nonly other physical exercise activity provided.  There are\\nno games, exercise equipment or activities.\\n42.  Defendants fail to provide children incarcerated\\nin the Conchetta Facility with any appropriate reading\\nmaterials.  Defendants prohibit children from having books.\\nThe only reading materials provided are religious pamphlets.\\nChildren are allowed to purchase periodicals from the\\ncommissary or have periodicals mailed to them.  Ho provision\\nis made for juveniles who cannot afford to purchase reading\\nmaterials.\\nVisitation\\n43.  Defendants fail to provide adequate opportunities\\nfor children to have visits from family members and friends.\\nVisitation is only allowed once a week on Saturday mornings\\n14\\n\\nor afternoons.  Visitors must have some form of state issued\\nidentification.  There is no waiting area for visitors\\ninside the facility.  Visitors are required to stand\\noutside, rain or shine, while waiting to visit.  Visits are\\nlimited to 15 minutes per visitor.  Children are not\\nallowed to touch their family members during visits since\\nall visiting is done through a glass partition.  Children\\nwho are on lock-down or are in a unit which is being\\ndisciplined as a group are denied visitors.\\nDiscipline- and Segregation\\n44.  Defendants do not have appropriate policies,\\nprocedures, and training regarding discipline and isolation\\npractices.  As a result, juveniles are subjected to unduly\\nharsh discipline and to long periods of segregation for\\nminor incidents.\\n45.  As a result of defendants' policies, practices,\\nacts and omissions, described herein, plaintiffs'\\nconfinement by defendants in the Conchetta Facility, Orleans\\nParish Prison is cruel, harsh, punitive and oppressive.\\nKnowledge of the Defendants\\n46.  Defendant Charles Foti is the Criminal Sheriff for\\nthe Parish of Orleans, Louisiana.  As such, this defendant\\nis keeper of the parish jail pursuant to Louisiana Revised\\nStatutes S 15:704 and thus responsible for operating the\\n15\\n\\nConchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison and insuring that\\npersons confined therein are properly cared for, fed and\\nclothed.

In such capacity defendants know or should know that\\nchildren are being confined in unconstitutional conditions\\nin the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison. By\\nallowing said conditions to continue, defendants have\\nbreached their duty and are responsible in part for said\\nconditions.

Given the important federal and state interests at stake, we conclude\\nthat the enforcement provisions of the decree are too ambiguous to be approved. Accordingly, we vacate the\\nconsent decree and remand for further proceedings.\\nI.\\nTen named plaintiffs commenced this class action under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 alleging that the Arkansas Department\\nof Human Services (DHS or the State) administers its child welfare programs in violation of the rights of foster\\nchildren and abused or neglected children under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Adoption Assistance and Child\\nWelfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 620-28, 670-79, and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, 42 U.S.C.\\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 5101-06a. Plaintiffs' ninety-three page complaint asserted, among other things, that DHS and its Division of\\nChildren and Family Services (DCFS) have failed to investigate complaints of abuse and neglect, to make\\nreasonable efforts to keep families together, to provide adequate care to children placed in foster homes, and to\\nproperly train foster parents.\\nOn October 10, 1991, pursuant to a stipulation, the district court certified a class consisting of:\\n323 *323 All children who, since July 1, 1988, have or will become known to DHS by reason of a\\ncomplaint of abuse or neglect, and all children who are now or will be in the custody of DHS as the\\nresult of an emergency 72-hour placement or an abuse, neglect, or Family in Need of Services\\n(FINS) petition.\\nOn February 27, 1992, after months of negotiations, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement\\nand a proposed order. As described in the motion:\\nThe [proposed] Order incorporates by reference the Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document, a\\ndetailed plan governing defendants' operation of [DHS] and [DCFS] in all the major areas\\n\\naddressed by plaintiffs' Complaint, including: out of home placement; health care; staff resources;\\ntraining; family services; child protective services; and case planning and case review.\\nThat same day, the Governor signed into law Act One of the First Extraordinary Session of 1992 (\\\"Act One\\\"),\\nwhich adopted the Child Welfare Reform Document \\\"as the requirements to be met by [DHS] and [DCFS] in their\\noperation of the Child Welfare System in Arkansas.\\\" 1992 Ark. Acts (1st Ex. Sess.) 1, \\u00a7 1(a). Section 1(b) of Act\\nOne directed the State Treasurer to make available such funds \\\"as may be required to meet the requirements of\\nthe Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document,\\\" subject to the following proviso:\\nProvided, however, the State Treasurer shall make no such transfers after June 30, 1992 unless\\nshe receives certification from the Governor that an order has been issued closing the case of \\nAngela R., et al v. Bill Clinton, et al, subject only to being reopened by either party to determine\\ncompliance or noncompliance with the Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document.\\nThe district court tentatively approved the settlement on March 19 and ordered that a fairness hearing be held\\nApril 30. On March 25, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Suter v. Artist M., ___ U.S. ___, ___ n. 10, ___,\\n112 S.Ct. 1360, 1368 n. 10, 1370, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992), holding that 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 671(a)(9) and (15), portions of\\nthe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, do not create private rights enforceable under \\u00a7 1983. The State\\nthen filed a Motion to Review Class Definition, suggesting that Suter \\\"brings into question this Court's subject\\nmatter jurisdiction\\\" and places the court \\\"in a position to enforce state law only, contrary to the holding of \\nPennhurst State School vs. Halderman, [465] U.S. 89, [104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67], and the Eleventh\\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.\\\" In particular, the State argued that Suter and our decision in Doe\\nv. Hennepin County, 858 F.2d 1325 (8th Cir.1988),cert. denied,490 U.S. 1108, 109 S.Ct. 3161, 104 L.Ed.2d\\n1023 (1989), deprived the court of jurisdiction over the claims of class members not in state custody.\\nOn May 5, 1992, the district court denied the State's motion and ordered entry of the proposed order as a\\nconsent decree. The court concluded that Suter does not foreclose all of the claims asserted by all class\\nmembers; that the settlement satisfies the standard articulated in Local 93, International Ass'n of Firefighters v.\\nCity of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986), and therefore the consent decree may\\nafford broader relief than the court could have awarded after trial; and that the State waived its Eleventh\\nAmendment immunity by enacting Act One and by consenting to the decree. The court expressly retained\\njurisdiction \\\"for the purpose of enforcing [the] Order and the Child Welfare Reform Document.\\\" The State appeals\\nthe district court's refusal to narrow the class and its entry of the consent decree.\\nII.\\nPlaintiffs commenced this action to compel the State to comply with federal statutes and the Constitution in\\ndealing with foster children and abused or neglected children. There can be no doubt that the district court had\\njurisdiction to consider these claims. See Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 539-41, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1380-81, 39\\nL.Ed.2d 577 (1974). It is true that the class members who are foster children in the State's custody have stronger\\n324 constitutional claims than abused or neglected children who have not *324 been placed in foster care. See \\nDeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1005-06, 103\\nL.Ed.2d 249 (1989). Compare Norfleet v. Arkansas Dep't of Human Servs., 989 F.2d 289, 292-93 (8th Cir.1993),\\nwith Doe v. Hennepin County, 858 F.2d at 1329. With respect to the statutory claims, Suter held that no class\\nmember may obtain relief for violations of 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 671(a)(9) or (a)(15), and the analysis in Suter might\\nultimately compel the conclusion that the other federal statutes upon which plaintiffs rely do not create an\\nenforceable private right of action on their behalf. But these questions go to the merits of plaintiffs' claims, not to\\nthe district court's jurisdiction. Because Suter does not \\\"inescapably render the claims frivolous,\\\" Koke v. Stifel,\\nNicolaus & Co., 620 F.2d 1340, 1346 (8th Cir.1980), we think it clear that the district court had jurisdiction to\\napprove the proposed settlement and to enter a consent decree resolving the claims of all class members.\\n\\nIII.\\nThe State requests that we set aside portions of the consent decree entered to implement the parties' settlement.\\nAlthough the law favors settlements, federal courts in adopting consent decrees are not mere \\\"`recorder[s] of\\ncontracts' from whom parties can purchase injunctions.\\\" Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 525, 106 S.Ct. at 3077. See \\nDonaghy v. City of Omaha, 933 F.2d 1448, 1459 (8th Cir.1991),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 938, 117\\nL.Ed.2d 109 (1992). Rather, as Justice Cardozo stated in United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 115, 52\\nS.Ct. 460, 462, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932), a consent decree is a judicial act, and \\\"the adopting court is free to reject\\nagreed-upon terms as not in furtherance of statutory objectives.\\\" System Federation v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 651,\\n81 S.Ct. 368, 373, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961). Before approving a class action settlement and entering the requested\\nconsent decree, then, a federal court must determine \\\"that the settlement is consistent with the statute the\\nconsent judgment is to enforce and fairly and reasonably resolves the controversy in a manner consistent with\\nthe public interest.\\\" Citizens for a Better Environment v. Gorsuch, 718 F.2d 1117, 1128 (D.C.Cir.1983),cert.\\ndenied,467 U.S. 1219, 104 S.Ct. 2668, 81 L.Ed.2d 373 (1984).\\nIn this case, the core of the parties' settlement is the Child Welfare Reform Document, a fifty-page document\\nsetting forth specific, detailed mandates to govern the manner in which DHS and DCFS will discharge their\\nresponsibilities to foster children and abused and neglected children under Arkansas law. Neither party has\\nchallenged the substantive provisions contained in this document. By enacting Act One, the State has made the\\nReform Document a part of state law, so there can be little doubt that DHS and DCFS intend to comply with the\\nReform Document's requirements, including those requirements that will benefit children who are not in the\\nState's custody.\\nThus, the dispute in this case involves not the substantive obligations imposed by the settlement, but rather the\\nfuture enforcement of those obligations. The consent decree's enforcement provision is ambiguous:\\nThe Court shall retain jurisdiction of this matter solely for the purpose of enforcing this Order and\\nthe Child Welfare Reform Document.\\nThe Clerk is directed to close this case in his records without prejudice to the rights of the parties\\n[1]\\nto seek enforcement from the Court. If the Compliance and Oversight Committee  has found by\\nmajority vote substantial compliance or noncompliance with the Document, and such finding has,\\nin the opinion of any party, remained disputed and unresolved for at least 90 days then either\\nparty may seek review by the District Court.\\nBy its wording, this provision suggests that only the plaintiffs as a class may seek to enforce the decree and only\\n325 by challenging decisions of the Compliance Committee. *325 Plaintiffs nevertheless assert that any class\\nmember will be entitled to apply to the district court for an order enforcing any provision of the consent decree,\\nincluding the entire Reform Document. In the wake of Suter, the State objects to such a wholesale transfer of\\njurisdiction to the federal court and seeks to limit the damage by removing pre-placement children from the class,\\n[2]\\n while leaving the State's obligations under Act One and the Reform Document intact.\\nFrom the standpoint of judicial administration, this impasse is unacceptable. While the Reform Document is a\\ncontract between the settling parties, it is the enforcement mechanism that makes the consent decree a judicial\\nact. Unless that mechanism is clearly defined 00 in terms of who may bring an enforcement action, for what kinds\\n97\\nof violations, and so forth 00 it is impossible to determine (i) the precise benefits class members are receiving, (ii)\\n97\\nthe extent to which the decree imposes federal control over state functions, or (iii) the burden that approval of the\\ndecree will impose upon the federal judiciary. In this very fundamental respect, the decree fails to set forth its\\nterms with the specificity required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d). See Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U.S. 473, 94 S.Ct. 713, 38\\nL.Ed.2d 661 (1974). We conclude that the district court abused its discretion in approving a consent decree that\\ndid not specifically resolve these enforcement issues.\\nWe therefore remand this case to the district court for further consideration of the proposed settlement. In\\nconsidering whether to approve any amended consent decree, the district court should weigh the following:\\n\\n1. The parties' pre-approval debate over enforcement of the decree suggests that their purported agreement\\nfailed to resolve fundamental remedy issues that are essential to any settlement. Plaintiffs argue that the consent\\ndecree permits any member of the class to enforce the Reform Document in federal court, even if the alleged\\nviolation involves only matters of state law. The State objects that it never consented to such a remedy. In\\nresolving this dispute, the district court must bear in mind that it \\\"is not free.. to impose unagreed-to equitable\\nremedies that it might have fashioned `had the plaintiff established his factual claims and legal theories in\\nlitigation.'\\\" SEC v. Levine, 881 F.2d 1165, 1181 (2d Cir.1989), quoting United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S.\\n673, 682, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971).\\nMoreover, the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from granting relief against state officials for conduct\\nthat violates only state law. Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79\\nL.Ed.2d 67 (1984). While Eleventh Amendment immunity can be waived, such waiver must be unequivocally\\nexpressed. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1360-61, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). For a state\\nstatute to constitute a waiver \\\"it must specify the State's intention to subject itself to suit in federal court.\\\" \\nAtascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 241, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3146-47, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985). See\\nalso Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U.S. 299, 306-08, 110 S.Ct. 1868, 1873-74, 109 L.Ed.2d\\n264 (1990); Burk v. Beene, 948 F.2d 489, 493-94 (8th Cir.1991). Although Act One expressly acknowledges the\\npendency of this litigation, we conclude that it falls considerably short of the \\\"unequivocal waiver\\\" of Eleventh\\nAmendment immunity that Atascadero requires. Thus, Eleventh Amendment concerns make it all the more\\nimportant to ensure that any approved enforcement provisions are the result of a consensual process and are\\nclearly spelled out in the decree.\\n2. Federal courts have interests independent of those of the states in preserving the appropriate relation between\\nsovereigns and in efficiently allocating scarce federal resources to the adjudication of federal claims. See Kasper\\nv. Board of Election Comm'rs, 814 F.2d 332, 340-41 (7th Cir. 1987); Sansom Comm. v. Lynn, 735 F.2d 1535,\\n1543-44 (3d Cir.) (Becker, J., concurring), cert. denied,469 U.S. 1017, 105 S.Ct. 431, 83 L.Ed.2d 358 (1984). As \\n326 Pennhurst*326 makes clear, a federal court's interest in remedying violations of state law is decidedly minor, so\\nthat expending significant federal judicial resources enforcing consent decree provisions that concern only issues\\nof state law is rarely justifiable. Thus, even if the State were willing to agree that any and all provisions of the\\nChild Welfare Reform Document would be enforceable in federal court through the consent decree, its\\nwillingness to transfer this burden of enforcing its own laws to the federal court \\\"does not oblige the court to\\naccept.\\\" Kasper, 814 F.2d at 340. See also Georgevich v. Strauss, 772 F.2d 1078, 1085 (3d Cir.1985) (en banc), \\ncert. denied,475 U.S. 1028, 106 S.Ct. 1229, 89 L.Ed.2d 339 (1986). Rather, \\\"appropriate consideration must be\\ngiven to principles of federalism in determining the availability and scope of equitable relief.\\\" Rizzo v. Goode, 423\\nU.S. 362, 379, 96 S.Ct. 598, 608, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976).\\n3. Although a consent decree may save federal judicial resources in the short term, its entry is often only the\\nbeginning of extended judicial involvement. See, e.g., Note, Federalism and Federal Consent Decrees Against\\nState Governmental Entities, 88 Colum.L.Rev. 1796, 1807-08 (1988). Federal courts operate according to\\ninstitutional rules and procedures that are poorly suited to the management of state agencies. See Donald L.\\nHorowitz, Decreeing Organizational Change: Judicial Supervision of Public Institutions, 1983 Duke L.J. 1265,\\n1303-05. And consent decrees entered in institutional reform litigation \\\"reach beyond the parties involved directly\\nin the suit and impact on the public's right to sound and efficient operation of its institutions.\\\" Rufo v. Inmates of\\nSuffolk County Jail, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 112 S.Ct. 748, 759, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992). Therefore, the manner in\\nwhich the Child Welfare Reform Document is to be enforced by a court of equity \\\"must be structured to take into\\naccount `the well-established rule that the government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the\\ndispatch of its own internal affairs.'\\\" Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1171 (9th Cir.1987), quoting Rizzo, 423\\nU.S. at 378-79, 96 S.Ct. at 607-08.\\nIV.\\nIn conclusion, we have no concern with the parties agreeing that the State's enactment of Act One provides a\\nsuitable basis for settling this action. We are concerned that the parties' serious dispute over the consent\\n\\ndecree's ambiguous enforcement provision reflects an absence of the sufficiently well-defined agreement that is\\nan essential predicate to the entry of an appropriate consent decree. We are also concerned that the district court\\ncarefully weigh the constitutional, statutory, and institutional factors that bear upon the task of crafting a suitable\\nequitable decree in this type of litigation. Therefore, we vacate the Consent Decree entered June 8, 1992, and\\nremand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n[*] The HONORABLE BRUCE M.

Beginning on or before October 22, 2001, defendant Huntwood engaged in\\\\n6 unlawful employment practices at its Spokane, Washington cabinet manufacturing\\\\n7 facility in violation of \\u00a7\\u00a7 703(a) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e-2(a).  Defendant\\\\n8 Huntwood affected the terms and conditions of employment of Ms. Gibbs by subjecting\\\\n9 her to a sexually hostile environment because of their sex, which caused Ms. Gibbs\\u2019\\\\n10 constructive discharge on or about January 2, 2002. \\\\n11 8.     The effect of the practices complained of in paragraph 7 above has been to\\\\n12 deprive Ms. Gibbs of equal employment opportunities and otherwise adversely affect her\\\\n13 status as an employee because of sex. \\\\n14 9.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraph 7 above\\\\n15 were intentional. \\\\n16 10.  The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraph 7 above\\\\n17 were done with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of\\\\n18 Ms. Gibbs. \\\\n19\\\\n20 PRAYER FOR RELIEF\\\\n21 Wherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court:\\\\n22 A. Grant a permanent injunction enjoining defendant, its officers, successors,\\\\n23 agents, assigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging\\\\n24 in any employment practices which discriminate on the bases of sex. \\\\n25\\\\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNIlr\\\"f COMMISSION\\\\n26\\\\nSeattle Dlstdct Office\\\\nFederal Offk:e Building\\\\n27 909 Finer Avenue, Suite 400\\\\nSeatlle, Wh~shington 98104-1061\\\\nTelephone (206} 220,6883\\\\nFax (206) 220--6911\\\\nCOMPLAINT3\\\\nTDD (206) 22O,6882\\\\n\\\\n1 B.

Juveniles eat in their\\\\nliving units and store leftovers and commissary items in\\\\ndirect proximity to their beds, further exacerbating the\\\\nvermin and roach infestation problems. \\\\n27.   Defendants fail to provide plaintiffs with\\\\nadequate basic supplies and appropriate clothing such as\\\\npillows, bed sheets, deodorant, socks, shoes, underwear and\\\\nseasonally appropriate clothing to enable plaintiffs to\\\\nmaintain personal hygiene.   Defendants only provide\\\\nplaintiffs with a toothbrush, toothpaste, a cup, soap and\\\\none uniform.   Soap, toilet paper, toothpaste, and\\\\ntoothbrushes are frequently unavailable.   Plaintiffs are\\\\nrequired to purchase or otherwise provide themselves with\\\\nbasic supplies not provided or not available from\\\\ndefendants.   No exceptions are made for juveniles who cannot\\\\nafford to purchase or otherwise obtain these basic supplies. \\\\n28.   Laundry practices in the Conchetta Facility are\\\\ninadequate to ensure the return of clothing.   As a result,\\\\njuveniles do not turn in their dirty clothes for laundering\\\\nand launder them in toilets and sinks. \\\\n29.   Ventilation, heating, and cooling in the Conchetta\\\\nFacility are inadequate.   Juveniles often suffer in\\\\noppressively cold or hot conditions.   The problem is\\\\n10\\\\n\\\\ncompounded by the fact that juveniles are not Issued\\\\nseasonally appropriate clothing. \\\\n30.   Defendants do not provide juveniles In the\\\\nConchetta Facility with meals adequate in quantity and\\\\nquality.   Food service and food transport practices are\\\\nunsanitary.   Food is frequently stored on the floor next to\\\\ndirty linens and garbage awaiting service. \\\\nSupervision by Staff\\\\n31.   Defendants have not implemented or promulgated\\\\nrules and regulations for the proper handling and treatment\\\\nof children who are detained in the Conchetta Facility. \\\\nTraining and Supervision of Staff\\\\n32.   Defendants do not employ Conchetta Facility\\\\npersonnel who are trained in identifying and responding to\\\\nproblems of juveniles.   Defendants\\\\' failure to employ\\\\nadequately trained staff results in lack of attention to\\\\nplaintiffs\\\\' problems during confinement, lack of appropriate\\\\nassessment of plaintiffs\\\\' physical, mental, emotional and\\\\nspiritual needs and lack of remedial programming.   Such\\\\nfailure subjects plaintiffs to serious harm from\\\\ninstitutional personnel, other detainees and themselves as\\\\nwell as neglect for their general well-being. \\\\n33.   Defendants do not hire program personnel who can\\\\nrespond to and provide for the needs of plaintiffs in the\\\\n11\\\\n\\\\nConchetta Facility. \\\\n34.   Defendants do not adequately supervise Conchetta\\\\nFacility personnel who are responsible for the care of\\\\nplaintiffs in the Conchetta Facility. \\\\nClassification\\\\n35.   Defendants have failed to develop and implement a\\\\nclassification system for children incarcerated in the\\\\nConchetta Facility.   As a result, children are arbitrarily\\\\nand inappropriately housed. \\\\n36.   Defendants also house on a separate tier children\\\\nfrom court8 of juvenile jurisdiction other than Orleans\\\\nParish. \\\\nMental Health, Dental, and Medical Care\\\\n37.   Defendants fail to provide adequate medical,\\\\ndental, or psychological screening or examination for\\\\nplaintiffs when plaintiffs are taken into custody. \\\\nDefendants fail to provide regular dental, medical, or\\\\nmental health services to plaintiffs.   Defendants\\\\' suicide\\\\nintervention and prevention measures are inadequate to\\\\nappropriately handle suicidal acts and gestures of juveniles\\\\nin the Conchetta Facility. \\\\nOvercrowding\\\\n38.   The Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison is\\\\n12\\\\n\\\\noften overcrowded and fails to provide an adequate\\\\nenvironment for its juvenile detainees.   Consequently, many\\\\njuveniles suffer forced idleness.   Juveniles are confined in\\\\ntheir housing unit all day for months on end with absolutely\\\\nnothing to do.   Moreover, the level of danger increases\\\\nsince staff are undertrained and do not monitor properly. \\\\nAs a result, juveniles act out, become aggressive, fight,\\\\nand eventually spend long amounts of time in segregation. \\\\nEducation\\\\n39.   Defendants do not provide children with any\\\\nappropriate educational program.   Children go to school\\\\napproximately 5 hours per week.  Children who are on\\\\ndisciplinary lock-down do not receive any educational\\\\nprogram. \\\\nSpecial Education\\\\n40.   Defendants fail to properly identify and assess\\\\nchildren with special education needs and fail to provide\\\\nappropriate special education and related services to\\\\nchildren while in the Conchetta Facility. \\\\nProgramming\\\\n41.   Defendants do not provide children with any\\\\nappropriate indoor or outdoor activities while at the\\\\nConchetta Facility.   Defendants subject plaintiff children\\\\n13\\\\n\\\\nto long periods of forced idleness.   The only activities\\\\navailable to children in the Conchetta Facility are\\\\ntelevision, cards, and limited physical exercise.   Exercise\\\\nconsists of, at best, a one hour period five times per week\\\\nduring which the only available activity is basketball or\\\\nmilitary drill type calisthenics.   Basketball consists of a\\\\nseries of five on five games in which the winning team\\\\ncontinues to play and the losing team must leave the court.\\\\nThus, only a few juveniles will engage in the one activity\\\\navailable during an unrestricted activity period. \\\\nCalisthenics under military drill type conditions are the\\\\nonly other physical exercise activity provided.   There are\\\\nno games, exercise equipment or activities. \\\\n42.   Defendants fail to provide children incarcerated\\\\nin the Conchetta Facility with any appropriate reading\\\\nmaterials.   Defendants prohibit children from having books. \\\\nThe only reading materials provided are religious pamphlets. \\\\nChildren are allowed to purchase periodicals from the\\\\ncommissary or have periodicals mailed to them.   Ho provision\\\\nis made for juveniles who cannot afford to purchase reading\\\\nmaterials. \\\\nVisitation\\\\n43.   Defendants fail to provide adequate opportunities\\\\nfor children to have visits from family members and friends. \\\\nVisitation is only allowed once a week on Saturday mornings\\\\n14\\\\n\\\\nor afternoons.   Visitors must have some form of state issued\\\\nidentification.   There is no waiting area for visitors\\\\ninside the facility.   Visitors are required to stand\\\\noutside, rain or shine, while waiting to visit.   Visits are\\\\nlimited to 15 minutes per visitor.   Children are not\\\\nallowed to touch their family members during visits since\\\\nall visiting is done through a glass partition.   Children\\\\nwho are on lock-down or are in a unit which is being\\\\ndisciplined as a group are denied visitors. \\\\nDiscipline- and Segregation\\\\n44.   Defendants do not have appropriate policies,\\\\nprocedures, and training regarding discipline and isolation\\\\npractices.   As a result, juveniles are subjected to unduly\\\\nharsh discipline and to long periods of segregation for\\\\nminor incidents. \\\\n45.   As a result of defendants\\\\' policies, practices,\\\\nacts and omissions, described herein, plaintiffs\\\\'\\\\nconfinement by defendants in the Conchetta Facility, Orleans\\\\nParish Prison is cruel, harsh, punitive and oppressive. \\\\nKnowledge of the Defendants\\\\n46.   Defendant Charles Foti is the Criminal Sheriff for\\\\nthe Parish of Orleans, Louisiana.   As such, this defendant\\\\nis keeper of the parish jail pursuant to Louisiana Revised\\\\nStatutes S 15:704 and thus responsible for operating the\\\\n15\\\\n\\\\nConchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison and insuring that\\\\npersons confined therein are properly cared for, fed and\\\\nclothed.   In such capacity defendant Foti knows or should\\\\nknow that children are being confined in unconstitutional\\\\nconditions in the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison. \\\\nBy allowing said conditions to continue, defendant has\\\\nbreached his duty and is responsible in part for said\\\\nconditions.   This defendant therefore shares responsibility\\\\nwith other defendants mentioned herein for violations of\\\\nplaintiffs\\\\' constitutional rights. \\\\n47.   Defendant Earl Weaver, Jr. is the Warden of the\\\\nConchetta Facility.   As such, this defendant is responsible\\\\nfor the day-to-day operation of the facility.   In such\\\\ncapacity defendant Weaver knows or should know that children\\\\nare being confined in unconstitutional conditions in the\\\\nConchetta Facility.   By allowing said conditions to\\\\ncontinue, defendant has breached his duty and is responsible\\\\nin part for said conditions.   This defendant therefore\\\\nshares responsibility with other defendants mentioned herein\\\\nfor violations of plaintiffs\\\\' constitutional rights. \\\\n48.   Defendant Sidney Barthelemy is the Mayor of the\\\\nCity of New Orleans.   As such, this defendant is\\\\nresponsible, pursuant to city ordinance, for the expenses of\\\\noperating a program for pre-adjudicated juveniles in the\\\\nOrleans Parish Prison and for the expenses of establishing,\\\\nmaintaining, and operating the Orleans Parish Prison,\\\\n16\\\\n\\\\npursuant to Louisiana Revised Statutes 15t702 and 33x1523.1. \\\\nIn such capacity defendant Barthelemy knows, or should know,\\\\nthat children are being confined in unconstitutional\\\\nconditions in the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison. \\\\nBy allowing said conditions to continue, defendant has\\\\nbreached his duty and is responsible in part for said\\\\nconditions.   This defendant therefore shares responsibility\\\\nwith other defendants mentioned herein for violations of\\\\nplaintiffs\\\\' constitutional rights. \\\\n49.   Defendant Orleans Parish School Board is\\\\nresponsible under Louisiana law for implementing the state\\\\'s\\\\ngeneral school law in Orleans Parish.   Louisiana Revised\\\\nStatutes 17t81(A).   This defendant is also responsible for\\\\nthe delivery of services to exceptional children, including\\\\n(1) special education and related services, personnel and\\\\nprograms; (2) alternative educational settings;\\\\n(3) appropriate materials and supplies, equipment, and other\\\\nmedia necessary for the provision of special education and\\\\nrelated services; and (4) individualized educational plans. \\\\nLouisiana Revised Statutes 17t1947.   In such capacity, the\\\\ndefendant school board knows or should know that children\\\\nincarcerated in Orleans Parish Prison are being denied the\\\\neducation to which they are entitled.   By allowing said\\\\nconditions to continue, defendant has breached its duty and\\\\nis responsible in part for said conditions.   This defendant\\\\ntherefore shares responsibility with other defendants\\\\n17\\\\n\\\\nmentioned herein for violations of plaintiffs constitutional\\\\nrightB. \\\\n50.   Defendants Anita H. Ganucheau, Ernestine S. Gray,\\\\nLawrence L. Lagarde Jr., Salvadore T. Mul6 and C. Hearn\\\\nTaylor are Juvenile Court Judges of Orleans Parish.   As such\\\\nthey exercise jurisdiction over children brought before them\\\\nin Juvenile Court pursuant to Louisiana Children\\\\'s Code Art.\\\\n302 and have the power, pursuant to Louisiana revised\\\\nStatutes S 13i1578, to arrange with any institution or\\\\nagency to receive for temporary care children within the\\\\njurisdiction of the court.  Defendant Juvenile Court Judges\\\\nhave arranged with Defendant Foti for the temporary care of\\\\nchildren within the jurisdiction of the court in facilities\\\\noperated by the Orleans Parish Criminal Sheriff\\\\'s Office and\\\\nhave ordered pursuant to the Louisiana Children\\\\'s Code Art.\\\\n822 and 886 children to be incarcerated in the Conchetta\\\\nFacility pending adjudication and disposition of their\\\\ncases.  In such capacity defendants know or should know that\\\\nchildren are being confined in unconstitutional conditions\\\\nin the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison.  By\\\\nallowing said conditions to continue, defendants have\\\\nbreached their duty and are responsible in part for said\\\\nconditions.  These defendants therefore share responsibility\\\\nwith other defendants mentioned herein for violations of\\\\nplaintiffs constitutional rights. \\\\n51.   Defendant Richard L. Stalder, as Secretary of the\\\\n18\\\\n\\\\nDepartment of Public Safety and Corrections for the State of\\\\nLouisiana, is responsible pursuant to Louisiana Revised\\\\nStatutes S 36t403 for the policies, administration control\\\\nand operation of the functions, programs and affairs of the\\\\nDepartment of Public Safety and Corrections.   As such, this\\\\ndefendant is responsible for insuring that all children\\\\ncommitted to the custody of the Department of Public Safety\\\\nand Corrections, including those children who have been\\\\ncommitted to the Department of Public Safety and Corrections\\\\nand are incarcerated in the Conchetta Facility, receive\\\\nappropriate treatment, training, and education commensurate\\\\nwith their needs and abilities pursuant to Louisiana Revised\\\\nStatutes S 15i905A.   in such capacity defendant Stalder\\\\nknows or should know that children are being confined in\\\\nunconstitutional conditions in the Conchetta Facility,\\\\nOrleans Parish Prison.   By allowing said conditions to\\\\ncontinue, defendant has breached his duty and is responsible\\\\nin part for said conditions.   This defendant therefore\\\\nshares responsibility with other defendants mentioned herein\\\\nfor violations of plaintiffs\\\\' constitutional rights. \\\\n52.   Defendant Governor Edwin W. Edwards is responsible\\\\npursuant to L.R.S.  S 36:403 for the general control and\\\\nsupervision of the State Department of Public Safety and\\\\nCorrections and its Secretary.   In such capacity defendant\\\\nknows or should know that children committed to the custody\\\\nof the Department of Public Safety and Corrections are being\\\\n19\\\\n-  T \\\\'\\\\n\\\\nconfined in unconstitutional conditions in the Conchetta\\\\nFacility, Orleans Parish Prison.   By allowing said\\\\nconditions to continue, defendant has breached his duty and\\\\nis responsible in part for said conditions.   This defendant\\\\ntherefore shares responsibility with other defendants\\\\nmentioned herein for violations of plaintiffs constitutional\\\\nrights. \\\\nNECESSITY FOR INJUNCTIVB RELIEFS  NO ADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW\\\\n53.   Defendants regularly subject plaintiffs to the\\\\ncruel, unconscionable and illegal conditions of confinement\\\\ndescribed above.   Defendants have similarly confined and\\\\ndetained juveniles in the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish\\\\nPrison under such conditions in previous years and\\\\ndefendants will continue to confine juveniles under such\\\\nconditions in the future unless plaintiffs are granted the\\\\nrelief requested herein. \\\\n54.   As a proximate result of the policies, practices,\\\\nacts and omissions of defendants complained of herein,\\\\nplaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer serious and\\\\nirreparable physical, psychological, mental, emotional and\\\\nspiritual injuries.   Plaintiffs have no plain, adequate, or\\\\ncomplete remedy at law to redress the wrongs described\\\\nherein.   Plaintiffs will continue to be irreparably injured\\\\nby the policies, practices, act and omissions of the\\\\ndefendants unless this Court grants the injunctive relief\\\\n20\\\\n-  T  \\u2022\\\\n\\\\nwhich plaintiffs seek. \\\\nLEGAL CLAIMS\\\\n55.

Matthews, San Francisco, CA, argued (William L. Grimm, San Francisco, CA, Griffin J.

Given the important federal and state interests at stake, we conclude\\\\nthat the enforcement provisions of the decree are too ambiguous to be approved.  Accordingly, we vacate the\\\\nconsent decree and remand for further proceedings. \\\\nI. \\\\nTen named plaintiffs commenced this class action under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 alleging that the Arkansas Department\\\\nof Human Services (DHS or the State) administers its child welfare programs in violation of the rights of foster\\\\nchildren and abused or neglected children under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Adoption Assistance and Child\\\\nWelfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 620-28, 670-79, and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, 42 U.S.C.\\\\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 5101-06a.  Plaintiffs\\\\' ninety-three page complaint asserted, among other things, that DHS and its Division of\\\\nChildren and Family Services (DCFS) have failed to investigate complaints of abuse and neglect, to make\\\\nreasonable efforts to keep families together, to provide adequate care to children placed in foster homes, and to\\\\nproperly train foster parents. \\\\nOn October 10, 1991, pursuant to a stipulation, the district court certified a class consisting of:\\\\n323 *323 All children who, since July 1, 1988, have or will become known to DHS by reason of a\\\\ncomplaint of abuse or neglect, and all children who are now or will be in the custody of DHS as the\\\\nresult of an emergency 72-hour placement or an abuse, neglect, or Family in Need of Services\\\\n(FINS) petition. \\\\nOn February 27, 1992, after months of negotiations, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement\\\\nand a proposed order.  As described in the motion:\\\\nThe [proposed] Order incorporates by reference the Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document, a\\\\ndetailed plan governing defendants\\\\' operation of [DHS] and [DCFS] in all the major areas\\\\n\\\\naddressed by plaintiffs\\\\' Complaint, including: out of home placement; health care; staff resources;\\\\ntraining; family services; child protective services; and case planning and case review. \\\\nThat same day, the Governor signed into law Act One of the First Extraordinary Session of 1992 (\\\"Act One\\\"),\\\\nwhich adopted the Child Welfare Reform Document \\\"as the requirements to be met by [DHS] and [DCFS] in their\\\\noperation of the Child Welfare System in Arkansas.\\\" 1992 Ark. Acts (1st Ex. Sess.) 1, \\u00a7 1(a).  Section 1(b) of Act\\\\nOne directed the State Treasurer to make available such funds \\\"as may be required to meet the requirements of\\\\nthe Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document,\\\" subject to the following proviso:\\\\nProvided, however, the State Treasurer shall make no such transfers after June 30, 1992 unless\\\\nshe receives certification from the Governor that an order has been issued closing the case of \\\\nAngela R., et al v. Bill Clinton, et al, subject only to being reopened by either party to determine\\\\ncompliance or noncompliance with the Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document. \\\\nThe district court tentatively approved the settlement on March 19 and ordered that a fairness hearing be held\\\\nApril 30.  On March 25, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Suter v. Artist M., ___ U.S. ___, ___ n. 10, ___,\\\\n112 S.Ct. 1360, 1368 n. 10, 1370, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992), holding that 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 671(a)(9) and (15), portions of\\\\nthe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, do not create private rights enforceable under \\u00a7 1983.  The State\\\\nthen filed a Motion to Review Class Definition, suggesting that Suter \\\"brings into question this Court\\\\'s subject\\\\nmatter jurisdiction\\\" and places the court \\\"in a position to enforce state law only, contrary to the holding of \\\\nPennhurst State School vs. Halderman, [465] U.S. 89, [104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67], and the Eleventh\\\\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.\\\" In particular, the State argued that Suter and our decision in Doe\\\\nv. Hennepin County, 858 F.2d 1325 (8th Cir.1988),cert. denied,490 U.S. 1108, 109 S.Ct. 3161, 104 L.Ed.2d\\\\n1023 (1989), deprived the court of jurisdiction over the claims of class members not in state custody. \\\\nOn May 5, 1992, the district court denied the State\\\\'s motion and ordered entry of the proposed order as a\\\\nconsent decree.  The court concluded that Suter does not foreclose all of the claims asserted by all class\\\\nmembers; that the settlement satisfies the standard articulated in Local 93, International Ass\\\\'n of Firefighters v.\\\\nCity of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986), and therefore the consent decree may\\\\nafford broader relief than the court could have awarded after trial; and that the State waived its Eleventh\\\\nAmendment immunity by enacting Act One and by consenting to the decree.  The court expressly retained\\\\njurisdiction \\\"for the purpose of enforcing [the] Order and the Child Welfare Reform Document.\\\" The State appeals\\\\nthe district court\\\\'s refusal to narrow the class and its entry of the consent decree. \\\\nII. \\\\nPlaintiffs commenced this action to compel the State to comply with federal statutes and the Constitution in\\\\ndealing with foster children and abused or neglected children.  There can be no doubt that the district court had\\\\njurisdiction to consider these claims.  See Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 539-41, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1380-81, 39\\\\nL.Ed.2d 577 (1974).  It is true that the class members who are foster children in the State\\\\'s custody have stronger\\\\n324 constitutional claims than abused or neglected children who have not *324 been placed in foster care.  See \\\\nDeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep\\\\'t of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1005-06, 103\\\\nL.Ed.2d 249 (1989).  Compare Norfleet v. Arkansas Dep\\\\'t of Human Servs., 989 F.2d 289, 292-93 (8th Cir.1993),\\\\nwith Doe v. Hennepin County, 858 F.2d at 1329.  With respect to the statutory claims, Suter held that no class\\\\nmember may obtain relief for violations of 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 671(a)(9) or (a)(15), and the analysis in Suter might\\\\nultimately compel the conclusion that the other federal statutes upon which plaintiffs rely do not create an\\\\nenforceable private right of action on their behalf.  But these questions go to the merits of plaintiffs\\\\' claims, not to\\\\nthe district court\\\\'s jurisdiction.  Because Suter does not \\\"inescapably render the claims frivolous,\\\" Koke v. Stifel,\\\\nNicolaus & Co., 620 F.2d 1340, 1346 (8th Cir.1980), we think it clear that the district court had jurisdiction to\\\\napprove the proposed settlement and to enter a consent decree resolving the claims of all class members. \\\\n\\\\nIII.\\\\nThe State requests that we set aside portions of the consent decree entered to implement the parties\\\\' settlement. \\\\nAlthough the law favors settlements, federal courts in adopting consent decrees are not mere \\\"`recorder[s] of\\\\ncontracts\\\\' from whom parties can purchase injunctions.\\\" Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 525, 106 S.Ct. at 3077.  See \\\\nDonaghy v. City of Omaha, 933 F.2d 1448, 1459 (8th Cir.1991),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 938, 117\\\\nL.Ed.2d 109 (1992).  Rather, as Justice Cardozo stated in United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 115, 52\\\\nS.Ct. 460, 462, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932), a consent decree is a judicial act, and \\\"the adopting court is free to reject\\\\nagreed-upon terms as not in furtherance of statutory objectives.\\\" System Federation v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 651,\\\\n81 S.Ct. 368, 373, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961).  Before approving a class action settlement and entering the requested\\\\nconsent decree, then, a federal court must determine \\\"that the settlement is consistent with the statute the\\\\nconsent judgment is to enforce and fairly and reasonably resolves the controversy in a manner consistent with\\\\nthe public interest.\\\" Citizens for a Better Environment v. Gorsuch, 718 F.2d 1117, 1128 (D.C.Cir.1983),cert.\\\\ndenied,467 U.S. 1219, 104 S.Ct. 2668, 81 L.Ed.2d 373 (1984). \\\\nIn this case, the core of the parties\\\\' settlement is the Child Welfare Reform Document, a fifty-page document\\\\nsetting forth specific, detailed mandates to govern the manner in which DHS and DCFS will discharge their\\\\nresponsibilities to foster children and abused and neglected children under Arkansas law. Neither party has\\\\nchallenged the substantive provisions contained in this document.  By enacting Act One, the State has made the\\\\nReform Document a part of state law, so there can be little doubt that DHS and DCFS intend to comply with the\\\\nReform Document\\\\'s requirements, including those requirements that will benefit children who are not in the\\\\nState\\\\'s custody. \\\\nThus, the dispute in this case involves not the substantive obligations imposed by the settlement, but rather the\\\\nfuture enforcement of those obligations.  The consent decree\\\\'s enforcement provision is ambiguous:\\\\nThe Court shall retain jurisdiction of this matter solely for the purpose of enforcing this Order and\\\\nthe Child Welfare Reform Document. \\\\nThe Clerk is directed to close this case in his records without prejudice to the rights of the parties\\\\n[1]\\\\nto seek enforcement from the Court. If the Compliance and Oversight Committee  has found by\\\\nmajority vote substantial compliance or noncompliance with the Document, and such finding has,\\\\nin the opinion of any party, remained disputed and unresolved for at least 90 days then either\\\\nparty may seek review by the District Court.\\\\nBy its wording, this provision suggests that only the plaintiffs as a class may seek to enforce the decree and only\\\\n325 by challenging decisions of the Compliance Committee.  *325 Plaintiffs nevertheless assert that any class\\\\nmember will be entitled to apply to the district court for an order enforcing any provision of the consent decree,\\\\nincluding the entire Reform Document.  In the wake of Suter, the State objects to such a wholesale transfer of\\\\njurisdiction to the federal court and seeks to limit the damage by removing pre-placement children from the class,\\\\n[2]\\\\n while leaving the State\\\\'s obligations under Act One and the Reform Document intact. \\\\nFrom the standpoint of judicial administration, this impasse is unacceptable.  While the Reform Document is a\\\\ncontract between the settling parties, it is the enforcement mechanism that makes the consent decree a judicial\\\\nact.  Unless that mechanism is clearly defined 00 in terms of who may bring an enforcement action, for what kinds\\\\n97\\\\nof violations, and so forth 00 it is impossible to determine (i) the precise benefits class members are receiving, (ii)\\\\n97\\\\nthe extent to which the decree imposes federal control over state functions, or (iii) the burden that approval of the\\\\ndecree will impose upon the federal judiciary.  In this very fundamental respect, the decree fails to set forth its\\\\nterms with the specificity required by Fed.R.Civ.P.  65(d).  See Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U.S. 473, 94 S.Ct. 713, 38\\\\nL.Ed.2d 661 (1974).  We conclude that the district court abused its discretion in approving a consent decree that\\\\ndid not specifically resolve these enforcement issues. \\\\nWe therefore remand this case to the district court for further consideration of the proposed settlement.  In\\\\nconsidering whether to approve any amended consent decree, the district court should weigh the following:\\\\n\\\\n1.  The parties\\\\' pre-approval debate over enforcement of the decree suggests that their purported agreement\\\\nfailed to resolve fundamental remedy issues that are essential to any settlement.  Plaintiffs argue that the consent\\\\ndecree permits any member of the class to enforce the Reform Document in federal court, even if the alleged\\\\nviolation involves only matters of state law. The State objects that it never consented to such a remedy.  In\\\\nresolving this dispute, the district court must bear in mind that it \\\"is not free.. to impose unagreed-to equitable\\\\nremedies that it might have fashioned `had the plaintiff established his factual claims and legal theories in\\\\nlitigation.\\\\'\\\" SEC v. Levine, 881 F.2d 1165, 1181 (2d Cir.1989), quoting United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S.\\\\n673, 682, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971). \\\\nMoreover, the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from granting relief against state officials for conduct\\\\nthat violates only state law. Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79\\\\nL.Ed.2d 67 (1984).  While Eleventh Amendment immunity can be waived, such waiver must be unequivocally\\\\nexpressed.  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1360-61, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).  For a state\\\\nstatute to constitute a waiver \\\"it must specify the State\\\\'s intention to subject itself to suit in federal court.\\\" \\\\nAtascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 241, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3146-47, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985).  See\\\\nalso Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U.S. 299, 306-08, 110 S.Ct. 1868, 1873-74, 109 L.Ed.2d\\\\n264 (1990); Burk v. Beene, 948 F.2d 489, 493-94 (8th Cir.1991).  Although Act One expressly acknowledges the\\\\npendency of this litigation, we conclude that it falls considerably short of the \\\"unequivocal waiver\\\" of Eleventh\\\\nAmendment immunity that Atascadero requires.  Thus, Eleventh Amendment concerns make it all the more\\\\nimportant to ensure that any approved enforcement provisions are the result of a consensual process and are\\\\nclearly spelled out in the decree. \\\\n2.  Federal courts have interests independent of those of the states in preserving the appropriate relation between\\\\nsovereigns and in efficiently allocating scarce federal resources to the adjudication of federal claims.  See Kasper\\\\nv. Board of Election Comm\\\\'rs, 814 F.2d 332, 340-41 (7th Cir. 1987); Sansom Comm. v. Lynn, 735 F.2d 1535,\\\\n1543-44 (3d Cir.) (Becker, J., concurring), cert. denied,469 U.S. 1017, 105 S.Ct. 431, 83 L.Ed.2d 358 (1984).  As \\\\n326 Pennhurst*326 makes clear, a federal court\\\\'s interest in remedying violations of state law is decidedly minor, so\\\\nthat expending significant federal judicial resources enforcing consent decree provisions that concern only issues\\\\nof state law is rarely justifiable.  Thus, even if the State were willing to agree that any and all provisions of the\\\\nChild Welfare Reform Document would be enforceable in federal court through the consent decree, its\\\\nwillingness to transfer this burden of enforcing its own laws to the federal court \\\"does not oblige the court to\\\\naccept.\\\" Kasper, 814 F.2d at 340.  See also Georgevich v. Strauss, 772 F.2d 1078, 1085 (3d Cir.1985) (en banc), \\\\ncert. denied,475 U.S. 1028, 106 S.Ct. 1229, 89 L.Ed.2d 339 (1986).  Rather, \\\"appropriate consideration must be\\\\ngiven to principles of federalism in determining the availability and scope of equitable relief.\\\" Rizzo v. Goode, 423\\\\nU.S. 362, 379, 96 S.Ct. 598, 608, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976). \\\\n3.  Although a consent decree may save federal judicial resources in the short term, its entry is often only the\\\\nbeginning of extended judicial involvement.  See, e.g., Note, Federalism and Federal Consent Decrees Against\\\\nState Governmental Entities, 88 Colum.L.Rev.  1796, 1807-08 (1988).  Federal courts operate according to\\\\ninstitutional rules and procedures that are poorly suited to the management of state agencies.  See Donald L.\\\\nHorowitz, Decreeing Organizational Change: Judicial Supervision of Public Institutions, 1983 Duke L.J. 1265,\\\\n1303-05.  And consent decrees entered in institutional reform litigation \\\"reach beyond the parties involved directly\\\\nin the suit and impact on the public\\\\'s right to sound and efficient operation of its institutions.\\\" Rufo v. Inmates of\\\\nSuffolk County Jail, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 112 S.Ct. 748, 759, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992).  Therefore, the manner in\\\\nwhich the Child Welfare Reform Document is to be enforced by a court of equity \\\"must be structured to take into\\\\naccount `the well-established rule that the government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the\\\\ndispatch of its own internal affairs.\\\\'\\\" Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1171 (9th Cir.1987), quoting Rizzo, 423\\\\nU.S. at 378-79, 96 S.Ct. at 607-08. \\\\nIV.\\\\nIn conclusion, we have no concern with the parties agreeing that the State\\\\'s enactment of Act One provides a\\\\nsuitable basis for settling this action.  We are concerned that the parties\\\\' serious dispute over the consent\\\\n\\\\ndecree\\\\'s ambiguous enforcement provision reflects an absence of the sufficiently well-defined agreement that is\\\\nan essential predicate to the entry of an appropriate consent decree.  We are also concerned that the district court\\\\ncarefully weigh the constitutional, statutory, and institutional factors that bear upon the task of crafting a suitable\\\\nequitable decree in this type of litigation.  Therefore, we vacate the Consent Decree entered June 8, 1992, and\\\\nremand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \\\\n[*] The HONORABLE BRUCE M. VAN SICKLE, Senior United States District Judge for the District of North\\\\nDakota, sitting by designation. \\\\n[1] Act One established the Child Welfare Compliance and Oversight Committee \\\"to ensure that [DHS] complies\\\\nwith the..

Plaintiff8 John Doe, James Doe and David Doe bring\\nthis action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly\\nsituated, pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal\\nRules of Civil Procedure.  The class consists of all\\njuveniles who are currently, have been or will be In the\\nfuture confined In the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish\\nPrison.\\n20.  The members of the class are so numerous that\\njoinder of all members Is Impracticable.  In addition, there\\nare questions of law and fact common to the members of the\\nplaintiff class regarding practices of the defendants, and\\nthe claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims\\nof the members of the plaintiff class.  Named plaintiffs and\\nthis counsel will fairly and adequately protect the\\ninterests of the members of the class.\\n21.  By their policies, the defendants have acted and\\n8\\n\\ncontinue to act  in a manner generally applicable to the\\nclass, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or\\ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class\\nas a whole.\\n22.  The injuries suffered by the named plaintiffs and\\nthe members of the plaintiff class are a result of the\\npolicies and practices of defendants and are capable of\\nrepetition, yet may evade review, thereby making class\\nrelief appropriate.\\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\\nConditions of Confinement Allegations\\nJuvenile Detention and the Physical Plant\\n23.  The Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office operates\\nseveral secure parish prison facilities in New Orleans,\\nLouisiana.\\n24.  Juveniles are incarcerated in the facility located\\nat 2622 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana.  This\\nfacility is referred to as the Conchetta Facility.  This\\nfacility was not constructed as a separate detention center\\nfor juveniles.  The Conchetta Facility does not provide the\\nenvironment, programs or services that an appropriate\\njuvenile detention center should provide.\\n25.  Defendants incarcerate plaintiffs in dormitories\\non the first, second and third floors of the facility.  Each\\ndormitory consists of a series of triple tier bunk beds\\naround the perimeter of the foom with tables and benches\\n9\\n\\nbolted to the floor in the middle of the room.  There are 5\\ntoilets and 4 showers per dorm.\\n26.  Defendants fail to maintain an environment free\\nfrom vermin and roach infestation.  Juveniles eat in their\\nliving units and store leftovers and commissary items in\\ndirect proximity to their beds, further exacerbating the\\nvermin and roach infestation problems.\\n27.  Defendants fail to provide plaintiffs with\\nadequate basic supplies and appropriate clothing such as\\npillows, bed sheets, deodorant, socks, shoes, underwear and\\nseasonally appropriate clothing to enable plaintiffs to\\nmaintain personal hygiene.  Defendants only provide\\nplaintiffs with a toothbrush, toothpaste, a cup, soap and\\none uniform.  Soap, toilet paper, toothpaste, and\\ntoothbrushes are frequently unavailable.  Plaintiffs are\\nrequired to purchase or otherwise provide themselves with\\nbasic supplies not provided or not available from\\ndefendants.  No exceptions are made for juveniles who cannot\\nafford to purchase or otherwise obtain these basic supplies.\\n28.  Laundry practices in the Conchetta Facility are\\ninadequate to ensure the return of clothing.  As a result,\\njuveniles do not turn in their dirty clothes for laundering\\nand launder them in toilets and sinks.\\n29.  Ventilation, heating, and cooling in the Conchetta\\nFacility are inadequate.  Juveniles often suffer in\\noppressively cold or hot conditions.  The problem is\\n10\\n\\ncompounded by the fact that juveniles are not Issued\\nseasonally appropriate clothing.\\n30.  Defendants do not provide juveniles In the\\nConchetta Facility with meals adequate in quantity and\\nquality.  Food service and food transport practices are\\nunsanitary.  Food is frequently stored on the floor next to\\ndirty linens and garbage awaiting service.\\nSupervision by Staff\\n31.  Defendants have not implemented or promulgated\\nrules and regulations for the proper handling and treatment\\nof children who are detained in the Conchetta Facility.\\nTraining and Supervision of Staff\\n32.  Defendants do not employ Conchetta Facility\\npersonnel who are trained in identifying and responding to\\nproblems of juveniles.  Defendants' failure to employ\\nadequately trained staff results in lack of attention to\\nplaintiffs' problems during confinement, lack of appropriate\\nassessment of plaintiffs' physical, mental, emotional and\\nspiritual needs and lack of remedial programming.  Such\\nfailure subjects plaintiffs to serious harm from\\ninstitutional personnel, other detainees and themselves as\\nwell as neglect for their general well-being.\\n33.  Defendants do not hire program personnel who can\\nrespond to and provide for the needs of plaintiffs in the\\n11\\n\\nConchetta Facility.\\n34.  Defendants do not adequately supervise Conchetta\\nFacility personnel who are responsible for the care of\\nplaintiffs in the Conchetta Facility.\\nClassification\\n35.  Defendants have failed to develop and implement a\\nclassification system for children incarcerated in the\\nConchetta Facility.  As a result, children are arbitrarily\\nand inappropriately housed.\\n36.  Defendants also house on a separate tier children\\nfrom court8 of juvenile jurisdiction other than Orleans\\nParish.\\nMental Health, Dental, and Medical Care\\n37.  Defendants fail to provide adequate medical,\\ndental, or psychological screening or examination for\\nplaintiffs when plaintiffs are taken into custody.\\nDefendants fail to provide regular dental, medical, or\\nmental health services to plaintiffs.  Defendants' suicide\\nintervention and prevention measures are inadequate to\\nappropriately handle suicidal acts and gestures of juveniles\\nin the Conchetta Facility.\\nOvercrowding\\n38.  The Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison is\\n12\\n\\noften overcrowded and fails to provide an adequate\\nenvironment for its juvenile detainees.  Consequently, many\\njuveniles suffer forced idleness.  Juveniles are confined in\\ntheir housing unit all day for months on end with absolutely\\nnothing to do.  Moreover, the level of danger increases\\nsince staff are undertrained and do not monitor properly.\\nAs a result, juveniles act out, become aggressive, fight,\\nand eventually spend long amounts of time in segregation.\\nEducation\\n39.  Defendants do not provide children with any\\nappropriate educational program.  Children go to school\\napproximately 5 hours per week.  Children who are on\\ndisciplinary lock-down do not receive any educational\\nprogram.\\nSpecial Education\\n40.  Defendants fail to properly identify and assess\\nchildren with special education needs and fail to provide\\nappropriate special education and related services to\\nchildren while in the Conchetta Facility.\\nProgramming\\n41.  Defendants do not provide children with any\\nappropriate indoor or outdoor activities while at the\\nConchetta Facility.  Defendants subject plaintiff children\\n13\\n\\nto long periods of forced idleness.  The only activities\\navailable to children in the Conchetta Facility are\\ntelevision, cards, and limited physical exercise.  Exercise\\nconsists of, at best, a one hour period five times per week\\nduring which the only available activity is basketball or\\nmilitary drill type calisthenics.  Basketball consists of a\\nseries of five on five games in which the winning team\\ncontinues to play and the losing team must leave the court.\\nThus, only a few juveniles will engage in the one activity\\navailable during an unrestricted activity period.\\nCalisthenics under military drill type conditions are the\\nonly other physical exercise activity provided.  There are\\nno games, exercise equipment or activities.\\n42.  Defendants fail to provide children incarcerated\\nin the Conchetta Facility with any appropriate reading\\nmaterials.  Defendants prohibit children from having books.\\nThe only reading materials provided are religious pamphlets.\\nChildren are allowed to purchase periodicals from the\\ncommissary or have periodicals mailed to them.  Ho provision\\nis made for juveniles who cannot afford to purchase reading\\nmaterials.\\nVisitation\\n43.  Defendants fail to provide adequate opportunities\\nfor children to have visits from family members and friends.\\nVisitation is only allowed once a week on Saturday mornings\\n14\\n\\nor afternoons.  Visitors must have some form of state issued\\nidentification.  There is no waiting area for visitors\\ninside the facility.  Visitors are required to stand\\noutside, rain or shine, while waiting to visit.  Visits are\\nlimited to 15 minutes per visitor.  Children are not\\nallowed to touch their family members during visits since\\nall visiting is done through a glass partition.  Children\\nwho are on lock-down or are in a unit which is being\\ndisciplined as a group are denied visitors.\\nDiscipline- and Segregation\\n44.  Defendants do not have appropriate policies,\\nprocedures, and training regarding discipline and isolation\\npractices.  As a result, juveniles are subjected to unduly\\nharsh discipline and to long periods of segregation for\\nminor incidents.\\n45.  As a result of defendants' policies, practices,\\nacts and omissions, described herein, plaintiffs'\\nconfinement by defendants in the Conchetta Facility, Orleans\\nParish Prison is cruel, harsh, punitive and oppressive.\\nKnowledge of the Defendants\\n46.  Defendant Charles Foti is the Criminal Sheriff for\\nthe Parish of Orleans, Louisiana.  As such, this defendant\\nis keeper of the parish jail pursuant to Louisiana Revised\\nStatutes S 15:704 and thus responsible for operating the\\n15\\n\\nConchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison and insuring that\\npersons confined therein are properly cared for, fed and\\nclothed.  In such capacity defendant Foti knows or should\\nknow that children are being confined in unconstitutional\\nconditions in the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison.\\nBy allowing said conditions to continue, defendant has\\nbreached his duty and is responsible in part for said\\nconditions.

Defendant Sidney Barthelemy is the Mayor of the\\nCity of New Orleans.  As such, this defendant is\\nresponsible, pursuant to city ordinance, for the expenses of\\noperating a program for pre-adjudicated juveniles in the\\nOrleans Parish Prison and for the expenses of establishing,\\nmaintaining, and operating the Orleans Parish Prison,\\n16\\n\\npursuant to Louisiana Revised Statutes 15t702 and 33x1523.1.\\nIn such capacity defendant Barthelemy knows, or should know,\\nthat children are being confined in unconstitutional\\nconditions in the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison.\\nBy allowing said conditions to continue, defendant has\\nbreached his duty and is responsible in part for said\\nconditions.  This defendant therefore shares responsibility\\nwith other defendants mentioned herein for violations of\\nplaintiffs' constitutional rights.\\n49.

In such capacity, the\\ndefendant school board knows or should know that children\\nincarcerated in Orleans Parish Prison are being denied the\\neducation to which they are entitled.

Given the important federal and state interests at stake, we conclude\\nthat the enforcement provisions of the decree are too ambiguous to be approved. Accordingly, we vacate the\\nconsent decree and remand for further proceedings.\\nI.\\nTen named plaintiffs commenced this class action under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 alleging that the Arkansas Department\\nof Human Services (DHS or the State) administers its child welfare programs in violation of the rights of foster\\nchildren and abused or neglected children under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Adoption Assistance and Child\\nWelfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 620-28, 670-79, and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, 42 U.S.C.\\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 5101-06a. Plaintiffs' ninety-three page complaint asserted, among other things, that DHS and its Division of\\nChildren and Family Services (DCFS) have failed to investigate complaints of abuse and neglect, to make\\nreasonable efforts to keep families together, to provide adequate care to children placed in foster homes, and to\\nproperly train foster parents.\\nOn October 10, 1991, pursuant to a stipulation, the district court certified a class consisting of:\\n323 *323 All children who, since July 1, 1988, have or will become known to DHS by reason of a\\ncomplaint of abuse or neglect, and all children who are now or will be in the custody of DHS as the\\nresult of an emergency 72-hour placement or an abuse, neglect, or Family in Need of Services\\n(FINS) petition.\\nOn February 27, 1992, after months of negotiations, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement\\nand a proposed order. As described in the motion:\\nThe [proposed] Order incorporates by reference the Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document, a\\ndetailed plan governing defendants' operation of [DHS] and [DCFS] in all the major areas\\n\\naddressed by plaintiffs' Complaint, including: out of home placement; health care; staff resources;\\ntraining; family services; child protective services; and case planning and case review.\\nThat same day, the Governor signed into law Act One of the First Extraordinary Session of 1992 (\\\"Act One\\\"),\\nwhich adopted the Child Welfare Reform Document \\\"as the requirements to be met by [DHS] and [DCFS] in their\\noperation of the Child Welfare System in Arkansas.\\\" 1992 Ark. Acts (1st Ex. Sess.) 1, \\u00a7 1(a). Section 1(b) of Act\\nOne directed the State Treasurer to make available such funds \\\"as may be required to meet the requirements of\\nthe Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document,\\\" subject to the following proviso:\\nProvided, however, the State Treasurer shall make no such transfers after June 30, 1992 unless\\nshe receives certification from the Governor that an order has been issued closing the case of \\nAngela R., et al v. Bill Clinton, et al, subject only to being reopened by either party to determine\\ncompliance or noncompliance with the Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document.\\nThe district court tentatively approved the settlement on March 19 and ordered that a fairness hearing be held\\nApril 30. On March 25, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Suter v. Artist M., ___ U.S. ___, ___ n. 10, ___,\\n112 S.Ct. 1360, 1368 n. 10, 1370, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992), holding that 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 671(a)(9) and (15), portions of\\nthe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, do not create private rights enforceable under \\u00a7 1983. The State\\nthen filed a Motion to Review Class Definition, suggesting that Suter \\\"brings into question this Court's subject\\nmatter jurisdiction\\\" and places the court \\\"in a position to enforce state law only, contrary to the holding of \\nPennhurst State School vs. Halderman, [465] U.S. 89, [104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67], and the Eleventh\\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.\\\" In particular, the State argued that Suter and our decision in Doe\\nv. Hennepin County, 858 F.2d 1325 (8th Cir.1988),cert. denied,490 U.S. 1108, 109 S.Ct. 3161, 104 L.Ed.2d\\n1023 (1989), deprived the court of jurisdiction over the claims of class members not in state custody.\\nOn May 5, 1992, the district court denied the State's motion and ordered entry of the proposed order as a\\nconsent decree. The court concluded that Suter does not foreclose all of the claims asserted by all class\\nmembers; that the settlement satisfies the standard articulated in Local 93, International Ass'n of Firefighters v.\\nCity of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986), and therefore the consent decree may\\nafford broader relief than the court could have awarded after trial; and that the State waived its Eleventh\\nAmendment immunity by enacting Act One and by consenting to the decree. The court expressly retained\\njurisdiction \\\"for the purpose of enforcing [the] Order and the Child Welfare Reform Document.\\\" The State appeals\\nthe district court's refusal to narrow the class and its entry of the consent decree.\\nII.\\nPlaintiffs commenced this action to compel the State to comply with federal statutes and the Constitution in\\ndealing with foster children and abused or neglected children. There can be no doubt that the district court had\\njurisdiction to consider these claims. See Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 539-41, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1380-81, 39\\nL.Ed.2d 577 (1974). It is true that the class members who are foster children in the State's custody have stronger\\n324 constitutional claims than abused or neglected children who have not *324 been placed in foster care. See \\nDeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1005-06, 103\\nL.Ed.2d 249 (1989). Compare Norfleet v. Arkansas Dep't of Human Servs., 989 F.2d 289, 292-93 (8th Cir.1993),\\nwith Doe v. Hennepin County, 858 F.2d at 1329. With respect to the statutory claims, Suter held that no class\\nmember may obtain relief for violations of 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 671(a)(9) or (a)(15), and the analysis in Suter might\\nultimately compel the conclusion that the other federal statutes upon which plaintiffs rely do not create an\\nenforceable private right of action on their behalf. But these questions go to the merits of plaintiffs' claims, not to\\nthe district court's jurisdiction. Because Suter does not \\\"inescapably render the claims frivolous,\\\" Koke v. Stifel,\\nNicolaus & Co., 620 F.2d 1340, 1346 (8th Cir.1980), we think it clear that the district court had jurisdiction to\\napprove the proposed settlement and to enter a consent decree resolving the claims of all class members.\\n\\nIII.\\nThe State requests that we set aside portions of the consent decree entered to implement the parties' settlement.\\nAlthough the law favors settlements, federal courts in adopting consent decrees are not mere \\\"`recorder[s] of\\ncontracts' from whom parties can purchase injunctions.\\\" Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 525, 106 S.Ct. at 3077. See \\nDonaghy v. City of Omaha, 933 F.2d 1448, 1459 (8th Cir.1991),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 938, 117\\nL.Ed.2d 109 (1992). Rather, as Justice Cardozo stated in United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 115, 52\\nS.Ct. 460, 462, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932), a consent decree is a judicial act, and \\\"the adopting court is free to reject\\nagreed-upon terms as not in furtherance of statutory objectives.\\\" System Federation v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 651,\\n81 S.Ct. 368, 373, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961). Before approving a class action settlement and entering the requested\\nconsent decree, then, a federal court must determine \\\"that the settlement is consistent with the statute the\\nconsent judgment is to enforce and fairly and reasonably resolves the controversy in a manner consistent with\\nthe public interest.\\\" Citizens for a Better Environment v. Gorsuch, 718 F.2d 1117, 1128 (D.C.Cir.1983),cert.\\ndenied,467 U.S. 1219, 104 S.Ct. 2668, 81 L.Ed.2d 373 (1984).\\nIn this case, the core of the parties' settlement is the Child Welfare Reform Document, a fifty-page document\\nsetting forth specific, detailed mandates to govern the manner in which DHS and DCFS will discharge their\\nresponsibilities to foster children and abused and neglected children under Arkansas law. Neither party has\\nchallenged the substantive provisions contained in this document. By enacting Act One, the State has made the\\nReform Document a part of state law, so there can be little doubt that DHS and DCFS intend to comply with the\\nReform Document's requirements, including those requirements that will benefit children who are not in the\\nState's custody.\\nThus, the dispute in this case involves not the substantive obligations imposed by the settlement, but rather the\\nfuture enforcement of those obligations. The consent decree's enforcement provision is ambiguous:\\nThe Court shall retain jurisdiction of this matter solely for the purpose of enforcing this Order and\\nthe Child Welfare Reform Document.\\nThe Clerk is directed to close this case in his records without prejudice to the rights of the parties\\n[1]\\nto seek enforcement from the Court. If the Compliance and Oversight Committee  has found by\\nmajority vote substantial compliance or noncompliance with the Document, and such finding has,\\nin the opinion of any party, remained disputed and unresolved for at least 90 days then either\\nparty may seek review by the District Court.\\nBy its wording, this provision suggests that only the plaintiffs as a class may seek to enforce the decree and only\\n325 by challenging decisions of the Compliance Committee. *325 Plaintiffs nevertheless assert that any class\\nmember will be entitled to apply to the district court for an order enforcing any provision of the consent decree,\\nincluding the entire Reform Document. In the wake of Suter, the State objects to such a wholesale transfer of\\njurisdiction to the federal court and seeks to limit the damage by removing pre-placement children from the class,\\n[2]\\n while leaving the State's obligations under Act One and the Reform Document intact.\\nFrom the standpoint of judicial administration, this impasse is unacceptable. While the Reform Document is a\\ncontract between the settling parties, it is the enforcement mechanism that makes the consent decree a judicial\\nact. Unless that mechanism is clearly defined 00 in terms of who may bring an enforcement action, for what kinds\\n97\\nof violations, and so forth 00 it is impossible to determine (i) the precise benefits class members are receiving, (ii)\\n97\\nthe extent to which the decree imposes federal control over state functions, or (iii) the burden that approval of the\\ndecree will impose upon the federal judiciary. In this very fundamental respect, the decree fails to set forth its\\nterms with the specificity required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d). See Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U.S. 473, 94 S.Ct. 713, 38\\nL.Ed.2d 661 (1974). We conclude that the district court abused its discretion in approving a consent decree that\\ndid not specifically resolve these enforcement issues.\\nWe therefore remand this case to the district court for further consideration of the proposed settlement. In\\nconsidering whether to approve any amended consent decree, the district court should weigh the following:\\n\\n1. The parties' pre-approval debate over enforcement of the decree suggests that their purported agreement\\nfailed to resolve fundamental remedy issues that are essential to any settlement. Plaintiffs argue that the consent\\ndecree permits any member of the class to enforce the Reform Document in federal court, even if the alleged\\nviolation involves only matters of state law. The State objects that it never consented to such a remedy. In\\nresolving this dispute, the district court must bear in mind that it \\\"is not free.. to impose unagreed-to equitable\\nremedies that it might have fashioned `had the plaintiff established his factual claims and legal theories in\\nlitigation.'\\\" SEC v. Levine, 881 F.2d 1165, 1181 (2d Cir.1989), quoting United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S.\\n673, 682, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971).\\nMoreover, the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from granting relief against state officials for conduct\\nthat violates only state law. Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79\\nL.Ed.2d 67 (1984). While Eleventh Amendment immunity can be waived, such waiver must be unequivocally\\nexpressed. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1360-61, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). For a state\\nstatute to constitute a waiver \\\"it must specify the State's intention to subject itself to suit in federal court.\\\" \\nAtascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 241, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3146-47, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985). See\\nalso Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U.S. 299, 306-08, 110 S.Ct. 1868, 1873-74, 109 L.Ed.2d\\n264 (1990); Burk v. Beene, 948 F.2d 489, 493-94 (8th Cir.1991). Although Act One expressly acknowledges the\\npendency of this litigation, we conclude that it falls considerably short of the \\\"unequivocal waiver\\\" of Eleventh\\nAmendment immunity that Atascadero requires. Thus, Eleventh Amendment concerns make it all the more\\nimportant to ensure that any approved enforcement provisions are the result of a consensual process and are\\nclearly spelled out in the decree.\\n2. Federal courts have interests independent of those of the states in preserving the appropriate relation between\\nsovereigns and in efficiently allocating scarce federal resources to the adjudication of federal claims. See Kasper\\nv. Board of Election Comm'rs, 814 F.2d 332, 340-41 (7th Cir. 1987); Sansom Comm. v. Lynn, 735 F.2d 1535,\\n1543-44 (3d Cir.) (Becker, J., concurring), cert. denied,469 U.S. 1017, 105 S.Ct. 431, 83 L.Ed.2d 358 (1984). As \\n326 Pennhurst*326 makes clear, a federal court's interest in remedying violations of state law is decidedly minor, so\\nthat expending significant federal judicial resources enforcing consent decree provisions that concern only issues\\nof state law is rarely justifiable. Thus, even if the State were willing to agree that any and all provisions of the\\nChild Welfare Reform Document would be enforceable in federal court through the consent decree, its\\nwillingness to transfer this burden of enforcing its own laws to the federal court \\\"does not oblige the court to\\naccept.\\\" Kasper, 814 F.2d at 340. See also Georgevich v. Strauss, 772 F.2d 1078, 1085 (3d Cir.1985) (en banc), \\ncert. denied,475 U.S. 1028, 106 S.Ct. 1229, 89 L.Ed.2d 339 (1986). Rather, \\\"appropriate consideration must be\\ngiven to principles of federalism in determining the availability and scope of equitable relief.\\\" Rizzo v. Goode, 423\\nU.S. 362, 379, 96 S.Ct. 598, 608, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976).\\n3. Although a consent decree may save federal judicial resources in the short term, its entry is often only the\\nbeginning of extended judicial involvement. See, e.g., Note, Federalism and Federal Consent Decrees Against\\nState Governmental Entities, 88 Colum.L.Rev. 1796, 1807-08 (1988). Federal courts operate according to\\ninstitutional rules and procedures that are poorly suited to the management of state agencies. See Donald L.\\nHorowitz, Decreeing Organizational Change: Judicial Supervision of Public Institutions, 1983 Duke L.J. 1265,\\n1303-05. And consent decrees entered in institutional reform litigation \\\"reach beyond the parties involved directly\\nin the suit and impact on the public's right to sound and efficient operation of its institutions.\\\" Rufo v. Inmates of\\nSuffolk County Jail, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 112 S.Ct. 748, 759, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992). Therefore, the manner in\\nwhich the Child Welfare Reform Document is to be enforced by a court of equity \\\"must be structured to take into\\naccount `the well-established rule that the government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the\\ndispatch of its own internal affairs.'\\\" Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1171 (9th Cir.1987), quoting Rizzo, 423\\nU.S. at 378-79, 96 S.Ct. at 607-08.\\nIV.\\nIn conclusion, we have no concern with the parties agreeing that the State's enactment of Act One provides a\\nsuitable basis for settling this action. We are concerned that the parties' serious dispute over the consent\\n\\ndecree's ambiguous enforcement provision reflects an absence of the sufficiently well-defined agreement that is\\nan essential predicate to the entry of an appropriate consent decree. We are also concerned that the district court\\ncarefully weigh the constitutional, statutory, and institutional factors that bear upon the task of crafting a suitable\\nequitable decree in this type of litigation. Therefore, we vacate the Consent Decree entered June 8, 1992, and\\nremand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\\n[*] The HONORABLE BRUCE M.

Plaintiff8 John Doe, James Doe and David Doe bring\\\\nthis action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly\\\\nsituated, pursuant to Rule 23(a) and (b)(2) of the Federal\\\\nRules of Civil Procedure.   The class consists of all\\\\njuveniles who are currently, have been or will be In the\\\\nfuture confined In the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish\\\\nPrison. \\\\n20.   The members of the class are so numerous that\\\\njoinder of all members Is Impracticable.   In addition, there\\\\nare questions of law and fact common to the members of the\\\\nplaintiff class regarding practices of the defendants, and\\\\nthe claims of the named plaintiffs are typical of the claims\\\\nof the members of the plaintiff class.   Named plaintiffs and\\\\nthis counsel will fairly and adequately protect the\\\\ninterests of the members of the class. \\\\n21.   By their policies, the defendants have acted and\\\\n8\\\\n\\\\ncontinue to act  in a manner generally applicable to the\\\\nclass, thereby making appropriate final injunctive relief or\\\\ncorresponding declaratory relief with respect to the class\\\\nas a whole. \\\\n22.   The injuries suffered by the named plaintiffs and\\\\nthe members of the plaintiff class are a result of the\\\\npolicies and practices of defendants and are capable of\\\\nrepetition, yet may evade review, thereby making class\\\\nrelief appropriate. \\\\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\\\\nConditions of Confinement Allegations\\\\nJuvenile Detention and the Physical Plant\\\\n23.   The Orleans Parish Sheriff\\\\'s Office operates\\\\nseveral secure parish prison facilities in New Orleans,\\\\nLouisiana. \\\\n24.   Juveniles are incarcerated in the facility located\\\\nat 2622 Tulane Avenue, New Orleans, Louisiana.   This\\\\nfacility is referred to as the Conchetta Facility.   This\\\\nfacility was not constructed as a separate detention center\\\\nfor juveniles.   The Conchetta Facility does not provide the\\\\nenvironment, programs or services that an appropriate\\\\njuvenile detention center should provide. \\\\n25.   Defendants incarcerate plaintiffs in dormitories\\\\non the first, second and third floors of the facility.   Each\\\\ndormitory consists of a series of triple tier bunk beds\\\\naround the perimeter of the foom with tables and benches\\\\n9\\\\n\\\\nbolted to the floor in the middle of the room.   There are 5\\\\ntoilets and 4 showers per dorm. \\\\n26.   Defendants fail to maintain an environment free\\\\nfrom vermin and roach infestation.   Juveniles eat in their\\\\nliving units and store leftovers and commissary items in\\\\ndirect proximity to their beds, further exacerbating the\\\\nvermin and roach infestation problems. \\\\n27.   Defendants fail to provide plaintiffs with\\\\nadequate basic supplies and appropriate clothing such as\\\\npillows, bed sheets, deodorant, socks, shoes, underwear and\\\\nseasonally appropriate clothing to enable plaintiffs to\\\\nmaintain personal hygiene.   Defendants only provide\\\\nplaintiffs with a toothbrush, toothpaste, a cup, soap and\\\\none uniform.   Soap, toilet paper, toothpaste, and\\\\ntoothbrushes are frequently unavailable.   Plaintiffs are\\\\nrequired to purchase or otherwise provide themselves with\\\\nbasic supplies not provided or not available from\\\\ndefendants.   No exceptions are made for juveniles who cannot\\\\nafford to purchase or otherwise obtain these basic supplies. \\\\n28.   Laundry practices in the Conchetta Facility are\\\\ninadequate to ensure the return of clothing.   As a result,\\\\njuveniles do not turn in their dirty clothes for laundering\\\\nand launder them in toilets and sinks. \\\\n29.   Ventilation, heating, and cooling in the Conchetta\\\\nFacility are inadequate.   Juveniles often suffer in\\\\noppressively cold or hot conditions.   The problem is\\\\n10\\\\n\\\\ncompounded by the fact that juveniles are not Issued\\\\nseasonally appropriate clothing. \\\\n30.   Defendants do not provide juveniles In the\\\\nConchetta Facility with meals adequate in quantity and\\\\nquality.   Food service and food transport practices are\\\\nunsanitary.   Food is frequently stored on the floor next to\\\\ndirty linens and garbage awaiting service. \\\\nSupervision by Staff\\\\n31.   Defendants have not implemented or promulgated\\\\nrules and regulations for the proper handling and treatment\\\\nof children who are detained in the Conchetta Facility. \\\\nTraining and Supervision of Staff\\\\n32.   Defendants do not employ Conchetta Facility\\\\npersonnel who are trained in identifying and responding to\\\\nproblems of juveniles.   Defendants\\\\' failure to employ\\\\nadequately trained staff results in lack of attention to\\\\nplaintiffs\\\\' problems during confinement, lack of appropriate\\\\nassessment of plaintiffs\\\\' physical, mental, emotional and\\\\nspiritual needs and lack of remedial programming.   Such\\\\nfailure subjects plaintiffs to serious harm from\\\\ninstitutional personnel, other detainees and themselves as\\\\nwell as neglect for their general well-being. \\\\n33.   Defendants do not hire program personnel who can\\\\nrespond to and provide for the needs of plaintiffs in the\\\\n11\\\\n\\\\nConchetta Facility. \\\\n34.   Defendants do not adequately supervise Conchetta\\\\nFacility personnel who are responsible for the care of\\\\nplaintiffs in the Conchetta Facility. \\\\nClassification\\\\n35.   Defendants have failed to develop and implement a\\\\nclassification system for children incarcerated in the\\\\nConchetta Facility.   As a result, children are arbitrarily\\\\nand inappropriately housed. \\\\n36.   Defendants also house on a separate tier children\\\\nfrom court8 of juvenile jurisdiction other than Orleans\\\\nParish. \\\\nMental Health, Dental, and Medical Care\\\\n37.   Defendants fail to provide adequate medical,\\\\ndental, or psychological screening or examination for\\\\nplaintiffs when plaintiffs are taken into custody. \\\\nDefendants fail to provide regular dental, medical, or\\\\nmental health services to plaintiffs.   Defendants\\\\' suicide\\\\nintervention and prevention measures are inadequate to\\\\nappropriately handle suicidal acts and gestures of juveniles\\\\nin the Conchetta Facility. \\\\nOvercrowding\\\\n38.   The Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison is\\\\n12\\\\n\\\\noften overcrowded and fails to provide an adequate\\\\nenvironment for its juvenile detainees.   Consequently, many\\\\njuveniles suffer forced idleness.   Juveniles are confined in\\\\ntheir housing unit all day for months on end with absolutely\\\\nnothing to do.   Moreover, the level of danger increases\\\\nsince staff are undertrained and do not monitor properly. \\\\nAs a result, juveniles act out, become aggressive, fight,\\\\nand eventually spend long amounts of time in segregation. \\\\nEducation\\\\n39.   Defendants do not provide children with any\\\\nappropriate educational program.   Children go to school\\\\napproximately 5 hours per week.  Children who are on\\\\ndisciplinary lock-down do not receive any educational\\\\nprogram. \\\\nSpecial Education\\\\n40.   Defendants fail to properly identify and assess\\\\nchildren with special education needs and fail to provide\\\\nappropriate special education and related services to\\\\nchildren while in the Conchetta Facility. \\\\nProgramming\\\\n41.   Defendants do not provide children with any\\\\nappropriate indoor or outdoor activities while at the\\\\nConchetta Facility.   Defendants subject plaintiff children\\\\n13\\\\n\\\\nto long periods of forced idleness.   The only activities\\\\navailable to children in the Conchetta Facility are\\\\ntelevision, cards, and limited physical exercise.   Exercise\\\\nconsists of, at best, a one hour period five times per week\\\\nduring which the only available activity is basketball or\\\\nmilitary drill type calisthenics.   Basketball consists of a\\\\nseries of five on five games in which the winning team\\\\ncontinues to play and the losing team must leave the court.\\\\nThus, only a few juveniles will engage in the one activity\\\\navailable during an unrestricted activity period. \\\\nCalisthenics under military drill type conditions are the\\\\nonly other physical exercise activity provided.   There are\\\\nno games, exercise equipment or activities. \\\\n42.   Defendants fail to provide children incarcerated\\\\nin the Conchetta Facility with any appropriate reading\\\\nmaterials.   Defendants prohibit children from having books. \\\\nThe only reading materials provided are religious pamphlets. \\\\nChildren are allowed to purchase periodicals from the\\\\ncommissary or have periodicals mailed to them.   Ho provision\\\\nis made for juveniles who cannot afford to purchase reading\\\\nmaterials. \\\\nVisitation\\\\n43.   Defendants fail to provide adequate opportunities\\\\nfor children to have visits from family members and friends. \\\\nVisitation is only allowed once a week on Saturday mornings\\\\n14\\\\n\\\\nor afternoons.   Visitors must have some form of state issued\\\\nidentification.   There is no waiting area for visitors\\\\ninside the facility.   Visitors are required to stand\\\\noutside, rain or shine, while waiting to visit.   Visits are\\\\nlimited to 15 minutes per visitor.   Children are not\\\\nallowed to touch their family members during visits since\\\\nall visiting is done through a glass partition.   Children\\\\nwho are on lock-down or are in a unit which is being\\\\ndisciplined as a group are denied visitors. \\\\nDiscipline- and Segregation\\\\n44.   Defendants do not have appropriate policies,\\\\nprocedures, and training regarding discipline and isolation\\\\npractices.   As a result, juveniles are subjected to unduly\\\\nharsh discipline and to long periods of segregation for\\\\nminor incidents. \\\\n45.   As a result of defendants\\\\' policies, practices,\\\\nacts and omissions, described herein, plaintiffs\\\\'\\\\nconfinement by defendants in the Conchetta Facility, Orleans\\\\nParish Prison is cruel, harsh, punitive and oppressive. \\\\nKnowledge of the Defendants\\\\n46.   Defendant Charles Foti is the Criminal Sheriff for\\\\nthe Parish of Orleans, Louisiana.   As such, this defendant\\\\nis keeper of the parish jail pursuant to Louisiana Revised\\\\nStatutes S 15:704 and thus responsible for operating the\\\\n15\\\\n\\\\nConchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison and insuring that\\\\npersons confined therein are properly cared for, fed and\\\\nclothed.   In such capacity defendant Foti knows or should\\\\nknow that children are being confined in unconstitutional\\\\nconditions in the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison. \\\\nBy allowing said conditions to continue, defendant has\\\\nbreached his duty and is responsible in part for said\\\\nconditions.

Defendant Earl Weaver, Jr. is the Warden of the\\\\nConchetta Facility.   As such, this defendant is responsible\\\\nfor the day-to-day operation of the facility.   In such\\\\ncapacity defendant Weaver knows or should know that children\\\\nare being confined in unconstitutional conditions in the\\\\nConchetta Facility.

In such capacity, the\\\\ndefendant school board knows or should know that children\\\\nincarcerated in Orleans Parish Prison are being denied the\\\\neducation to which they are entitled.   By allowing said\\\\nconditions to continue, defendant has breached its duty and\\\\nis responsible in part for said conditions.   This defendant\\\\ntherefore shares responsibility with other defendants\\\\n17\\\\n\\\\nmentioned herein for violations of plaintiffs constitutional\\\\nrightB. \\\\n50.   Defendants Anita H.

In such capacity defendants know or should know that\\\\nchildren are being confined in unconstitutional conditions\\\\nin the Conchetta Facility, Orleans Parish Prison.  By\\\\nallowing said conditions to continue, defendants have\\\\nbreached their duty and are responsible in part for said\\\\nconditions.  These defendants therefore share responsibility\\\\nwith other defendants mentioned herein for violations of\\\\nplaintiffs constitutional rights. \\\\n51.   Defendant Richard L. Stalder, as Secretary of the\\\\n18\\\\n\\\\nDepartment of Public Safety and Corrections for the State of\\\\nLouisiana, is responsible pursuant to Louisiana Revised\\\\nStatutes S 36t403 for the policies, administration control\\\\nand operation of the functions, programs and affairs of the\\\\nDepartment of Public Safety and Corrections.

Matthews, San Francisco, CA, argued (William L. Grimm, San Francisco, CA, Griffin J.

Given the important federal and state interests at stake, we conclude\\\\nthat the enforcement provisions of the decree are too ambiguous to be approved.  Accordingly, we vacate the\\\\nconsent decree and remand for further proceedings. \\\\nI. \\\\nTen named plaintiffs commenced this class action under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983 alleging that the Arkansas Department\\\\nof Human Services (DHS or the State) administers its child welfare programs in violation of the rights of foster\\\\nchildren and abused or neglected children under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Adoption Assistance and Child\\\\nWelfare Act of 1980, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 620-28, 670-79, and the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, 42 U.S.C.\\\\n\\u00a7\\u00a7 5101-06a.  Plaintiffs\\\\' ninety-three page complaint asserted, among other things, that DHS and its Division of\\\\nChildren and Family Services (DCFS) have failed to investigate complaints of abuse and neglect, to make\\\\nreasonable efforts to keep families together, to provide adequate care to children placed in foster homes, and to\\\\nproperly train foster parents. \\\\nOn October 10, 1991, pursuant to a stipulation, the district court certified a class consisting of:\\\\n323 *323 All children who, since July 1, 1988, have or will become known to DHS by reason of a\\\\ncomplaint of abuse or neglect, and all children who are now or will be in the custody of DHS as the\\\\nresult of an emergency 72-hour placement or an abuse, neglect, or Family in Need of Services\\\\n(FINS) petition. \\\\nOn February 27, 1992, after months of negotiations, the parties filed a Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement\\\\nand a proposed order.  As described in the motion:\\\\nThe [proposed] Order incorporates by reference the Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document, a\\\\ndetailed plan governing defendants\\\\' operation of [DHS] and [DCFS] in all the major areas\\\\n\\\\naddressed by plaintiffs\\\\' Complaint, including: out of home placement; health care; staff resources;\\\\ntraining; family services; child protective services; and case planning and case review. \\\\nThat same day, the Governor signed into law Act One of the First Extraordinary Session of 1992 (\\\"Act One\\\"),\\\\nwhich adopted the Child Welfare Reform Document \\\"as the requirements to be met by [DHS] and [DCFS] in their\\\\noperation of the Child Welfare System in Arkansas.\\\" 1992 Ark. Acts (1st Ex. Sess.) 1, \\u00a7 1(a).  Section 1(b) of Act\\\\nOne directed the State Treasurer to make available such funds \\\"as may be required to meet the requirements of\\\\nthe Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document,\\\" subject to the following proviso:\\\\nProvided, however, the State Treasurer shall make no such transfers after June 30, 1992 unless\\\\nshe receives certification from the Governor that an order has been issued closing the case of \\\\nAngela R., et al v. Bill Clinton, et al, subject only to being reopened by either party to determine\\\\ncompliance or noncompliance with the Arkansas Child Welfare Reform Document. \\\\nThe district court tentatively approved the settlement on March 19 and ordered that a fairness hearing be held\\\\nApril 30.  On March 25, the Supreme Court issued its decision in Suter v. Artist M., ___ U.S. ___, ___ n. 10, ___,\\\\n112 S.Ct. 1360, 1368 n. 10, 1370, 118 L.Ed.2d 1 (1992), holding that 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 671(a)(9) and (15), portions of\\\\nthe Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, do not create private rights enforceable under \\u00a7 1983.  The State\\\\nthen filed a Motion to Review Class Definition, suggesting that Suter \\\"brings into question this Court\\\\'s subject\\\\nmatter jurisdiction\\\" and places the court \\\"in a position to enforce state law only, contrary to the holding of \\\\nPennhurst State School vs. Halderman, [465] U.S. 89, [104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67], and the Eleventh\\\\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.\\\" In particular, the State argued that Suter and our decision in Doe\\\\nv. Hennepin County, 858 F.2d 1325 (8th Cir.1988),cert. denied,490 U.S. 1108, 109 S.Ct. 3161, 104 L.Ed.2d\\\\n1023 (1989), deprived the court of jurisdiction over the claims of class members not in state custody. \\\\nOn May 5, 1992, the district court denied the State\\\\'s motion and ordered entry of the proposed order as a\\\\nconsent decree.  The court concluded that Suter does not foreclose all of the claims asserted by all class\\\\nmembers; that the settlement satisfies the standard articulated in Local 93, International Ass\\\\'n of Firefighters v.\\\\nCity of Cleveland, 478 U.S. 501, 106 S.Ct. 3063, 92 L.Ed.2d 405 (1986), and therefore the consent decree may\\\\nafford broader relief than the court could have awarded after trial; and that the State waived its Eleventh\\\\nAmendment immunity by enacting Act One and by consenting to the decree.  The court expressly retained\\\\njurisdiction \\\"for the purpose of enforcing [the] Order and the Child Welfare Reform Document.\\\" The State appeals\\\\nthe district court\\\\'s refusal to narrow the class and its entry of the consent decree. \\\\nII. \\\\nPlaintiffs commenced this action to compel the State to comply with federal statutes and the Constitution in\\\\ndealing with foster children and abused or neglected children.  There can be no doubt that the district court had\\\\njurisdiction to consider these claims.  See Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U.S. 528, 539-41, 94 S.Ct. 1372, 1380-81, 39\\\\nL.Ed.2d 577 (1974).  It is true that the class members who are foster children in the State\\\\'s custody have stronger\\\\n324 constitutional claims than abused or neglected children who have not *324 been placed in foster care.  See \\\\nDeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep\\\\'t of Social Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199-200, 109 S.Ct. 998, 1005-06, 103\\\\nL.Ed.2d 249 (1989).  Compare Norfleet v. Arkansas Dep\\\\'t of Human Servs., 989 F.2d 289, 292-93 (8th Cir.1993),\\\\nwith Doe v. Hennepin County, 858 F.2d at 1329.  With respect to the statutory claims, Suter held that no class\\\\nmember may obtain relief for violations of 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 671(a)(9) or (a)(15), and the analysis in Suter might\\\\nultimately compel the conclusion that the other federal statutes upon which plaintiffs rely do not create an\\\\nenforceable private right of action on their behalf.  But these questions go to the merits of plaintiffs\\\\' claims, not to\\\\nthe district court\\\\'s jurisdiction.  Because Suter does not \\\"inescapably render the claims frivolous,\\\" Koke v. Stifel,\\\\nNicolaus & Co., 620 F.2d 1340, 1346 (8th Cir.1980), we think it clear that the district court had jurisdiction to\\\\napprove the proposed settlement and to enter a consent decree resolving the claims of all class members. \\\\n\\\\nIII.\\\\nThe State requests that we set aside portions of the consent decree entered to implement the parties\\\\' settlement. \\\\nAlthough the law favors settlements, federal courts in adopting consent decrees are not mere \\\"`recorder[s] of\\\\ncontracts\\\\' from whom parties can purchase injunctions.\\\" Firefighters, 478 U.S. at 525, 106 S.Ct. at 3077.  See \\\\nDonaghy v. City of Omaha, 933 F.2d 1448, 1459 (8th Cir.1991),cert. denied,___ U.S. ___, 112 S.Ct. 938, 117\\\\nL.Ed.2d 109 (1992).  Rather, as Justice Cardozo stated in United States v. Swift & Co., 286 U.S. 106, 115, 52\\\\nS.Ct. 460, 462, 76 L.Ed. 999 (1932), a consent decree is a judicial act, and \\\"the adopting court is free to reject\\\\nagreed-upon terms as not in furtherance of statutory objectives.\\\" System Federation v. Wright, 364 U.S. 642, 651,\\\\n81 S.Ct. 368, 373, 5 L.Ed.2d 349 (1961).  Before approving a class action settlement and entering the requested\\\\nconsent decree, then, a federal court must determine \\\"that the settlement is consistent with the statute the\\\\nconsent judgment is to enforce and fairly and reasonably resolves the controversy in a manner consistent with\\\\nthe public interest.\\\" Citizens for a Better Environment v. Gorsuch, 718 F.2d 1117, 1128 (D.C.Cir.1983),cert.\\\\ndenied,467 U.S. 1219, 104 S.Ct. 2668, 81 L.Ed.2d 373 (1984). \\\\nIn this case, the core of the parties\\\\' settlement is the Child Welfare Reform Document, a fifty-page document\\\\nsetting forth specific, detailed mandates to govern the manner in which DHS and DCFS will discharge their\\\\nresponsibilities to foster children and abused and neglected children under Arkansas law. Neither party has\\\\nchallenged the substantive provisions contained in this document.  By enacting Act One, the State has made the\\\\nReform Document a part of state law, so there can be little doubt that DHS and DCFS intend to comply with the\\\\nReform Document\\\\'s requirements, including those requirements that will benefit children who are not in the\\\\nState\\\\'s custody. \\\\nThus, the dispute in this case involves not the substantive obligations imposed by the settlement, but rather the\\\\nfuture enforcement of those obligations.  The consent decree\\\\'s enforcement provision is ambiguous:\\\\nThe Court shall retain jurisdiction of this matter solely for the purpose of enforcing this Order and\\\\nthe Child Welfare Reform Document. \\\\nThe Clerk is directed to close this case in his records without prejudice to the rights of the parties\\\\n[1]\\\\nto seek enforcement from the Court. If the Compliance and Oversight Committee  has found by\\\\nmajority vote substantial compliance or noncompliance with the Document, and such finding has,\\\\nin the opinion of any party, remained disputed and unresolved for at least 90 days then either\\\\nparty may seek review by the District Court.\\\\nBy its wording, this provision suggests that only the plaintiffs as a class may seek to enforce the decree and only\\\\n325 by challenging decisions of the Compliance Committee.  *325 Plaintiffs nevertheless assert that any class\\\\nmember will be entitled to apply to the district court for an order enforcing any provision of the consent decree,\\\\nincluding the entire Reform Document.  In the wake of Suter, the State objects to such a wholesale transfer of\\\\njurisdiction to the federal court and seeks to limit the damage by removing pre-placement children from the class,\\\\n[2]\\\\n while leaving the State\\\\'s obligations under Act One and the Reform Document intact. \\\\nFrom the standpoint of judicial administration, this impasse is unacceptable.  While the Reform Document is a\\\\ncontract between the settling parties, it is the enforcement mechanism that makes the consent decree a judicial\\\\nact.  Unless that mechanism is clearly defined 00 in terms of who may bring an enforcement action, for what kinds\\\\n97\\\\nof violations, and so forth 00 it is impossible to determine (i) the precise benefits class members are receiving, (ii)\\\\n97\\\\nthe extent to which the decree imposes federal control over state functions, or (iii) the burden that approval of the\\\\ndecree will impose upon the federal judiciary.  In this very fundamental respect, the decree fails to set forth its\\\\nterms with the specificity required by Fed.R.Civ.P.  65(d).  See Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U.S. 473, 94 S.Ct. 713, 38\\\\nL.Ed.2d 661 (1974).  We conclude that the district court abused its discretion in approving a consent decree that\\\\ndid not specifically resolve these enforcement issues. \\\\nWe therefore remand this case to the district court for further consideration of the proposed settlement.  In\\\\nconsidering whether to approve any amended consent decree, the district court should weigh the following:\\\\n\\\\n1.  The parties\\\\' pre-approval debate over enforcement of the decree suggests that their purported agreement\\\\nfailed to resolve fundamental remedy issues that are essential to any settlement.  Plaintiffs argue that the consent\\\\ndecree permits any member of the class to enforce the Reform Document in federal court, even if the alleged\\\\nviolation involves only matters of state law. The State objects that it never consented to such a remedy.  In\\\\nresolving this dispute, the district court must bear in mind that it \\\"is not free.. to impose unagreed-to equitable\\\\nremedies that it might have fashioned `had the plaintiff established his factual claims and legal theories in\\\\nlitigation.\\\\'\\\" SEC v. Levine, 881 F.2d 1165, 1181 (2d Cir.1989), quoting United States v. Armour & Co., 402 U.S.\\\\n673, 682, 91 S.Ct. 1752, 1757, 29 L.Ed.2d 256 (1971). \\\\nMoreover, the Eleventh Amendment prohibits a federal court from granting relief against state officials for conduct\\\\nthat violates only state law. Pennhurst State School & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79\\\\nL.Ed.2d 67 (1984).  While Eleventh Amendment immunity can be waived, such waiver must be unequivocally\\\\nexpressed.  Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 673, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1360-61, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974).  For a state\\\\nstatute to constitute a waiver \\\"it must specify the State\\\\'s intention to subject itself to suit in federal court.\\\" \\\\nAtascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 241, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3146-47, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985).  See\\\\nalso Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corp. v. Feeney, 495 U.S. 299, 306-08, 110 S.Ct. 1868, 1873-74, 109 L.Ed.2d\\\\n264 (1990); Burk v. Beene, 948 F.2d 489, 493-94 (8th Cir.1991).  Although Act One expressly acknowledges the\\\\npendency of this litigation, we conclude that it falls considerably short of the \\\"unequivocal waiver\\\" of Eleventh\\\\nAmendment immunity that Atascadero requires.  Thus, Eleventh Amendment concerns make it all the more\\\\nimportant to ensure that any approved enforcement provisions are the result of a consensual process and are\\\\nclearly spelled out in the decree. \\\\n2.  Federal courts have interests independent of those of the states in preserving the appropriate relation between\\\\nsovereigns and in efficiently allocating scarce federal resources to the adjudication of federal claims.  See Kasper\\\\nv. Board of Election Comm\\\\'rs, 814 F.2d 332, 340-41 (7th Cir. 1987); Sansom Comm. v. Lynn, 735 F.2d 1535,\\\\n1543-44 (3d Cir.) (Becker, J., concurring), cert. denied,469 U.S. 1017, 105 S.Ct. 431, 83 L.Ed.2d 358 (1984).  As \\\\n326 Pennhurst*326 makes clear, a federal court\\\\'s interest in remedying violations of state law is decidedly minor, so\\\\nthat expending significant federal judicial resources enforcing consent decree provisions that concern only issues\\\\nof state law is rarely justifiable.  Thus, even if the State were willing to agree that any and all provisions of the\\\\nChild Welfare Reform Document would be enforceable in federal court through the consent decree, its\\\\nwillingness to transfer this burden of enforcing its own laws to the federal court \\\"does not oblige the court to\\\\naccept.\\\" Kasper, 814 F.2d at 340.  See also Georgevich v. Strauss, 772 F.2d 1078, 1085 (3d Cir.1985) (en banc), \\\\ncert. denied,475 U.S. 1028, 106 S.Ct. 1229, 89 L.Ed.2d 339 (1986).  Rather, \\\"appropriate consideration must be\\\\ngiven to principles of federalism in determining the availability and scope of equitable relief.\\\" Rizzo v. Goode, 423\\\\nU.S. 362, 379, 96 S.Ct. 598, 608, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976). \\\\n3.  Although a consent decree may save federal judicial resources in the short term, its entry is often only the\\\\nbeginning of extended judicial involvement.  See, e.g., Note, Federalism and Federal Consent Decrees Against\\\\nState Governmental Entities, 88 Colum.L.Rev.  1796, 1807-08 (1988).  Federal courts operate according to\\\\ninstitutional rules and procedures that are poorly suited to the management of state agencies.  See Donald L.\\\\nHorowitz, Decreeing Organizational Change: Judicial Supervision of Public Institutions, 1983 Duke L.J. 1265,\\\\n1303-05.  And consent decrees entered in institutional reform litigation \\\"reach beyond the parties involved directly\\\\nin the suit and impact on the public\\\\'s right to sound and efficient operation of its institutions.\\\" Rufo v. Inmates of\\\\nSuffolk County Jail, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 112 S.Ct. 748, 759, 116 L.Ed.2d 867 (1992).  Therefore, the manner in\\\\nwhich the Child Welfare Reform Document is to be enforced by a court of equity \\\"must be structured to take into\\\\naccount `the well-established rule that the government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the\\\\ndispatch of its own internal affairs.\\\\'\\\" Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1171 (9th Cir.1987), quoting Rizzo, 423\\\\nU.S. at 378-79, 96 S.Ct. at 607-08. \\\\nIV.\\\\nIn conclusion, we have no concern with the parties agreeing that the State\\\\'s enactment of Act One provides a\\\\nsuitable basis for settling this action.  We are concerned that the parties\\\\' serious dispute over the consent\\\\n\\\\ndecree\\\\'s ambiguous enforcement provision reflects an absence of the sufficiently well-defined agreement that is\\\\nan essential predicate to the entry of an appropriate consent decree.  We are also concerned that the district court\\\\ncarefully weigh the constitutional, statutory, and institutional factors that bear upon the task of crafting a suitable\\\\nequitable decree in this type of litigation.  Therefore, we vacate the Consent Decree entered June 8, 1992, and\\\\nremand this case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. \\\\n[*] The HONORABLE BRUCE M.
