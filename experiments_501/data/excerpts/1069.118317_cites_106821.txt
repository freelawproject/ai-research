 Since 1988, it has administered a tuition prepayment program designed to provide individuals with sufficient funds to cover future college expenses.  College Savings brought a patent infringement action against Florida Prepaid in United States District Court in New Jersey.  That action is the subject of today’s decision in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. College Savings Bank, ante, p. 627.  In addition, and in the same court, College Savings filed the instant action alleging that Florida Prepaid violated § 43(a) of the Lanham Act by making misstatements about its own tuition savings plans in its brochures and annual reports. Florida Prepaid moved to dismiss this action on the ground that it was barred by sovereign immunity.  It argued that Congress had not abrogated sovereign immunity in this case because the TRCA was enacted pursuant to Congress’s powers under Article I of the Constitution and, under our decisions in Seminole Tribe, supra, and Fitzpatrick, supra, Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity only when it legislates to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.  The United States intervened to defend the constitutionality of the TRCA.  Both it and College Savings argued that, under the doctrine of constructive waiver articulated in Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964), Florida Prepaid had waived its immunity from Lan-ham Act suits by engaging in the interstate marketing and administration of its program after the TRCA made clear that such activity would subject Florida Prepaid to suit.  College Savings also argued that Congress’s purported abrogation of Florida Prepaid’s sovereign immunity in the TRCA *672 was effective, since it was enacted not merely pursuant to Article I but also to enforce the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The District Court rejected both of these arguments and granted Florida Prepaid’s motion to dismiss.  948 F. Supp. 400 (N. J. 1996).  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  181 F. 3d 353 (CA3 1997).  We granted certiorari.

 Thus, a State does not consent to suit in federal court merely by consenting to suit in the courts of its own creation.  Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436 , 441—445 (1900).  Nor does it consent to suit in federal court merely by stating its intention to “sue and be sued,” Florida Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Servs. v. Florida Nursing Home Assn., 450 U. S. 147, 149-150 (1981) (per curiam), or even by authorizing suits against it “‘in any court of competent jurisdiction,’ ” Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Common, 327 U. S. 573, 577-579 (1946).  We have even held that a State may, absent any contractual commitment to the contrary, alter the conditions of its waiver and apply those changes to a pending suit.  Beers v. Arkansas, supra. There is no suggestion here that respondent Florida Prepaid expressly consented to being sued in federal court. Nor is this a ease in which the State has affirmatively invoked our jurisdiction.  Rather, petitioner College Savings and the United States both maintain that Florida Prepaid has "impliedly” or “constructively” waived its immunity from Lanham Act suit.  They do so on the authority of Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964)— an elliptical opinion that stands at the nadir of our waiver (and, for that matter, sovereign-immunity) jurisprudence.  In <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , we permitted employees of a railroad owned and operated by Alabama to bring an action under the Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) against their employer.  Despite the absence of any provision in the statute specifically referring to the States, we held that the Act authorized suits against the States by virtue of its general provision subjecting to suit "[e]very common carrier by railroad .  .  .  *677 engaging in commerce between .  .  .  the several States,” 45 U. S. C. §51 (1940 ed.).  We further held that Alabama had waived its immunity from FELA suit even though Alabama law expressly disavowed any such waiver: “By enacting the [FELA]... Congress conditioned the right to operate a railroad in interstate commerce upon amenability to suit in federal court as provided by the Act; by.  thereafter operating a railroad in interstate commerce, Alabama must be taken to have accepted that condition and thus to have consented to suit.” <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> .  The four dissenting Justices in <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> refused to infer a waiver because Congress had not “expressly declared” that a State operating in commerce would be subject to liability, but they went on to acknowledge — in a concession that, strictly speaking, was not necessary to their analysis — that Congress possessed the power to effect such a waiver of the State’s constitutionally protected immunity so long as it did so with clarity.  <citedDecision>Id., at 198-200</citedDecision> (opinion of White, J.).  Only nine years later, in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279 (1973), we began to retreat from <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> .  That case held — in an opinion written by one of the <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> dissenters over the solitary dissent of Parderis author — that the State of Missouri was immune from a suit brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act by employees of its state health facilities.  Although the statute specifically covered the state hospitals in question, see 29 U. S. C. § 203 (d) (1964 ed.), and such coverage was unquestionably enforceable in federal court by the United States, 411 U. S., at 285-286 , we did not think that the statute expressed with clarity Congress’s intention to supersede the States’ immunity from suits brought by individuals.  We “put to one side” the <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> case, which we characterized as involving “dramatic circumstances” and “a rather isolated state activity,” *678 411 U. S., at 285 , unlike the provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act in question that applied to a broad class of state employees.  We also distinguished the railroad in <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> on the ground that it was “operated for profit” “in the area where private persons and corporations normally ran the enterprise.” 411 U. S., at 284 .  Justice Marshall, joined by Justice Stewart, went even further, concluding that although, in their view, Congress had clearly purported to subject the States to suits by individuals in federal courts, it lacked the constitutional authority to do so. Id., at 287, 289-290 (opinion concurring in result).  The next year, we observed (in dictum) that there is “no place” for the doctrine of constructive waiver in our sovereign-immunity jurisprudence, and we emphasized that we would “find waiver only where stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.” Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 673 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Several Terms later, in Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468 (1987), although we expressly avoided addressing the constitutionality of Congress’s conditioning a State’s engaging in Commerce Clause activity upon the State’s waiver of sovereign immunity, we said there was “no doubt that Parden’s discussion of congressional intent to negate Eleventh Amendment immunity is no longer good law,” and overruled <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> “to the extent [it] is inconsistent with the requirement that an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity by Congress must be expressed in unmistakably clear language,” 483 U. S., at 478 , and n. 8.  2 *679 College Savings and the United States concede, as they surely must, that these intervening decisions have seriously limited the holding of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> .  They maintain, however, that Employees and Welch are distinguishable, and that a core principle of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> remains good law. A Parden-style waiver of immunity, they say, is still possible after Employees and Welch so long as the following two conditions are satisfied: First, Congress must provide unambiguously that the State will be subject to suit if it engages in certain specified conduct governed by federal regulation.  Second, the State must voluntarily elect to engage in the federally regulated conduct that subjects it to suit.  In this latter regard, their argument goes, a State is never deemed to have constructively waived its sovereign immunity by engaging in activities that it cannot realistically choose to abandon, such *680 as the operation of a police force; but constructive waiver is appropriate where a State runs an enterprise for profit, operates in a field traditionally occupied by private persons or corporations, engages in activities sufficiently removed from “core [state] functions,” Reply Brief for United States 3, or otherwise acts as a “market participant” in interstate commerce, cf. White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204, 206-208 (1983).  On this theory, Florida Prepaid constructively waived its immunity from suit by engaging in the voluntary and nonessential activity of selling and advertising a for-profit educational investment vehicle in interstate commerce after being put on notice by the clear language of the TRCA that it would be subject to Lanham Act liability for doing so. We think that the constructive-waiver experiment of Par-den was ill conceived, and see no merit in attempting to salvage any remnant of it.  As we explain below in detail, <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> broke sharply with prior eases, and is fundamentally incompatible with later ones.  We have never applied the holding of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> to another statute, and in fact have narrowed the case in every subsequent opinion in which it has been under consideration.  In short, <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> stands as an anomaly in the jurisprudence of sovereign immunity, and indeed in the jurisprudence of constitutional law. Today, we drop the other shoe: Whatever may remain of our decision in <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> is expressly overruled.  To begin with, we eannot square <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> with our cases requiring that a State’s express waiver of sovereign immunity be unequivocal.  See, e. g., Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47 (1944).  The whole point of requiring a “clear declaration” by the State of its waiver is to be certain that the State in fact consents to suit.  But there is little reason to assume actual consent based upon the State’s mere presence in a field subject to congressional regulation.  There is a fundamental difference between a State’s expressing unequivocally that it waives its immunity and Congress’s *681 expressing unequivocally its intention that if the State takes certain action it shall be deemed to have waived that immunity.  In the latter situation, the most that can be said with certainty is that the State has been put on notice that Congress intends to subject it to suits brought by individuals.  That is very far from concluding that the State made an “altogether voluntary” decision to waive its immunity.

 See also Ohio Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Util. Comm’n of Ohio, 301 U. S. 292, 307 (1937) (we “do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights”).  State sovereign immunity, no less than the right to trial by jury in criminal eases, is constitutionally protected.  Great Northern, supra, at 51 ; Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 98 .  And in the context oí federal sovereign immunity — obviously the closest analogy to the present case — it is well established that waivers are not implied.  See, e.g., United States v. King, 395 U. S. 1, 4 (1969) (describing the “settled proposi-tio[n]” that the United States’ waiver of sovereign immunity “cannot be implied but must be unequivocally expressed”).  We see no reason why the rule should be different with respect to state sovereign immunity.  Given how anomalous it is to speak of the “constructive waiver” of a constitutionally protected privilege, it is not surprising that the very cornerstone of the <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> opinion was the notion that state sovereign immunity is not constitutionally grounded.  Parden’s discussion of waiver began with the observation: *683 “By empowering Congress to regulate commerce .  .  .  the States necessarily surrendered any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regulation.  Since imposition of the FELA right of action upon interstate railroads is within the congressional regulatory power, it must follow that application of the Act to such a railroad cannot be precluded by sovereign immunity.” <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> .  See also <citedDecision>id., at 193-194, n. 11</citedDecision> .  Our more recent decision in Seminole Tribe expressly repudiates that proposition, and in formally overruling <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> we do no more than make explicit what that case implied.  Recognizing a congressional power to exact constructive waivers of sovereign immunity through the exercise of Article I powers would also, as a practical matter, permit Congress to circumvent the antiabrogation holding of Seminole Tribe.  Forced waiver and abrogation are not even different sides of the same coin — they are the same side of the same coin.  “All congressional creations of private rights of action attach recovery to the defendant’s commission of some act, or possession of some status, in a field where Congress has authority to regulate conduct.  Thus, all federal prescriptions are, insofar as their prospective application is concerned, in a sense conditional, and — to the extent that the objects of the prescriptions consciously engage in the activity or hold the status that produces liability — can be rede-scribed as invitations to ‘waiver.’ ” Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 43 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  See also Fitzpatrick, 427 U. S., at 451-452 (referring to congressional intent to “abrogate” state sovereign immunity as a “necessary predicate” for Parden-style waiver).  There is little more than a verbal distinction between saying that Congress can make Florida liable to private parties for false or misleading advertising in interstate commerce of its prepaid tuition program, and saying the same thing but adding *684 at the end “if Florida chooses to engage in such advertising.” As further evidence that constructive waiver is little more than abrogation under another name, consider the revealing facts of this case: The statutory provision relied upon to demonstrate that Florida constructively waived its sovereign immunity is the very same provision that purported to abrogate it.
**Lead Opinion**
 And we think that feature aptly characterizes, not our opinion, but Justice Breyer’s dissent, which believes that States should not enjoy the normal constitutional protections of sovereign immunity when they step out of their proper economic role to engage in (we are sure Mr. Herbert Spencer would be shocked) “ordinary commercial ventures,” post, at 694.  What ever happened to the need for “legislative flexibility”?  * * * Concluding, for the foregoing reasons, that the sovereign immunity of the State of Florida was neither validly abrogated by the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act, nor voluntarily waived by the State’s activities in interstate commerce, we hold that the federal courts are without jurisdiction to entertain this suit against an arm of the State of Florida.  The judgment of the Third Circuit dismissing the action is affirmed.  It is so ordered.  See Hardin, The Tragedy of the Commons, 162 Science 1243 (1968).  In response to this string of cases criticizing or narrowing the holding of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , Justice Breyek holds up three post -Parden cases as decisions that “support[ed]” Parden, post, at 696, or at least “carefully avoided calling [it] into question,” post, at 698.  His perception of “support” in Atasca-dero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234 (1985), rests upon nothing more substantial than the fact that the case “suggest[ed] that a waiver *679 may be found in a State’s acceptance of a federal grant.” Post, at 696.  But we make the same suggestion today, while utterly rejecting <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> .  As we explain elsewhere in detail, see infra, at 686-687, conditions attached to a State’s receipt of federal funds are simply not analogous to Parden-style conditions attached to a State’s decision to engage in otherwise lawful commercial activity.  Justice Breyer’s second case, Welch , overruled <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> in part, as we discuss above, and we think it quite impossible to believe that the following statement in the opinion did not “questio[n] the holding of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> that the Court today discards,’"'post, at 698: “We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject uneonsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” 483 U. S., at 475.  Calling what a prior case has flatly decided a “question” in need of “deciding,” and (lest there be any doubt on the point) making it clear that we “intimatfe] no view” as to whether the answer given by that prior ease was correct, surely was handwriting on the wall which even an inept cryptologist would recognize as spelling out the caption of today’s opinion.  As for Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), we explain elsewhere, see infra, at 682-684, how that case was logically and practically inconsistent with <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , even though it did not expressly overrule it.  Justice Breyer realizes this well enough, or else his call for an overruling of that case, which occupies almost half of his dissent, see post, at 699-705, would be supremely irrelevant to the matter before us.  In an attempt to cast doubt on our characterization of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> as a groundbreaking case, Justice Beeyer points to three earlier decisions which allegedly demonstrate that <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> worked no major change.  These cases, however, have only the most tenuous relation to Parderis actual holding — as one might suspect from the dissent’s soft-pedaled description of them as “roughly comparable” and involving (in quotation marks) ‘“waivers.”’ Post, at 696.  The first two, United, States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), and California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), involved neither state immunity from suit nor waiver, but the entirely different question whether substantive provisions of Commerce Clause legislation applied to the States.  The former concerned a suit brought against a State by ike United States (a situation in which state sovereign immunity does not exist, see United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892)), and the latter expressly acknowledged that “the Eleventh Amendment” was “not before us,” 353 U. S., at 568, n. 16 .  The last case, Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565 (1947), which held that a bankruptcy court can entertain a trustee’s objections to a claim filed by a State, stands for the unremarkable proposition that a State waives its sovereign immunity by voluntarily invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  See supra, at 675-676.  In sum, none of these cases laid any foundation for Parden— whose author was quite correct in acknowledging that it “presented a question of first impression,” Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 299 (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  As for the suggestion of Justice Beeyer that we limit state sovereign immunity to noncommercial state activities because Congress has so limited foreign sovereign immunity, in accord with the “modern trend,” see post, at 699 (dissenting opinion) (citing the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U. S. C. 11605(a)(2)), see also Justice Stevens’s dissent, post, at 692: This proposal ignores the fact that state sovereign immunity, unlike foreign sovereign immunity, is a constitutional doctrine that is meant to be both immutable by Congress and resistant to trends.  The text of the Eleventh Amendment, of course, makes no distinction between commercial and noncommercial state activities — and so if we were to combine Justice Beeyer’s literalistic interpretation of that Amendment with his affection for FSIA, we would have a “commercial activities” exception for all suits against States except those commenced in federal court by citizens of another State, a disposition that hardly “makes sense,” post, at 699.  Justice Breyer purports to “accept this Court’s pre-Seminole Tribe sovereign immunity decisions,” post, at 699 (dissenting opinion), but by that he could not mean Hans , but rather only the distorted view of Hans that prevailed briefly between Farden and Seminole Tribe.  Pardon was the first case to suggest that the sovereign immunity announced in Hans was so fragile a flower that it could be abrogated under Article I — a suggestion contrary to the reality that Hans itself involved a congressional conferral of jurisdiction enacted under Article I.  See Pennsylvania v. Union Gas, 491 U. S. 1, 36-37 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Moreover, that conferral of jurisdiction was combined, in Hans , with a substantive *688 claim under the Contracts Clause of the Constitution itself, which one would think to have greater, rather than lesser, abrogative force than a substantive statute enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause.  Justice Breyer would apparently interpose that the statute in Hans did not expressly “ ‘purpor[t] to pierce state immunity/ ” post, at 700, quoting Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 119 (Souter, J., dissenting) — but the opinion in Hans did not allude to that refinement, nor did <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> think it made any difference.  The so-called “clear statement rule” was not even adumbrated until nine years after <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , in Employees, 411 U. S., at 284-285 .  It is difficult to square Justice Breyer’s reliance upon the distinction that the present case involves a federal question (and is therefore not explicitly covered by the Eleventh Amendment), see post, at 700-701, with its professed fidelity to Hans , the whole point of which was that the sovereign immunity reflected in (rather than created by) the Eleventh Amendment transcends the narrow text of the Amendment itself Or to put it differently, the “pre-Seminole Tribe sovereign immunity decisions” to which Justice Breyer pledges allegiance appear to include Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793).  But see U. S. Const., Arndt.  11.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.  The Court holds that Congress, in the exercise of its commerce power, cannot require a State to waive its immunity from suit in federal court even where the State engages in activity from which it might readily withdraw, such as federally regulated commercial activity.  This Court has previously held to the contrary.  Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964).  I would not abandon that precedent.  *694 I Thirty-five years ago this Court unanimously subscribed to the holding that the Court today overrules.  Justice White, writing for four Members of the Court who dissented on a different issue, succinctly described that holding as follows: “[I]t is within the power of Congress to condition a State’s permit to engage in the interstate transportation business on a waiver of the State’s sovereign immunity from suits arising out of such business.  Congress might well determine that allowing regulable conduct such as the operation of a railroad to be undertaken by a body legally immune from liability directly resulting from these operations is so inimical to the purposes of its regulation that the State must be put to the option of either foregoing participation in the conduct or consenting to legal responsibility for injury caused thereby.” <citedDecision>Id., at 198</citedDecision> (opinion of White, J., joined by Douglas, Harlan, and Stewart, JJ.).  The majority, seeking to justify the overruling of so clear a precedent, describes Parden’s holding as a constitutional "anomaly” that “broke sharply with prior cases,” that is “fundamentally incompatible with later ones,” and that has been “narrowed ... in every subsequent opinion.” Ante, at 680.  <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> is none of those things.  Far from being anomalous, Parden’s holding finds support in reason and precedent.  When a State engages in ordinary commercial ventures, it acts like a private person, outside the area of its “core” responsibilities, and in a way unlikely to prove essential to the fulfillment of a basic governmental obligation.  A Congress that decides to regulate those state commercial activities rather than to exempt the State likely believes that an exemption, by treating the State differently from identically situated private persons, would threaten the objectives of a federal regulatory program aimed primarily *695 at private conduct.  Compare, e. g., 12 U. S. C. § 1841 (b) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (exempting state companies from regulations covering federal bank holding companies); 15 U. S. C. §77e(a)(2) (exempting state-issued securities from federal securities laws); and 29 U. S. C. § 652 (5) (exempting States from the definition of “employer[sJ” subject to federal occupational safety and health laws), with 11 U. S. C. § 106 (a) (subjecting States to federal bankruptcy court judgments); 15 U. S. C. § 1122 (a) (subjecting States to suit for violation of Lanham Act); 17 U. S. C. § 511 (a) (subjecting States to suit for copyright infringement); and 35 U. S. C. § 271 (h) (subjecting States to suit for patent infringement).  And a Congress that includes the State not only within its substantive regulatory rules but also (expressly) within a related system of private remedies likely believes that a remedial exemption would similarly threaten that program.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. Co liege Savings Bank, ante, at 656-657 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  It thereby avoids an enforcement gap which, when allied with the pressures of a competitive marketplace, could place the State’s regulated private competitors at a significant disadvantage.  These considerations make Congress’ need to possess the power to condition entry into the market upon a waiver of sovereign immunity (as “necessary and proper” to the exercise of its commerce power) unusually strong, for to deny Congress that power would deny Congress the power effectively to regulate private conduct.  Cf. California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553, 566 (1957).  At the same time they make a State’s need to exercise sovereign immunity unusually weak, for the State is unlikely to have to supply what private firms already supply, nor may it fairly demand special treatment, even to protect the public purse, when it does so. Neither can one easily imagine what the Constitution’s Founders would have thought about the assertion of sovereign immunity in this special context.  These considerations, differing in kind or degree from those that would support a general *696 congressional “abrogation” power, indicate that Pardens holding is sound, irrespective of this Court’s decisions in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), and Alden v. Maine, post, p. 706.  Neither did <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> break “sharply.  with prior cases.” <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> itself cited authority that found related “waivers” in at least roughly comparable circumstances.  United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), for example, held that a State, “by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has subjected itself to the commerce power,” id., at 185 , which amounted to a waiver of a (different though related) substantive immunity.  See also Taylor, supra, at 568 .  <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> also relied on authority holding that States seeking necessary congressional approval for an interstate compact had, “by venturing into the [federal] realm 'assume[d] the [waiver of sovereign immunity] conditions .  .  .  attached.’” <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 196</citedDecision> (quoting Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm’n, 359 U. S. 275, 281-282 (1959)).  Earlier case law had found a waiver of sovereign immunity in a State’s decision to bring a creditor’s claim in bankruptcy.  See Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565, 573-574 (1947).  Later case law, suggesting that a waiver may be found in a State’s acceptance of a federal grant, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 247 (1985), supports Parderis conclusion.  Where is the sharp break?  The majority has only one answer to this question.  It believes that this Court’s ease law requires any “waiver” to be “express” and “unequivocal.” Ante, at 680.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 *697 The statement does appeal to an intuition, namely, that it is somehow easier for the State, and hence more voluntary, to forgo “a gift or gratuity” than to refrain from “otherwise lawful activity,” or that it is somehow more compelling or oppressive for Congress to forbid the State to perform an “otherwise lawful” act than to withhold “beneficence.” But the force of this intuition depends upon the example that one chooses as its illustration; and realistic examples suggest the intuition is not sound in the present context.  Given the amount of money at stake, it may be harder, not easier, for a State to refuse highway funds than to refrain from entering the investment services business.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Federal Aid to States for Fiscal Year 1998, p. 17 (Apr. 1999) (Federal Government provided over $20 billion to States for highways in 1998).  It is more compelling and oppressive for Congress to threaten to withhold from a State fluids needed to educate its children than to threaten to subject it to suit when it competes directly with a private investment company.  See id., at 5 (Federal Government provided over $21 billion to States for education in 1998).  The distinction that the majority seeks to make — drawn in terms of gifts and entitlements — does not exist.  The majority is also wrong to say that this Court has “narrowed” <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> in its “subsequent opinion^],” ante, at 680, at least in any way relevant to today’s decision.  <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> considered two separate issues: (1) Does Congress have the power to require a State to waive its immunity?  (2) How clearly must Congress speak when it does so?  The Court has narrowed <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> only in respect to the second issue, not the first; but today we are concerned only with the first.  The Court in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U.S. 279 (1973), for example, discussed whether Congress had, or had not, “lift[ed]” sovereign immunity, not whether it could, or could not, have done so. Id., at 285 *698 (“Congress did not lift the sovereign immunity of the States” (emphasis added)).  And Employees’ limitation of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , to “the area where private persons and corporations normally ran the enterprise,” took place in the context of clarity, not power.  411 U. S., at 284 (specifying that “Congress can act” outside the limited area (emphasis added)).  Although two Justices would have limited Parden’s holding in respect to power, that limitation would simply have required Congress to give the States advance notice of the consequence (loss of sovereign immunity), which, as they noted, happened in Parden.  411 U. S., at 296-297 (Marshall, J., concurring in result).  The remaining cases the majority mentions offer it no greater support.  One said, “We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 488 U. S. 468 , 475 (1987).  Two others also considered legislative clarity, not power.  Atascadero State Hospital, supra, at 247 (Rehabilitation Act “falls far short” of clearly indicating a waiver by a State accepting funds under the Act); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 674 (1974) (same for Social Security Act).  Even Seminole Tribe carefully avoided calling Par-den into question.  While specifying that Congress cannot, in the exercise of its Article I powers, “abrogate unilaterally the States’ immunity from suit,” 517 U. S., at 59 , it left open the scope of the term “unilaterally” by referring to <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , without criticism, as standing for the “unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that the States may waive their sovereign immunity,” 517 U. S., at 65 .  In short, except for those in today’s majority, no member of this Court had ever questioned the holding of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> that the Court today discards because it cannot find “merit in attempting to salvage any remnant of it.” Ante, at 680.  *699 <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> had never been questioned because, Seminole Tribe or not, it still makes sense.  The line the Court today rejects has been drawn by this Court to place States outside the ordinary dormant Commerce Clause rules when they act as “market participants.” White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204, 206-208 (1988); Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 434-439 (1980); Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 804-810 (1976).  And Congress has drawn this same line in the related context of foreign state sovereign immunity.  28 U. S. C. § 1605 (a)(2).  In doing so, Congress followed the modern trend, which “spread rapidly after the Second World War,” regarding foreign state sovereign immunity.  1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States, eh. 5, Introductory Note, p. 391 (1986) (recognizing that “immunity... gave states an unfair advantage in competition with private commercial enterprise”); see also Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of its Thirty-Eighth Session, Art. 11, ¶ 1, p. 7 (United Nations Doe.  A/41/498, Aug. 26, 1986) (when a State engages in a commercial contract with a foreign person, “the State is considered to have consented to the exercise” of foreign jurisdiction in a proceeding arising out of that contract).  Indeed, given the widely accepted view among modern nations that when a State engages in ordinary commercial activity sovereign immunity has no significant role to play, it is today’s holding, not <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , that creates the legal “anomaly.” II I resist all the more strongly the Courts extension of Seminole Tribe in this case because, although I accept this Court’s -pre-Seminole Tribe sovereign immunity decisions, I am not yet ready to adhere to the proposition of law set forth in Seminole Tribe.  Cf. EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 249-250 (1988) (Stevens, J., concurring).  In my view, Congress does possess the authority to abrogate a State’s sover *700 eign immunity where "necessary and proper” to the exercise of an Article I power.  My reasons include those that Justices Stevens and Souter already have described in detail.  (1) Neither constitutional text nor the surrounding debates support Seminole Tribe's view that Congress lacks the Article I power to abrogate a State’s sovereign immunity in federal-question cases (unlike diversity eases).  Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 82-88 , and nn. 8, 9 (Stevens, J., dissenting); id., at 142-150 (Souter, J., dissenting); ef.  the majority’s characterization of this argument, ante, at 687-688.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.  The Court holds that Congress, in the exercise of its commerce power, cannot require a State to waive its immunity from suit in federal court even where the State engages in activity from which it might readily withdraw, such as federally regulated commercial activity.  This Court has previously held to the contrary.  Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964).  I would not abandon that precedent.  *694 I Thirty-five years ago this Court unanimously subscribed to the holding that the Court today overrules.  Justice White, writing for four Members of the Court who dissented on a different issue, succinctly described that holding as follows: “[I]t is within the power of Congress to condition a State’s permit to engage in the interstate transportation business on a waiver of the State’s sovereign immunity from suits arising out of such business.  Congress might well determine that allowing regulable conduct such as the operation of a railroad to be undertaken by a body legally immune from liability directly resulting from these operations is so inimical to the purposes of its regulation that the State must be put to the option of either foregoing participation in the conduct or consenting to legal responsibility for injury caused thereby.” <citedDecision>Id., at 198</citedDecision> (opinion of White, J., joined by Douglas, Harlan, and Stewart, JJ.).  The majority, seeking to justify the overruling of so clear a precedent, describes Parden’s holding as a constitutional "anomaly” that “broke sharply with prior cases,” that is “fundamentally incompatible with later ones,” and that has been “narrowed ... in every subsequent opinion.” Ante, at 680.  <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> is none of those things.  Far from being anomalous, Parden’s holding finds support in reason and precedent.  When a State engages in ordinary commercial ventures, it acts like a private person, outside the area of its “core” responsibilities, and in a way unlikely to prove essential to the fulfillment of a basic governmental obligation.  A Congress that decides to regulate those state commercial activities rather than to exempt the State likely believes that an exemption, by treating the State differently from identically situated private persons, would threaten the objectives of a federal regulatory program aimed primarily *695 at private conduct.  Compare, e. g., 12 U. S. C. § 1841 (b) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (exempting state companies from regulations covering federal bank holding companies); 15 U. S. C. §77e(a)(2) (exempting state-issued securities from federal securities laws); and 29 U. S. C. § 652 (5) (exempting States from the definition of “employer[sJ” subject to federal occupational safety and health laws), with 11 U. S. C. § 106 (a) (subjecting States to federal bankruptcy court judgments); 15 U. S. C. § 1122 (a) (subjecting States to suit for violation of Lanham Act); 17 U. S. C. § 511 (a) (subjecting States to suit for copyright infringement); and 35 U. S. C. § 271 (h) (subjecting States to suit for patent infringement).  And a Congress that includes the State not only within its substantive regulatory rules but also (expressly) within a related system of private remedies likely believes that a remedial exemption would similarly threaten that program.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. Co liege Savings Bank, ante, at 656-657 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  It thereby avoids an enforcement gap which, when allied with the pressures of a competitive marketplace, could place the State’s regulated private competitors at a significant disadvantage.  These considerations make Congress’ need to possess the power to condition entry into the market upon a waiver of sovereign immunity (as “necessary and proper” to the exercise of its commerce power) unusually strong, for to deny Congress that power would deny Congress the power effectively to regulate private conduct.  Cf. California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553, 566 (1957).  At the same time they make a State’s need to exercise sovereign immunity unusually weak, for the State is unlikely to have to supply what private firms already supply, nor may it fairly demand special treatment, even to protect the public purse, when it does so. Neither can one easily imagine what the Constitution’s Founders would have thought about the assertion of sovereign immunity in this special context.  These considerations, differing in kind or degree from those that would support a general *696 congressional “abrogation” power, indicate that Pardens holding is sound, irrespective of this Court’s decisions in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), and Alden v. Maine, post, p. 706.  Neither did <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> break “sharply.  with prior cases.” <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> itself cited authority that found related “waivers” in at least roughly comparable circumstances.  United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), for example, held that a State, “by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has subjected itself to the commerce power,” id., at 185 , which amounted to a waiver of a (different though related) substantive immunity.  See also Taylor, supra, at 568 .  <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> also relied on authority holding that States seeking necessary congressional approval for an interstate compact had, “by venturing into the [federal] realm 'assume[d] the [waiver of sovereign immunity] conditions .  .  .  attached.’” <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 196</citedDecision> (quoting Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm’n, 359 U. S. 275, 281-282 (1959)).  Earlier case law had found a waiver of sovereign immunity in a State’s decision to bring a creditor’s claim in bankruptcy.  See Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565, 573-574 (1947).  Later case law, suggesting that a waiver may be found in a State’s acceptance of a federal grant, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 247 (1985), supports Parderis conclusion.  Where is the sharp break?  The majority has only one answer to this question.  It believes that this Court’s ease law requires any “waiver” to be “express” and “unequivocal.” Ante, at 680.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 *697 The statement does appeal to an intuition, namely, that it is somehow easier for the State, and hence more voluntary, to forgo “a gift or gratuity” than to refrain from “otherwise lawful activity,” or that it is somehow more compelling or oppressive for Congress to forbid the State to perform an “otherwise lawful” act than to withhold “beneficence.” But the force of this intuition depends upon the example that one chooses as its illustration; and realistic examples suggest the intuition is not sound in the present context.  Given the amount of money at stake, it may be harder, not easier, for a State to refuse highway funds than to refrain from entering the investment services business.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Federal Aid to States for Fiscal Year 1998, p. 17 (Apr. 1999) (Federal Government provided over $20 billion to States for highways in 1998).  It is more compelling and oppressive for Congress to threaten to withhold from a State fluids needed to educate its children than to threaten to subject it to suit when it competes directly with a private investment company.  See id., at 5 (Federal Government provided over $21 billion to States for education in 1998).  The distinction that the majority seeks to make — drawn in terms of gifts and entitlements — does not exist.  The majority is also wrong to say that this Court has “narrowed” <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> in its “subsequent opinion^],” ante, at 680, at least in any way relevant to today’s decision.  <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> considered two separate issues: (1) Does Congress have the power to require a State to waive its immunity?  (2) How clearly must Congress speak when it does so?  The Court has narrowed <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> only in respect to the second issue, not the first; but today we are concerned only with the first.  The Court in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U.S. 279 (1973), for example, discussed whether Congress had, or had not, “lift[ed]” sovereign immunity, not whether it could, or could not, have done so. Id., at 285 *698 (“Congress did not lift the sovereign immunity of the States” (emphasis added)).  And Employees’ limitation of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , to “the area where private persons and corporations normally ran the enterprise,” took place in the context of clarity, not power.  411 U. S., at 284 (specifying that “Congress can act” outside the limited area (emphasis added)).  Although two Justices would have limited Parden’s holding in respect to power, that limitation would simply have required Congress to give the States advance notice of the consequence (loss of sovereign immunity), which, as they noted, happened in Parden.  411 U. S., at 296-297 (Marshall, J., concurring in result).  The remaining cases the majority mentions offer it no greater support.  One said, “We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 488 U. S. 468 , 475 (1987).  Two others also considered legislative clarity, not power.  Atascadero State Hospital, supra, at 247 (Rehabilitation Act “falls far short” of clearly indicating a waiver by a State accepting funds under the Act); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 674 (1974) (same for Social Security Act).  Even Seminole Tribe carefully avoided calling Par-den into question.  While specifying that Congress cannot, in the exercise of its Article I powers, “abrogate unilaterally the States’ immunity from suit,” 517 U. S., at 59 , it left open the scope of the term “unilaterally” by referring to <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , without criticism, as standing for the “unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that the States may waive their sovereign immunity,” 517 U.

S. 794, 804-810 (1976).  And Congress has drawn this same line in the related context of foreign state sovereign immunity.  28 U. S. C. § 1605 (a)(2).
