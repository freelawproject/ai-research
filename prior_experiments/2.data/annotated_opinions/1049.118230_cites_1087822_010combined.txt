4-6. Construing the issuance of a certificate of appealability as an administrative function, moreover, would suggest an entity not wielding judicial power might review the *246 decision of an Article III court. In light of the constitutional questions which would surround such an arrangement, see Gordon, supra ; Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), we should avoid any such implication. We further disagree with the contention, advanced by the dissent and by Court-appointed amicus, that a request to proceed before a court of appeals should be regarded as a threshold inquiry separate from the merits which, if denied, prevents the case from ever being in the court of appeals. Precedent forecloses this argument. In Ex parte Quirin, <targetCase>317 U. S. 1</targetCase> (1942), we confronted the analogous question whether a request for leave to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was a case in a district court for the purposes of the then-extant statute governing court of appeals review of district court decisions. See 28 U. S. C. § 225 (a) First (1940 ed.) (courts of appeals had jurisdiction to review final decisions "[i]n the district courts, in all cases save where a direct review of the decision may be had in the Supreme Court"). We held the request for leave constituted a case in the district court over which the court of appeals could assert jurisdiction, even though the district court had denied the request. We reasoned, "[p]resentation of the petition for judicial action is the institution of a suit. Hence the denial by the district court of leave to file the petitions in these causes was the judicial determination of a case or controversy, reviewable on appeal to the Court of Appeals." <targetCase>317 U. S., at </targetCase>24 . We reached a similar conclusion in Nixon v. Fitzgerald . There President Nixon sought to appeal an interlocutory District Court order rejecting his claim of absolute immunity. The Court of Appeals summarily dismissed the appeal because, in its view, the order failed to present a "serious and unsettled question" of law sufficient to bring the case within the collateral order doctrine announced in Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U. S. 541 , 547 (1949). Because the Court of Appeals had dismissed for failure to *247 satisfy this threshold jurisdictional requirement, respondent Fitzgerald argued, "the District Court's order was not an appealable `case' properly `in' the Court of Appeals within the meaning of § 1254." 457 U. S., at 742 . Turning aside this argument, we ruled "petitioner did present a `serious and unsettled' and therefore appealable question to the Court of Appeals.

If this were Congress's wish, there would have been no need for § 102 of AEDPA. The whole point of that provision is to diverge from the ordinary course of the judicial process and to keep petitioner's case against respondent out of the Court of Appeals unless petitioner obtains a COA. "The certificate is a screening device, helping to conserve judicial (and prosecutorial) resources." Young v. United States, 124 F. 3d 794 , 799 *258 (CA7 1997). It is this unique screening function that distinguishes a COA from the jurisdictional issues discussed by the Court: Section 102 of AEDPA prevents petitioner's case from entering the Court of Appeals at all in the absence of a COA, whereas other jurisdictional determinations are made after a case is in the Court of Appeals (even if the case is later dismissed because of jurisdictional defects), ante, at 246 249. See Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397 , 403, n. 3 (1970) (a court always has jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction). The Court's only response to these arguments is that they are foreclosed by our precedent, since we decided an analogous issue in Ex parte Quirin, <targetCase>317 U. S. 1</targetCase> (1942). Ante, at 246. (The Court displays no appreciation of the delicious irony involved in its insistence upon hewing to an allegedly analogous decision while overruling the case directly in point, House. ) <targetCase>Quirin</targetCase> held that a petition for habeas corpus constituted the institution of a suit, and that it was not necessary for the writ to issue for the matter to be considered a case or controversy. <targetCase>317 U. S., at </targetCase>24 . <targetCase>Quirin</targetCase> relied upon our decision in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 , 110-113 (1866), which reasoned that a petition for habeas corpus is a suit because the petitioner seeks "`that remedy which the law affords him' " to recover his liberty. Id., at 113 (quoting Weston v. City Council of Charleston, 2 Pet. 449 , 464 (1829)). Petitioner's request for § 2255 relief is analogous to a petition for habeas corpus, but his request for a COA is of a wholly different nature. That is no "remedy" for any harm, but a threshold procedural requirement that petitioner must meet in order to carry his § 2255 suit to the appellate stage. That is why the Court in House, decided less than three years after <targetCase>Quirin</targetCase>, did not treat the application for a certificate as a separate case but did recognize the petition for habeas corpus as a case even though it was decided without a hearing or a call for a return. 324 U. S., at 43 . I have described above why House was entirely correct, but a few words are in order concerning the inappropriateness *259 of overruling House, regardless of its virtue as an original matter. "[T]he burden borne by the party advocating abandonment of an established precedent is greater where the Court is asked to overrule a point of statutory construction." Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164 , 172-173 (1989); see also Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720 , 736 (1977); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 , 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting). The Court acknowledges this principle, but invokes cases of ours that say that stare decisis concerns are "`somewhat reduced' " in the case of a procedural rule. Ante, at 251.
