 1 For 15 years, respondents, a class of inmates and certain publishers, have claimed that these regulations violate their First Amendment rights under the standard of review enunciated in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396 (1974).  2 They mount a facial challenge to the regulations as well as a challenge to the regulations as applied to 46 specific publications excluded by the Bureau.  After a 10-day bench trial, the District Court refrained from adopting the Martinez standard.  Instead, it favored an approach more deferential to the judgment of prison authorities and upheld the regulations without addressing the propriety of the 46 specific exclusions.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a, 43a-47a.  The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, utilized the Martinez standard, found the regulations wanting, *404 and remanded the case to the District Court for an individualized determination of the constitutionality of the 46 exclusions.  Abbott v. Meese, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d 1166</citedDecision> (1987).  Petitioners, officials of the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Prisons, sought certiorari.  We granted the writ in order to determine the appropriate standard of review.  Meese v. Abbott, 485 U. S. 1020 (1988).  We now hold that the District Court correctly anticipated that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the regulations are “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,” Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987), and we conclude that under this standard the regulations are facially valid.  We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals on the issue of facial validity, but we agree with that court’s remand of the case to the District Court for a determination of the validity of the regulations as applied to each of the 46 publications.  II We are concerned primarily with the regulations set forth at 28 CFR §§540.70 and 540.71 (1988), first promulgated in 1979.

 .  .  But if an inmate claimant can point to an alternative that fully accommodates the prisoner’s rights at de minimis cost to valid penological interests, a court may consider that as evidence that the regulation does not satisfy the reasonable relationship standard.” 482 U. S., at 90-91.  We agree with the District Court that these regulations, on their face, are not an “exaggerated response” to the problem at hand: no obvious, easy alternative has been established.  Regarding the all-or-nothing rule, we analyze respondents’ proposed alternatives to that rule as alternative means of accommodating respondents’ asserted rights.  The District Court discussed the evidence and found, on the basis of testimony in the record, that petitioners’ fear that tearing out the *419 rejected portions and admitting the rest of the publication would create more discontent than the current practice was “reasonably founded.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  The Court of Appeals did not contest the District Court’s factual finding as such, but ruled that upholding a practice merely because it is based upon “reasonably founded” fears is improper under Martinez : the Court of Appeals held that this finding “conflicts with the holding of Martinez that prison administrators have the burden of showing that a restrictive practice is ‘generally necessary.’” 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 194, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d, at 1174</citedDecision> .  As we here do not apply the Martinez standard, we reject the Court of Appeals’ sole ground for questioning the District Court’s findings in this respect.  In our view, when prison officials are able to demonstrate that they have rejected a less restrictive alternative because of reasonably founded fears that it will lead to greater harm, they succeed in demonstrating that the alternative they in fact selected was not an “exaggerated response” under Turner .  Furthermore, the administrative inconvenience of this proposed alternative is also a factor to be considered and adds additional support to the District Court’s conclusion that petitioners were not obligated to adopt it.  See Wolfish, 441 U. S., at 549 .  V In sum, we hold that Turner's reasonableness standard is to be applied to the regulations at issue in this case, and that those regulations are facially valid under that standard.  We agree with the remand for an examination of the validity of the regulations as applied to any of the 46 publications introduced at trial as to which there remains a live controversy.  See 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 196, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d, at 1176</citedDecision> .  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  As explained in the text, rejection of a publication is authorized “only if it is determined detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity.” 28 CFR 8 540.71(b) (1988).  References in the text to “prison security” are intended, for the sake of convenience, to refer more broadly to this range of concerns.  This lawsuit was filed by prisoners in May 1973 and was certified the following year as a class action.  In 1978, three publishers, The Prisoners’ Union, Weekly Guardian Associates, and The Revolutionary Socialist League, were added as party plaintiffs.  The suit also challenged several prison practices, largely concerning inmate correspondence, that are not at issue here.  Individual claims for damages were severed in 1979.  A bench trial on the claims for injunctive relief took place in 1981, and a memorandum opinion and accompanying order were issued by the District Court in September 1984.  The Court of Appeals predicated its jurisdiction on 28 U. S. C. 8 1292(a)(1) on the ground that the order of the District Court denied respondents injunctive relief.  Abbott v. Mee.sr, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 187-188, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d 1166, 1167-1168</citedDecision> (1987).  When the complaint was filed in 1973, the Bureau had not yet issued regulations dealing with management of federal inmates.  See 43 Fed. Reg. 30574 (1978) (proposed rulemaking); 44 Fed. Reg. 38254 (1979) (final rules).  References herein to regulations are to those presently in effect.  They are identical to the version considered by the District Court and the Court of Appeals.  The current version differs in some respects from the 1979 version, but those differences are not material to our present inquiry.  The term “publication” is defined as “a book (for example, novel, instructional manual), or a single issue of a magazine or newspaper, plus such other materials addressed to a specific inmate as advertising brochures, flyers, and catalogues.” 28 CFR § 540.70 (a) (1988).

 “(4) Involving children.” Material in categories (1), (2), and (3) may be admitted if the warden determines it “not to pose a threat at the local institution.” ¶ (b)(1).  Explicit heterosexual material ordinarily will be admitted.  "I (b)(2).  Other ex *406 plicit material may be admitted if it has scholarly, or general social or literary, value.  1 (b)(5).  Homosexual material that is not sexually explicit is to be admitted; this includes a publication covering the activities of gay-rights groups or gay religious groups, *: (b)(3), and literary publications with homosexual themes or references, "(b)(4).  See 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 197, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d, at 1177</citedDecision> .  Under the Administrative Remedy Procedure, a prisoner who has been unable informally to resolve his difficulty may file a formal written complaint.  28 CFR § 542.13 (b) (1988).  If the inmate believes he would be adversely affected if the complaint became known at the prison, he may file the complaint with the Regional Director of the Bureau.  § 542.13(c).  The warden or Regional Director is to respond within 15 or 30 days, respectively.  § 542.14.
