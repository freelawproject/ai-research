Mr. Justice Brennan, with whom Mr. Justice Marshall joins, dissenting.  I would not overrule the per se rule stated in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., <citedDecision>388 U. S. 365</citedDecision> (1967), and would therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.
