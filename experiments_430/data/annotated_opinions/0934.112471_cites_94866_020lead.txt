 .  .  was not increased (but actually decreased), and the elements of the offense or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt were not changed,” there was no ex post facto violation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C-6.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Youngblood v. Lynaugh, 882 F. 2d 956 (CA5 1989).  It relied on the statement in this Court’s decision in Thompson v. Utah, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 343</citedDecision> (1898), that retroactive procedural statutes violate the Ex Post Facto Clause unless they ‘“leave untouched all the substantial-protections with which existing law surrounds the person accused of crime,’” Lynaugh, supra, at 959 (quoting <citedDecision>170 U. S., at 352</citedDecision> ).  It held that Youngblood’s right to a new trial under the Bogany decision was such a “substantial protection,” and therefore ordered that a writ of habeas corpus be issued.  We granted certiorari.  493 U. S. 1001 (1989).  Because respondent is before us on collateral review, we are faced with a threshold question whether the relief sought by Youngblood would constitute a “new rule,” which would not apply retroactively under our decisions in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), and Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407 (1990).  Generally speaking, “[rjetroactivity is *41 properly treated as a threshold question, for, once a new rule is applied to the defendant in the case announcing the rule, evenhanded justice requires that it be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated.” Teague, supra, at 300 .  The State of Texas, however, did not address retroactivity in its petition for certiorari or its briefs on the merits, and when asked about the issue at oral argument, counsel answered that the State had chosen not to rely on Teague .

 But the prohibition which may not be evaded is the one defined by the Calder categories.  See Duncan, supra, at 382 ; Malloy, supra, at 183-184 .  The references in Duncan and Malloy to “substantial protections” and “personal rights” should not be read to adopt without explanation an undefined enlargement of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  *47 Two decisions of this Court, relied upon by respondent, do not fit into this analytical framework.  In Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221 (1883), the Court said “it is not to be supposed that the opinion in [Calder v. Bull] undertook to define, by way of exclusion, all the cases to which the constitutional provision would be applicable.” Id., at 228 .  It defined an ex post facto law, inter alia, as one which, “ ‘in relation to the offence or its consequences, alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.”’ Id., at 228-229 (quoting United States v. Hall, 26 F. Cas. 84, 86 (No. 15,285) (D Pa. 1809)) (emphasis deleted).  And in Thompson v. Utah, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 343</citedDecision> (1898), the Court held that a change in Utah law reducing the size of juries in criminal cases from 12 persons to 8 deprived Thompson of “a substantial right involved in his liberty” and violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.  <citedDecision>Id., at 352</citedDecision> .  Neither of these decisions, in our view, is consistent with the understanding of the term “ex post facto law” at the time the Constitution was adopted.  Nor has their reasoning been followed by this Court since <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> was decided in 1898.  These cases have caused confusion in state and lower federal courts about the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause, as exemplified by the opinions of the District Court and Court of Appeals in this case. See also Murphy v. Kentucky, 465 U. S. 1072, 1073 (1984) (White, J., dissenting from denial of certio-rari) (noting “the evident confusion among lower courts concerning the application of the Ex Post Facto Clause to changes in rules of evidence and procedure”); United States v. Kowal, 596 F. Supp. 375, 377 (Conn. 1984) (Supreme Court jurisprudence applying ex post facto prohibition to retroactive procedural changes “is not all of one piece”); L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 638 (2d ed. 1988) (procedural changes upheld by the Court “can hardly be distinguished in any functional way from those invalidated”).  The earlier decision, Kring v. Missouri, was a capital case with a lengthy procedural history.  Kring was charged with first-degree murder, but pursuant to a plea agreement, he *48 pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.  The plea was accepted by the prosecutor and the trial court, and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison.  He appealed the judgment, however, on the ground that his plea agreement provided for a sentence of no more than 10 years.  The State Supreme Court reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings.

 His jury charge should not be read to mean that the Constitution prohibits retrospective *50 laws, other than those encompassed by the Calder categories, which “alte[r] the situation of a party to his disadvantage.” Nothing in the Hall case supports the broad construction of the ex post facto provision given by the Court in Kring .  It is possible to reconcile Kring with the numerous cases which have held that “procedural” changes do not result in ex post facto violations by saying that the change in Missouri law did take away a “defense” available to the defendant under the old procedure.  But this use of the word “defense” carries a meaning quite different from that which appears in the quoted language from Beazell , where the term was linked to the prohibition on alterations in “the legal definition of the offense” or “the nature or amount of the punishment imposed for its commission.” Beazell, 269 U. S., at 169-170 .  The “defense” available to Kring under earlier Missouri law was not one related to the definition of the crime, but was based on the law regulating the effect of guilty pleas.  Missouri had not changed any of the elements of the crime of murder, or the matters which might be pleaded as an excuse or justification for the conduct underlying such a charge; it had changed its law respecting the effect of a guilty plea to a lesser included offense.  The holding in Kring can only be justified if the Ex Post Facto Clause is thought to include not merely the Calder categories, but any change which “alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.” We think such a reading of the Clause departs from the meaning of the Clause as it was understood at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, and is not supported by later cases. We accordingly overrule Kring .  The second case, <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Utah</citedDecision> , must be viewed in historical context.  Thompson was initially charged with his crime — grand larceny committed by stealing a calf — in 1895, when Utah was a Territory.  He was tried by a jury of 12 persons and convicted.  A new trial was subsequently granted, however, and in the meantime Utah was admitted *51 into the Union as a State.  The Constitution of the State of Utah provided that juries in noncapital cases would consist of 8 persons, not 12, and Thompson was retried and convicted by a panel of 8.  This Court reversed the conviction.  It reasoned first that while Utah was a Territory, the Sixth Amendment applied to actions of the territorial government and guaranteed Thompson a right to a 12-person jury.  <citedDecision>170 U. S., at 349-350</citedDecision> .  The Court then held that “the State did not acquire upon its admission into the Union the power to provide, in respect of felonies committed within its limits while it was a Territory, that they should be tried otherwise than by a jury such as is provided by the Constitution of the United States.” <citedDecision>Id., at 350-351</citedDecision> .  Because the State Constitution “deprive[d] him of a substantial right involved in his liberty” and “materially altered] the situation to his disadvantage,” the Court concluded that Thompson’s conviction was prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause.  <citedDecision>Id., at 352-353</citedDecision> .  The result in <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Utah</citedDecision> foreshadowed our decision in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), which held that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury — then believed to mean a jury of 12, see, e. g., Patton v. United States, 281 U. S. 276, 288-289 (1930) — was incorporated and made applicable by the Fourteenth Amendment against the States.  The Court held that since Utah was a Territory when Thompson’s crime was committed, and therefore obligated to provide a 12-person jury by the Sixth Amendment, the Ex Post Facto Clause prevented the State from taking away that substantial right from him when it became a State and was no longer bound by the Sixth Amendment as then interpreted.  The right to jury trial provided by the Sixth Amendment is obviously a “substantial” one, but it is not a right that has anything to do with the definition of crimes, defenses, or punishments, which is the concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  To the extent that <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Utah</citedDecision> *52 rested on the Ex Post Facto Clause and not the Sixth Amendment, we overrule it.  4 The Texas statute allowing reformation of improper verdicts does not punish as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; nor make more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission; nor deprive one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed.  Its application to respondent therefore is not prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. I, § 10.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.  In Bogany , the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a jury verdict which included a punishment unauthorized by law was void at its inception and had to be set aside.  It concluded that Texas law at that time did not give appellate courts authority to reform such verdicts.  Although there has been some debate within the Court about the accuracy of the historical discussion in Calder v. Bull , see Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380, 381 (1829) (note by Johnson, J.), the Court has consistently adhered to the view expressed by Justices Chase, Paterson, and Iredell in Calder that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies only to penal statutes.  The Beazell definition omits the reference by Justice Chase in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798), to alterations in the “legal rules of evidence.” See also Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 590 (1884) (approving procedural changes “leaving untouched the nature of the crime and the amount or degree of proof essential to conviction”).  As cases subsequent to Calder make clear, this language was not intended to prohibit the application of new evidentiary rules in trials for crimes committed before the changes.  Thompson v. Missouri, 171 U. S. 380, 386-387 (1898) (rejecting e.r post facto challenge to retroactive application of statute making admissible handwritten documents as handwriting exemplars): Hopt, supra, at 588-590 (upholding retroactive application of statute making felons competent to testify).  The Court’s holding in Thompson v. Utah, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 343</citedDecision> (1898), that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury panel of 12 persons is also obsolete.  Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970).
