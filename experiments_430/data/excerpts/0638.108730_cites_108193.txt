 But on November 13, 1967, he escaped from the custody of Kentucky officials and remained at large until his arrest in Alabama on February 24, 1968.  Petitioner was convicted of certain unspecified felonies in the Alabama state courts, and was sentenced to the Alabama state prison, where he was confined when he filed this action.  The validity of petitioner’s conviction on the Alabama felonies is not at issue here, just as it was not at issue before the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.  Nor does petitioner challenge the “present effect being given the [Kentucky] detainer by the [Alabama] authorities .  .  .  .” Nelson v. George, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 224, 225</citedDecision> (1970).  He attacks, rather, the validity of the *487 Kentucky indictment which underlies the detainer lodged against him by officials of that State.  In a pro se application for habeas corpus relief to the Federal District Court in the Western District of Kentucky, petitioner alleged that he had made repeated demands for a speedy trial on the Kentucky indictment, that he had been denied his right to a speedy trial, that further delay in trial would impair his ability to defend himself, and that the existence of the Kentucky indictment adversely affected his condition of confinement in Alabama by prejudicing his opportunity for parole.  In response to an order to show cause, respondent argued that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because the petitioner was not confined within the district.  Respondent added that “petitioner in the case at bar may challenge the legality of any of the adverse effects of any Kentucky detainer against him in Alabama by habeas corpus in the Alabama Federal District Court.” App. 6-7.  The District Court held, citing Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969), that Kentucky must “attempt to effect the return of a prisoner from a foreign jurisdiction for trial on pending state charges when such prisoner so demands .... Since it is the State of Kentucky which must take action, it follows that jurisdiction rests in this district which has jurisdiction over the necessary state officials.” App. 9.  Under the constraint of its earlier decision, 1 the Court of Appeals reversed but stated that it “reach [ed] this conclusion reluctantly” because of the possibility that the decision would “result in Braden’s inability to find a forum in which to assert his constitutional right to a speedy trial — a right which he is legally entitled to assert at this time under Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 *488 (1968).
**Lead Opinion**
 Nothing in this opinion should be taken to preclude the exercise of concurrent habeas corpus jurisdiction over the petitioner’s claim by a federal district court in the district of confinement.  But as we have made clear above, that forum will not in the ordinary ease prove as convenient as the district court in the State which has lodged the detainer.  Where a prisoner brings an action in the district of confinement attacking a detainer lodged by another State, the court can, of course, transfer the suit to a more convenient forum.  28 U. S. C. § 1404 (a).  Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U. S. 335 (1960).  Obviously, since petitioner could not have presented his habeas corpus claim prior to our 1968 decision in Peyton v. Rowe, supra, and since the choice-of-forum provisions in the habeas corpus statute were most recently amended in 1966, see n. 13, supra, we can hardly draw any inference from the fact that the amendment did not specifically overrule Ahrens with respect to the type of case now before us.  In Nelson v. George, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 224</citedDecision> , 228 n. 5 (1970), we adverted to, but reserved judgment on, the precise question at issue here.  We did point out, however, that the “obvious, logical, and practical solution is an amendment to § 2241 to remedy the shortcoming that has become apparent following the holding in Peyton v. Rowe .  Sound judicial administration calls for such an amendment.” We note that an amendment to § 2241 drafted by the Administrative Conference of the United States Courts was introduced during the 92d Congress, but no action was taken upon it.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Blackmun, concurring in the result.  I concur in the result.  The conclusion the Court reaches is not unexpected when one notes the extraordinary expansion of the concept of habeas corpus effected in recent years.  See Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S. 546 (1941); Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283 (1944); Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963); Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968); Carajus v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234 (1968); Nelson v. George, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 224</citedDecision> (1970).  Cf. Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U. S. 487 (1971).  A trend of this kind, once begun, easily assumes startling proportions.  The present case is but one more step, with the Alabama warden now made the agent of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  I do not go so far as to say that on the facts of this case the result is necessarily wrong.  I merely point out that we have come a long way from the traditional notions of the Great Writ.  The common-law scholars of the past hardly would recognize what the Court has developed, see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *131-134, and they would, I suspect, conclude that it is not for the better.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The Court construed the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” to mean that Congress intended to limit the jurisdiction of a district court to prisoners in custody within its territorial jurisdiction.  Id., at 193 .  The Court here says that the “language” of Ahrens “indicates” the result reached below.  The explicit holding of the Court, however, is plainly much more than an “indication.” “Thus the view that the jurisdiction of the District Court to issue the writ in cases such as this is restricted to those petitioners who are confined or detained within the territorial jurisdiction of the court is supported by the language of the statute, by considerations of policy, and by the legislative history of the enactment.  We therefore do not feel free to weigh the policy considerations which are advanced for giving district courts discretion in cases like this.  If that concept is to be imported into this statute, Congress must do so.” Id., at 192-193 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).  The result reached today may be desirable from the point of view of sound judicial administration, see Ahrens v. Clark, supra, at 191 ; Nelson v. George, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 224</citedDecision> , 228 n. 5 (1970).  It is the function of this Court, however, to ascertain the intent of Congress as to the mean *510 ing of “within their respective jurisdictions.” Having completed that task in Ahrens , it is the function of Congress to amend the statute if this Court misinterpreted congressional intent or if subsequent developments suggest the desirability, from a policy viewpoint, of alterations in the statute.  See Cleveland v. United States, 329 U. S. 14 (1946).  We noted in <citedDecision>Nelson</citedDecision> that the resolution of any apparent dilemma “caused” by this Court’s holding in Ahrens is appropriately one to be undertaken by Congress.  <citedDecision>399 U. S., at 228</citedDecision> n. 5.  Legislative “inaction” in amending a statute to comport with this Court’s evaluation of “[s]ound judicial administration” hardly warrants the disingenuous reading of a previous decision to achieve the result that Congress, despite judicial prodding, has refused to mandate.  However impatient we may be with a federal statute which sometimes may fail to provide a remedy for every situation, one would have thought it inappropriate for the Court to amend the statute by judicial action.  The Court lists several “developments” that have somehow undercut the validity, in the Court’s opinion, of the statutory interpretation of the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions.” As the amended § 2255 is relevant only to federal prisoners collaterally attacking a conviction, and as § 2241 (d) applies only to intrastate jurisdiction, the relevance of the amendments with respect to the jurisdictional requirement of § 2241 (c) (3) is not a little obscure.  The interpretation of the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” in Ahrens is hardly incompatible with these recent amendments of statutes dealing with situations not involving the interstate transportation of state prisoners.  The further argument that Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137 (1953), “undermines” Ahrens overlooks the fact that the Court in Ahrens specifically reserved that question, 335 U. S., at 192 n. 4, the resolution of which is by no means an explicit rejec *511 tion of Ahrens .  Finally, the fact that this Court has expanded the notion of “custody” for habeas corpus purposes hardly supports, much less compels, the rejection of a statutory construction of an unrelated phrase.

**Combined Opinion**
 Since the petitioner's absence from the Western District of Kentucky did not deprive the court of jurisdiction, and since the respondent was properly served in that district, see Strait v. Laird, 406 U. S. 341 (1972); Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U. S. 487 (1971), the court below erred in ordering the dismissal of the petition on jurisdictional grounds.  The judgment of the Court of *501 Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Reversed and remanded.  MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the result.  I concur in the result.  The conclusion the Court reaches is not unexpected when one notes the extraordinary expansion of the concept of habeas corpus effected in recent years.
