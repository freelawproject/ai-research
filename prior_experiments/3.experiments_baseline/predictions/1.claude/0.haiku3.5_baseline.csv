In fact, the passages show the case being consistently referenced and its legal principles being reinforced. 

The passages demonstrate that Merrill v. Monticello is being used to support legal arguments about municipal bond issuance, specifically regarding the limitations of municipal corporations' power to issue negotiable bonds. In Passage 2, the case is explicitly cited with approval, with the court noting its holding about the difference between borrowing money and issuing negotiable securities. 

In Passage 3, the case is cited as part of a series of precedents supporting the principle that bonds issued without proper authority cannot be enforced, even by bona fide holders. Passage 4 further lists this case among a line of consistent judicial decisions about municipal bond issuance.

Therefore, far from being overruled, <targetCase>138 U.S. 673</targetCase> appears to be a well-established precedent being actively applied in subsequent cases.""

St. Louis Trust Co., and Becker v. St. Louis Trust Co. The language suggests the Court is comprehensively re-examining these prior precedents. The fact that the Court 'brought the cases here' indicates an intent to resolve conflicting interpretations and potentially overrule or significantly modify the previous decisions. While the full extent of overruling is not explicitly stated in these excerpts, the Court's approach strongly suggests a fundamental reconsideration of the prior case law, which meets the criteria for overruling, particularly conditions 1, 2, and 5 from the provided guidelines.""

The key indicators are:
1. The Court acknowledges 'difficulties' lower courts had in applying previous decisions
2. They note 'seeming disharmony' in prior results
3. They deliberately brought the cases to the Supreme Court to resolve these issues
4. The language implies a comprehensive review of previous precedents"

McCanless appears to be treating it as valid precedent.""
}

The key points supporting this conclusion are:
1. Justice Roberts explicitly states he is bound by the Curry v. McCanless decision
2. The case is cited multiple times without any language suggesting it has been overruled
3. The case appears to be used as supporting precedent for the legal principles being discussed
4. There is no direct statement overruling this specific case

The Court provides specific reasons for overruling Douds, noting that the previous decision had accepted congressional findings about Communist Party members that the Court now finds unconstitutional under the Bill of Attainder Clause. 

The overruling is comprehensive, as the Court indicates that the Douds decision was fundamentally incorrect in its approach to legislative findings about group characteristics. Specifically, the Court criticizes Douds for:
1. Accepting congressional inferences about Communist Party members' likely conduct
2. Permitting legislative findings that some Communists would engage in illegal activities
3. Allowing Congress to draw inferences about probable conduct based on political affiliations

The Court explicitly states that 'The Bill of Attainder Clause now forbids Congress to do precisely what was validated in Douds', making this a clear and direct overruling of the previous decision.""

The language suggests the Court is carefully parsing the earlier decision rather than completely overturning it.

However, the somewhat critical tone and detailed analysis suggest some potential weakening of the original precedent, which is why the confidence is not at 1.0.""

4. In some instances, the Court even affirms parts of the Civil Rights Cases, such as the agreement that the Thirteenth Amendment authorizes Congress to eradicate vestiges of slavery.

The repeated citations suggest the case remains good law, albeit with a broader interpretation of its principles. The Court is expanding the understanding of the Thirteenth Amendment's reach, not overruling the original case.""

The high confidence stems from the careful treatment of MacDougall as still-relevant precedent, with the Court engaging with its reasoning rather than dismissing or overruling it.""

The second passage cites the case in discussing how early American legal sources referenced common law.

The language suggests the case is being referenced as historical precedent rather than being overruled. However, the somewhat critical tone and analytical discussion leaves some room for uncertainty, which is why the confidence is not at 1.0.""

The Court notes that in Pittsburgh Press, the ordinance was upheld because the advertisements proposed illegal discriminatory hirings. Here, they are exploring the broader question of commercial speech protection, using Pittsburgh Press as a reference point.

The multiple references to Pittsburgh Press (in passages 1, 2, 3, and footnotes) without any language suggesting it has been overruled, combined with the careful analysis of its specific holding, strongly indicate the case remains good law, just with a more nuanced interpretation of commercial speech.""

The overruling appears comprehensive, with the Court noting that the decision is 'fundamentally incompatible with more than a century of constitutional development.' The language suggests a full overruling, though Justice Scalia's phrasing suggests it might be a partial overruling limited to the statute's interpretation.

The high confidence stems from the clear, direct language used by the Court in rejecting the precedent of Kentucky v. Dennison.""

The passages show the Court is consciously moving away from Fay's previous standard and replacing it with a new approach that gives more respect to state procedural rules.

The high confidence stems from the clear and direct language used by the Court in rejecting Fay's previous broad interpretation.""

""rationale"": ""The passages discuss the case <targetCase>202 U. S. 344</targetCase> (Burton v. United States) in detail, but do not explicitly overrule it. Instead, the text provides a nuanced interpretation of the case's precedential value. 

The passages suggest that Burton was a limited precedent, primarily notable for how it handled a double jeopardy claim on a demurrer (legal pleading). The text argues that Burton does not definitively establish the Blockburger test as the exclusive standard for successive prosecutions, but does not overturn the case itself.

The analysis includes detailed discussion of the case's procedural context and limitations, but this amounts to distinguishing or narrowing the precedent rather than fully overruling it. The authors critique how the case might have been interpreted, but do not declare it overruled.

4. In Part VI, explicitly rejecting arguments similar to those in Rubin
5. In Part VII, noting details about the case

The Court treats Rubin as good law and uses it to support its reasoning about commercial speech restrictions. While the Court critiques some prior reasoning about commercial speech regulations, it does not overrule Rubin itself. The citations suggest the case remains a valid precedent for commercial speech analysis, particularly regarding alcohol-related advertising.""

In Passage 2, the text explicitly states that the Court has only 'narrowed Parden' with respect to the second issue (how clearly Congress must speak), not the first issue (whether Congress has the power to require a State to waive its immunity). 

The case <targetCase>411 U.S. 279</targetCase> (Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo.) is discussed as limiting Parden's application, but not completely overruling it. The passage notes that the limitation was primarily about the 'clarity' of Congress's intent, not a complete rejection of the original ruling.

The Court seems to have significantly restricted Parden's scope by:
1. Characterizing it as involving 'dramatic circumstances'
2. Distinguishing it based on the type of enterprise involved
3. Emphasizing a more stringent standard for waiver of sovereign immunity

However, the fundamental principle of Parden was not completely overturned, which supports a 'no' to full overruling.""
