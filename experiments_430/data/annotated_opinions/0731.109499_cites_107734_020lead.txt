 Appellants in these cases include individual cities and States, the National League of Cities, and the National Governors' Conference; 7 they brought an action in the District *837 Court for the District of Columbia which challenged the validity of the 1974 amendments.  They asserted in effect that when Congress sought to apply the Fair Labor Standards Act provisions virtually across the board to employees of state and municipal governments it “infringed a constitutional prohibition” running in favor of the States as States.  The gist of their complaint was not that the conditions of employment of such public employees were beyond the scope of the commerce power had those employees been employed in the private sector but that the established constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental immunity consistently recognized in a long series of our cases affirmatively prevented the exercise of this authority in the manner which Congress chose in the 1974 amendments.  I In a series of amendments beginning in 1961 Congress began to extend the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act to some types of public employees.  The 1961 amendments to the Act 8 extended its coverage to persons who were employed in “enterprises” engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce.  9 And in 1966, with the amendment of the definition of employers under the Act, the exemption heretofore extended to the States and their political subdivisions was *838 removed with respect to employees of state hospitals, institutions, and schools.  10 We nevertheless sustained the validity of the combined effect of these two amendments in Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968).  In 1974, Congress again broadened the coverage of the Act, 88 Stat, 55.  The definition of “employer” in the Act now specifically “includes a public agency,” 29 U. S. C. §203 (d) (1970 ed., Supp, IV).  In addition, the critical definition of “[e]nterprise[s] engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce” was expanded to encompass “an activity of a public agency,” and goes on to specify that “[t]he employees of an enterprise which is a public agency shall for purposes of this subsection be deemed to be employees engaged in commerce, or in the production of goods for commerce, or employees handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for commerce.” 29 U; S. C. §203 (s)(5) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  Under the amendments “[p]ublic agency” is in turn defined as including “the Government of the United States; the government of a State or political subdivision thereof; any agency of the United States (including the United States Postal Service and Postal Rate Commission), a State, or a political subdivision of a State; or any interstate governmental agency.” 29 U. S. C. § 203 (x) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  By its 1974 amendments, then, Congress has now entirely removed the exemption previously afforded States and their political subdivisions, substituting only the Act’s general exemption for executive, administrative, or pro *839 fession^l personnel, 29 U. S. C. §213 (a)(1), which is supplemented by provisions excluding from the Act’s coverage those individuals holding public elective office or serving such an officeholder in one of several specific capacities.  29 U. S. C. § 203 (e) (2) (C) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  The Act thus imposes upon almost all public employment the minimum wage and maximum hour requirements previously restricted to employees engaged in interstate commerce.  These requirements are essentially identical to those imposed upon private employers, although the Act does attempt to make some provision for public employment relationships which are without counterpart in the private sector, such as those presented by fire protection and law enforcement personnel.  See 29 U. S. C. §207 (k) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  Challenging these 1974 amendments in the District Court, appellants sought both declaratory and injunc-tive relief against the amendments’ application to them, and a three-judge court was accordingly convened pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 2282 .  That court, after hearing argument on the law from the parties, granted appel-lee Secretary of Labor’s motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief might be granted.  The District Court stated it was “troubled” by appellants’ contentions that the amendments would intrude upon the States’ performance of essential governmental functions.  The court went on to say that it considered their contentions “substantial and that it may well be that the Supreme Court will feel it appropriate to draw back from the far-reaching implications of [Maryland v. <citedDecision>Wirtz, supra];</citedDecision> but that is a decision that only the Supreme Court can make, and as a Federal district court we feel obliged to apply the Wirtz opinion as it stands.” National League of Cities v. Brennan, 406 F. Supp, 826, 828 (DC 1974).  *840 We noted probable jurisdiction in order to consider the important questions recognized by the District Court. 420 U. S. 906 (1975).  11 We agree with the District Court that the appellants' contentions are substantial.  Indeed upon full consideration of the question we have decided that the “far-reaching implications” of <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> should be overruled, and that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed.  II It is established beyond peradventure that the Commerce Clause of Art. I of the Constitution is a grant of plenary authority to Congress.  That authority is, in the words of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), “the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.” Id., at 196.  When considering the validity of asserted applications of this power to wholly private activity, the Court has made it clear that “[e]ven activity that is purely intrastate in char^ acter may be regulated by Congress, where the activity, combined with like conduct by others similarly situated, affects commerce among the States or with foreign nations.” Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 547 (1975).  Congressional power over areas of private endeavor, even when its exercise may pre-empt express state-law determinations contrary to the result which has commended itself to the collective wisdom of Congress, has been held to be limited only by the requirement that “the means chosen by [Congress] must be reasonably adapted to the end permitted by the Constitution.” Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 262 (1964).  *841 Appellants in no way challenge these decisions establishing the breadth of authority granted Congress under the commerce power.  Their contention, on the contrary, is that when Congress seeks to regulate directly the activities of States as public employers, it transgresses an affirmative limitation on the exercise of its power akin to other commerce power affirmative limitations contained in the Constitution.

 Appellants’ essential contention is that the 1974 amendments to the Act, while undoubtedly within the scope of the Commerce Clause, encounter a similar constitutional barrier because they are to be applied directly to the States and subdivisions of States as employers.  12 *842 This Court has never doubted that there are limits upon the power of Congress to override state sovereignty, even when exercising its otherwise plenary powers to tax or to regulate commerce which are conferred- by Art. I of the Constitution.  In Wirts, for example, the Court took care to assure the appellants that it had “ample power to prevent .  .  .  'the utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity/ ” which they feared.  <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 196</citedDecision> .  Appellee Secretary in this case, both in his brief and upon oral argument, has agreed that our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.  See, e. g., Brief for Appellee 30-41; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-43.  In Fry, supra, the Court recognized that an express declaration of this limitation is found in the Tenth Amendment: “While the Tenth Amendment has been characterized as a 'truism/ stating merely that 'all is retained which has not been surrendered,' United States v. *843 Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 124 (1941), it is not without significance.  The Amendment expressly declares the constitutional policy that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States’ integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.” 421 U. S., at 547 n. 7.  In New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), Mr. Chief Justice Stone, speaking for four Members of an eight-Member Court 13 in rejecting the proposition that Congress could impose taxes on the States so long as it did so in a nondiscriminatory manner, observed: “A State may, like a private individual, own real property and receive income.  But in view of our former decisions we could hardly say that a general non-discriminatory real estate tax (apportioned), or an income tax laid upon citizens and States alike could be constitutionally applied to the State’s capitol, its State-house, its public school houses, public parks, or its revenues from taxes or school lands, even though all real property and all income of the citizen .is taxed.” Id., at 587-588 .

 If Congress may withdraw from the States the authority to make those fundamental employment decisions upon which their systems for performance of these functions must rest, we think there would be little left of the States’ “ ‘separate and independent existence.’ ” Coyle, 221 U. S., at 580 .  Thus, even if appellants may have overestimated the effect which the Act will have upon *852 their current levels and patterns of governmental activity, the dispositive factor is that Congress has attempted to exercise its Commerce Clause authority to prescribe minimum wages and maximum hours to be paid by the States in their capacities as sovereign governments.  In so doing, Congress has sought to wield its power in a fashion that would impair the States' “ability to function effectively in a federal system,” Fry, 421 U. S., at 547 n. 7.  This exercise of congressional authority does not comport with the federal system of government embodied in the Constitution.  We hold that insofar as the challenged amendments operate to directly displace the States’ freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions, they are not within the authority granted Congress by Art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  17 Ill One final matter requires our attention.  Appellee has vigorously urged that we cannot, consistently with the Court’s decisions in Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968), and Fry, supra, rule against him here.  It is important to examine this contention so that it will be clear what we hold today, and what we do not.  With regard to Fry , we disagree with appellee.  There the Court held that the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 was constitutional as applied to temporarily freeze the wages of state and local government employees.  The Court expressly noted that the degree of intrusion upon the protected area of state sovereignty was in that case *853 even less than that worked by the amendments to the FLSA which were before the Court in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> .  The Court recognized that the Economic Stabilization Act was “an emergency measure to counter severe inflation that threatened the national economy.” 421 U. S., at 548 .  We think our holding today quite consistent with Fry .  The enactment at issue there was occasioned by an extremely serious problem which endangered the well-being of all the component parts of our federal system and which only collective action by the National Government might forestall.  The means selected were carefully drafted so as not to interfere with the States’ freedom beyond a very limited, specific period of time.  The effect of the across-the-board freeze authorized by that Act, moreover, displaced no state choices as to how governmental operations should be structured, nor did it force the States to remake such choices themselves.  Instead, it merely required that the wage scales and employment relationships which the States themselves had chosen be maintained during the period of the emergency.  Finally, the Economic Stabilization Act operated to reduce the pressures upon state budgets rather than increase them.  These factors distinguish the statute in Fry from the provisions at issue here.  The limits imposed upon the commerce power when Congress seeks to apply it to the States are not so inflexible as to preclude temporary enactments tailored to combat a national emergency.  “[Although an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived, nevertheless emergency may afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed.” Wilson v. New, 243 U. S. 332, 348 (1917).  With respect to the Court’s decision in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , we reach a different conclusion.  Both appellee and the District Court thought that decision required rejection of appel *854 lants’ claims.  Appellants, in turn, advance several arguments by which they seek to distinguish the facts before the Court in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> from those presented by the 1974 amendments to the Act.  There are undoubtedly factual distinctions between the two situations, but in view of the conclusions expressed earlier in this opinion we do not believe the reasoning in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> may any longer be regarded as authoritative.  <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> relied heavily on the Court’s decision in United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936).  The opinion quotes the following language from that case: “‘[We] look to the activities in which the states have traditionally engaged as marking the boundary of the restriction upon the federal taxing power.  But there is no such limitation upon the plenary power to regulate commerce.  The state can no more deny the power if its exercise has been authorized by Congress than can an individual.’ 297 U. S., at 185 .” <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 198</citedDecision> .  But we have reaffirmed today that the States as States stand on a quite different footing from an individual or a corporation when challenging the exercise of Congress’ power to regulate commerce.  We think the dicta 18 from *855 United States v. California , simply wrong.  19 Congress may not exercise that power so as to force directly upon the States its choices as to how essential decisions regarding the conduct of integral governmental functions are to be made.  We agree that such assertions of power, if unchecked, would indeed, as Mr. Justice Douglas cautioned in his dissent in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , allow “the National Government [to] devour the essentials of state sovereignty,” <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 205</citedDecision> , and would therefore transgress the bounds of the authority granted Congress under the Commerce Clause.  While there are obvious differences between the schools and hospitals involved in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , and the fire and police departments affected'here, each provides an integral portion of those governmental services which the States and their political subdivisions have traditionally afforded their citizens.  20 We are therefore persuaded that <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> must be overruled.  *856 The judgment of the District Court is accordingly reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  So ordered.  The Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 52 Stat. 1060 , 29 U. S. C. §201 et seq. (1940 ed.).  §206 (a) (1940 ed.).  § 207 (a)(3) (1940 ed.).  §211 (c) (1940 ed.).
