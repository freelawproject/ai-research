<p id="b680-8">The State of Montana has approximately 25% of all known United States coal reserves, and more than 50% of the Nation’s low-sulfur coal reserves.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Department of Energy, Demonstrated Reserve Base of Coal in the United States on January 1, 1979, p. 8 (1981); National Coal Assn., Coal Data 1978, p. 1-6 (1980). Approximately 70-75% of Montana’s <page-number citation-index="1" label="639">*639</page-number>coal lies under land owned by the Federal Government in the State. See Hearings on H. It. 6625, H. R. 6654, and H. R. 7163 before the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 22 (1980) (Hearings) (statement of Rep. Vento). The great bulk of the coal mined in Montana — indeed, allegedly as much as 90%, see <em>ante, </em>at 617-618 — is exported to other States pursuant to long-term purchase contracts with out-of-state utilities. See H. R. Rep. No. 96-1527, pt. 1, pp. 3-4 (1980). Those contracts typically provide that the costs of state taxation shall be passed on to the utilities; in turn, fuel adjustment clauses allow the utilities to pass the cost of taxation along to their consumers. <em><span class="citation" data-id="109615"><a href="/opinion/109615/complete-auto-transit-inc-v-brady/" aria-description="Citation for case: Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady">Ibid.</a></span> </em>Because federal environmental legislation has increased the demand for low-sulfur coal, <em>id., </em>at 3, and because the Montana coal fields occupy a “pivotal” geographic position in the midwestern and northwestern energy markets, see J. Krutilla &amp; A. Fisher with R. Rice, Economic and Fiscal Impacts of Coal Development: Northern Great Plains xvi (1978) (Krutilla), Montana has supplied an increasing percentage of the Nation’s coal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b681-5">In 1975, following the Arab oil embargo and the first federal coal conversion legislation, the Montana Legislature,. by 1975 Mont. Laws, ch. 525, increased the State’s severance tax on coal from a flat rate of approximately 34 cents per ton to a maximum rate of 30% of the “contract sales price.” <span class="citation no-link">Mont. Code Ann. § 15-35-103</span> (1979).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See H. R. Rep. No. 96-1527, pt. 1, p. 3 (1980). The legislative history of this tax is illuminating. The Joint Conference Committees of the Mon<page-number citation-index="1" label="640">*640</page-number>tana Legislature that recommended this amendment acknowledged : “It is true that this is a higher rate of taxation than that levied by any other American state on the coal industry/’ <footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Statement to Accompany the Report “of the Free Joint Conference Committees on Coal Taxation 1 (1975). The Committees pointed out, however, that the Province of Alberta, Canada, recently had raised sharply its royalty on natural gas, thereby forcing consumers of Alberta gas in Montana and elsewhere to finance involuntarily Alberta’s “universities, hospitals, reduction of other taxes, etc.” <em><span class="citation no-link">Ibid.</span> </em>Stating that “we should . . . look north to Alberta,” the Conference Committees observed: “While coal is not as scarce as natural gas, most of the Montana coal now produced is committed for sale under long-term contracts and will be purchased with this tax added to its price.” <em><span class="citation no-link">Ibid.</span> </em>The Committees noted that although some new coal contracts might shift to Wyoming to take advantage of that State’s lower severance tax, Montana’s severance tax was comparable to that recently enacted by North Dakota.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, the Com<page-number citation-index="1" label="641">*641</page-number>mittees had no doubt that the coal industry would grow even with this tax, since “the combined coal reserves of Montana and North Dakota are simply too great a part of the nation’s fossil fuel resources to be ignored because of taxes at these levels.”<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em><span class="citation no-link">Ibid.</span></em></p>
<p id="b683-5">As the Montana Legislature foresaw, the imposition of this severance tax has generated enormous revenues for the State. Montana collected $33.6 million in severance taxes in fiscal year 1978, H. R. Rep. No. 96-1527, pt. 1, p. 3 (1980), and appellants alleged that it would collect not less than $40 million in fiscal year 1979. App. to Juris. Statement 55a. It has been suggested that by the year 2010, Montana will have collected more than $20 billion through the implementation of this tax. Hearings 22 (statement of Rep. Vento).</p>
<p id="b684-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="642">*642</page-number>No less remarkable is the increasing percentage of total revenue represented by the severance tax. In 1972, the then-current flat rate severance tax on coal provided only 0.4% of Montana’s total tax revenue; in contrast, in the year following the 1975 amendment, the coal severance tax supplied 11.4% of the State’s total tax revenue. See Griffin &amp; Shelton, Coal Severance Tax Policies in the Rocky Mountain States, 7 Policy Studies J. 29, 33 (1978) (Griffin). Appellants assert that the tax now supplies almost 20% of the State’s total revenue. Tr. of Oral Arg. 31. Indeed, the funds generated by the tax have been so large that, beginning in 1980, at least 50% of the severance tax is to be transferred and dedicated to a permanent trust .fund, the principal of which must “forever remain inviolate” unless appropriated by a vote of three-fourths of the members of each house of the legislature. Mont. Const., Art. IX, § 5. Moreover, in 1979, Montana passed legislation providing property and income tax relief for state residents. 1979 Mont. Laws, ch. 698.</p>
<p id="b684-5">Appellants’ complaint alleged that Montana’s severance tax is ultimately borne by out-of-state consumers, and for the purposes of this appeal that allegation is to be treated as true.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellants further alleged that the tax bears no reasonable relationship to the services or protection provided by the State. The issue here, of course, is whether they are entitled to a trial on that claim, not whether they will succeed on the merits. It should be noted, however, that Montana imposes numerous other taxes upon coal mining.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addi<page-number citation-index="1" label="643">*643</page-number>tion, because 70% to 75%• of the coal-bearing land in Montana is owned by the Federal Government, Montana derives a large amount of coal mining revenue from the United States as well,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In light of these circumstances, the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee of the United States House of Representatives concluded that Montana’s coal severance tax results in revenues “far in excess of the direct and indirect impact costs attributable to the coal production.” H. R. Rep. No. 96-1527, pt. 1, p. 2 (1980). Several commentators have agreed that Montana and other similarly situated Western States have pursued a policy of “OPEC-like revenue maximization,” and that the Montana tax accordingly bears no reasonable relationship to the services and protection afforded by the State. R. Nehring &amp; B. Zycher with J. Wharton, Coal Development and Government Regulation in the Northern Great Plains: A Preliminary Report 148 (1976); Church, at 272. See Krutilla, at 185. These findings, of course, are not dispositive of the issue whether the Montana severance tax is “fairly related” to the services <page-number citation-index="1" label="644">*644</page-number>provided by the State within the meaning of our prior cases. They do suggest, however, that appellants’ claim is a substantial one. The failure of the Court to acknowledge this stems, it seems to me, from a misreading of our prior cases. It is to those cases that I now turn.</p>
<p id="b686-7">h — t hH</p>
<p id="b686-3">This Court’s Commerce Clause cases have been marked by-tension between two competing concepts: the view that interstate commerce should enjoy a “free trade” immunity from state taxation, see, <em>e. g., Freeman </em>v. <em>Hewit, </em><span class="citation" data-id="9419897"><a href="/opinion/104339/freeman-v-hewit/#252" aria-description="Citation for case: Freeman v. Hewit">329 U. S. 249, 252</a></span> (1946), and the view that interstate commerce may be required to “ 'pay its way,’ ” see, <em>e. g., Western Live Stock </em>v. <em>Bureau of Revenue, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102972"><a href="/opinion/102972/western-live-stock-v-bureau-of-revenue/#254" aria-description="Citation for case: Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue">303 U. S. 250, 254</a></span> (1938). See generally <em>Complete Auto Transit, Inc. </em>v. <em>Brady, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109615"><a href="/opinion/109615/complete-auto-transit-inc-v-brady/#278" aria-description="Citation for case: Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady">430 U. S., at 278-281, 288-289, n. 15</a></span>; Simet &amp; Lynn, Interstate Commerce Must Pay Its Way: The Demise of Spector, 31 Nat. Tax J. 53 (1978); Hellerstein, Foreword, State Taxation Under the Commerce Clause: An Historical Perspective, 29 Yand. L. Rev. 335, 335-339 (1976). In <em>Complete Auto Transit, </em>the Court resolved that tension by unanimously reaffirming that interstate commerce is not immune from state taxation. <span class="citation" data-id="109615"><a href="/opinion/109615/complete-auto-transit-inc-v-brady/#288" aria-description="Citation for case: Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady">430 U. S., at 288</a></span>. But at the same time the Court made clear that not all state taxation of interstate commerce is valid; a state tax will be sustained against Commerce Clause challenge <em>only </em>if “the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.” <span class="citation" data-id="109615"><a href="/opinion/109615/complete-auto-transit-inc-v-brady/#279" aria-description="Citation for case: Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady"><em>Id., </em>at 279</a></span>. See <em>Maryland </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110488"><a href="/opinion/110488/maryland-v-louisiana/#754" aria-description="Citation for case: Maryland v. Louisiana">451 U. S. 725, 754</a></span> (1981).</p>
<p id="b686-4">The Court today acknowledges and, indeed, holds that a Commerce Clause challenge to a state severance tax must be evaluated under <em>Complete Auto Transit’s </em>four-part test. <em>Ante, at </em>617. I fully agree. I cannot <em>agree, </em>however, with the Court’s application of that test to the facts of the present case. Appellants concede, and the Court properly concludes, <page-number citation-index="1" label="645">*645</page-number>that the first two prongs of the test — substantial nexus and fair apportionment — are satisfied here. The Court also correctly observes that Montana’s severance tax is facially neutral. It does not automatically follow, however, that the Montana severance tax does not unduly burden or interfere with interstate commerce. The gravamen of appellants’ complaint is that the severance tax does not satisfy the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit </em>test because it is tailored to, and does, force interstate commerce to pay <em>more </em>than its way. Under our established precedents, appellants are entitled to a trial on this claim.</p>
<p id="b687-5">The Court’s conclusion to the contrary rests on the premise that the relevant inquiry under the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit </em>test is simply whether the <em>measure </em>of the tax is fixed as a percentage of the value of the coal taken. <em>Ante, </em>at 626. This interpretation emasculates the fourth prong. No trial will ever be necessary on the issue of fair relationship so long as a State is careful to impose a proportional rather than a flat tax rate; thus, the Court’s rule is no less “mechanical” than the approach entertained in <em>Heisler </em>v. <em>Thomas Colliery Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="100063"><a href="/opinion/100063/heisler-v-thomas-colliery-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co.">260 U. S. 245</a></span> (1922), disapproved today, <em>ante, </em>at 617.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Under the Court’s reasoning, any ad valorem tax will satisfy the fourth prong; indeed, the Court implicitly ratifies Montana’s contention that it is free to tax this coal at 100% or even 1,000% of value, should it <page-number citation-index="1" label="646">*646</page-number>choose to do so. Tr. of Oral Arg. 21. Likewise, the Court’s analysis indicates that Montana’s severance tax would not run afoul of the Commerce Clause even if it raised sufficient revenue to allow Montana to eliminate all other taxes upon its citizens.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b688-5">The Court’s prior cases neither require nor support such a startling result.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Court often has noted that “‘[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their <em>just share </em>of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business.’ ” <em>Complete Auto Transit, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109615"><a href="/opinion/109615/complete-auto-transit-inc-v-brady/#279" aria-description="Citation for case: Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v.

Accordingly, <page-number citation-index="1" label="647">*647</page-number>interstate commerce cannot claim any exemption from a state tax that “is fairly related to the services provided by the State.” <em>Complete Auto Transit, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109615"><a href="/opinion/109615/complete-auto-transit-inc-v-brady/#279" aria-description="Citation for case: Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v.

We have not interpreted this requirement of “fair relation” in a narrow sense; interstate commerce may be required to share equally with intrastate commerce the cost of providing “police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and ‘the advantages of a civilized society.’ ” <em>Exxon Corp. </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110297"><a href="/opinion/110297/exxon-corp-v-department-of-revenue-of-wis/#228" aria-description="Citation for case: Exxon Corp. v.

See, <em>e. g., Nippert </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104253"><a href="/opinion/104253/nippert-v-city-of-richmond/#433" aria-description="Citation for case: Nippert v. City of Richmond">327 U. S. 416, 433</a></span> (1946). Moreover, interstate commerce can be required to “pay its own way” in a narrower sense as well: the State may tax interstate commerce for the purpose of recovering those costs attributable to the activity itself. See, <em>e. g., Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em><span class="citation" data-id="99328"><a href="/opinion/99328/postal-telegraph-cable-co-v-city-of-richmond/" aria-description="Citation for case: Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v.

<p id="b690-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="648">*648</page-number>The Court has never suggested, however, that interstate commerce may be required to pay <em>more </em>than its own way. The Court today fails to recognize that the Commerce Clause does impose limits upon the State’s power to impose even facially neutral and properly apportioned taxes. See <em>ante, </em>at 622-623. In <em>Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. </em>v. <em>Calvert, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105195"><a href="/opinion/105195/michigan-wisconsin-pipe-line-co-v-calvert/#163" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert">347 U. S. 157, 163</a></span> (1954), Texas argued that no inquiry into the constitutionality of a facially neutral tax on the “taking” of gas was necessary because the State “has afforded great benefits and protection to pipeline companies.” The <em><span class="citation" data-id="105195"><a href="/opinion/105195/michigan-wisconsin-pipe-line-co-v-calvert/" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert">Calvert</a></span> </em>Court rejected this argument, holding that “these benefits are relevant here only to show that the essential requirements of due process have been met sufficiently to justify the imposition of <em>any </em>tax on the interstate activity.” <span class="citation" data-id="105195"><a href="/opinion/105195/michigan-wisconsin-pipe-line-co-v-calvert/#163" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert"><em>Id., </em>at 163-164</a></span>. The Court held, <span class="citation" data-id="105195"><a href="/opinion/105195/michigan-wisconsin-pipe-line-co-v-calvert/#164" aria-description="Citation for case: Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert"><em>id., </em>at 164</a></span>, that when a tax is challenged on Commerce Clause grounds its validity “ ‘depends upon other considerations of constitutional policy having reference to the substantial effects, actual or potential, of the particular tax in suppressing or burdening unduly the commerce,’ ” quoting <em>Nippert </em>v. <em>Richmond, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104253"><a href="/opinion/104253/nippert-v-city-of-richmond/#424" aria-description="Citation for case: Nippert v. City of Richmond">327 U. S., at 424</a></span>. Accordingly, while <page-number citation-index="1" label="649">*649</page-number>the Commerce Clause does not require that interstate commerce be placed in a privileged position, it does require that it not be unduly burdened. In framing its taxing measures to reach interstate commerce, the State must be “at pains to do so in a manner which avoids the evils forbidden by the commerce clause and puts that commerce <em>actually </em>on a plane of equality with local trade in local taxation.” <em>Nippert, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104253"><a href="/opinion/104253/nippert-v-city-of-richmond/#434" aria-description="Citation for case: Nippert v. City of Richmond">327 U. S., at 434</a></span> (emphasis added).</p>
<p id="b691-5">Thus, the Court has been particularly vigilant to review taxes that “single out interstate business,” since “[a]ny tailored tax of this sort creates an increased danger of error in apportionment, of discrimination against interstate commerce, and of a lack of relationship to the services provided by the State.” <em>Complete Auto Transit, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109615"><a href="/opinion/109615/complete-auto-transit-inc-v-brady/#288" aria-description="Citation for case: Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady">430 U. S., at 288-289, n. 15</a></span>.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court’s vigilance has not been limited to taxes that discriminate upon their face: “Not the tax in a vacuum of words, but its practical consequences for the doing of interstate commerce in applications to concrete facts are our concern.” <em>Nippert, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104253"><a href="/opinion/104253/nippert-v-city-of-richmond/#431" aria-description="Citation for case: Nippert v.

Louisiana">451 U. S., at 756</a></span>. This is particularly true when the challenged tax, while facially neutral, falls so heavily upon interstate commerce that its burden “is not likely to be alleviated by those political restraints which are normally exerted on legislation where it affects adversely interests within the state.” <em>McGoldrick </em>v. <em>Berwind-White Co., </em><span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./309/33/">309 U. S. 33</a></span>, 46, n. 2 (1940). Cf. <em>Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rice, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109771"><a href="/opinion/109771/raymond-motor-transportation-inc-v-rice/#446" aria-description="Citation for case: Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice">434 U. S. 429, 446-447</a></span> (1978). In sum, then, when a tax has been “tailored” to reach interstate com<page-number citation-index="1" label="650">*650</page-number>merce, the Court’s cases suggest that we require a closer “fit” under the fourth prong of the <em>Complete Auto Transit </em>test than when interstate commerce has not been singled out by the challenged tax.</p>
<p id="b692-5">As a number of commentators have noted, state severance taxes upon minerals are particularly susceptible to “tailoring.” “Like a tollgate lying athwart a trade route, a severance or processing tax conditions access to natural resources.” Developments in the Law: Federal Limitations on State Taxation of Interstate Business, <span class="citation no-link">75 Harv. L. Rev. 953</span>, 970 (1962). Thus, to the extent that the taxing jurisdiction approaches a monopoly position in the mineral, and consumption is largely outside the State, such taxes are “[economically and politically analogous to transportation taxes exploiting geographical position.” Brown, The Open Economy: Justice Frankfurter and the Position of the Judiciary, 67 Yale L. J. 219, 232 (1957) (Brown). See also Hellerstein, Constitutional Constraints on State and Local Taxation of Energy Resources, 31 Nat. Tax J. 245, 249-250 (1978); R. Posner, Economic Analysis of Law 510-514 (2d ed. 1977) (Posner). But just as a port State may require that imports pay their own way even though the tax levied increases the cost of goods purchased by inland customers, see <em>Michelin Tire Corp. </em>v. <em>Wages, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109344"><a href="/opinion/109344/michelin-tire-corp-v-wages/#288" aria-description="Citation for case: Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages">423 U. S. 276, 288</a></span> (1976),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> so also may a mineral-rich State require that those who consume its resources pay a fair share of the general costs of government, as well as the specific costs attributable to the commerce itself. Thus, the mere fact that the burden of a severance tax is largely shifted forward to out-of-state consumers does not, standing alone, make out a Commerce Clause violation. See Hellerstein, <em>supra, </em>at 249. But the Clause <em>is </em>violated when, as appellants allege is the case here, the State effectively selects “a class of out-of-state <page-number citation-index="1" label="651">*651</page-number>taxpayers to shoulder a tax burden grossly in excess of any costs imposed directly or indirectly by such taxpayers on the State.” <em>Ibid.</em></p>
<p id="b693-4">Ill</p>
<p id="b693-5">It is true that a trial in this case would require “complex factual inquiries” into whether economic conditions are such that Montana is in fact able to export the burden of its severance tax, <em>ante, </em>at 619, n. 8.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I do not believe, however, that this threshold inquiry is beyond judicial competence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> If the trial court were to determine that the tax is exported, it would then have to determine whether the tax is “fairly related,” within the meaning of <em>Complete Auto Transit. </em>The Court to the contrary, this would not require the trial court “to second-guess legislative decisions about the amount or disposition of tax revenues.” <em>Ante, </em>at 627, n. 16. If the tax is in fact a legitimate general revenue measure identical or roughly comparable to taxes imposed upon similar industries, a court’s inquiry is at an end; on the other hand, if the tax <page-number citation-index="1" label="652">*652</page-number>singles out this particular interstate activity and charges it with a grossly disproportionate share of the general costs of government,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the court must determine whether there is some reasonable basis for the legislative judgment that the tax is necessary to compensate the State for the particular costs imposed by the activity.</p>
