 Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978).  The Geer analysis has also been eroded to the point of virtual extinction in cases involving regulation of wild animals.  The first challenge to Geer’s, theory of a State’s power over wild animals came in Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920).  The State of Missouri, relying on the theory of state ownership of wild animals, attacked the Migratory Bird Treaty Act on the ground that it interfered with the State’s control over wild animals within its boundaries.  Writing for the Court, Mr. Justice Holmes upheld the Act as a proper *332 exercise of the treatymaking power.  He commented in passing on the artificiality of the Geer rationale: “To put the claim of the State upon title is to lean upon a slender reed.” 252 U. S., at 434 .  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, <citedDecision>278 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1928), undermined Geer even more directly.  A Louisiana statute forbade the transportation beyond the State of shrimp taken in Louisiana waters until the heads and shells had been removed.  10 The statute clearly relied on the Geer state-control-of-ownership rationale.  11 Anyone lawfully taking shrimp from Louisiana waters was granted “a qualified interest which may be sold within the State.” Only after the head and shell *333 had been removed within the State did the taker or possessor acquire “title and the right to sell and ship the same ‘beyond the limit[s] of the State, without restriction or reservation.’ ” <citedDecision>278 U. S., at 8</citedDecision> .  Ignoring the niceties of “title” to the shrimp and concentrating instead on the purposes and effects of the statute, Foster-Fountain Packing struck down the statute as economic protectionism abhorrent to the Commerce Clause.  The analysis resembled that employed in the natural gas cases, which were cited with approval, <citedDecision>id., at 10-11, 13</citedDecision> .  12 Geer was distinguished on the ground that there “[n]o part of the game was permitted by the statute to become an article of interstate commerce.” <citedDecision>278 U. S., at 12</citedDecision> .  13 Limiting Geer to cases involving complete embargoes on interstate commerce in a wild animal created the anomalous result that the most burdensome laws enjoyed the most protection from Commerce Clause attack.  Foster-Fountain Packing’s implicit shift away from Geer’s formalistic “ownership” analysis became explicit in Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 402 (1948), which struck down as violations of the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and *334 Immunities Clause certain South Carolina laws discriminating against out-of-state commercial fishermen: “The whole ownership theory, in fact, is now generally regarded as but a fiction expressive in legal shorthand of the importance to its people that a State have power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of an important resource.  And there is no necessary conflict between that vital policy consideration and the constitutional command that the State exercise that power, like its other powers, so as not to discriminate without reason against citizens of other States.” Although stated in reference to the Privileges and Immunities Clause challenge, this reasoning is equally applicable to the Commerce Clause challenge.  14 Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 (1977), dispelled any doubts on that score.  In rejecting the argument that Virginia’s “ownership” of fish swimming in its territorial waters empowered the State to forbid fishing by federally licensed ships owned by nonresidents while permitting residents to fish, Seacoast Products explicitly embraced the analysis of the Geer dissenters: “A State does not stand in the same position as the owner of a private game preserve and it is pure fantasy to talk of 'owning’ wild fish, birds, or animals.  Neither the States nor the Federal Government, any more than a hopeful fisherman or hunter, has title to these creatures until they are reduced to possession by skillful capture.... Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519, 539-540 (1896) *335 (Field, J., dissenting).

 Overruling Geer also eliminates the anomaly, created by the decisions distinguishing Geer , that statutes imposing the most extreme burdens on interstate commerce (essentially total embargoes) were the most immune from challenge.  At the same time, the general rule we adopt in this case makes ample allowance for preserving, in ways not *336 inconsistent with the Commerce Clause, the legitimate state concerns for conservation and protection of wild animals underlying the 19th-century legal fiction of state ownership.  II We turn then to the question whether the burden imposed on interstate commerce in wild game by § 4-115 (B) is permissible under the general rule articulated in our precedents governing other types of commerce.  See, e. g., Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S., at 142 , quoted, supra, at 331.  Under that general rule, we must inquire (1) whether the challenged statute regulates evenhandedly with only “incidental” effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce either on its face or in practical effect; (2) whether the statute serves a legitimate local purpose; and, if so, (3) whether alternative means could promote this local purpose as well without discriminating against interstate commerce.  The burden to show discrimination rests on the party challenging the validity of the statute, but “[w]hen discrimination against commerce ... is demonstrated, the burden falls on the State to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve, the local interests at stake.” Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, 432 U. S. 333, 353 (1977).  Furthermore, when considering the purpose of a challenged statute, this Court is not bound by “[t]he name, description or characterization given it by the legislature or the courts of the State,” but will determine for itself the practical impact of the law. Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545, 550 (1924); see Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. <citedDecision>Haydel, 278 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> ; Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., supra. Section 4-115 (B.) on its face discriminates against interstate commerce.  It forbids the transportation of natural min *337 nows out of the State for purposes of sale, and thus “overtly blocks the flow of interstate commerce at [the] State’s borders.” Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 624 .  Such facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect, regardless of the State’s purpose, because “the evil of protectionism can reside in legislative means as well as legislative ends.” Id., at 626 .  17 At a minimum such facial discrimination invokes the strictest scrutiny of any purported legitimate local purpose and of the absence of nondiscriminatory alternatives.  Oklahoma argues that § A-115 (B) serves a legitimate local purpose in that it is “readily apparent as a conservation measure.” Brief for Appellee 8.  The State’s interest in maintaining the ecological balance in state waters by avoiding the removal of inordinate numbers of minnows may well qualify as a legitimate local purpose.  We consider the States’ interests in conservation and protection of wild animals as legitimate local purposes similar to the States’ interests in protecting the health and safety of their citizens.

 The state legislature may have been encouraged to take such action by certain language in Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545 (1924), language also relied on by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in this case. Lacoste upheld a Louisiana “severance” tax on the skins of all wild furbearing animals and alligators taken in the State.  The Court cited Geer for the proposition that: “The wild animals within its borders are, so far as capable of ownership, owned by the State in its sovereign capacity for the common benefit of all of its people.  Because of such ownership, and in the exercise of its police power the State may regulate and control the taking, subsequent use and property rights that may be acquired therein.” 263 U. S., at 549 .  Nevertheless, Lacoste expressly declined to uphold the tax “by virtue of the power of the State to prohibit, and therefore to condition, the removal of wild game from the State.” Ibid. Rather than reach this issue, the Court upheld the measure as a valid police regulation designed to conserve and protect wild animals, noting that the tax applied to all skins taken within the State, whether kept within the State or shipped out.  Id., at 550-551 .  Thus, despite its citation of Geer, Lacoste is actually more compatible with the cases following the views of the Justices dissenting in Geer .  The preamble to the Act read in part as follows: “To declare all shrimp and parts thereof in the waters of the State to be the property of the State of Louisiana, and to provide the manner and extent of their reduction to private ownership Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, <citedDecision>278 U. S., at 5</citedDecision> n. The Court cited these cases for the proposition that “[a] State is without power to prevent privately owned articles of trade from being shipped and sold in interstate commerce on the ground that they are required to satisfy local demands or because they are needed by the people of the State.” <citedDecision>Id., at 10</citedDecision> .  “As the representative of its people, the State might have retained the shrimp for consumption and use therein.  .  .  .  But by permitting its shrimp to be taken and all the products thereof to be shipped and sold in interstate commerce, the State necessarily releases its hold and, as to the shrimp so taken, definitely terminates its control.  Clearly such authorization and the taking in pursuance thereof put an end to the trust upon which the State is deemed to own or control the shrimp for the benefit of its people.  And those taking the shrimp under the authority of the Act necessarily thereby become entitled to the rights of private ownership and the protection of the commerce clause.” <citedDecision>Id., at 13</citedDecision> .  See Hicklin v. Orbeck, 437 U. S. 518, 531-532 (1978).  The Court distinguished Geer on the same basis used in Foster-Fountain Packing Co., 334 U. S., at 404-406 .  Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm’n, 334 U. S. 410, 420-421 (1948), decided the same day as Toomer , reviewed the cases distinguishing and questioning Geer and found the State's claim to “ownership” inadequate to justify a ban on commercial fishing by alien residents.  “In more recent years .  .  .  the Court has recognized that the States’ interest in regulating and controlling those things they claim to 'own,’ including wildlife, is by no means absolute.  States may not compel the confinement of the benefits of their resources, even .their wildlife, to their own people whenever such hoarding and confinement impedes interstate commerce.  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, <citedDecision>278 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1928) ; Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923); West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911).” Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, 436 U. S. 371, 385-386 (1978).  See, e. g., Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 , 285 n. 21 (1977).  “ [W] hatever [a State’s] ultimate purpose, it may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently.” Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 626-627 .  See n. 1, supra. Section 4-115 (B) does not apply to persons transporting three dozen or less natural minnows outside the State.  See n. 1, supra. In its brief, Oklahoma argues, apparently for the first time, that the discrimination against out-of-state sales of natural minnows is justified because minnows purchased in the State are more likely to be used for bait in state waters.  Brief for Appellee 3.  The State contends that minnows “returned” to state waters as bait do not upset the ecological balance as much as those that never “return.” The late appearance of this argument and the total absence of any record support for the questionable factual assumptions that underlie it give it the flavor of a post hoc rationalization.
