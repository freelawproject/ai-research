 And the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen's vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise." 377 U. S., at 555 .  We have said enough to indicate why MacDougall v. Green is out of line with our recent apportionment cases. The use of nominating petitions by independents to obtain a place on the Illinois ballot is an integral part of her elective system.  See People v. Election Commissioners, 221 Ill. 9, 18 , 77 N. E. 321 , 323.  All procedures used by a State as an integral part of the election process must pass muster against the charges of discrimination or of abridgment of the right to vote.  United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 314-318 ; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 664 .  Dusch v. Davis, <citedDecision>387 U. S. 112</citedDecision> , is not relevant to the problem of this case. There each councilman was required to be a resident of the borough from which he was elected.  Like the residence requirement for state senators from a multi-district county ( Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U. S. 433 ), the place of residence did not mark the voting unit; for in <citedDecision>Dusch</citedDecision> all the electors in the city voted for each councilman.  It is no answer to the argument under the Equal Protection Clause that this law was designed to require statewide support for launching a new political party rather than support from a few localities.  This law applies a rigid, arbitrary formula to sparsely settled counties and populous counties alike, contrary to the constitutional *819 theme of equality among citizens in the exercise of their political rights.  The idea that one group can be granted greater voting strength than another is hostile to the one man, one vote basis of our representative government.  Under this Illinois law the electorate in 49 of the counties which contain 93.4% of the registered voters may not form a new political party and place its candidates on the ballot.  Yet 25,000 of the remaining 6.6% of registered voters properly distributed among the 53 remaining counties may form a new party to elect candidates to office.  This law thus discriminates against the residents of the populous counties of the State in favor of rural sections.

The rationale of Reynolds v. Sims simply does not control this case. Any reliance by the Court on Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23 , would also be misplaced.  That case involved an Ohio requirement that new political parties secure the support of over 433,000 persons15% of the electorate before their candidates could appear on the ballot.  Here, the 25,000 signatures required by Illinois represent only about one-half of one percent of the total number of Illinois votersa percentage requirement permissible, one would hope, under any view of the Rhodes case. Nor do the appellants make any showing that securing 200 signatures in less than half of the State's counties would be a burden at all comparable to that involved in Williams v. Rhodes .  The Court held in MacDougall v. Green, 335 U. S. 281 , in sustaining the very statutory requirement here at issue, [1] that Illinois had pursued an "allowable State policy [of] requir[ing] that candidates for state-wide office should have support not limited to a concentrated locality." Id., at 283 .  That conclusion seems to me to be no less sound today than it was at the time of the MacDougall decision.  [2] Illinois' policy is, in fact, not at *822 all unlike that upheld by the Court only two Terms ago in Dusch v. Davis, <citedDecision>387 U. S. 112</citedDecision> , in which a district-residence requirement imposed upon municipal officers despite population variations among districts was nevertheless held proper as reasonably "reflect[ing] a detente between urban and rural communities .  .  .  ." <citedDecision>Id., at 117</citedDecision> .  Cf. Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly, 377 U. S. 713, 744 (STEWART, J., dissenting); Reynolds v. Sims, supra, at 589 (HARLAN, J., dissenting).  I respectfully dissent.  NOTES [1] MacDougall involved Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 46, § 10-2, relating to ballot position for candidates of new political parties; Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 46, § 10-3, involved here, imposes identical signature requirements for independent candidates.  [2]  While MacDougall involved candidates for various offices, the appellants here all sought election as presidential electors.  See U. S. Const., Art. II, § 1: "Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress .  .
