 Id., at 687-689 .  Many constitutional standards involve "undoubte[d] .  .  .  gray areas," Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 558 (1975) (dissenting opinion), and, despite the difficulties that this Court and other courts have encountered so far, it normally might be fair to venture the assumption that case-by-case development would lead to a workable standard for determining whether a particular governmental function should be immune from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.  A further cautionary note is sounded, however, by the Court's experience in the related field of state immunity from federal taxation.  In South Carolina v. United States, <citedDecision>199 U. S. 437</citedDecision> (1905), the Court held for the first time that the state tax immunity recognized in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871), extended only to the "ordinary" and "strictly governmental" instrumentalities of state governments and not to instrumentalities "used by the State in the carrying on of an ordinary private business." <citedDecision>199 U. S., at 451, 461</citedDecision> .  While the Court applied the distinction outlined in <citedDecision>South Carolina</citedDecision> for the following 40 years, at no time during that period did the Court develop a consistent formulation of the kinds of governmental functions that were entitled to immunity.  The Court identified the protected functions at various times as "essential," "usual," "traditional," or "strictly governmental." [6] *541 While "these differences in phraseology .  .  .  must not be too literally contradistinguished," Brush v. Commissioner, 300 U. S. 352, 362 (1937), they reflect an inability to specify precisely what aspects of a governmental function made it necessary to the "unimpaired existence" of the States.  Collector v. Day, 11 Wall., at 127 .

 Helvering v. Powers, 293 U. S. 214 (1934).  Justice Black, in Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 427 (1938), was moved to observe: "An implied constitutional distinction which taxes income of an officer of a state-operated transportation system and exempts income of the manager of a municipal water works system manifests the uncertainty created by the `essential' and `non-essential' test" (concurring opinion).  It was this uncertainty and instability that led the Court shortly thereafter, in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), unanimously to conclude that the distinction between "governmental" and "proprietary" functions was "untenable" and must be abandoned.  See id., at 583 (opinion of Frankfurter, J., joined by Rutledge, J.); id., at 586 (Stone, C. J., concurring, joined by Reed, Murphy, and Burton, JJ.); id., at 590-596 (Douglas, J., dissenting, joined by Black J.).  See also Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444, 457 , and n. 14 (1978) (plurality opinion); Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92, 101 (1946).  *543 Even during the heyday of the governmental/proprietary distinction in intergovernmental tax-immunity doctrine the Court never explained the constitutional basis for that distinction.  In <citedDecision>South Carolina</citedDecision> , it expressed its concern that unlimited state immunity from federal taxation would allow the States to undermine the Federal Government's tax base by expanding into previously private sectors of the economy.  See <citedDecision>199 U. S., at 454-455</citedDecision> .  [8] Although the need to reconcile state and federal interests obviously demanded that state immunity have some limiting principle, the Court did not try to justify the particular result it reached; it simply concluded that a "line [must] be drawn," <citedDecision>id., at 456</citedDecision> , and proceeded to draw that line. The Court's elaborations in later cases, such as the assertion in Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 360, 369 (1934), that "[w]hen a state enters the market place seeking customers it divests itself of its quasi sovereignty pro tanto, " sound more of ipse dixit than reasoned explanation.  This inability to give principled content to the distinction between "governmental" and "proprietary," no less significantly than its unworkability, led the Court to abandon the distinction in New York v. United States .  The distinction the Court discarded as unworkable in the field of tax immunity has proved no more fruitful in the field of regulatory immunity under the Commerce Clause.  Neither do any of the alternative standards that might be employed to distinguish between protected and unprotected governmental functions appear manageable.  We rejected the possibility of making immunity turn on a purely historical standard of "tradition" in Long Island, and properly so. The most obvious defect of a historical approach to state immunity is that it prevents a court from accommodating changes in the historical functions of States, changes that have resulted *544 in a number of once-private functions like education being assumed by the States and their subdivisions.  [9] At the same time, the only apparent virtue of a rigorous historical standard, namely, its promise of a reasonably objective measure for state immunity, is illusory.  Reliance on history as an organizing principle results in line-drawing of the most arbitrary sort; the genesis of state governmental functions stretches over a historical continuum from before the Revolution to the present, and courts would have to decide by fiat precisely how longstanding a pattern of state involvement had to be for federal regulatory authority to be defeated.

 We are informed that basic wage levels in the mass-transit industry traditionally have been well in excess of the minimum wages prescribed by the FLSA.  See Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 7-8.  [4]  The District Court also analyzed the status of mass transit under the four-part test devised by the Sixth Circuit in Amersbach v. City of Cleveland, 598 F. 2d 1033 (1979).  In that case, the Court of Appeals looked to (1) whether the function benefits the community as a whole and is made available at little or no expense; (2) whether it is undertaken for public service or pecuniary gain; (3) whether government is its principal provider; and (4) whether government is particularly suited to perform it because of a community-wide need.  Id., at 1037 .  [5]  See also, however, Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Assn. v. Abott Laboratories, 460 U. S. 150, 154, n. 6 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 781 , and n. 7 (1982) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 558 , and n. 2 (1975) (dissenting opinion).  [6]  See Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 172 (1911) ("essential"); Helvering v. Therrell, 303 U. S. 218, 225 (1938) (same); Helvering v. Powers, 293 U. S. 214, 225 (1934) ("usual"); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175, 185 (1936) ("activities in which the states have traditionally engaged"); South Carolina v. United States, <citedDecision>199 U. S. 437, 461</citedDecision> (1905) ("strictly governmental").  [7]  In <citedDecision>South Carolina</citedDecision> , the Court relied on the concept of "strictly governmental" functions to uphold the application of a federal liquor license tax to a state-owned liquor-distribution monopoly.  In Flint , the Court stated: "The true distinction is between .  .  .  those operations of the States essential to the execution of its [sic] governmental functions, and which the State can only do itself, and those activities which are of a private character"; under this standard, "[i]t is no part of the essential governmental functions of a State to provide means of transportation, supply artificial light, water and the like." 220 U. S., at 172 .  In Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 360 (1934), another case involving a state liquor-distribution monopoly, the Court stated that "the business of buying and selling commodities.

 .  is not the performance of a governmental function," and that "[w]hen a state enters the market place seeking customers it divests itself of its quasi sovereignty pro tanto, and takes on the character of a trader, so far, at least, as the taxing power of the federal government is concerned." Id., at 369 .  In Powers , the Court upheld the application of the federal income tax to the income of trustees of a state-operated commuter railroad; the Court reiterated that "the State cannot withdraw sources of revenue from the federal taxing power by engaging in businesses which constitute a departure from usual governmental functions and to which, by reason of their nature, the federal taxing power would normally extend," regardless of the fact that the proprietary enterprises "are undertaken for what the State conceives to be the public benefit." 293 U. S., at 225 .  Accord, Allen v. Regents, 304 U. S. 439, 451-453 (1938).  [8]  That concern was especially weighty in <citedDecision>South Carolina</citedDecision> because liquor taxes, the object of the dispute in that case, then accounted for over one-fourth of the Federal Government's revenues.  See New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 598, n. 4 (1946) (dissenting opinion).  [9]  Indeed, the "traditional" nature of a particular governmental function can be a matter of historical nearsightedness; today's self-evidently "traditional" function is often yesterday's suspect innovation.  Thus, National League of Cities offered the provision of public parks and recreation as an example of a traditional governmental function.  426 U. S., at 851 .  A scant 80 years earlier, however, in Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282 (1893), the Court pointed out that city commons originally had been provided not for recreation but for grazing domestic animals "in common," and that "[i]n the memory of men now living, a proposition to take private property [by eminent domain] for a public park .  .
