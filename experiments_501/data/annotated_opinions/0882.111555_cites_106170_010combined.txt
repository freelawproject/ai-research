 Thus, the State, as well as the Federal Government, must comply with the commands in the First [2] and Eighth [3] Amendments; so too, the State must respect the guarantees in the Fourth, [4] Fifth, [5] and Sixth [6] Amendments.  Second, it contains a substantive component, sometimes referred to as "substantive due process," which bars certain arbitrary government actions "regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them." Ante, at 331.  [7] Third, it is a guarantee of fair procedure, sometimes referred to as "procedural due process": the State may not execute, imprison, or fine a defendant without giving him a fair trial, [8] nor may it take property without providing appropriate procedural safeguards.  [9] The type of Fourteenth Amendment interest that is implicated has important effects on the nature of the constitutional claim and the availability of § 1983 relief.  If the claim is in *338 the first category (a violation of one of the specific constitutional guarantees of the Bill of Rights), a plaintiff may invoke § 1983 regardless of the availability of a state remedy.  [10] As explained in Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 167</citedDecision> (1961), this conclusion derives from the fact that the statute  the Ku Klux Act of 1871  was intended to provide a federal remedy for the violation of a federal constitutional right.  Thus, when the Fourth Amendment is violated, as in <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> , the provision of an independent federal remedy under § 1983 is necessary to satisfy the purpose of the statute.  Similarly, if the claim is in the second category (a violation of the substantive component of the Due Process Clause), a plaintiff may also invoke § 1983 regardless of the availability of a state remedy.  [11] For, in that category, no less than with the provisions of the Bill of Rights, if the Federal Constitution prohibits a State from taking certain actions "regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them," the constitutional violation is complete as soon as the prohibited action is taken; the independent federal remedy is then authorized by the language and legislative history of § 1983.  A claim in the third category  a procedural due process claim  is fundamentally different.  In such a case, the deprivation may be entirely legitimate  a State may have every right to discharge a teacher or punish a student  but the State may nevertheless violate the Constitution by failing to provide appropriate procedural safeguards.  The constitutional duty to provide fair procedures gives the citizen the opportunity to try to prevent the deprivation from happening, but the deprivation itself does not necessarily reflect any *339 "abuse" of state power.  Similarly, a deprivation may be the consequence of a mistake or a negligent act, and the State may violate the Constitution by failing to provide an appropriate procedural response.
