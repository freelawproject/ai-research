Mr. Justice Frankfurter, dissenting.  The question in this case is whether Nevada, which was empowered to grant petitioner a divorce without personal jurisdiction over respondent that must be respected, by command of the Constitution, by every other State, Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287 , *420 was at the same time empowered by virtue of its domiciliary connection with petitioner to make, incidental to its' dissolution of the marriage, an adjudication denying alimony to which sister States must also give full faith and credit.  Whatever the answer to the question may be, Estin v. Estin, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 541</citedDecision> , does not supply it.  What the Court now states to be “not material” was crucial to the decision in that case, namely, the prior New York support order, which the Court held Nevada was required to respect by virtue of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IY, § 1, of the Constitution.  That this fact was crucial to the Court’s decision in that case is made clear by the Court’s reference to the prior New York judgment in its two statements of the question presented and more than a half dozen times throughout the course of its opinion.  The Court rightly regarded the fact as crucial because of the requirement of Art. IV, § 1, that Nevada give full faith and credit to the prior New York “judicial Proceedings.” The Court now chooses to regard the existence of a prior New York support order as “not material,” holding for the first time that “the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which [respondent] had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband.  It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant [citing for this proposition, Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 726-727 ].” We have thus reached another stage — one cannot say it is the last — in the Court’s tortuous course of constitutional adjudication relating to dissolution of the marriage status.  Whereas previously only the State of “matrimonial domicile” could grant an ex parte divorce and alimony, now any domiciliary State can grant an ex parte divorce, but no State, even if domiciliary, can grant alimony ex parte when it grants a divorce ex parte.  *421 It will make for clarity to give a brief review of the singular history of matrimonial law in this Court since the decision in Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S. 155 .

 Custody over children presents an entirely different problem.  See May v. Anderson, 345 U. S. 528 .  The interests of independent human beings, the children, are involved.  Also, insofar as the spouses’ interests are concerned, the divorce may terminate their relations with each other as husband and wife, but it cannot terminate their relation to their children.  They are still parents.  “The deceptive appeal of the phrase ‘divisible divorce’ should not be permitted to obscure the basic concepts involved.  A finding of divisibility may be appropriate where, as in <citedDecision>Estin</citedDecision> , the particular right at issue is a distinct property right, embodied in a previously granted judgment, which is no longer dependent, for its recognition or enforcement, upon the marital relationship, or where, as in Armstrong, the court rendering the divorce has itself severed the issue of support and left it subject to separate adjudication in the future.  The situation is, however, decidedly different where, as in the case before us, the claim asserted depends for its very existence on the continuance of the marital status and that status and its incidents *425 have both been terminated by a jurisdictionally valid judgment of divorce.” Judge Fuld, dissenting in this ease in the New York Court of Appeals, 1 N. Y. 2d 342, 356-357, 135 N. E. 2d 553, 561 .  I would add that the concept of “divisible divorce” is a misnomer.  The divorce is not divisible.  It is the cause of action for terminating the marital relation and making a property arrangement that is divided.  We are not told what a third State is to do if suit is brought there.  Does New York or Nevada law control?
