<p id="Amb">concurring.</p>
<p id="b855-5">While I join the opinion of the Court, I think it is desirable to point out that in a majority of the six cases that we dispose of today no indictment, however drawn, could in my view be sustained under the requirements of the First Amendment.</p>
<p id="b855-6">The investigation was concededly an investigation of the press. This was clearly brought out by the record in <em>Shelton, </em>wherein the following colloquy was alleged to have taken place at the commencement of the Subcommittee hearings:</p>
<blockquote id="b855-7">“Senator Hennings. On the same subject matter. I do believe it is very important at the outset for us to make it abundantly clear, if that is the purpose of counsel, and if it is the purpose of this committee, that this is not in any sense an attack upon the free press of the United States.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b855-8">“The Chairman. Why, certainly, that is true.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b855-9">“Senator Hennings. And I think, too, that it should be clear that the best evidence of any subversion or infiltration into any news-dispensing agency or opinion-forming journal is certainly the product itself.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b855-10">“The Chairman. That is correct.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b855-11">“Senator Hennings. Of course, the committee is interested in the extent and nature of so-called Communist infiltration, if such exists, into any news-dispensing agency.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b855-12">“The Chairman. Correct.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b855-13">“Senator Hennings. But I would like to have the position of the committee, if it be the position of the majority of this committee, since the committee has not met to determine whether one policy or another is to be pursued in the course of these hearings — that it be generally known and understood that this is not <page-number citation-index="1" label="774">*774</page-number>an attack upon any one newspaper, upon any group of newspapers as such, but an effort on the part of this committee to show such participation and such attempt as may be disclosed on the part of the Communist Party in the United States or elsewhere, indeed, to influence or to subvert the American press.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b856-6">“And I do think that at some later time, perhaps, it might be appropriate for executives of some of the newspapers under inquiry, whose employees are under inquiry, to be called and to testify and for them to show, if they can show, that the end product, the newspaper itself, has not been influenced by these efforts.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b856-7">“The Chairman. The Chair thinks that is a very fine and very accurate statement, one with which the Chair certainly agrees, in its entirety.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b856-8">“We are not singling out any newspaper and not investigating any newspaper or any group of newspapers. We are simply investigating communism wherever we find it,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and I think that when this series <page-number citation-index="1" label="775">*775</page-number>of hearings is over that no one can say that any newspaper or any employees of any one newspaper has been singled out.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b857-4">“Senator Hennings. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b857-5">“Senator Watkins. I would like to say I agree with Senator Hennings’ statement, Mr. Chairman.” R. 72-73.</blockquote>
<p id="b857-6">The New York Times was a prime target of the investigation, 30 of the 38 witnesses called at the 1955 executive session and 15 of the 18 called at the 1956 public hearings being present or past employees of that paper.</p>
<p id="b857-7">The power to investigate is limited to a valid legislative function. Inquiry is precluded where the matter investi<page-number citation-index="1" label="776">*776</page-number>gated is one on which “no valid legislation” can be enacted. <em>Kilbourn </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>103 U. S. 168, 195. Since the First Amendment provides that “Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom ... of the press,” this present investigation was plainly unconstitutional. As we said in <em>Watkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U. S. 178, 197:</p>
<blockquote id="b858-4">“Clearly, an investigation is subject to the command that the Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or press or assembly. While it is true that there is no statute to be reviewed, and that an investigation is not a law, nevertheless an investigation is part of lawmaking. It is justified solely as an adjunct to the legislative process. The First Amendment may be invoked against infringement of the protected freedoms by law or by lawmaking.”</blockquote>
<p id="b858-5">Under our system of government, I do not see how it is possible for Congress to pass a law saying whom a newspaper or news agency or magazine shall or shall not employ. If this power exists, it can reach the rightist as well as the leftist press, as <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rumely, </em>345 U. S. 41, shows. Whether it is used against the one or the other will depend on the mood of the day. Whenever it is used to ferret out the ideology of those collecting news or writing articles or editorials for the press, it is used unconstitutionally. The theory of our Free Society is that government must be neutral when it comes to the press — whether it be rightist or leftist, orthodox or unorthodox. The theory is that in a community where men’s minds are free, all shades of opinion must be immune from governmental inquiry lest we end with regimentation. Congress has no more authority in the field of the press than it does where the pulpit is involved. Since the editorials written and the news printed and the policies advocated by the press are none of the Govern-<page-number citation-index="1" label="777">*777</page-number>merit’s business, I see no justification for the Government investigating the capacities, leanings, ideology, qualifications, prejudices or politics of those who collect or write the news. It was conceded on oral argument that Congress would have no power to establish standards of fitness for those who work for the press. It was also conceded that Congress would have no power to prescribe loyalty tests for people who work for the press. Since this investigation can have no legislative basis as far as the press is concerned, what then is its constitutional foundation?</p>
<p id="b859-5">It is said that Congress has the power to determine the extent of Communist infiltration so that it can know how much tighter the “security” laws should be made. This proves too much. It would give Congress a roving power to inquire into fields in which it could not legislate. If Congress can investigate the press to find out if Communists have infiltrated it, it could also investigate the churches for the same reason. Are the pulpits being used to promote the Communist cause? Were any of the clergy ever members of the Communist Party? How about the governing board? How about those who assist the pastor and perhaps help prepare his sermons or do the research? Who comes to the confession and discloses that he or she once was a Communist?</p>
<p id="b859-6">There is a dictum in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rumely, </em>345 U. S. 41, 43, that the reach of the investigative power of Congress is measured by the “informing function of Congress,” a phrase taken from Woodrow Wilson’s Congressional Government (1885), p. 303. But the quotation from Wilson was mutilated, because the sentences which followed his statement that “The informing function of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative function” were omitted from the <em>Rumely </em>opinion. Those omitted sentences make abundantly clear that Wilson was speak<page-number citation-index="1" label="778">*778</page-number>ing, not of a congressional inquiry roaming at large, but of one that inquired into and discussed the functions and operations of government. Wilson said:</p>
<blockquote id="b860-4">“The informing function of Congress should be preferred even to its legislative function. The argument is not only that discussed and interrogated administration is the only pure and efficient administration, but, more than that, that the only really self-governing people is that people which discusses and interrogates its administration. The talk on the part of Congress which we sometimes justly condemn is the profitless squabble of words over frivolous bills or selfish party issues. It would be hard to conceive of there being too much talk about the practical concerns and processes of government. Such talk it is which, when earnestly and purposefully conducted, clears the public mind and shapes the demands of public opinion.” <em>Id., </em>at 303-304.</blockquote>
<p id="b860-5">The power to inform is, in my view, no broader than the power to legislate.</p>
<p id="b860-6">Congress has no power to legislate either on “religion” or on the “press.” If an editor or a minister violates the law, he can be prosecuted. But the investigative power, as I read our Constitution, is barred from certain areas by the First Amendment. If we took the step urged by the prosecution, we would allow Congress to enter the forbidden domain.</p>
<p id="b860-7">The strength of the “press” and the “church” is in their freedom. If they pervert or misuse their power, informed opinion will in time render the verdict against them. A paper or pulpit might conceivably become a mouthpiece for Communist ideology. That is typical of the risks a Free Society runs. The alternative is governmental oversight, governmental investigation, governmental questioning, governmental harassment, governmental exposure for <page-number citation-index="1" label="779">*779</page-number>exposure’s sake. Once we crossed that line, we would sacrifice the values of a Free Society for one that has a totalitarian cast.</p>
<p id="b861-5">Some think a certain leeway is necessary or desirable, leaving it to the judiciary to curb what judges may from time to time think are excessive practices. Thus, a judge with a professorial background may put the classroom in a preferred position. One with a background of a prosecutor dealing with “subversives” may be less tolerant. When a subjective standard is introduced, the line between constitutional and unconstitutional conduct becomes vague, uncertain, and unpredictable. The rationalization, of course, reduces itself ultimately to the idea that “the judges know best.” My idea is and has been that those who put the words of the First Amendment in the form of a command knew best. That is the political theory of government we must sustain until a constitutional amendment is adopted that puts the Congress astride the “press.”</p>

<p id="b856-9">The Subcommittee in its Report to the Senate Judiciary Committee, S. Rep. No. 131, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 95, stated:</p>
<p id="b856-10">“The Communists in the United States have their own daily newspaper, the Daily Worker, and control various weekly and monthly periodicals, including Political Affairs and Masses and Mainstream. But those publications are so brazenly slanted that their propaganda value, except for certain elements of the foreign language press in this country, is sharply limited (pts. 28 and 29).</p>
<p id="b856-11">“In order to overcome this disadvantage, and for other reasons, Communists have made vigorous and sustained efforts to infiltrate the American press and radio and to entrench their members in all other forms of mass communications, where, by emphasis or omission of the written or spoken word, it may be turned to the advantage of the conspiracy/'</p>
<p id="b856-12">The Report referred to the ruling of an arbiter in a case where a paper had discharged a “rewrite man” because he invoked the Fifth <page-number citation-index="1" label="775">*775</page-number>Amendment. It said that the following quotations from his opinion were “of more than passing interest:”</p>
<p id="b857-9">“A metropolitan newspaper in America today is more than a mirror to the happenings of the day. It is a moulder of public opinion; capable of leading crusades; capable of introducing new ideas; capable of propagating truth or propaganda as it wills. By its very nature, whether it would abdicate or not, a newspaper maintains a position of leadership and responsibility in this cold war that is vital to our national security. Other industries (atomic energy, defense, et cetera) may be more vital but this fact does not impair the vital role of our press.</p>
<p id="b857-10">“Each worker performs his task in life with tools, and these tools run the gamut from an ax to a zither. The rewrite man has his tools, too. They are words. Words but express ideas and so it follows that the rewrite man works all day with ideas. This is a war of ideas. Can his position then be deemed nonsensitive? A rewrite man can select the facts he considers important as relayed to him by the reporter in the field. His is the choice of the topic sentence and the lead paragraph. His selection of words sets the tone of the article and influences, too, the choice of headline. The conclusion is irresistible that a rewrite man occupies a sensitive position on a newspaper.” <em>Id., </em>at 97.</p>
<p id="b857-11">The Committee concluded, “Communists have infiltrated mass communications media in the United States, and efforts to increase such infiltration continue.” <em>Id., </em>at 117.</p>
