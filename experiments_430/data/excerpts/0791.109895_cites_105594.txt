 Since up to that point Government appeals had been subject to statutory restrictions independent of the Double Jeopardy Clause, our previous cases construing the statute proved to be of little assistance in determining when the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment would *86 prohibit further prosecution.  A detailed canvass of the history of the double jeopardy principles in English and American law led us to conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause was primarily “directed at the threat of multiple prosecutions,” and posed no bar to Government appeals “where those appeals would not require a new trial.” Id., at 342 .  We accordingly held in Jenkins, supra, at 370 , that, whether or not a dismissal of an indictment after jeopardy had attached amounted to an acquittal on the merits, the Government had no right to appeal, because “further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand.” 2 If Jenkins is a correct statement of the law, the judgment of the Court of Appeals relying on that decision, as it was bound to do, would in all likelihood have to be affirmed.  3 Yet, though our assessment of the history and meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause in Wilson, Jenkins, and Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377 (1975), occurred only three Terms ago, our vastly increased exposure to the various facets of the Double Jeopardy Clause has now convinced us that Jenkins *87 was wrongly decided.  It placed an unwarrantedly great emphasis on the defendant’s right to have his guilt decided by the first jury empaneled to try him so as to include those cases where the defendant himself seeks to terminate the trial before verdict on grounds unrelated to factual guilt or innocence.  We have therefore decided to overrule Jenkins , and thus to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case. II The origin and history of the Double Jeopardy Clause are hardly a matter of dispute.  See generally Wilson; supra, at 339-340; Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187-188 (1957); <citedDecision>id., at 200</citedDecision> (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  The constitutional provision had its origin in the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon.  These three pleas prevented the retrial of a person who had previously been acquitted, convicted, or pardoned for the same offense.  As this Court has described the purpose underlying the prohibition against double jeopardy: “The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to malee repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.” <citedDecision>Green, supra, at 187-188</citedDecision> .  These historical purposes are necessarily general in nature, and their application has come to abound in often subtle distinctions which cannot by any means all be traced to the original three common-law pleas referred to above.  Part of the difficulty arises from the development of other protections for criminal defendants in the years since the *88 adoption of the Bill of Rights.  At the time the Fifth Amendment was adopted, its principles were easily applied, since most criminal prosecutions proceeded to final judgment, and neither the United States nor the defendant had any right to appeal an adverse verdict.  See Act of Sept. 24, 1789, ch. 20, § 22, 1 Stat. 84 .  The verdict in such a case was unquestionably final, and could be raised in bar against any further prosecution for the same offense.  Soon thereafter, Congress made provision for review of certain criminal cases by this Court, but only upon a certificate of division from the circuit court, and not at the instigation of the defendant.

 The Court found the circumstances presented by that case “functionally indistinguishable from a declaration of mistrial.” 432 U. S., at 31 .  Thus, Lee demonstrated that, at least in some cases, the dismissal of an indictment may be treated on the same basis as the declaration of a mistrial.  *95 In the present case, the District Court’s dismissal of the first count of the indictment was based upon a claim of prein-dictment delay and not on the court’s conclusion that the Government had not produced sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the defendant.  Respondent Scott points out quite correctly that he had moved to dismiss the indictment on this ground prior to trial, and that had the District Court chosen to grant it at that time the Government could have appealed the ruling under our holding in Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377 (1975).  He also quite correctly points out that jeopardy had undeniably “attached” at the time the District Court terminated the trial in his favor; since a successful Government appeal would require further proceedings in the District Court leading to a factual resolution of the issue of guilt or innocence, Jenkins bars the Government’s appeal.  However, our growing experience with Government appeals convinces us that we must re-examine the rationale of Jenkins in light of Lee, Martin Linen, and other recent expositions of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  IV Our decision in Jenkins was based upon our perceptions of the underlying purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, see supra, at 87: “ ‘The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity ....’” Jenkins, supra, at 370 , quoting Green, <citedDecision>355 U. S., at 187</citedDecision> .  Upon fuller consideration, we are now of the view that this language from <citedDecision>Green</citedDecision> , while entirely appropriate in the circumstances of that opinion, is not a principle which can be *96 expanded to include situations in which the defendant is responsible for the second prosecution.  It is quite true that the Government with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense.  This truth is expressed in the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon, which lie at the core of the area protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  As we have recognized in cases from United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896), to Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54, a defendant once acquitted may not be again subjected to trial without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.  But that situation is obviously a far cry from the present case, where the Government was quite willing to continue with its production of evidence to show the defendant guilty before the jury first empaneled to try him, but the defendant elected to seek termination of the trial on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence.  This is scarcely a picture of an all-powerful state relentlessly pursuing a defendant who had either been found not guilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact.  It is instead a picture of a defendant who chooses to avoid conviction and imprisonment, not because of his assertion that the Government has failed to make out a case against him, but because of a legal claim that the Government’s case against him must fail even though it might satisfy the trier of fact that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

 evaluated the Government’s evidence and determined that it was legally] insufficient to sustain a conviction.”., 430 U. S., at 572 .  9 Our opinion in Burks necessarily holds that there has been a “failure of proof,” ante, at 16, requiring an acquittal when the Government does not submit sufficient evidence to rebut a defendant’s essentially factual defense of insanity, though it may otherwise be entitled to have its case submitted to the jury.  The defense of insanity, like the defense of entrapment, arises from “the notion that Congress could not have intended criminal punishment for a defendant who has committed all the elements of a proscribed offense,” United States v. Russell, 411 U. S. 423, 435 (1973), where other facts established to the satisfaction of the trier of fact provide a legally *98 adequate justification for otherwise criminal acts.  10 Such a factual finding does “necessarily establish the criminal defendant’s lack of criminal culpability,” post, at 106 (Brennan, J., dissenting), under the existing law; the fact that “the acquittal may result from erroneous evidentiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing legal principles,” ibid., affects the accuracy of that determination, but it does not alter its essential character.  By contrast, the dismissal of an indictment for preindictment delay represents a legal judgment that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may not be punished because of a supposed constitutional violation.  11 We think that in a case such as this the defendant, by deliberately choosing to seek termination of the proceedings *99 against him on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which he is accused, suffers no injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Government is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial court in favor of the defendant.  We do not thereby adopt the doctrine of “waiver” of double jeopardy rejected in <citedDecision>Green</citedDecision> .  12 , Rather, we conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause, which guards against Government oppression, does not relieve a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary choice.  In <citedDecision>Green</citedDecision> the question of the defendant’s factual guilt or innocence of murder in the first degree was actually submitted to the jury as a trier of fact; in the present case, respondent successfully avoided such a submission of the first count of the indictment by persuading the trial court to dismiss it on a basis which did not depend on guilt or innocence.  He was thus neither acquitted nor convicted, because he himself successfully undertook to persuade the trial court not to submit the issue of guilt or innocence to the jury which had been empaneled to try him.  The reason for treating a trial aborted on the initiative of the trial judge differently from a trial verdict reversed on appeal, for purposes of double jeopardy, is thus described in Jorn, 400 U. S., at 484 (opinion of Harlan, J.): “[I]n the [second] situation the defendant has not been deprived of his option to go to the first jury, and, perhaps, end the dispute then and there with an acquittal.  On the other hand, where the judge, acting without the defendant’s consent, aborts the proceeding, the defendant has *100 been deprived of his Valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.5 ” We think the same reasoning applies in pari passu where the defendant, instead of obtaining a reversal of his conviction on appeal, obtains the termination of the proceedings against him in the trial court without any finding by a court or jury as to his guilt or innocence.  He has not been “deprived55 of his valued right to go to the first jury; only the public has been deprived of its valued right to “one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws.55 Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S., at 509 .  No interest protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause is invaded when the Government is allowed to appeal and seek reversal of such a midtrial termination of the proceedings in a manner favorable to the defendant.  13 It is obvious from what we have said that we believe we pressed too far in Jenkins the concept of the “defendant's valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tri *101 bunal.” Wade v. Hunter, 336 U. S. 684, 689 (1949).  We now conclude that where the defendant himself seeks to have the trial terminated without any submission to either judge or jury as to his guilt or innocence, an appeal by the Government from his successful effort to do so is not barred by 18 U. S. C. §3731 (1976 ed.).  We recognize the force of the doctrine of stare decisis, but we are conscious as well of the admonition of Mr. Justice Brandéis: “[I]n cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.  The Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function.” Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406-408 (1932) (dissenting opinion).  Here, “the lessons of experience” indicate that Government appeals from midtrial dismissals requested by the defendant would significantly advance the public interest in assuring that each defendant shall be subject to a just judgment on the merits of his case, without “enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.” Green, <citedDecision>355 U. S., at 188</citedDecision> .  Accordingly, the contrary holding of United States v. Jenkins is overruled.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.  It is so ordered.  A thorough account of the enactment and development of the Act is set out in Mr. Justice Harlan’s opinion for the Court in United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267, 291-296 (1970).  The rule established in Wilson and Jenkins was later described in the following terms: “[Dismissals (as opposed to mistrials) if they occurred at a stage of the proceeding after which jeopardy had attached, but prior to the factfinder’s conclusion as to guilt or innocence, were final so far as the accused defendant was concerned and could not be appealed by the Government because retrial was barred by double jeopardy.  This made the issue of double jeopardy turn very largely on temporal considerations — if the Court granted an order of dismissal during the factfinding stage of the proceedings, the defendant could not be reprosecuted, but if the dismissal came later, he could.” Lee v. United, States, 432 U. S. 23, 36 (1977) (RehN-qtjist, J., concurring).

 Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 12.2 (a).  While an acquittal on the merits by the trier of fact “can never represent a determination that the criminal defendant is innocent in any absolute sense,” post, at 107 (BreNNAN, J., dissenting), a defendant who has been released by a court for reasons required by the Constitution or laws, but which are unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, has not been determined to be innocent in any sense of that word, absolute or otherwise.  In other circumstances, this Court has had no difficulty in distinguishing between those rulings which relate to “the ultimate question of guilt or innocence” and those which serve other purposes.  Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 490 (1976).  We reject the contrary implication of the dissent that this Court or other courts are incapable of distinguishing between the latter and the former.  The original jury in that case had found the defendant guilty of second-degree murder, but did not find him guilty of first-degree murder.  The Court held that his appeal did not waive his objection to a second prosecution for firsydegree murder, but it was careful to reaffirm the holding of United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896), that “a defendant can be tried a second time for an offense when his prior conviction for that same offense [has] been set aside on appeal.” <citedDecision>355 U. S., at 189</citedDecision> .  We should point out that it is entirely possible for a trial court to reconcile the public interest in the Government’s right to appeal from an erroneous conclusion of law with the defendant’s interest in avoiding a second prosecution.  In United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332 (1975), the court permitted the case to go to the jury, which returned a verdict of guilty, but it subsequently dismissed the indictment for preindictment delay on the basis of evidence adduced at trial. Most recently in United States v. Ceccolini, 435 U. S. 268 (1978), we described similar action with approval: “The District Court had sensibly first made its finding on the factual question of guilt or innocence, and then ruled on the motion to suppress; a reversal of these rulings would require no further proceedings in the District Court, but merely a reinstatement of the finding of guilt.” Id., at 271 .  Accord, United States v. Kopp, 429 U. S. 121 (1976); United States v. Rose, 429 U. S. 5 (1976); United States v. Morrison, 429 U. S. 1 (1976).  We, of course, do not suggest that a midtrial dismissal of a prosecution, in response to a defense motion on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence, is necessarily improper.  Such rulings may be necessary to terminate proceedings marred by fundamental error.  But where a defendant prevails on such a motion, he takes the risk that an appellate court will reverse the trial court.

 Moreover, in terms of the practical operation of the adversary process, there is actually no difference between a so-called “true acquittal” and the termination in this case favorably to respondent.  A While the Double Jeopardy Clause often has the effect of protecting the accused’s interest in the finality of particular favorable determinations, this is not its objective.  For the Clause often permits Government appeals from final judgments favorable to the accused.  See United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332 (1975) (whether or not final judgment was an acquittal, Government may appeal if reversal would not ne *105 cessitate a retrial).  The purpose of the Clause, which the Court today fails sufficiently to appreciate, is to protect the accused against the agony and risks attendant upon undergoing more than one criminal trial for any single offense.  See ibid. A retrial increases the financial and emotional burden that any criminal trial represents for the accused, prolongs the period of the unresolved accusation of -wrongdoing, and enhances the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted.  4 See Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 503-504 (1978); Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 187-188</citedDecision> (1957).  Society’s “willingness to limit the Government to a single criminal proceeding to vindicate its very vital interest in enforcement of criminal laws” bespeaks society’s recognition of the gross unfairness of requiring the accused to undergo the strain and agony of more than one trial for any single offense.  United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S. 470, 479 (1971) (opinion of Harlan, J.).  Accordingly, the policies of the Double Jeopardy Clause mandate that the Government be afforded but one complete opportunity to convict an accused and that when the first proceeding terminates in a final judgment favorable to the defendant 5 any retrial be barred.  The rule as to acquittals can only be understood as simply an application of this larger principle.  Judgments of acquittal normally result from jury or bench *106 verdicts of not guilty.  In such cases, the acquittal represents the factfinder’s conclusion that, under the controlling legal principles, the evidence does not establish that the defendant can be convicted of the offense charged in the indictment.

 See generally United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783 (1977).  It is regrettable that the Court should introduce such confusion in an area of the law that, until today, had been crystal clear.  Its introduction might be tolerable if necessary to advance some important policy or to serve values protected by *116 the Double Jeopardy Clause, but that manifestly is not the case. Rather, today's decision fashions an entirely arbitrary distinction that creates precisely the evils that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to prevent.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  See also Finch v. United States, 433 U. S. 676 (1977) (applying rule of Jenkins to dismissal entered on basis of stipulated facts); United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564 (1977).  Section 3731 provides that the United States may obtain appellate review of a "dismissal” “except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.” The Court cites with approval Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54; United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., supra; Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141 (1962); Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100 (1904); and United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896).  There are a number of reasons a retrial enhances the risk that “even though innocent, [the criminal defendant] may be found guilty.” Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 188</citedDecision> (1957).  A retrial affords the Government the opportunity to re-examine the weaknesses of its first presentation in order to strengthen the second.  And, as would any litigant, the Government has been known to take advantage of this opportunity.  It is not uncommon to find that prosecution witnesses change their testimony, not always subtly, at second trials.  See Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 , 504 n. 14 (1978), quoting Carsey v. United States, 129 U. S. App. D. C. 205, 208-209, 392 F. 2d 810, 813-814 (1967).  By “final judgment favorable to the accused,” I am, of course, referring to an order terminating all prosecution of the defendant on the ground he “simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged.” See Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, 30 (1977).  Similarly unpersuasive is the Court’s suggestion that its holding is supported by the well-recognized rules that a criminal defendant may twice be tried for the same offense if he either successfully moved for a mistrial at the first trial, see Lee, supra; United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600 (1976), or succeeded in having a conviction set aside on a ground other than the insufficiency of the evidence.
**Combined Opinion**
 A detailed canvass of the history of the double jeopardy principles in English and American law led us to conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause was primarily "directed at the threat of multiple prosecutions," and posed no bar to Government appeals "where those appeals would not require a new trial." Id., at 342 .  We accordingly held in Jenkins, supra, at 370 , that, whether or not a dismissal of an indictment after jeopardy had attached amounted to an acquittal on the merits, the Government had no right to appeal, because "further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand."

[3] Yet, though our assessment of the history and meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause in Wilson, Jenkins, and Serfass v. United States, 420 U.

It placed an unwarrantedly great emphasis on the defendant's right to have his guilt decided by the first jury empaneled to try him so as to include those cases where the defendant himself seeks to terminate the trial before verdict on grounds unrelated to factual guilt or innocence.  We have therefore decided to overrule Jenkins , and thus to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case. II The origin and history of the Double Jeopardy Clause are hardly a matter of dispute.  See generally Wilson, supra, at 339-340 ; Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 187-188</citedDecision> (1957); <citedDecision>id., at 200</citedDecision> (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  The constitutional provision had its origin in the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon.  These three pleas prevented the retrial of a person who had previously been acquitted, convicted, or pardoned for the same offense.  As this Court has described the purpose underlying the prohibition against double jeopardy: "The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty." <citedDecision>Green, supra, at 187-188</citedDecision> .  These historical purposes are necessarily general in nature, and their application has come to abound in often subtle distinctions which cannot by any means all be traced to the original three common-law pleas referred to above.

Soon thereafter, Congress made provision for review of certain criminal cases by this Court, but only upon a certificate of division from the circuit court, and not at the instigation of the defendant.
**Combined Opinion**
 These, then, at least, are two venerable principles of double jeopardy jurisprudence.  The successful appeal of a judgment of conviction, on any ground other than the insufficiency of *91 the evidence to support the verdict, Burks v. United States, ante, p. 1, poses no bar to further prosecution on the same charge.  A judgment of acquittal, whether based on a jury verdict of not guilty or on a ruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to convict, may not be appealed and terminates the prosecution when a second trial would be necessitated by a reversal.  [7] What may seem superficially to be a disparity in the rules governing a defendant's liability to be tried again is explainable by reference to the underlying purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  As Kepner and Fong Foo illustrate, the law attaches particular significance to an acquittal.  To permit a second trial after an acquittal, however mistaken the acquittal may have been, would present an unacceptably high risk that the Government, with its vastly superior resources, might wear down the defendant so that "even though innocent he may be found guilty." Green, <citedDecision>355 U. S., at 188</citedDecision> .  On the other hand, to require a criminal defendant to stand trial again after he has successfully invoked a statutory right of appeal to upset his first conviction is not an act of governmental oppression of the sort against which the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to protect.  The common sense of the matter is most pithily, if not most elegantly, expressed in the words of Mr. Justice McLean on circuit in United States v. Keen, 26 F. Cas. 686 (No. 15,510) *92 (CC Ind. 1839).  He vigorously rejected the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited any new trial after the setting aside of a judgment of conviction against the defendant or that it "guarantees to him the right of being hung, to protect him from the danger of a second trial." Id., at 690 .  III Although the primary purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause was to protect the integrity of a final judgment, see Crist v. Bretz, ante, at 33, this Court has also developed a body of law guarding the separate but related interest of a defendant in avoiding multiple prosecutions even where no final determination of guilt or innocence has been made.  Such interests may be involved in two different situations: the first, in which the trial judge declares a mistrial; the second, in which the trial judge terminates the proceedings favorably to the defendant on a basis not related to factual guilt or innocence.  A When a trial court declares a mistrial, it all but invariably contemplates that the prosecutor will be permitted to proceed anew notwithstanding the defendant's plea of double jeopardy.
**Combined Opinion**
 He also quite correctly points out that jeopardy had undeniably "attached" at the time the District Court terminated the trial in his favor; since a successful Government appeal would require further proceedings in the District Court leading to a factual resolution of the issue of guilt or innocence, Jenkins bars the Government's appeal.  However, our growing experience with Government appeals convinces us that we must re-examine the rationale of Jenkins in light of Lee, Martin Linen, and other recent expositions of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  IV Our decision in Jenkins was based upon our perceptions of the underlying purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, see supra, at 87: "`The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity .  .  .  .'" Jenkins, supra, at 370 , quoting Green, <citedDecision>355 U. S., at 187</citedDecision> .  Upon fuller consideration, we are now of the view that this language from <citedDecision>Green</citedDecision> , while entirely appropriate in the circumstances of that opinion, is not a principle which can be *96 expanded to include situations in which the defendant is responsible for the second prosecution.  It is quite true that the Government with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense.  This truth is expressed in the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon, which lie at the core of the area protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  As we have recognized in cases from United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896), to Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54, a defendant once acquitted may not be again subjected to trial without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.  But that situation is obviously a far cry from the present case, where the Government was quite willing to continue with its production of evidence to show the defendant guilty before the jury first empaneled to try him, but the defendant elected to seek termination of the trial on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence.  This is scarcely a picture of an all-powerful state relentlessly pursuing a defendant who had either been found not guilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact.  It is instead a picture of a defendant who chooses to avoid conviction and imprisonment, not because of his assertion that the Government has failed to make out a case against him, but because of a legal claim that the Government's case against him must fail even though it might satisfy the trier of fact that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

430 U. S., at 572 .  [9] Our opinion in Burks necessarily holds that there has been a "failure of proof," ante, at 16, requiring an acquittal when the Government does not submit sufficient evidence to rebut a defendant's essentially factual defense of insanity, though it may otherwise be entitled to have its case submitted to the jury.  The defense of insanity, like the defense of entrapment, arises from "the notion that Congress could not have intended criminal punishment for a defendant who has committed all the elements of a proscribed offense," United States v. Russell, 411 U. S. 423, 435 (1973), where other facts established to the satisfaction of the trier of fact provide a legally *98 adequate justification for otherwise criminal acts.  [10] Such a factual finding does "necessarily establish the criminal defendant's lack of criminal culpability," post, at 106 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), under the existing law; the fact that "the acquittal may result from erroneous evidentiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing legal principles," ibid., affects the accuracy of that determination, but it does not alter its essential character.  By contrast, the dismissal of an indictment for preindictment delay represents a legal judgment that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may not be punished because of a supposed constitutional violation.  [11] We think that in a case such as this the defendant, by deliberately choosing to seek termination of the proceedings *99 against him on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which he is accused, suffers no injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Government is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial court in favor of the defendant.  We do not thereby adopt the doctrine of "waiver" of double jeopardy rejected in <citedDecision>Green</citedDecision> .  [12] Rather, we conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause, which guards against Government oppression, does not relieve a defendant from the consequences of his voluntary choice.  In <citedDecision>Green</citedDecision> the question of the defendant's factual guilt or innocence of murder in the first degree was actually submitted to the jury as a trier of fact; in the present case, respondent successfully avoided such a submission of the first count of the indictment by persuading the trial court to dismiss it on a basis which did not depend on guilt or innocence.  He was thus neither acquitted nor convicted, because he himself successfully undertook to persuade the trial court not to submit the issue of guilt or innocence to the jury which had been empaneled to try him.  The reason for treating a trial aborted on the initiative of the trial judge differently from a trial verdict reversed on appeal, for purposes of double jeopardy, is thus described in Jorn, 400 U. S., at 484 (opinion of Harlan, J.): "[I]n the [second] situation the defendant has not been deprived of his option to go to the first jury, and, perhaps, end the dispute then and there with an acquittal.  On the other hand, where the judge, acting without the defendant's consent, aborts the proceeding, the defendant has *100 been deprived of his `valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal.'" We think the same reasoning applies in pari passu where the defendant, instead of obtaining a reversal of his conviction on appeal, obtains the termination of the proceedings against him in the trial court without any finding by a court or jury as to his guilt or innocence.  He has not been "deprived" of his valued right to go to the first jury; only the public has been deprived of its valued right to "one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws." Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S., at 509 .

*101 Wade v. Hunter, 336 U. S. 684, 689 (1949).  We now conclude that where the defendant himself seeks to have the trial terminated without any submission to either judge or jury as to his guilt or innocence, an appeal by the Government from his successful effort to do so is not barred by 18 U. S. C. § 3731 (1976 ed.).  We recognize the force of the doctrine of stare decisis, but we are conscious as well of the admonition of Mr. Justice Brandeis: "[I]n cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.  The Court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function." Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406-408 (1932) (dissenting opinion).  Here, "the lessons of experience" indicate that Government appeals from midtrial dismissals requested by the defendant would significantly advance the public interest in assuring that each defendant shall be subject to a just judgment on the merits of his case, without "enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty." Green, <citedDecision>355 U. S., at 188</citedDecision> .  Accordingly, the contrary holding of United States v. Jenkins is overruled.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.  It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, and MR. JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.  On the basis of his evaluation of the trial evidence, the District Judge concluded that unjustifiable preindictment delay *102 had so prejudiced respondent's defense as to preclude consistently with the Due Process Clausehis conviction of the offense alleged in count one of the indictment.  He therefore dismissed this count with prejudice.

 Moreover, in terms of the practical operation of the adversary process, there is actually no difference between a so-called "true acquittal" and the termination in this case favorably to respondent.  A While the Double Jeopardy Clause often has the effect of protecting the accused's interest in the finality of particular favorable determinations, this is not its objective.  For the Clause often permits Government appeals from final judgments favorable to the accused.  See United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332 (1975) (whether or not final judgment was an acquittal, Government may appeal if reversal would not necessitate *105 a retrial).  The purpose of the Clause, which the Court today fails sufficiently to appreciate, is to protect the accused against the agony and risks attendant upon undergoing more than one criminal trial for any single offense.  See ibid. A retrial increases the financial and emotional burden that any criminal trial represents for the accused, prolongs the period of the unresolved accusation of wrongdoing, and enhances the risk that an innocent defendant may be convicted.  [4] See Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497, 503-504 (1978); Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 187-188</citedDecision> (1957).  Society's "willingness to limit the Government to a single criminal proceeding to vindicate its very vital interest in enforcement of criminal laws" bespeaks society's recognition of the gross unfairness of requiring the accused to undergo the strain and agony of more than one trial for any single offense.  United States v. Jorn, 400 U. S. 470, 479 (1971) (opinion of Harlan, J.).  Accordingly, the policies of the Double Jeopardy Clause mandate that the Government be afforded but one complete opportunity to convict an accused and that when the first proceeding terminates in a final judgment favorable to the defendant [5] any retrial be barred.  The rule as to acquittals can only be understood as simply an application of this larger principle.  Judgments of acquittal normally result from jury or bench *106 verdicts of not guilty.  In such cases, the acquittal represents the factfinder's conclusion that, under the controlling legal principles, the evidence does not establish that the defendant can be convicted of the offense charged in the indictment.
**Combined Opinion**
 [11]  While an acquittal on the merits by the trier of fact "can never represent a determination that the criminal defendant is innocent in any absolute sense," post, at 107 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), a defendant who has been released by a court for reasons required by the Constitution or laws, but which are unrelated to factual guilt or innocence, has not been determined to be innocent in any sense of that word, absolute or otherwise.  In other circumstances, this Court has had no difficulty in distinguishing between those rulings which relate to "the ultimate question of guilt or innocence" and those which serve other purposes.  Stone v. Powell 428 U. S. 465, 490 (1976).  We reject the contrary implication of the dissent that this Court or other courts are incapable of distinguishing between the latter and the former.  [12]  The original jury in that case had found the defendant guilty of second-degree murder, but did not find him guilty of first-degree murder.  The Court held that his appeal did not waive his objection to a second prosecution for first-degree murder, but it was careful to reaffirm the holding of United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896), that "a defendant can be tried a second time for an offense when his prior conviction for that same offense [has] been set aside on appeal." <citedDecision>355 U. S., at 189</citedDecision> .  [13]  We should point out that it is entirely possible for a trial court to reconcile the public interest in the Government's right to appeal from an erroneous conclusion of law with the defendant's interest in avoiding a second prosecution.  In United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332 (1975), the court permitted the case to go to the jury, which returned a verdict of guilty, but it subsequently dismissed the indictment for preindictment delay on the basis of evidence adduced at trial. Most recently in United States v. Ceccolini, 435 U. S. 268 (1978), we described similar action with approval: "The District Court had sensibly first made its finding on the factual question of guilt or innocence, and then ruled on the motion to suppress; a reversal of these rulings would require no further proceedings in the District Court, but merely a reinstatement of the finding of guilt." Id., at 271 .  Accord, United States v. Kopp, 429 U. S. 121 (1976); United States v. Rose, 429 U. S. 5 (1976); United States v. Morrison, 429 U. S. 1 (1976).  We, of course, do not suggest that a midtrial dismissal of a prosecution, in response to a defense motion on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence, is necessarily improper.  Such rulings may be necessary to terminate proceedings marred by fundamental error.  But where a defendant prevails on such a motion, he takes the risk that an appellate court will reverse the trial court. [1]  See also Finch v. United States, 433 U. S. 676 (1977) (applying rule of Jenkins to dismissal entered on basis of stipulated facts); United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564 (1977).  [2]  Section 3731 provides that the United States may obtain appellate review of a "dismissal" "except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution." [3]  The Court cites with approval Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54; United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., supra ; Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141 (1962); Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100 (1904); and United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896).  [4]  There are a number of reasons a retrial enhances the risk that "even though innocent, [the criminal defendant] may be found guilty." Green v. United States, <citedDecision>355 U. S. 184, 188</citedDecision> (1957).  A retrial affords the Government the opportunity to re-examine the weaknesses of its first presentation in order to strengthen the second.  And, as would any litigant, the Government has been known to take advantage of this opportunity.  It is not uncommon to find that prosecution witnesses change their testimony, not always subtly, at second trials.  See Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 , 504 n. 14 (1978), quoting Carsey v. United States, 129 U. S. App. D. C. 205, 208-209, 392 F. 2d 810, 813-814 (1967).  [5]  By "final judgment favorable to the accused," I am, of course, referring to an order terminating all prosecution of the defendant on the ground he "simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged." See Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, 30 (1977).
