**Combined Opinion**
ยง 922(a)(1). Such firearms are rendered subject to forfeiture under 18 U.S. C . ยง 924(d), which forfeiture is hereby ordered." 511 F. Supp. 133 , 139 (1980). B A divided United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed. [4] 685 F.2d 913 (1982). The en banc majority relied upon two theories for its conclusion that the forfeiture proceeding against these firearms was barred by Mulcahey's prior acquittal, although it did not sharply distinguish between the two. Because the majority considered the ยง 924(d) forfeiture proceeding to be criminal and punitive in nature, the Court of Appeals concluded that it was barred by double jeopardy principles. Looking to Coffey v. United States, 116 U.S. 436 (1886), as authority, the Court of Appeals also determined that the forfeiture action was barred by collateral estoppel, because it was based upon the same facts as the earlier criminal action. In dissent, four judges argued that neither collateral estoppel nor double jeopardy should preclude forfeiture proceedings brought under ยง 924(d). 685 F.2d , at 918-919 (Winter, J., joined by Butzner, Russell, and Murnaghan, JJ., dissenting). We granted certiorari, 459 U.S. 1199 (1983), and we reverse.
