 On January 22, 1971, four of the striking warehouse employees entered the center’s enclosed mall carrying placards which read: “Butler Shoe Warehouse on Strike, AFL-CIO, Local 315.” The general manager of the shopping center informed the employees that they could not picket within the mall or on the parking lot and threatened them with arrest if they did not leave.  The employees departed but returned a short time later and began picketing in an area of the mall immediately adjacent to the entrances of the Butler store.  After the picketing had continued for approximately 30 minutes, the shopping center manager again informed the pickets that if they did not leave they would be arrested for trespassing.  The pickets departed.  The union subsequently filed with the Board an unfair labor practice charge against Hudgens, alleging interference.  with rights protected by § 7 of the Act, 29 *510 U. S. C. § 157 .  2 Relying on this Court’s decision in Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 308</citedDecision> , the Board entered a cease-and-desist order against Hudgens, reasoning that because the warehouse employees enjoyed a First Amendment right to picket on the shopping center property, the owner’s threat of arrest violated § 8 (a)(1) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (a)(1).  3 Hudgens filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  Soon thereafter this Court decided Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 , and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 , and the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of those two decisions.  The Board, in turn, remanded to an Administrative Law Judge, who made findings of fact, recommendations, and conclusions to the effect that Hudgens had committed an unfair labor practice by excluding the pickets.  *511 This result was ostensibly reached under the statutory criteria set forth in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105 , a case which held that union organizers who seek to solicit for union membership may intrude on an employer’s private property if no alternative means exist for communicating with the employees.  But the Administrative Law Judge’s opinion also relied on this Court’s constitutional decision in Logan Valley for a “realistic view of the facts.” The Board agreed with the findings and recommendations of the Administrative Law Judge, but departed somewhat from his reasoning.  It concluded that the pickets were within the scope of Hudgens’ invitation to members of the public to do business at the shopping center, and that it was, therefore, immaterial whether or not there existed an alternative means of communicating with the customers and employees of the Butler store.

 To do so, they now, as they have for many years, make use of a company-owned paved street and sidewalk located alongside the store fronts in order to enter and leave the stores and the post office.  Intersecting company-owned roads at each end of the business block lead into a four-lane public highway which runs parallel to the business block at a distance of thirty feet.  There is nothing to stop highway traffic from coming onto the business block and upon arrival a traveler may make free use of the facilities available there.  In short the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the property belongs to a private corporation.” Id,., at 502-503.  The Court pointed out that if the “title” to Chickasaw had “belonged not to a private but to a municipal corporation and had appellant been arrested for violating a municipal ordinance rather than a ruling by those appointed by the corporation to manage a company town it would have been clear that appellant’s conviction must be reversed.” Id., at 504 .  Concluding that Gulfs “property interests” should not be allowed to lead to a different result in Chickasaw, which did “not function differently from any other town,” id., at 506-508 , the Court invoked the First and Fourteenth Amendments to reverse the appellant’s conviction.  It was the Marsh case that in 1968 provided the foundation for the Court’s decision in Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 308</citedDecision> .  That case involved peaceful picketing within a large *515 shopping center near Altoona, Pa. One of the tenants of the shopping center was a retail store that employed a wholly nonunion staff.  Members of a local union picketed the store, carrying signs proclaiming that it was nonunion and that its employees were not receiving union wages or other union benefits.  The picketing took place on the shopping center’s property in the immediate vicinity of the store.  A Pennsylvania court issued an injunction that required all picketing to be confined to public areas outside the shopping center, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the issuance of this injunction.  This Court held that the doctrine of the Marsh case required reversal of that judgment.  The Court’s opinion pointed out that the First and Fourteenth Amendments would clearly have protected the picketing if it had taken place on a public sidewalk: “It is clear that if the shopping center premises were not privately owned but instead constituted the business area of a municipality, which they to a large extent resemble, petitioners could not be barred from exercising their First Amendment rights there on the sole ground that title to the property was in the municipality.  Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 (1938); Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496 (1939); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413 (1943).  The essence of those opinions is that streets, sidewalks, parks, and other similar public places are so historically associated with the exercise of First Amendment rights that access to them for the purpose of exercising such rights cannot constitutionally be denied broadly and absolutely.” <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 315</citedDecision> .  The Court’s opinion then reviewed the Marsh case in detail, emphasized the similarities between the business *516 block in Chickasaw, Ala., and the Logan Valley shopping center, and unambiguously concluded: “The shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent of the business district of Chickasaw involved in Marsh.” <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 318</citedDecision> .  Upon the basis of that conclusion, the Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments required reversal of the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. There were three dissenting opinions in the Logan Valley case, one of them by the author of the Court’s opinion in Marsh , Mr. Justice Black. His disagreement with the Court’s reasoning was total: “In affirming petitioners’ contentions the majority opinion relies on Marsh v. Alabama, supra, and holds that respondents’ property has been transformed to some type of public property.  But Marsh was never intended to apply to this kind of situation.  Marsh dealt with the very special situation of a company-owned town, complete with streets, alleys, sewers, stores, residences, and everything else that goes to make a town.  ... I can find very little resemblance between the shopping center involved in this case and Chickasaw, Alabama.  There are no homes, there is no sewage disposal plant, there is not even a post office on this private property which the Court now considers the equivalent of a ‘town.’ ” <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 330-331</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  “The question is, Under what circumstances can private property be treated as though it were public?  The answer that Marsh gives is when that property has taken on all the attributes of a town, i.  e., ‘residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a “business block” on which business places are situated.’ 326 U. S., at 502 .  I *517 can find nothing in Marsh which indicates that if one of these features is present, e. g., a business district, this is sufficient for the Court to confiscate a part of an owner’s private property and give its use to people who want to picket on it.” Id., at 332.  “To hold that store owners are compelled by law to supply picketing areas for pickets to drive store customers away is to create a court-made law wholly disregarding the constitutional basis on which private ownership of property rests in this country.  .

 Insofar as the two shopping centers differed as such, the one in Lloyd more closely resembled the business section in Chickasaw, Ala.: “The principal differences between the two centers are that the Lloyd Center is larger than Logan Valley, that Lloyd Center contains more commercial facilities, that Lloyd Center contains a range of professional and nonprofessional services that were not found in Logan Valley, and that Lloyd Center is much more intertwined with public streets than Logan Valley.  Also, as in Marsh, supra, Lloyd’s private police are given full police power by the city of Portland, even though they are hired, fired, controlled, and paid by the owners of the Center.  This was not true in Logan Valley.” 407 U. S., at 575 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  See id., at 570 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  This was the entire thrust of Mr. Justice Marshall’s dissenting opinion in the Lloyd case. See id., at 584.  Mr. Justice White clearly recognized this principle in his Logan Valley dissenting opinion.  <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 339</citedDecision> .  The Court has in the past held that some expression is not protected “speech” within the meaning of the First Amendment.  Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476 ; Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 .  A wholly different balance was struck when the organizational *522 activity was carried on by employees already rightfully on the employer’s property, since the employer’s management interests rather than his property interests were there involved.  Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 .  This difference is “one of substance.” NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S., at 113 .  This is not to say that Hudgens was not a statutory “employer” under the Act.
