 The employees departed but returned a short time later and began picketing in an area of the mall immediately adjacent to the entrances of the Butler store.  After the picketing had continued for approximately 30 minutes, the shopping center manager again informed the pickets that if they did not leave they would be arrested for trespassing.  The pickets departed.  The union subsequently filed with the Board an unfair labor practice charge against Hudgens, alleging interference with rights protected by § 7 of the Act, 29 *510 U. S. C. § 157.  [2] Relying on this Court's decision in Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 , the Board entered a cease-and-desist order against Hudgens, reasoning that because the warehouse employees enjoyed a First Amendment right to picket on the shopping center property, the owner's threat of arrest violated § 8 (a) (1) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (a) (1).  [3] Hudgens filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  Soon thereafter this Court decided Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 , and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 539</citedDecision> , and the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of those two decisions.  The Board, in turn, remanded to an Administrative Law Judge, who made findings of fact, recommendations, and conclusions to the effect that Hudgens had committed an unfair labor practice by excluding the pickets.  *511 This result was ostensibly reached under the statutory criteria set forth in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105 , a case which held that union organizers who seek to solicit for union membership may intrude on an employer's private property if no alternative means exist for communicating with the employees.  But the Administrative Law Judge's opinion also relied on this Court's constitutional decision in Logan Valley for a "realistic view of the facts." The Board agreed with the findings and recommendations of the Administrative Law Judge, but departed somewhat from his reasoning.  It concluded that the pickets were within the scope of Hudgens' invitation to members of the public to do business at the shopping center, and that it was, therefore, immaterial whether or not there existed an alternative means of communicating with the customers and employees of the Butler store.  [4] Hudgens again petitioned for review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and there the Board changed its tack and urged that the case was controlled not by Babcock & Wilcox, but by Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 , a case which held that an employer commits an unfair labor practice if he enforces a no-solicitation rule against employees on his premises who are also union organizers, unless he can prove that the rule is necessitated by special circumstances.

 But even under the Court's reading of the opinions of the Board and the Court of Appeals, the statutory question on which it remands is now before the Court. By bypassing that question and reaching out to overrule a constitutionally based decision, the Court surely departs from traditional modes of adjudication.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on purely statutory grounds.  And on the merits of the only question that the Court decides, I dissent from the overruling of Logan Valley.  I The Court views the history of this litigation as one of "shifting positions" and "considerable confusion." To be sure, the Board's position has not been constant.  But the ultimate decisions by the Administrative Law Judge *527 and by the Board rested solely on § 7 of the NLRA, not on the First Amendment.  As the Court indicates, the Board's initial determination that petitioner violated § 8 (a) (1) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (a) (1), was based on its reading of Logan Valley, a First Amendment case. But before the Court of Appeals reviewed this initial determination, this Court decided Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 (1972), and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 539</citedDecision> (1972), and the Board moved to have the case remanded for reconsideration in light of these two decisions.  The Court of Appeals granted the motion.  Lloyd and Central Hardware demonstrated, each in its own way, that Logan Valley could not be read as broadly as some Courts of Appeals had read it.  And together they gave a signal to the Board and to the Court of Appeals that it would be wise to pass upon statutory contentions in cases of this sort before turning to broad constitutional questions, the answers to which could no longer be predicted with certainty.  See <citedDecision>Central Hardware, supra, at 548, 549</citedDecision> (MARSHALL, J., dissenting); Lloyd, supra, at 584 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  Taking heed of this signal, the Administrative Law Judge and the Board proceeded on remand to assess the conflicting rights of the employees and the shopping center owner within the framework of the NLRA.  The Administrative Law Judge's recommendation that petitioner be found guilty of a § 8 (a) (1) violation rested explicitly on the statutory test enunciated by this Court in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105 (1956).  That the Administrative Law Judge supported his "realistic view of the facts" by referring to this Court's "factual view" of the Logan Valley case surely cannot be said to alter the judge's explicitly stated legal theory, which was a statutory one.  *528 Even more clearly, the Board's rationale in agreeing with the Administrative Law Judge's recommendation was exclusively a statutory one.  Nowhere in the Board's decision, Hudgens v. Local 315, Retail, Wholesale & Dept. Store Union, 205 N. L. R. B. 628 (1973), is there any reference to the First Amendment or any constitutionally based decision.  The Board reached its result "for the reasons specifically set forth in Frank Visceglia and Vincent Visceglia, t/a Peddie Buildings, " [1] ibid., a case decided solely on § 7 grounds.

 Lloyd involved the distribution of antiwar handbills in a large shopping center, and while some of us viewed *536 the case differently, 407 U. S., at 570, 577-579 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), the Court treated it as presenting the question left open in Logan Valley.  But the Court did no more than decide that question.  It preserved the holding of Logan Valley, as limited to cases in which (1) the picketing is directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property is put, and (2) "no other reasonable opportunities for the pickets to convey their message to their intended audience [are] available." 407 U. S., at 563.  The Court today gives short shrift to the language in Lloyd preserving Logan Valley, and quotes extensively from language that admittedly differs in emphasis from much of the language of Logan Valley.  But even the language quoted by the Court says no more than that the dedication of the Lloyd Center to public use was more limited than the dedication of the company town in Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U. S. 501 (1946), and that the pickets in Lloyd were not entitled to exercise "the asserted First Amendment rights"that is, the right to distribute antiwar handbills.  Any doubt about the limited scope of Lloyd is removed completely by a consideration of Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 539</citedDecision> (1972), decided the same day as Lloyd.  In Central Hardware the Court was faced with solicitation by nonemployee union organizers on a parking lot of a retail store that was not part of a shopping center complexactivity clearly related to the use to which the private property had been put.  The Court found the activity unprotected by the First Amendment, but in a way that explicitly preserved the holding in Logan Valley.  The Court could have held that the First Amendment has no application to use-related activity on privately owned business property, thereby rejecting Logan Valley, but instead the Court chose to *537 distinguish the parking lot in Central Hardware from the shopping center complex in Logan Valley.  Rejecting the argument that the opening of property to the general public suffices to activate the prohibition of the First Amendment, the Court explained: "This analysis misconceives the rationale of Logan Valley.  Logan Valley involved a large commercial shopping center which the Court found had displaced, in certain relevant respects, the functions of the normal municipal `business block.' First and Fourteenth Amendment free-speech rights were deemed infringed under the facts of that case when the property owner invoked the trespass laws of the State against the pickets.

 [10]  A wholly different balance was struck when the organizational activity was carried on by employees already rightfully on the employer's property, since the employer's management interests rather than his property interests were there involved.  Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 .  This difference is "one of substance." NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S., at 113 .  [11]  This is not to say that Hudgens was not a statutory "employer" under the Act.  See n. 3, supra. [12] 351 U. S., at 112 .  This language was explicitly reaffirmed as stating "the guiding principle" in Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 539, 544</citedDecision> .  [1]  In his dissent in Logan Valley, Mr. Justice Black stated that " Marsh was never intended to apply to this kind of situation.  .  .  .  [T]he basis on which the Marsh decision rested was that the property involved encompassed an area that for all practical purposes had been turned into a town; the area had all the attributes of a town and was exactly like any other town in Alabama.  I can find very little resemblance between the shopping center involved in this case and Chickasaw, Alabama."
