This scope of search incident to arrest, extending to all items under the suspect’s “control,” was reaffirmed in a dictum in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 158 (1925).  Accord, Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20, 30 (1925) (holding that “the place where the arrest is made” may be searched “is not to be doubted”).  The rule was reaffirmed in Marron v. United States, 275 U. S. 192, 199 (1927), where the Court asserted that authority *771 to search incident to an arrest “extended to all parts of the premises used for the unlawful purpose.” Within five years, this rule was qualified by two Prohibition Act cases, Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 344, 356-358 (1931), and United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U. S. 452, 463-467 (1932).  If Go-Bart and Lefkowitz represented a retreat from the rule of Weeks, Carroll, Agnello, and Marron , the vigor of the earlier rule was reaffirmed in Harris v. United States, 331 U. S. 145 (1947), which has, but for one brief interlude, clearly been the law until today.  The very next Term after Harris , in Trupiano v. United States, 334 U. S. 699 (1948), the Court held unjustifiable the seizure of a still incident to the arrest of a man at the still site, even though the still was contraband, had been visible through an open door before entering the premises to be “searched,” and although a crime was being committed in the officers’ presence.  Accord, that year, McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 (1948) (gambling game seen through transom before entry).  Less than two years later, however, the Court returned to the Harris rule in United States v. Rabinowitz, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 56</citedDecision> (1950), where the Court held that the reasonableness of a search does not depend upon the practicability of obtaining a search warrant, and that the fact of a valid arrest is relevant to reasonableness.  Trupiano was pro tanto overruled.  Such rapid reversals have occurred before, 1 but they are rare.  Here there had been two about-faces, one following hard upon the other.  Justice Frankfurter objected in this language: “Especially ought the Court not reenforce needlessly the instabilities of our day by giving fair ground for the belief that Law is the expression of *772 chance — for instance, of unexpected changes in the Court’s composition and the contingencies in the choice of successors.” <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 86</citedDecision> .  Since that time, the rule of Weeks, Marron, Harris, and <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> has clearly been the law. E. g., Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., writing for the Court) ; Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963).  2 II.  The rule which has prevailed, but for very brief or doubtful periods of aberration, is that a search incident to an arrest may extend to those areas under the control of the defendant and where items subject to constitutional seizure may be found. The justification for this rule must, under the language of the Fourth Amendment, lie in the reasonableness of the rule.  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 9 (1968); Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 (1968); Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 222 (1960).  The Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” In terms, then, the Court must decide whether a given search is reasonable.  The Amendment does not proscribe “warrantless searches” but instead it proscribes “unrea *773 sonable searches” and this Court has never held nor does the majority today assert that warrantless searches are necessarily unreasonable.  Applying this reasonableness test to the area of searches incident to arrests, one thing is clear at the outset.

 I would uphold the constitutionality of this search contemporaneous with an arrest since there were probable cause both for the search and for the arrest, exigent circumstances involving the removal or destruction of evidence, and satisfactory opportunity to dispute the issues of probable cause shortly thereafter.  In this case, the search was reasonable.  Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105 (1943), overruled Jones v. Opelika, 316 U. S. 584 (1942); Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457 (1871), overruled Hepburn v. Griswold, 8 Wall. 603 (1870).  The majority cites Kremen v. United States, 353 U. S. 346 (1957), as suggesting an inconsistency.  There, however, in a per curiam opinion the Court merely overturned a general search in which the entire contents of a cabin, which it took 11 pages of fine print for the Court to inventory, were seized.  See Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217, 239 (1960) (Kremen distinguished as a “mass seizure").  Even Mr. Justice Frankfurter, joined in dissent in <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> by Mr. Justice Jackson, admitted that there was an exception to the search-warrant requirement in cases of necessity, and noted that this applied, for example, to vehicles which could readily be moved.  <citedDecision>339 U. S. 56, at 73</citedDecision> .  Before the burglary of the coin store, petitioner had told its owner that he was planning a big robbery, had inquired about the alarm system in the store, the state of the owner’s insurance, and the location of the owner’s most valuable coins.  Petitioner wandered about the store the day before the burglary.  After the burglary, petitioner called the store’s owner and accused him of robbing the store himself for the insurance proceeds on a policy which, as *775 petitioner knew, had just been reduced from $50,000 to $10,000 coverage.  On being told that the robbery had been sloppy, petitioner excitedly claimed that it had been “real professional” but then denied the robbery.  On the night of the robbery itself petitioner declined an invitation to a bicycle ride, saying he was “going to knock over a place” and that a coin shop was “all set.” After the robbery, he told the same neighbor that he had started to break into the coin shop, but had stopped, and then denied the whole incident.  The neighbor had earlier seen stacks of typewriters in petitioner’s house.
