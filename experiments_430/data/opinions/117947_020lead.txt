<p id="b250-5">Petitioner Adarand Constructors, Inc., claims that the Federal Government’s practice of giving general contractors on Government projects a financial incentive to hire subcontractors controlled by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,” and in particular, the Government’s use of race-based presumptions in identifying such individuals, violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The Court of Appeals rejected Adarand’s claim. We conclude, however, that courts should analyze cases of this kind under a different standard of review than the one the Court of Appeals applied. We there<page-number citation-index="1" label="205">*205</page-number>fore vacate the Court of Appeals’ judgment and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>

<p id="b251-3">In 1989, the Central Federal Lands Highway Division (CFLHD), which is part of the United States Department of Transportation (DOT), awarded the prime contract for a highway construction project in Colorado to Mountain Gravel &amp; Construction Company. Mountain Gravel then solicited bids from subcontractors for the guardrail portion of the contract. Adarand, a Colorado-based highway construction company specializing in guardrail work, submitted the low bid. Gonzales Construction Company also submitted a bid.</p>
<p id="b251-4">The prime contract’s terms provide that Mountain Gravel would receive additional compensation if it hired subcontractors certified as small businesses controlled by “socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,” App. 24. Gonzales is certified as such a business; Adarand is not. Mountain Gravel awarded the subcontract to Gonzales, despite Ada-rand’s low bid, and Mountain Gravel’s Chief Estimator has submitted an affidavit stating that Mountain Gravel would have accepted Adarand’s bid, had it not been for the additional payment it received by hiring Gonzales instead. <em>Id., </em>at 28-31. Federal law requires that a subcontracting clause similar to the one used here must appear in most federal agency contracts, and it also requires the clause to state that “[t]he contractor shall presume that socially and economically disadvantaged individuals include Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and other minorities, or any other individual found to be disadvantaged by the [Small Business] Administration pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.” <span class="citation no-link">15 U. S. C. §§ 637</span>(d)(2), (3). Adarand claims that the presumption set forth in that statute discriminates on the basis of <page-number citation-index="1" label="206">*206</page-number>race in violation of the Federal Government’s Fifth Amendment obligation not to deny anyone equal protection of the laws.</p>
<p id="b252-5">These fairly straightforward facts implicate a complex scheme of federal statutes and regulations, to which we now turn. The Small Business Act (Act), <span class="citation no-link">72 Stat. 384</span>, as amended, <span class="citation no-link">15 U. S. C. § 631</span> <em>et seq., </em>declares it to be “the policy of the United States that small business concerns, [and] small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals,... shall have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in the performance of contracts let by any Federal agency.” § 8(d)(1), <span class="citation no-link">15 U. S. C. § 637</span>(d)(1). The Act defines “socially disadvantaged individuals” as “those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities,” § 8(a)(5), <span class="citation no-link">15 U. S. C. § 637</span>(a)(5), and it defines “economically disadvantaged individuals” as “those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged.” § 8(a)(6)(A), <span class="citation no-link">15 U. S. C. § 637</span>(a)(6)(A).</p>
<p id="b252-6">In furtherance of the policy stated in § 8(d)(1), the Act establishes “[t]he Government-wide goal for participation by small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals” at “not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year.” <span class="citation no-link">15 U. S. C. § 644</span>(g)(1). It also requires the head of each federal agency to set agency-specific goals for participation by businesses controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals. <em><span class="citation no-link">Ibid.</span></em></p>
<p id="b252-7">The- Small Business Administration (SBA) has implemented these statutory directives in a variety of ways, two of which are relevant here. One is the “8(a) program,” <page-number citation-index="1" label="207">*207</page-number>which is available to small businesses controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals as the SBA has defined those terms. The 8(a) program confers a wide range of benefits on participating businesses, see, <em>e. g., </em><span class="citation no-link">13 CFR §§ 124.303-124.311</span>,124.403 (1994); 48 CFR subpt. 19.8 (1994), one of which is automatic eligibility for subcontractor compensation provisions of the kind at issue in this case, <span class="citation no-link">15 U. S. C. § 637</span>(d)(3)(C) (conferring presumptive eligibility on anyone “found to be disadvantaged . . . pursuant to section 8(a) of the Small Business Act”). To participate in the 8(a) program, a business must be “small,” as defined in <span class="citation no-link">13 CFR § 124.102</span> (1994); and it must be 51% owned by individuals who qualify as “socially and economically disadvantaged,” §124.103. The SBA presumes that black, Hispanic, Asian Pacific, Subcontinent Asian, and Native Americans, as well as “members of other groups designated from time to time by SBA,” are “socially disadvantaged,” § 124.105(b)(1). It also allows any individual not a member of a listed group to prove social disadvantage “on the basis of clear and convincing evidence,” as described in § 124.105(c). Social disadvantage is not enough to establish eligibility, however; SBA also requires each 8(a) program participant to prove “economic disadvantage” according to the criteria set forth in § 124.106(a).</p>
<p id="b253-5">The other SBA program relevant to this case is the “8(d) subcontracting program,” which unlike the 8(a) program is limited to eligibility for subcontracting provisions like the one at issue here. In determining eligibility, the SBA presumes social disadvantage based on membership in certain minority groups, just as in the 8(a) program, and again appears to require an individualized, although “less restrictive,” showing of economic disadvantage, § 124.106(b). A different set of regulations, however, says that members of minority groups wishing to participate in the 8(d) subcontracting program are entitled to a race-based presumption of social <em>and </em>economic disadvantage. <span class="citation no-link">48 CFR §§19.001</span>, <page-number citation-index="1" label="208">*208</page-number>19.703(a)(2) (1994). We are left with some uncertainty as to whether participation in the 8(d) subcontracting program requires an individualized showing of economic disadvantage. In any event, in both the 8(a) and the 8(d) programs, the presumptions of disadvantage are rebuttable if a third party comes forward with evidence suggesting that the participant is not, in fact, either economically or socially disadvantaged. <span class="citation no-link">13 CFR §§ 124.111</span>(c)-(d), 124.601-124.609 (1994).</p>
<p id="b254-5">The contract giving rise to the dispute in this case came about as a result of the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation Assistance Act of 1987, <span class="citation no-link">Pub. L. 100-17, 101</span> Stat. 132 (STURAA), a DOT appropriations measure. Section 106(c)(1) of STURAA provides that “not less than 10 percent” of the appropriated funds “shall be expended with small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.” <span class="citation no-link">101 Stat. 145</span>. STURAA adopts the Small Business Act’s definition of “socially and economically disadvantaged individual,” including the applicable race-based presumptions, and adds that “women shall be presumed to be socially and economically disadvantaged individuals for purposes of this subsection.” § 106(c)(2)(B), <span class="citation no-link">101 Stat. 146</span>. STURAA also requires the Secretary of Transportation to establish “minimum uniform criteria for State governments to use in certifying whether a concern qualifies for purposes of this subsection.” § 106(c)(4), <span class="citation no-link">101 Stat. 146</span>. The Secretary has done so in 49 CFR pt. 23, subpt. D (1994). Those regulations say that the certifying authority should presume both social and economic disadvantage <em>(i. e., </em>eligibility to participate) if the applicant belongs to certain racial groups, or is a woman. <span class="citation no-link">49 CFR §23.62</span> (1994); 49 CFR pt. 23, subpt. D, App. C (1994). As with the SBA programs, third parties may come forward with evidence in an effort to rebut the presumption of disadvantage for a particular business. <span class="citation no-link">49 CFR §23.69</span> (1994).</p>
<p id="b254-6">The operative clause in the contract in this case reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b255-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="209">*209</page-number><em>“Subcontracting. </em>This subsection is supplemented to include a Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) Development and Subcontracting Provision as follows:</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b255-5">“Monetary compensation is offered for awarding subcontracts to small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals....</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b255-6">“A small business concern will be considered a DBE after it has been certified as such by the U. S. Small Business Administration or any State Highway Agency. Certification by other Government agencies, counties, or cities may be acceptable on an individual basis provided the Contracting Officer has determined the certifying agency has an acceptable and viable DBE certification program. If the Contractor requests payment under this provision, the Contractor shall furnish the engineer with acceptable evidence of the subcontractor(s) DBE certification and shall furnish one certified copy of the executed subcontract(s).</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b255-7">“The Contractor will be paid an amount computed as follows:</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b255-8">“1. If a subcontract is awarded to one DBE, 10 percent of the final amount of the approved DBE subcontract, not to exceed 1.5 percent of the original contract amount.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b255-9">“2. If subcontracts are awarded to two or more DBEs, 10 percent of the final amount of the approved DBE subcontracts, not to exceed 2 percent of the original contract amount.” App. 24-26.</blockquote>
<p id="b255-10">To benefit from this clause, Mountain Gravel had to hire a subcontractor who had been certified as a small disadvantaged business by the SBA, a state highway agency, or some other certifying authority acceptable to the contracting officer. Any of the three routes to such certification described above — SBA’s 8(a) or 8(d) program, or certification by a State <page-number citation-index="1" label="210">*210</page-number>under the DOT regulations — would meet that requirement. The record does not reveal how Gonzales obtained its certification as a small disadvantaged business.</p>
<p id="b256-5">After losing the guardrail subcontract to Gonzales, Ada-rand filed suit against various federal officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, claiming that the race-based presumptions involved in the use of subcontracting compensation clauses violate Adarand’s right to equal protection. The District Court granted the Government’s motion for summary judgment. <em>Adarand Constructors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skinner, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1879640"><a href="/opinion/1879640/adarand-constructors-inc-v-skinner/" aria-description="Citation for case: Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner">790 F. Supp. 240</a></span> (1992). The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. <span class="citation no-link">16 F. 3d 1637</span> (1994). It understood our decision in <em>Fullilove </em>v. <em>Klutznick, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v. Klutznick">448 U. S. 448</a></span> (1980), to have adopted “a lenient standard, resembling intermediate scrutiny, in assessing” the constitutionality of federal race-based action. 16 F. 3d, at 1544. Applying that “lenient standard,” as further developed in <em>Metro Broadcasting, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, </em><span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./497/647/">497 U. S. 647</a></span> (1990), the Court of Appeals upheld the use of subcontractor compensation clauses. 16 F. 3d, at 1547. We granted certiorari. <span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./512/1288/">512 U. S. 1288</a></span> (1994).</p>
<p id="b256-6">II</p>
<p id="b256-7">Adarand, in addition to its general prayer for “such other and further relief as to the Court seems just and equitable,” specifically seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against any <em>future </em>use of subcontractor compensation clauses. App. 22-23 (complaint). Before reaching the merits of Adarand’s challenge, we must consider whether Adarand has standing to seek forward-looking relief. Adarand’s allegation that it has lost a contract in the past because of a subcontractor compensation clause of course entitles it to seek damages for the loss of that contract (we express no view, however, as to whether sovereign immunity would bar such relief on these facts). But as we explained in <em>Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110916"><a href="/opinion/110916/city-of-los-angeles-v-lyons/" aria-description="Citation for case: City of Los Angeles v. Lyons">461 U. S. 95</a></span> (1983), the fact of past injury, “while presumably affording [the plaintiff] standing to claim damages ..., does <page-number citation-index="1" label="211">*211</page-number>nothing to establish a real and immediate threat that he would again” suffer similar injury in the future. <span class="citation" data-id="110916"><a href="/opinion/110916/city-of-los-angeles-v-lyons/#105" aria-description="Citation for case: City of Los Angeles v. Lyons"><em>Id., </em>at 105</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b257-5">If Adarand is to maintain its claim for forward-looking relief, our cases require it to allege that the use of subcontractor compensation clauses in the future constitutes “an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.” <em>Lujan </em>v. <em>Defenders of Wildlife, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112747"><a href="/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/#560" aria-description="Citation for case: Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife">504 U. S. 555, 560</a></span> (1992) (footnote, citations, and internal quotation marks omitted). Adarand’s claim that the Government’s use of subcontractor compensation clauses denies it equal protection of the laws of course alleges an invasion of a legally protected interest, and it does so in a manner that is “particularized” as to Adarand. We note that, contrary to respondents’ suggestion, see Brief for Respondents 29-30, Adarand need not demonstrate that it has been, or will be, the low bidder on a Government contract. The injury in cases of this kind is that a “discriminatory classification prevent[s] the plaintiff from competing on an equal footing.” <em>Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America </em>v. <em>Jacksonville, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112884"><a href="/opinion/112884/northeastern-florida-chapter-of-the-associated-general-contractors-of/#667" aria-description="Citation for case: Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General...">508 U. S. 656, 667</a></span> (1993). The aggrieved party “need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.” <span class="citation" data-id="112884"><a href="/opinion/112884/northeastern-florida-chapter-of-the-associated-general-contractors-of/#666" aria-description="Citation for case: Northeastern Florida Chapter of the Associated General..."><em>Id., </em>at 666</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b257-6">It is less clear, however, that the future use of subcontractor compensation clauses will cause Adarand “imminent” injury. We said in <em><span class="citation" data-id="112747"><a href="/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife">Lujan</a></span> </em>that “[although ‘imminence’ is con-cededly a somewhat elastic concept, it cannot be stretched beyond its purpose, which is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too speculative for Article III purposes — that the injury is <em>‘certainly </em>impending.’” <span class="citation" data-id="112747"><a href="/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/#565" aria-description="Citation for case: Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife"><em>Lujan, supra, </em>at 565, n. 2</a></span>. We therefore must ask whether Adarand has made an adequate showing that sometime in the relatively near future it will bid on another Government contract that offers financial incentives to a prime contractor for hiring disadvantaged subcontractors.</p>
<p id="b258-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="212">*212</page-number>We conclude that Adarand has satisfied this requirement. Adarand’s general manager said in a deposition that his company bids on every guardrail project in Colorado. See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5-A. According to documents produced in discovery, the CFLHD let 14 prime contracts in Colorado that included guardrail work between 1983 and 1990. Plaintiff’s Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 90-C-1413, Exh. I, Attachment A (D. Colo.). Two of those contracts do not present the kind of injury Adarand alleges here. In one, the prime contractor did not subcontract out the guardrail work; in another, the prime contractor was itself a disadvantaged business, and in such cases the contract generally does not include a subcontractor compensation clause. <em>Ibid.; </em>see also <em><span class="citation" data-id="112747"><a href="/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife">id.,</a></span> </em>Supplemental Exhibits, Deposition of Craig Actis 14 (testimony of CFLHD employee that 8(a) contracts do not include subcontractor compensation clauses). Thus, statistics from the years 1983 through 1990 indicate that the CFLHD lets on average <em>IV2 </em>contracts per year that could injure Adarand in the manner it alleges here. Nothing in the record suggests that the CFLHD has altered the frequency with which it lets contracts that include guardrail work. And the record indicates that Adarand often must compete for contracts against companies certified as small disadvantaged businesses. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="112747"><a href="/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife">id.,</a></span> </em>Exh. F, Attachments 1-3. Because the evidence in this case indicates that the CFLHD is likely to let contracts involving guardrail work that contain a subcontractor compensation clause at least once per year in Colorado, that Adarand is very likely to bid on each such contract, and that Adarand often must compete for such contracts against small disadvantaged businesses, we are satisfied that Adarand has standing to bring this lawsuit.</p>
<p id="b258-5">Ill</p>
<p id="b258-6">Respondents urge that “[t]he Subcontracting Compensation Clause program is ... a program based on <em>disadvantage, </em>not on race,” and thus that it is subject only to “the most <page-number citation-index="1" label="213">*213</page-number>relaxed judicial scrutiny.” Brief for Respondents 26. To the extent that the statutes and regulations involved in this case are race neutral, we agree. Respondents concede, however, that “the race-based rebuttable presumption used in some certification determinations under the Subcontracting Compensation Clause” is subject to some heightened level of scrutiny. <em>Id., </em>at 27. The parties disagree as to what that level should be. (We note, incidentally, that this case concerns only classifications based explicitly on race, and presents none of the additional difficulties posed by laws that, although facially race neutral, result in racially disproportionate impact and are motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose. See generally <em>Arlington Heights </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., </em><span class="citation" data-id="109573"><a href="/opinion/109573/village-of-arlington-heights-v-metropolitan-housing-development-corp/" aria-description="Citation for case: Village of Arlington Heights v.

Davis">426 U. S. 229</a></span> (1976).)</p>
<p id="b259-5">Adarand’s claim arises under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that “No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Although this Court has always understood that Clause to provide some measure of protection against <em>arbitrary </em>treatment by the Federal Government, it is not as explicit a guarantee of <em>equal </em>treatment as the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that “No <em>State </em>shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws” (emphasis added). Our cases have accorded varying degrees of significance to the difference in the language of those two Clauses. We think it necessary to revisit the issue here.</p>
<p id="b259-6">A</p>
<p id="b259-7">Through the 1940’s, this Court had routinely taken the view in non-raee-related cases that, “fujnlike the Fourteenth Amendment, the Fifth contains no equal protection clause and it provides no guaranty against discriminatory legislation by Congress.” <em>Detroit Bank </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103738"><a href="/opinion/103738/detroit-bank-v-united-states/#337" aria-description="Citation for case: Detroit Bank v.

S. 329, 337</a></span> (1943); see also, <em>e.g., Helvering </em>v. <em>Lerner Stores Corp., </em><span class="citation" data-id="103574"><a href="/opinion/103574/helvering-v-lerner-stores-corp/#468" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v.

The Fifth Amendment has no equal protection clause”). When the Court first faced a Fifth Amendment equal protection challenge to a federal racial classification, it adopted a similar approach, with most unfortunate results. In <em>Hirabayashi </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103875"><a href="/opinion/103875/hirabayashi-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Hirabayashi v. United States">320 U. S. 81</a></span> (1943), the Court considered a curfew applicable only to persons of Japanese ancestry. The Court observed — correctly—that “[distinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality,” and that “racial discrimina-tions are in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited.” <span class="citation" data-id="103875"><a href="/opinion/103875/hirabayashi-v-united-states/#100" aria-description="Citation for case: Hirabayashi v.

But it also cited <em><span class="citation" data-id="103738"><a href="/opinion/103738/detroit-bank-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Detroit Bank v. United States">Detroit Bank</a></span> </em>for the proposition that the Fifth Amendment “restrains only such discriminatory legislation by Congress as amounts to a denial of due process,” <span class="citation" data-id="103875"><a href="/opinion/103875/hirabayashi-v-united-states/#100" aria-description="Citation for case: Hirabayashi v.

Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the. Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny. Justice Powell’s defense of this conclusion bears repeating here:</p>
<blockquote id="b270-5">“If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather than the individual only because of his membership in a particular group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently. Political judgments regarding the necessity for the particular classification may be weighed in the constitutional balance, <em>[KorematsuJ, </em>but the standard of justification will remain constant. This is as it should be, since those political judgments are the product of rough compromise struck by contending groups within the democratic process. When they touch upon an individual’s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to ,a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling <page-number citation-index="1" label="225">*225</page-number>governmental interest.

<p id="b271-5">A year later, however, the Court took a surprising turn. <em>Metro Broadcasting, Inc. </em>v. <em>FCC, supra, </em>involved a Fifth Amendment challenge to two race-based policies of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In <em>Metro Broadcasting, </em>the Court repudiated the long-held notion that “it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government” than it does on a State to afford equal protection of the laws, <span class="citation" data-id="105222"><a href="/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/#500" aria-description="Citation for case: Bolling v. Sharpe"><em>Bolling, supra, </em>at 500</a></span>. It did so by holding that “benign” federal racial classifications need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny, even though <em>Croson </em>had recently concluded that such classifications enacted by a State must satisfy strict scrutiny. “[BJenign” federal racial classifications, the Court said, “ — even if those measures are not ‘remedial’ in the sense of being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal discrimination — are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve <em>important </em>governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are <em>substantially related </em>to achievement of those objectives.” <em>Metro Broadcasting, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112484"><a href="/opinion/112484/metro-broadcasting-inc-v-federal-communications-commission/#564" aria-description="Citation for case: Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications...">497 U. S., at 564-565</a></span> (emphasis added). The Court did not explain how to tell whether a racial classification should be deemed “benign,” other than to express “confidence] that an ‘examination of the legislative scheme and its history’ will separate benign measures from other types of racial classifications.” <span class="citation" data-id="112484"><a href="/opinion/112484/metro-broadcasting-inc-v-federal-communications-commission/#564" aria-description="Citation for case: Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications..."><em>Id., </em>at 564, n. 12</a></span> (citation omitted).</p>
<p id="b271-6">Applying this test, the Court first noted that the FCC policies at issue did not serve as a remedy for past discrimination. <span class="citation" data-id="112484"><a href="/opinion/112484/metro-broadcasting-inc-v-federal-communications-commission/#566" aria-description="Citation for case: Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications..."><em>Id., </em>at 566</a></span>. Proceeding on the assumption that the policies were nonetheless “benign,” it concluded that they served the “important governmental objective” of “enhancing broadcast diversity,” <span class="citation" data-id="112484"><a href="/opinion/112484/metro-broadcasting-inc-v-federal-communications-commission/#566" aria-description="Citation for case: Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v.

Federal Communications..."><em>id., </em>at 569</a></span>. It therefore upheld the policies.</p>
<p id="b272-5">By adopting intermediate scrutiny as the standard of review for congressionally mandated “benign” racial classifications, <em>Metro Broadcasting </em>departed from prior cases in two significant respects. First, it turned its back on <em>Cro-son’s </em>explanation of why strict scrutiny of all governmental racial classifications is essential:</p>
<blockquote id="b272-6">“Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of determining what classifications are ‘benign’ or ‘remedial’ and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics. Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to ‘smoke out’ illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool. The test also ensures that the means chosen ‘fit’ this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.” <span class="citation" data-id="112176"><a href="/opinion/112176/city-of-richmond-v-j-a-croson-co/#493" aria-description="Citation for case: City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co."><em>Croson, supra, </em>at 493</a></span> (plurality opinion of O’Connor, J.).</blockquote>
<p id="b272-7">We adhere to that view today, despite the surface appeal of holding “benign” racial classifications to a lower standard, because “it may not always be clear that a so-called preference is in fact benign,” <span class="citation" data-id="109930"><a href="/opinion/109930/regents-of-the-university-of-california-v-bakke/#298" aria-description="Citation for case: Regents of the University of California v. Bakke"><em>Bakke, supra, </em>at 298</a></span> (opinion of Powell, J.). “[M]ore than good motives should be required when government seeks to allocate its resources by way of an explicit racial classification system.” Days, Fullilove, 96 Yale L. J. 453, 485 (1987).</p>
<p id="b272-8">Second, <em>Metro Broadcasting </em>squarely rejected one of the three propositions established by the Court’s earlier equal protection cases, namely, congruence between the standards applicable to federal and state racial classifications, and in so doing also undermined the other two — skepticism of all racial <page-number citation-index="1" label="227">*227</page-number>classifications and consistency of treatment irrespective of the race of the burdened or benefited group. See <em>supra, </em>at 223-224. Under <em>Metro Broadcasting, </em>certain racial classifications (“benign” ones enacted by the Federal Government) should be treated less skeptically than others; and the race of the benefited group is critical to the determination of which standard of review to apply. <em>Metro Broadcasting </em>was thus a significant departure from much of what had come before it.</p>
<p id="b273-5">The three propositions undermined by <em>Metro Broadcasting </em>all derive from the basic principle that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution protect <em>persons, </em>not <em>groups. </em>It follows from that principle that all governmental action based on <em>race </em>— a <em>group </em>classification long recognized as “in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited,” <em>Hirabayashi, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103875"><a href="/opinion/103875/hirabayashi-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Hirabayashi v. United States">320 U. S., at 100</a></span> — should be subjected to detailed judicial inquiry to ensure that the <em>personal </em>right to equal protection of the laws has not been infringed. These ideas have long been central to this Court’s understanding of equal protection, and holding “benign” state and federal racial classifications to different standards does not square with them. “[A] free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality,” <em>ibid., </em>should tolerate no retreat from the principle that government may treat people differently because of their race only for the most compelling reasons. Accordingly, we hold today that all racial classifications, imposed by whatever federal, state, or local governmental actor, must be analyzed by a reviewing court under strict scrutiny. In other words, such classifications are constitutional only if they are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling governmental interests. To the extent that <em>Metro Broadcasting </em>is inconsistent with that holding, it is overruled.</p>
<p id="b273-6">In dissent, Justice Stevens criticizes us for “delivering] a disconcerting lecture about the evils of governmental racial classifications,” <em>post, </em>at 242. With respect, we believe his criticisms reflect a serious misunderstanding of our opinion.</p>
<p id="b274-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="228">*228</page-number>Justice Stevens concurs in our view that courts should take a skeptical view of all governmental racial classifications. <em><span class="citation" data-id="103875"><a href="/opinion/103875/hirabayashi-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Hirabayashi v. United States">Ibid.</a></span> </em>He also allows that “[n]othing is inherently wrong with applying a single standard to fundamentally different situations, as long as that standard takes relevant differences into account.” <em>Post, </em>at 246. What he fails to recognize is that strict scrutiny <em>does </em>take “relevant differences” into account — indeed, that is its fundamental purpose. The point of carefully examining the interest asserted by the government in support of a racial classification, and the evidence offered to show that the classification is needed, is precisely to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of race in governmental decisionmaking. See <em>supra, </em>at 226. And Justice Stevens concedes that “some cases may be difficult to classify,” <em>post, </em>at 245, and n. 4; all the more reason, in our view, to examine all racial classifications carefully. Strict scrutiny does not “trea[t] dissimilar race-based decisions as though they were equally objectionable,” <em>post, </em>at 245; to the contrary, it evaluates carefully all governmental race-based decisions <em>in order to decide </em>which are constitutionally objectionable and which are not. By requiring strict scrutiny of racial classifications, we require courts to make sure that a governmental classification based on race, which “so seldom provide[s] a relevant basis for disparate treatment,” <em>Fulli-love, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/#534" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v. Klutznick">448 U. S., at 534</a></span> (Stevens, J., dissenting), is legitimate, before permitting unequal treatment based on race to proceed.</p>
<p id="b274-5">Justice Stevens chides us for our “supposed inability to differentiate between ‘invidious’ and ‘benign’ discrimination,” because it is in his view sufficient that “people understand the difference between good intentions and bad.” <em>Post, </em>at 245. But, as we have just explained, the point of strict scrutiny is to “differentiate between” permissible and impermissible governmental use of race. And Justice Stevens himself has already explained in his dissent in <em>Full-ilove </em>why “good intentions” alone are not enough to sustain</p>
<p id="b275-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="229">*229</page-number>a supposedly “benign” racial classification: “[E]ven though it is not the actual predicate for this legislation, a statute of this kind inevitably is perceived by many as resting on an assumption that those who are granted this special preference are less qualified in some respect that is identified purely by their race. Because that <em>perception </em>— especially <em>when fostered by the Congress of the United States </em>— can only exacerbate rather than reduce racial prejudice, it will delay the time when race will become a truly irrelevant, or at least insignificant, factor. <em>Unless Congress clearly articulates the need and basis </em>for a racial classification, <em>and also tailors the classification to its justification, </em>the Court should not uphold this kind of statute.” <em>Fullilove, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/#545" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v.

These passages make a persuasive case for requiring strict scrutiny of congressional racial classifications.</p>
<p id="b275-5">Perhaps it is not the standard of strict scrutiny itself, but our use of the concepts of “consistency” and “congruence” in conjunction with it, that leads Justice Stevens to dissent. According to Justice Stevens, our view of consistency “equate[s] remedial preferences with invidious discrimination,” <em>post, </em>at 246, and ignores the difference between “an engine of oppression” and an effort “to foster equality in society,” or, more colorfully, “between a ‘No Trespassing’ sign and a welcome mat,” <em>post, </em>at 243, 245. It does nothing of the kind. The principle of consistency simply means that whenever the government treats any person unequally be<page-number citation-index="1" label="230">*230</page-number>cause of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection. It says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny. The principle of consistency explains the circumstances in which the injury requiring strict scrutiny occurs. The application of strict scrutiny, in turn, determines whether a compelling governmental interest justifies the infliction of that injury.</p>
<p id="b276-5">Consistency <em>does </em>recognize that any individual suffers an injury when he or she is disadvantaged by the government because of his or her race, whatever that race may be. This Court clearly stated that principle in <em>Croson, </em>see <span class="citation" data-id="112176"><a href="/opinion/112176/city-of-richmond-v-j-a-croson-co/#493" aria-description="Citation for case: City of Richmond v.

Justice Stevens does not explain how his views square with <em>Croson, </em>or with the long line of cases understanding equal protection as a personal right.</p>
<p id="b276-6">Justice Stevens also claims that we have ignored any difference between federal and state legislatures. But requiring that Congress, like the States, enact racial classifications only when doing so is necessary to further a “compelling interest” does not contravene any principle of appropriate respect for a coequal branch of the Government. It is true that various Members of this Court have taken different views of the authority §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment confers upon Congress to deal with the problem of racial discrimination, and the extent to which courts should defer to Congress’ exercise of that authority.

For now, it is enough to observe that Justice Stevens’ suggestion that any Member of this Court has repudiated in this case his or her previously expressed views on the subject, <em>post, </em>at 249-253, 256-257, is incorrect.</p>
<p id="b277-5">C</p>
<p id="b277-6">“Although adherence to precedent is not rigidly required in constitutional cases, any departure from the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>demands special justification.” <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Rumsey, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111194"><a href="/opinion/111194/arizona-v-rumsey/#212" aria-description="Citation for case: Arizona v. Rumsey">467 U. S. 203, 212</a></span> (1984). In deciding whether this case presents such justification, we recall Justice Frankfurter’s admonition that <em>“stare decisis </em>is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Hallock, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103292"><a href="/opinion/103292/helvering-v-hallock/#119" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v. Hallock">309 U. S. 106, 119</a></span> (1940). Remaining true to an “intrinsically sounder” doctrine established in prior cases better serves the values of <em>stare decisis </em>than would following a more recently decided case inconsistent with the decisions that came before it; the latter course would simply compound the recent error and would likely make the unjustified break from previously established doctrine complete. In such a situation, “special justification” exists to depart from the recently decided case.</p>
<p id="b277-7">As we have explained, <em>Metro Broadcasting </em>undermined important principles of this Court’s equal protection jurisprudence, established in a line of cases stretching back over 50 years, see <em>supra, </em>at 213-225. Those principles together stood for an “embracing” and “intrinsically soun[d]” understanding of equal protection “verified by experience,” namely, that the Constitution imposes upon federal, state, and local governmental actors the same obligation to respect <page-number citation-index="1" label="232">*232</page-number>the personal right to equal protection of the laws. This case therefore presents precisely the situation described by Justice Frankfurter in <em>Helvering: </em>We cannot adhere to our most recent decision without colliding with an accepted and established doctrine. We also note that <em>Metro Broadcasting’s </em>application of different standards of review to federal and state racial classifications has been consistently criticized by commentators. See, <em>e. g., </em>Fried, <em>Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC: </em>Two Concepts of Equality, <span class="citation no-link">104 Harv. L. Rev. 107</span>, 113— 117 (1990) (arguing that <em>Metro Broadcasting’s </em>adoption of different standards of review for federal and state racial classifications placed the law in an “unstable condition," and advocating strict scrutiny across the board); Comment, <em>Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC: </em>Requiem for a Heavyweight, 69 Texas L. Rev. 125, 145-146 (1990) (same); Linder, Review of Affirmative Action After <em>Metro Broadcasting v.

In addition, such precedent is likely to have engendered substantial reliance, as was true in <em><span class="citation" data-id="112786"><a href="/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/" aria-description="Citation for case: Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v.

But in this case, as we have explained, we do not face a precedent of that kind, because <em>Metro Broadcasting </em>itself <em>departed </em>from our prior cases — and did so quite recently. By refusing to follow <page-number citation-index="1" label="234">*234</page-number><em>Metro Broadcasting, </em>then, we do not depart from the fabric of the law; we restore it. We also note that reliance on a case that has recently departed from precedent is likely to be minimal, particularly where, as here, the rule set forth in that case is unlikely to affect primary conduct in any event.

<p id="b280-5">Justice Stevens takes us to task for what he perceives to be an erroneous application of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis. </em>But again, he misunderstands our position. We have acknowledged that, after <em>Croson, </em>“some uncertainty persisted with respect to the standard of review for federal racial classifications,” <em>supra, </em>at 223, and we therefore do not say that we “merely restor[e] the <em>status quo </em>ante” today, <em>post, </em>at 257. But as we have described <em>supra, </em>at 213-227, we think that well-settled legal principles pointed toward a conclusion different from that reached in <em>Metro Broadcasting, </em>and we therefore disagree with Justice Stevens that “the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the Court reached,” <em>post, </em>at 257. We also disagree with Justice Stevens that Justice Stewart’s dissenting opinion in <em><span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v. Klutznick">Fullilove</a></span> </em>supports his “novelty” argument, see <em>post, </em>at 258-259, and n. 13. Justice Stewart said that “[u]nder our Constitution, any official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect and presumptively invalid,” and that “‘[e]qual protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment.’” <em>Fullilove, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/#523" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v.

He took the view that “[t]he hostility of the Constitution to racial classifications by government has been manifested in many cases decided by this Court,” and that “our cases have made clear that the Constitution is <page-number citation-index="1" label="235">*235</page-number>wholly neutral in forbidding such racial discrimination, whatever the race may be of those who are its victims.” <span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/#524" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v. Klutznick"><em>Id., </em>at 524</a></span>. Justice Stewart gave no indication that he thought he was addressing a “novel” proposition, <em>post, </em>at 259. Rather, he relied on the fact that the text of the Fourteenth Amendment extends its guarantee to “persons,” and on cases like <em>Buckley, Loving, McLaughlin, Bolling, Hirabayashi, </em>and <em>Korematsu, </em>see <span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/#524" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v.

There is nothing new about the notion that Congress, like the States, may treat people differently because of their race only for compelling reasons.</p>
<p id="b281-4">“The real problem,” Justice Frankfurter explained, “is whether a principle shall prevail over its later misapplications.” <em>Helvering, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103292"><a href="/opinion/103292/helvering-v-hallock/#122" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v.

But we agree with Justice Stevens that, “[b]ecause racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment, and because classifications based on race are potentially so harmful to the entire body politic, it is especially important that the reasons for any such classification be clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate,” and that “[rjacial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification.” <span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/#533" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v. Klutznick"><em>Fullilove, supra, </em>at 533-535, 537</a></span> (dissenting opinion) (footnotes omitted). We think that requiring strict scrutiny is the best way to ensure that courts will consistently give racial classifications that kind of detailed examination, both as to ends and as to means. <em>Korematsu </em>demonstrates vividly that even “the most rigid scrutiny” can sometimes fail to detect an illegitimate racial classification, compare <em>Korematsu, </em>323 U. S., at 223 (“To cast this case into outlines of racial prejudice, without reference to the real military dangers which were presented, merely confuses the issue. Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race”), with <span class="citation no-link">Pub. L. 100-383, § 2</span>(a), <span class="citation no-link">102 Stat. 903</span>-904 (“[Tjhese actions [of relocating and interning civilians of Japanese ancestry] were carried out without adequate security reasons .. . and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership”). Any retreat from the most searching judicial inquiry can only increase the risk of another such error occurring in the future.</p>
<p id="b283-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="237">*237</page-number>Finally, we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is “strict in theory, but fatal in fact.” <span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/#519" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v. Klutznick"><em>Fullilove, supra, </em>at 519</a></span> (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment). The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. As recently as 1987, for example, every Justice of this Court agreed that the Alabama Department of Public Safety’s “pervasive, systematic, and obstinate discriminatory conduct” justified a narrowly tailored race-based remedy. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111827"><a href="/opinion/111827/united-states-v-paradise/#167" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the “narrow tailoring” test this Court has set out in previous cases.</p>

<p id="b283-3">Because our decision today alters the playing field in some important respects, we think it best to remand the case to the lower courts for further consideration in light of the principles we have announced. The Court of Appeals, following <em>Metro Broadcasting </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v. Klutznick">Fullilove</a></span>, </em>analyzed the case in terms of intermediate scrutiny. It upheld the challenged statutes and regulations because it found them to be “narrowly tailored to achieve [their] <em>significant governmental purpose </em>of providing subcontracting opportunities for small disadvantaged business enterprises.” 16 F. 3d, at 1547 (emphasis added). The Court of Appeals did not decide the question whether the interests served by the use of subcontractor compensation clauses are properly described as “compelling.” It also did not address the question of narrow tailoring in terms of our strict scrutiny cases, by asking, for example, whether there was “any consideration of the use of <page-number citation-index="1" label="238">*238</page-number>race-neutral means to increase minority business participation” in government contracting, <span class="citation" data-id="112176"><a href="/opinion/112176/city-of-richmond-v-j-a-croson-co/#507" aria-description="Citation for case: City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co."><em>Croson, supra, </em>at 507</a></span>, or whether the program was appropriately limited such that it “will not last longer than the discriminatory effects it is designed to eliminate,” <span class="citation" data-id="110338"><a href="/opinion/110338/fullilove-v-klutznick/#513" aria-description="Citation for case: Fullilove v.

<p id="b284-5">Moreover, unresolved questions remain concerning the details of the complex regulatory regimes implicated by the use of subcontractor compensation clauses. For example, the SBA’s 8(a) program requires an individualized inquiry into the economic disadvantage of every participant, see <span class="citation no-link">13 CFR § 124.106</span>(a) (1994), whereas the DOT’s regulations implementing STURAA § 106(c) do <em>not </em>require certifying authorities to make such individualized inquiries, see <span class="citation no-link">49 CFR §23.62</span> (1994); 49 CFR pt. 23, subpt. D, App. C (1994). And the regulations seem unclear as to whether 8(d) subcontractors must make individualized showings, or instead whether the race-based presumption applies both to social <em>and </em>economic disadvantage, compare <span class="citation no-link">13 CFR § 124.106</span>(b) (1994) (apparently requiring 8(d) participants to make an individualized showing), with <span class="citation no-link">48 CFR § 19.703</span>(a)(2) (1994) (apparently allowing 8(d) subcontractors to invoke the race-based presumption for social and economic disadvantage). See generally Part I, <em>supra. </em>We also note an apparent discrepancy between the definitions of which socially disadvantaged individuals qualify as economically disadvantaged for the 8(a) and 8(d) programs; the former requires a showing that such individuals’ ability to compete has been impaired “as compared to others in the same or similar line of business <em>who are not socially disadvantaged,'” </em><span class="citation no-link">13 CFR § 124.106</span>(a) (l)(i) (1994) (emphasis added), while the latter requires that showing only “as compared to others in the same or similar line of business,” § 124.106(b)(1). The question whether any of the ways in which the Government uses subcontractor compensation clauses can survive strict scrutiny, and any relevance distinctions such as these may have to that ques<page-number citation-index="1" label="239">*239</page-number>tion, should be addressed in the first instance by the lower courts.</p>
<p id="b285-5">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>
<p id="b285-6">
<em>It is so ordered.</em>
