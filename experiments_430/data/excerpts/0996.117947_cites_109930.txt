 Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967), which struck down a race-based state law, cited Korematsu for the proposition that “the Equal Protection Clause demands that racial classifications ... be subjected to the ‘most rigid scrutiny.’” 388 U. S., at 11 .  The various opinions in Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677 (1973), which concerned sex discrimination by the Federal Government, took their equal protection standard of review from Reed v. Reed, 404 U. S. 71 (1971), a case that invalidated sex discrimination by a State, without mentioning any possibility of a difference between the standards applicable to state and federal action.  Frontiero, 411 U. S., at 682-684 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 691 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 692 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  Thus, in 1975, the Court stated explicitly that “[t]his Court’s approach to Fifth Amendment equal protection claims has always been precisely the same as to equal protection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 638, n. 2 ; see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 93 (1976) (“Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment”); United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S. 149, 166, n. 16 (1987) (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.) (“[T]he reach of the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment is coextensive with that of the Fourteenth”).  We do not understand a few contrary suggestions appearing in cases in which we found special deference to *218 the political branches of the Federal Government to be appropriate, e. g., Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 100, 101-102, n. 21 (1976) (federal power over immigration), to detract from this general rule.  B Most of the cases discussed above involved classifications burdening groups that have suffered discrimination in our society.  In 1978, the Court confronted the question whether race-based governmental action designed to benefit such groups should also be subject to “the most rigid scrutiny.” Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, <citedDecision>438 U. S. 265</citedDecision> , involved an equal protection challenge to a state-run medical school’s practice of reserving a number of spaces in its entering class for minority students.  The petitioners argued that “strict scrutiny” should apply only to “classifications that disadvantage ‘discrete and insular minorities.’” <citedDecision>Id., at 287-288</citedDecision> (opinion of Powell, J.) (citing United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144, 152, n. 4 (1938)).  <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> did not produce an opinion for the Court, but Justice Powell’s opinion announcing the Court’s judgment rejected the argument.  In a passage joined by Justice White, Justice Powell wrote that “[t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color.” <citedDecision>438 U. S., at 289-290</citedDecision> .  He concluded that “[r]acial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination.” <citedDecision>Id., at 291</citedDecision> .  On the other hand, four Justices in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> would have applied a less stringent standard of review to racial classifications “designed to further remedial purposes,” see <citedDecision>id., at 359</citedDecision> (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  And four Justices thought the case should be decided on statutory grounds.  <citedDecision>Id., at 411-412, 421</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart and Rehn *219 quist, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Two years after <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> , the Court faced another challenge to remedial race-based action, this time involving action undertaken by the Federal Government.  In Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448 (1980), the Court upheld Congress’ inclusion of a 10% set-aside for minority-owned businesses in the Public Works Employment Act of 1977.  As in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> , there was no opinion for the Court. Chief Justice Burger, in an opinion joined by Justices White and Powell, observed that “[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination to make sure that it does not conflict with constitutional guarantees.” 448 U. S., at 491 .  That opinion, however, “d[id] not adopt, either expressly or implicitly, the formulas of analysis articulated in such cases as [Bakke] ” Id., at 492 .  It employed instead a two-part test which asked, first, “whether the objectives of th[e] legislation are within the power of Congress,” and second, “whether the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria, in the context presented, is a constitutionally permissible means for achieving the congressional objectives.” Id., at 473 .  It then upheld the program under that test, adding at the end of the opinion that the program also “would survive judicial review under either ‘test’ articulated in the several <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> opinions.” Id., at 492.  Justice Powell wrote separately to express his view that the plurality opinion had essentially applied “strict scrutiny” as described in his Bakke opinion — i.  e., it had determined that the set-aside was “a necessary means of advancing a compelling governmental interest” — and had done so correctly.  448 U. S., at 496 (concurring opinion).  Justice Stewart (joined by then-Justice Rehnquist) dissented, arguing that the Constitution required the Federal Government to meet the same strict standard as the States when enacting racial classifications, id., at 523 , and n. 1, and that the program before the Court failed that standard.  Justice Stevens also dis *220 sented, arguing that “[rjacial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification,” id., at 537 , and that the program before the Court could not be characterized “as a ‘narrowly tailored’ remedial measure.” Id., at 541 .  Justice Marshall (joined by Justices Brennan and Blackmun) concurred in the judgment, reiterating the view of four Justices in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> that any race-based governmental action designed to “remed[y] the present effects of past racial discrimination” should be upheld if it was “substantially related” to the achievement of an “important governmental objective”— i.  e., such action should be subjected only to what we now call “intermediate scrutiny.” 448 U. S., at 518-519 .  In Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), the Court considered a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to another form of remedial racial classification.  The issue in Wygant was whether a school board could adopt race-based preferences in determining which teachers to lay off.  Justice Powell’s plurality opinion observed that “the level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification operates against a group that historically has not been subject to governmental discrimination,” id., at 273 , and stated the two-part inquiry as “whether the layoff provision is supported by a compelling state purpose and whether the means chosen to accomplish that purpose are narrowly tailored.” Id., at 274 .  In other words, “racial classifications of any sort must be subjected to ‘strict scrutiny.’” Id., at 285 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The plurality then concluded that the school board’s interest in “providing minority role models for its minority students, as an attempt to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination,” id., at 274 , was not a compelling interest that could justify the use of a racial classification.
**Lead Opinion**
 Justice White concurred only in the judgment, although he agreed that the school board’s asserted interests could not, “singly or together, justify this racially discriminatory layoff policy.” Id., at 295 .  Four Justices dissented, three of whom again argued for intermediate scrutiny of remedial race-based government action.  Id., at 301-302 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting).  The Court’s failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove, and Wygant left unresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-based governmental action.  See United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S., at 166 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.) (“[Although this Court has consistently held that some elevated level of scrutiny is required when a racial or ethnic distinction is made for remedial purposes, it has yet to reach consensus on the appropriate constitutional analysis”); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 480 (1986) (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.).  Lower courts found this lack of guidance unsettling.  See, e. g., Kromnick v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 739 F. 2d 894 , 901 (CA3 1984) (“The absence of an Opinion of the Court in either <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> or Fullilove and the concomitant failure of the Court to articulate an analytic framework supporting the judgments makes the position of the lower federal courts considering the constitutionality of affirmative action programs somewhat vulnerable”), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1107 (1985); Williams v. New Orleans, 729 F. 2d 1554, 1567 (CA5 1984) (en banc) (Hig-ginbotham, J., concurring specially); South Florida Chapter of Associated General Contractors of America, Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., 723 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA11), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 871 (1984).  The Court resolved the issue, at least in part, in 1989.  Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), concerned a *222 city’s determination that 30% of its contracting work should go to minority-owned businesses.  A majority of the Court in Croson held that “the standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification,” and that the single standard of review for racial classifications should be “strict scrutiny.” Id., at 493-494 (opinion of O’Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (“I agree ... with Justice O’Connor’s conclusion that strict scrutiny must be applied to all governmental classification by race”).  As to the classification before the Court, the plurality agreed that “a state or local subdivision .  .  .

 Id., at 491 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 522 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (“[Wjithout revisiting what we held in Fullilove ... , I do not believe our decision in that case controls the one before us here”).  On the other hand, the Court subsequently indicated that Croson had at least some bearing on federal race-based ac *223 tion when it vacated a decision upholding such action and remanded for further consideration in light of Croson.  H. K. Porter Co. v. Metropolitan Dade County, 489 U. S. 1062 (1989); see also Shurberg Broadcasting of Hartford, Inc. v. FCC, 876 F. 2d 902, 915, n. 16 (CADC 1989) (opinion of Silber-man, J.) (noting the Court’s action in H. K. Porter Co.), rev’d sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990).  Thus, some uncertainty persisted with respect to the standard of review for federal racial classifications.  See, e. g., Mann v. Albany, 883 F. 2d 999, 1006 (CA11 1989) (Cro-son “may be applicable to race-based classifications imposed by Congress”); Shurberg, 876 F. 2d, at 910 (noting the difficulty of extracting general principles from the Court’s fractured opinions); id., at 959 (Wald, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (“Croson certainly did not resolve the substantial questions posed by congressional programs which mandate the use of racial preferences”); Winter Park Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 873 F. 2d 347 , 366 (CADC 1989) (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The unresolved ambiguity of Fullilove and Croson leaves it impossible to reach a firm opinion as to the evidence of discrimination needed to sustain a congressional mandate of racial preferences”), aff’d sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, supra. Despite lingering uncertainty in the details, however, the Court’s cases through Croson had established three general propositions with respect to governmental racial classifications.  First, skepticism: “Any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination,’ ” Wygant, 476 U. S., at 273 (plurality opinion of Powell, J.); Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 491 (opinion of Burger, C. J.); see also id., at 523 (Stewart, J., dissenting) (“[A]ny official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect”); McLaughlin, 379 U. S., at 192 (“[R]acial classifications [are] ‘constitutionally suspect’ ”); Hirabayashi, 320 U. S., at 100 (“Distinctions *224 between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people”).  Second, consistency: “[T]he standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification,” Croson, 488 U. S., at 494 (plurality opinion); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also Bakke, <citedDecision>438 U. S., at 289-290</citedDecision> (opinion of Powell, J.), i.  e., all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized.  And third, congruence: “Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 93 ; see also Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 638, n. 2 ; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S., at 500 .  Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the.  Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.  Justice Powell’s defense of this conclusion bears repeating here: “If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather than the individual only because of his membership in a particular group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently.  Political judgments regarding the necessity for the particular classification may be weighed in the constitutional balance, [KorematsuJ, but the standard of justification will remain constant.  This is as it should be, since those political judgments are the product of rough compromise struck by contending groups within the democratic process.  When they touch upon an individual’s race or ethnic background, he is entitled to ,a judicial determination that the burden he is asked to bear on that basis is precisely tailored to serve a compelling *225 governmental interest.  The Constitution guarantees that right to every person regardless of his background.  Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. [1, 22 (1948)].” <citedDecision>Bakke, supra, at 299</citedDecision> (opinion of Powell, J.) (footnote omitted).  A year later, however, the Court took a surprising turn.  Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, supra, involved a Fifth Amendment challenge to two race-based policies of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  In Metro Broadcasting, the Court repudiated the long-held notion that “it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government” than it does on a State to afford equal protection of the laws, Bolling, supra, at 500 .  It did so by holding that “benign” federal racial classifications need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny, even though Croson had recently concluded that such classifications enacted by a State must satisfy strict scrutiny.  “[BJenign” federal racial classifications, the Court said, “ — even if those measures are not ‘remedial’ in the sense of being designed to compensate victims of past governmental or societal discrimination — are constitutionally permissible to the extent that they serve important governmental objectives within the power of Congress and are substantially related to achievement of those objectives.” Metro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 564-565 (emphasis added).  The Court did not explain how to tell whether a racial classification should be deemed “benign,” other than to express “confidence] that an ‘examination of the legislative scheme and its history’ will separate benign measures from other types of racial classifications.” Id., at 564, n. 12 (citation omitted).
**Lead Opinion**
 Proceeding on the assumption that the policies were nonetheless “benign,” it concluded that they served the “important governmental objective” of “enhancing broadcast diversity,” id., at 566-567 , and that they were *226 “substantially related” to that objective, id., at 569 .  It therefore upheld the policies.  By adopting intermediate scrutiny as the standard of review for congressionally mandated “benign” racial classifications, Metro Broadcasting departed from prior cases in two significant respects.  First, it turned its back on Cro-son’s explanation of why strict scrutiny of all governmental racial classifications is essential: “Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of determining what classifications are ‘benign’ or ‘remedial’ and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.  Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to ‘smoke out’ illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.  The test also ensures that the means chosen ‘fit’ this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype.” Croson, supra, at 493 (plurality opinion of O’Connor, J.).  We adhere to that view today, despite the surface appeal of holding “benign” racial classifications to a lower standard, because “it may not always be clear that a so-called preference is in fact benign,” <citedDecision>Bakke, supra, at 298</citedDecision> (opinion of Powell, J.).  “[M]ore than good motives should be required when government seeks to allocate its resources by way of an explicit racial classification system.” Days, Fullilove, 96 Yale L. J. 453, 485 (1987).  Second, Metro Broadcasting squarely rejected one of the three propositions established by the Court’s earlier equal protection cases, namely, congruence between the standards applicable to federal and state racial classifications, and in so doing also undermined the other two — skepticism of all racial *227 classifications and consistency of treatment irrespective of the race of the burdened or benefited group.  See supra, at 223-224.  Under Metro Broadcasting, certain racial classifications (“benign” ones enacted by the Federal Government) should be treated less skeptically than others; and the race of the benefited group is critical to the determination of which standard of review to apply.  Metro Broadcasting was thus a significant departure from much of what had come before it.  The three propositions undermined by Metro Broadcasting all derive from the basic principle that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution protect persons, not groups.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice Scalia, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join the opinion of the Court, except Part III-C, and except insofar as it may be inconsistent with the following: In my view, government can never have a “compelling interest” in discriminating on the basis of race in order to “make up” for past racial discrimination in the opposite direction. See Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 520 (1989) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Individuals who have been wronged by unlawful racial discrimination should be made whole; but under our Constitution there can be no such thing as either a creditor or a debtor race. That concept is alien to the Constitution’s focus upon the individual, see Arndt. 14, § 1 (“[N]or shall any State ... deny to any person” the equal protection of the laws) (emphasis added), and its rejection of dispositions based on race, see Arndt. 15, § 1 (prohibiting abridgment of the right to vote “on account of race”), or based on blood, see Art. Ill, §3 (“[N]o Attainder of Treason shall work Corruption of Blood”); Art. I, § 9, cl. 8 (“No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States”). To pursue the concept of racial entitlement — even for the most admirable and benign of purposes — is to reinforce and preserve for future mischief the way of thinking that produced race slavery, race privilege and race hatred. In the eyes of government, we are just one race here. It is American. It is unlikely, if not impossible, that the challenged program would survive under this understanding of strict scrutiny, but I am content to leave that to be decided on remand.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Ante, at 225-226.  But two decisive distinctions separate those two cases. First, Metro Broadcasting involved a federal program, whereas Croson involved a city ordinance.  Metro Broadcasting thus drew primary support from Fullilove , which predated Croson and which Croson distinguished on the grounds of the federal-state dichotomy that the majority today discredits.  Although Members of today’s majority trumpeted the importance of that distinction in Croson, they now reject it in the name of “congruence.” It is therefore *257 quite wrong for the Court to suggest today that overruling Metro Broadcasting merely restores the status quo ante, for the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the Court reached.  Today's decision is an unjustified departure from settled law. Second, Metro Broadcasting’s holding rested on more than its application of “intermediate scrutiny.” Indeed, I have always believed that, labels notwithstanding, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program we upheld in that case would have satisfied any of our various standards in affirmative-action cases — including the one the majority fashions today.  What truly distinguishes Metro Broadcasting from our other affirmative-action precedents is the distinctive goal of the federal program in that case. Instead of merely seeking to remedy past discrimination, the FCC program was intended to achieve future benefits in the form of broadcast diversity.  Reliance on race as a legitimate means of achieving diversity was first endorsed by Justice Powell in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, <citedDecision>438 U. S. 265, 311-319</citedDecision> (1978).  Later, in Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), I also argued that race is not always irrelevant to governmental decisionmaking, see id., at 314-315 (Stevens, J., dissenting); in response, Justice O’Connor correctly noted that, although the school board had relied on an interest in providing black teachers to serve as role models for black students, that interest “should not be confused with the very different goal of promoting racial diversity among the faculty.” Id., at 288 , n. She then added that, because the school board had not relied on an interest in diversity, it was not “necessary to discuss the magnitude of that interest or its applicability in this case.” Ibid. Thus, prior to Metro Broadcasting, the interest in diversity had been mentioned in a few opinions, but it is perfectly clear that the Court had not yet decided whether that interest had sufficient magnitude to justify a racial classification.  Metro Broadcasting, of course, answered that question in the *258 affirmative.  The majority today overrules Metro Broadcasting only insofar as it is “inconsistent with [the] holding” that strict scrutiny applies to “benign” racial classifications promulgated by the Federal Government.  Ante, at 227.  The proposition that fostering diversity may provide a sufficient interest to justify such a program is not inconsistent with the Court’s holding today — indeed, the question is not remotely presented in this case — and I do not take the Court’s opinion to diminish that aspect of our decision in Metro Broadcasting.  The Court’s suggestion that it may be necessary in the future to overrule Fullilove in order to restore the fabric of the law, ante, at 235, is even more disingenuous than its treatment of Metro Broadcasting.  For the Court endorses the “strict scrutiny” standard that Justice Powell applied in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> , see ante, at 224, and acknowledges that he applied that standard in Fullilove as well, ante, at 218-219.  Moreover, Chief Justice Burger also expressly concluded that the program we considered in Fullilove was valid under any of the tests articulated in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> , which of course included Justice Powell’s.  448 U. S., at 492 .  The Court thus adopts a standard applied in Fullilove at the same time it questions that case’s continued vitality and accuses it of departing from prior law. I continue to believe that the Fullilove case was incorrectly decided, see id., at 532-554 (Stevens, J., dissenting), but neither my dissent nor that filed by Justice Stewart, id., at 522-532 , contained any suggestion that the issue the Court was resolving had been decided before.  13 As was true *259 of Metro Broadcasting, the Court in Fullilove decided an important, novel, and difficult question.  Providing a different answer to a similar question today cannot fairly be characterized as merely “restoring” previously settled law. V The Court’s holding in Fullilove surely governs the result in this case. The Public Works Employment Act of 1977 (1977 Act), 91 Stat. 116 , which this Court upheld in Fullilove , is different in several critical respects from the portions of the Small Business Act (SBA), 72 Stat. 384 , as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 631 et seq., and STURAA, 101 Stat. 132 , challenged in this case. Each of those differences makes the current program designed to provide assistance to DBE’s significantly less objectionable than the 1977 categorical grant of $400 million in exchange for a 10% set-aside in public contracts to “a class of investors defined solely by racial characteristics.” Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 532 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  In no meaningful respect is the current scheme more objectionable than the 1977 Act.  Thus, if the 1977 Act was constitutional, then so must be the SBA and STURAA.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 13 CFR § 124.208 (1995).  As with other phases of the statutory policy of encouraging the formation and growth of small business enterprises, this program is intended to facilitate entry and increase competition in the free market.  Significantly, the current program, unlike the 1977 set-aside, does not establish any requirement — numerical or otherwise — that a general contractor must hire DBE subcontractors.  The program we upheld in Fullilove required that 10% of the federal grant for every federally funded project be expended on minority business enterprises.  In contrast, the current program contains no quota.  Although it provides monetary incentives to general contractors to hire DBE subcontractors, it does not require them to hire DBE’s, *263 and they do not lose their contracts if they fail to do so. The importance of this incentive to general contractors (who always seek to offer the lowest bid) should not be underestimated; but the preference here is far less rigid, and thus more narrowly tailored, than the 1977 Act.  Cf. Bakke, <citedDecision>438 U. S., at 319-320</citedDecision> (opinion of Powell, J.) (distinguishing between numerical set-asides and consideration of race as a factor).  Finally, the record shows a dramatic contrast between the sparse deliberations that preceded the 1977 Act, see Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 549-550 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and the extensive hearings conducted in several Congresses before the current program was developed.  18 However we might *264 evaluate the benefits and costs — both fiscal and social — of this or any other affirmative-action program, our obligation to give deference to Congress’ policy choices is much more demanding in this case than it was in Fullilove .  If the 1977 program of race-based set-asides satisfied the strict scrutiny dictated by Justice Powell’s vision of the Constitution — a vision the Court expressly endorses today — it must follow as night follows the day that the Court of Appeals’ judgment upholding this more carefully crafted program should be affirmed.  VI My skeptical scrutiny of the Court’s opinion leaves me in dissent.  The majority’s concept of “consistency” ignores a difference, fundamental to the idea of equal protection, between oppression and assistance.  The majority’s concept of “congruence” ignores a difference, fundamental to our constitutional system, between the Federal Government and the States.

 Frontiero, 411 U. S., at 682-684 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 691 (Stewart, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 692 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  Thus, in 1975, the Court stated explicitly that "[t]his Court's approach to Fifth Amendment equal protection claims has always been precisely the same as to equal protection claims under the Fourteenth Amendment." Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 638, n. 2 ; see also Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.

Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 100, 101-102, n. 21 (1976) (federal power over immigration), to detract from this general rule.  B Most of the cases discussed above involved classifications burdening groups that have suffered discrimination in our society.  In 1978, the Court confronted the question whether race-based governmental action designed to benefit such groups should also be subject to "the most rigid scrutiny." Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, <citedDecision>438 U. S. 265</citedDecision> , involved an equal protection challenge to a state-run medical school's practice of reserving a number of spaces in its entering class for minority students.

S., at 289-290</citedDecision> .  He concluded that "[r]acial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination." <citedDecision>Id., at 291</citedDecision> .  On the other hand, four Justices in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> would have applied a less stringent standard of review to racial classifications "designed to further remedial purposes," see <citedDecision>id., at 359</citedDecision> (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  And four Justices thought the case should be decided on statutory grounds.  <citedDecision>Id., at 411-412, 421</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart and Rehnquist, *219 JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Two years after <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> , the Court faced another challenge to remedial race-based action, this time involving action undertaken by the Federal Government.  In Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448 (1980), the Court upheld Congress' inclusion of a 10% set-aside for minority-owned businesses in the Public Works Employment Act of 1977.  As in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> , there was no opinion for the Court. Chief Justice Burger, in an opinion joined by Justices White and Powell, observed that "[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination to make sure that it does not conflict with constitutional guarantees." 448 U. S., at 491 .  That opinion, however, "d[id] not adopt, either expressly or implicitly, the formulas of analysis articulated in such cases as [Bakke] ." Id., at 492 .  It employed instead a two-part test which asked, first, "whether the objectives of th[e] legislation are within the power of Congress," and second, "whether the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria, in the context presented, is a constitutionally permissible means for achieving the congressional objectives." Id., at 473 .  It then upheld the program under that test, adding at the end of the opinion that the program also "would survive judicial review under either `test' articulated in the several <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> opinions." Id., at 492.  Justice Powell wrote separately to express his view that the plurality opinion had essentially applied "strict scrutiny" as described in his <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> opinion i.  e., it had determined that the set-aside was "a necessary means of advancing a compelling governmental interest"and had done so correctly.  448 U. S., at 496 (concurring opinion).  Justice Stewart (joined by thenJustice Rehnquist) dissented, arguing that the Constitution required the Federal Government to meet the same strict standard as the States when enacting racial classifications, id., at 523 , and n. 1, and that the program before the Court failed that standard.  Justice Stevens also dissented, *220 arguing that "[r]acial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification," id., at 537 , and that the program before the Court could not be characterized "as a `narrowly tailored' remedial measure." Id., at 541 .  Justice Marshall (joined by Justices Brennan and Blackmun) concurred in the judgment, reiterating the view of four Justices in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> that any race-based governmental action designed to "remed[y] the present effects of past racial discrimination" should be upheld if it was "substantially related" to the achievement of an "important governmental objective" i.  e., such action should be subjected only to what we now call "intermediate scrutiny." 448 U. S., at 518-519 .  In Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), the Court considered a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to another form of remedial racial classification.  The issue in Wygant was whether a school board could adopt race-based preferences in determining which teachers to lay off.  Justice Powell's plurality opinion observed that "the level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification operates against a group that historically has not been subject to governmental discrimination," id., at 273 , and stated the two-part inquiry as "whether the layoff provision is supported by a compelling state purpose and whether the means chosen to accomplish that purpose are narrowly tailored." Id., at 274 .
**Combined Opinion**
Id., at 295 .  Four Justices dissented, three of whom again argued for intermediate scrutiny of remedial race-based government action.  Id., at 301-302 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting).  The Court's failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove, and Wygant left unresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-based governmental action.  See United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S., at 166 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.) ("[A]lthough this Court has consistently held that some elevated level of scrutiny is required when a racial or ethnic distinction is made for remedial purposes, it has yet to reach consensus on the appropriate constitutional analysis"); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 480 (1986) (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.).  Lower courts found this lack of guidance unsettling.  See, e. g., Kromnick v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 739 F. 2d 894 , 901 (CA3 1984) ("The absence of an Opinion of the Court in either <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> or Fullilove and the concomitant failure of the Court to articulate an analytic framework supporting the judgments makes the position of the lower federal courts considering the constitutionality of affirmative action programs somewhat vulnerable"), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1107 (1985); Williams v. New Orleans, 729 F. 2d 1554, 1567 (CA5 1984) (en banc) (Higginbotham, J., concurring specially); South Florida Chapter of Associated General Contractors of America, Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., 723 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA11), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 871 (1984).  The Court resolved the issue, at least in part, in 1989.  Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), concerned a *222 city's determination that 30% of its contracting work should go to minority-owned businesses.  A majority of the Court in Croson held that "the standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification," and that the single standard of review for racial classifications should be "strict scrutiny." Id., at 493-494 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("I agree .  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 On the other hand, the Court subsequently indicated that Croson had at least some bearing on federal race-based action *223 when it vacated a decision upholding such action and remanded for further consideration in light of Croson.  H. K. Porter Co. v. Metropolitan Dade County, 489 U. S. 1062 (1989); see also Shurberg Broadcasting of Hartford, Inc. v. FCC, 876 F. 2d 902, 915, n. 16 (CADC 1989) (opinion of Silberman, J.) (noting the Court's action in H. K. Porter Co. ), rev'd sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990).  Thus, some uncertainty persisted with respect to the standard of review for federal racial classifications.  See, e. g., Mann v. Albany, 883 F. 2d 999, 1006 (CA11 1989) ( Croson "may be applicable to race-based classifications imposed by Congress"); Shurberg, 876 F. 2d, at 910 (noting the difficulty of extracting general principles from the Court's fractured opinions); id., at 959 (Wald, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (" Croson certainly did not resolve the substantial questions posed by congressional programs which mandate the use of racial preferences"); Winter Park Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 873 F. 2d 347 , 366 (CADC 1989) (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("The unresolved ambiguity of Fullilove and Croson leaves it impossible to reach a firm opinion as to the evidence of discrimination needed to sustain a congressional mandate of racial preferences"), aff'd sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, supra .  Despite lingering uncertainty in the details, however, the Court's cases through Croson had established three general propositions with respect to governmental racial classifications.  First, skepticism: "`Any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination,' " Wygant, 476 U. S., at 273 (plurality opinion of Powell, J.); Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 491 (opinion of Burger, C. J.); see also id., at 523 (Stewart, J., dissenting) ("[A]ny official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect"); McLaughlin, 379 U. S., at 192 ("[R]acial classifications [are] `constitutionally suspect' "); Hirabayashi, 320 U. S., at 100 ("Distinctions *224 between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people").  Second, consistency: "[T]he standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification," Croson, 488 U. S., at 494 (plurality opinion); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also Bakke, <citedDecision>438 U. S., at 289-290</citedDecision> (opinion of Powell, J.), i.  e., all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized.  And third, congruence: "Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment," Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 93 ; see also Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 638, n. 2 ; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S., at 500 .  Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.  Justice Powell's defense of this conclusion bears repeating here: "If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather than the individual only because of his membership in a particular group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently.  Political judgments regarding the necessity for the particular classification may be weighed in the constitutional balance, [Korematsu] , but the standard of justification will remain constant.  This is as it should be, since those political judgments are the product of rough compromise struck by contending groups within the democratic process.
**Combined Opinion**
 It therefore upheld the policies.  By adopting intermediate scrutiny as the standard of review for congressionally mandated "benign" racial classifications, Metro Broadcasting departed from prior cases in two significant respects.  First, it turned its back on Croson `s explanation of why strict scrutiny of all governmental racial classifications is essential: "Absent searching judicial inquiry into the justification for such race-based measures, there is simply no way of determining what classifications are `benign' or `remedial' and what classifications are in fact motivated by illegitimate notions of racial inferiority or simple racial politics.  Indeed, the purpose of strict scrutiny is to `smoke out' illegitimate uses of race by assuring that the legislative body is pursuing a goal important enough to warrant use of a highly suspect tool.  The test also ensures that the means chosen `fit' this compelling goal so closely that there is little or no possibility that the motive for the classification was illegitimate racial prejudice or stereotype." Croson, supra, at 493 (plurality opinion of O'Connor, J.).  We adhere to that view today, despite the surface appeal of holding "benign" racial classifications to a lower standard, because "it may not always be clear that a so-called preference is in fact benign," <citedDecision>Bakke, supra, at 298</citedDecision> (opinion of Powell, J.).  "[M]ore than good motives should be required when government seeks to allocate its resources by way of an explicit racial classification system." Days, Fullilove, 96 Yale L. J. 453, 485 (1987).  Second, Metro Broadcasting squarely rejected one of the three propositions established by the Court's earlier equal protection cases, namely, congruence between the standards applicable to federal and state racial classifications, and in so doing also undermined the other twoskepticism of all racial *227 classifications and consistency of treatment irrespective of the race of the burdened or benefited group.  See supra, at 223-224.  Under Metro Broadcasting, certain racial classifications ("benign" ones enacted by the Federal Government) should be treated less skeptically than others; and the race of the benefited group is critical to the determination of which standard of review to apply.  Metro Broadcasting was thus a significant departure from much of what had come before it.
**Combined Opinion**
 Metro Broadcasting thus drew primary support from Fullilove , which predated Croson and which Croson distinguished on the grounds of the federal-state dichotomy that the majority today discredits.  Although Members of today's majority trumpeted the importance of that distinction in Croson, they now reject it in the name of "congruence." It is therefore *257 quite wrong for the Court to suggest today that overruling Metro Broadcasting merely restores the status quo ante, for the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the Court reached.  Today's decision is an unjustified departure from settled law. Second, Metro Broadcasting `s holding rested on more than its application of "intermediate scrutiny." Indeed, I have always believed that, labels notwithstanding, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program we upheld in that case would have satisfied any of our various standards in affirmative-action casesincluding the one the majority fashions today.  What truly distinguishes Metro Broadcasting from our other affirmative-action precedents is the distinctive goal of the federal program in that case. Instead of merely seeking to remedy past discrimination, the FCC program was intended to achieve future benefits in the form of broadcast diversity.  Reliance on race as a legitimate means of achieving diversity was first endorsed by Justice Powell in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, <citedDecision>438 U. S. 265, 311-319</citedDecision> (1978).  Later, in Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), I also argued that race is not always irrelevant to governmental decisionmaking, see id., at 314-315 (Stevens, J., dissenting); in response, Justice O'Connor correctly noted that, although the school board had relied on an interest in providing black teachers to serve as role models for black students, that interest "should not be confused with the very different goal of promoting racial diversity among the faculty." Id., at 288 , n. She then added that, because the school board had not relied on an interest in diversity, it was not "necessary to discuss the magnitude of that interest or its applicability in this case." Ibid. Thus, prior to Metro Broadcasting, the interest in diversity had been mentioned in a few opinions, but it is perfectly clear that the Court had not yet decided whether that interest had sufficient magnitude to justify a racial classification.  Metro Broadcasting, of course, answered that question in the *258 affirmative.  The majority today overrules Metro Broadcasting only insofar as it is "inconsistent with [the] holding" that strict scrutiny applies to "benign" racial classifications promulgated by the Federal Government.  Ante, at 227.  The proposition that fostering diversity may provide a sufficient interest to justify such a program is not inconsistent with the Court's holding todayindeed, the question is not remotely presented in this caseand I do not take the Court's opinion to diminish that aspect of our decision in Metro Broadcasting.  The Court's suggestion that it may be necessary in the future to overrule Fullilove in order to restore the fabric of the law, ante, at 235, is even more disingenuous than its treatment of Metro Broadcasting.  For the Court endorses the "strict scrutiny" standard that Justice Powell applied in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> , see ante, at 224, and acknowledges that he applied that standard in Fullilove as well, ante, at 218-219.  Moreover, Chief Justice Burger also expressly concluded that the program we considered in Fullilove was valid under any of the tests articulated in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> , which of course included Justice Powell's.  448 U. S., at 492 .  The Court thus adopts a standard applied in Fullilove at the same time it questions that case's continued vitality and accuses it of departing from prior law. I continue to believe that the Fullilove case was incorrectly decided, see id., at 532-554 (Stevens, J., dissenting), but neither my dissent nor that filed by Justice Stewart, id., at 522-532 , contained any suggestion that the issue the Court was resolving had been decided before.  [13] As was true *259 of Metro Broadcasting, the Court in Fullilove decided an important, novel, and difficult question.  Providing a different answer to a similar question today cannot fairly be characterized as merely "restoring" previously settled law. V The Court's holding in Fullilove surely governs the result in this case. The Public Works Employment Act of 1977 (1977 Act), 91 Stat. 116 , which this Court upheld in Fullilove , is different in several critical respects from the portions of the Small Business Act (SBA), 72 Stat. 384 , as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 631 et seq., and STURAA, 101 Stat. 132 , challenged in this case. Each of those differences makes the current program designed to provide assistance to DBE's significantly less objectionable than the 1977 categorical grant of $400 million in exchange for a 10% set-aside in public contracts to "a class of investors defined solely by racial characteristics." Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 532 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  In no meaningful respect is the current scheme more objectionable than the 1977 Act.

 13 CFR § 124.208 (1995).  As with other phases of the statutory policy of encouraging the formation and growth of small business enterprises, this program is intended to facilitate entry and increase competition in the free market.  Significantly, the current program, unlike the 1977 setaside, does not establish any requirementnumerical or otherwisethat a general contractor must hire DBE subcontractors.  The program we upheld in Fullilove required that 10% of the federal grant for every federally funded project be expended on minority business enterprises.  In contrast, the current program contains no quota.  Although it provides monetary incentives to general contractors to hire DBE subcontractors, it does not require them to hire DBE's, *263 and they do not lose their contracts if they fail to do so. The importance of this incentive to general contractors (who always seek to offer the lowest bid) should not be underestimated; but the preference here is far less rigid, and thus more narrowly tailored, than the 1977 Act.  Cf. Bakke, <citedDecision>438 U. S., at 319-320</citedDecision> (opinion of Powell, J.)(distinguishing between numerical set-asides and consideration of race as a factor).  Finally, the record shows a dramatic contrast between the sparse deliberations that preceded the 1977 Act, see Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 549-550 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and the extensive hearings conducted in several Congresses before the current program was developed.  [18] However we might *264 evaluate the benefits and costsboth fiscal and socialof this or any other affirmative-action program, our obligation to give deference to Congress' policy choices is much more demanding in this case than it was in Fullilove .  If the 1977 program of race-based set-asides satisfied the strict scrutiny dictated by Justice Powell's vision of the Constitutiona vision the Court expressly endorses todayit must follow as night follows the day that the Court of Appeals' judgment upholding this more carefully crafted program should be affirmed.  VI My skeptical scrutiny of the Court's opinion leaves me in dissent.  The majority's concept of "consistency" ignores a difference, fundamental to the idea of equal protection, between oppression and assistance.  The majority's concept of "congruence" ignores a difference, fundamental to our constitutional system, between the Federal Government and the States.

[*]   It should be obvious that every racial classification helps, in a narrow sense, some races and hurts others.  As to the races benefited, the classification could surely be called "benign.
