 Review of this case calls directly into question whether the coordinated acts of a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary can, in the legal sense contemplated by § 1 of the Sherman Act, constitute a combination or conspiracy.  3 The so-called “intra-enterprise conspiracy” doctrine provides that § 1 liability is not foreclosed merely because a parent and its subsidiary are subject to common ownership.  The doctrine derives from declarations in several of this Court’s opinions.  *760 In no case has the Court considered the merits of the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine in depth.  Indeed, the concept arose from a far narrower rule.  Although the Court has expressed approval of the doctrine on a number of occasions, a finding of intra-enterprise conspiracy was in all but perhaps one instance unnecessary to the result.  The problem began with United States v. Yellow Cab Co., <citedDecision>332 U. S. 218</citedDecision> (1947).  The controlling shareholder of the Checker Cab Manufacturing Corp., Morris Markin, also controlled numerous companies operating taxicabs in four cities.  With few exceptions, the operating companies had once been independent and had come under Markin’s control by acquisition or merger.  The complaint alleged conspiracies under §§ 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act among Markin, Checker, and five corporations in the operating system.  The Court stated that even restraints in a vertically integrated enterprise were not “necessarily” outside of the Sherman Act, observing that an unreasonable restraint “may result as readily from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are otherwise independent.  Similarly, any affiliation or integration flowing from an illegal conspiracy cannot insulate the conspirators from the sanctions which Congress has imposed.  The corporate interrelationships of the conspirators, in other words, are not determinative of the applicability of the Sherman Act.

 Section 1 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: “Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal.  Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony.” 26 Stat. 209 , as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 1 .  Under the arrangements condemned in Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197, 354 (1904) (plurality opinion), “all the stock [a railroad holding company] held or acquired in the constituent companies was acquired and held to be used in suppressing competition between those companies.  It came into existence only for that purpose.” In Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1 (1911), and United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106 (1911), the trust or holding company device brought together previously independent firms to lessen competition and achieve monopoly power.  Although the Court in the latter case suggested that the contracts between affiliated companies, and not merely the original combination, could be viewed as the conspiracy, id., at 184 , the Court left no doubt that “the combination in and of itself” was a restraint of trade and a monopolization, id., at 187 .  Contrary to the dissent’s suggestion, post, at 779, 788, n. 18, our point is not that Yellow Cab found only the initial acquisition illegal; our point is that the illegality of the initial acquisition was a predicate for its holding that any postacquisition conduct violated the Act.  When discussing the fact that some of the affiliated Chicago operating companies did not compete to obtain exclusive transportation contracts held by another of the affiliated companies, the Court stated: “[T]he fact that the competition restrained is that between affiliated corporations cannot serve to negative the statutory violation where, as here, the affiliation is assertedly one of the means of effectuating the illegal conspiracy not to compete.” <citedDecision>332 U. S., at 229</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  The passage quoted in text is soon followed by a cite to United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U. S. 173, 189 (1944).  Crescent Amusement found violations of §§ 1 and 2 by film exhibitors affiliated (in most cases) by 50 percent ownership.  The exhibitors used the monopoly power they possessed in certain towns to force film distributors to give them favorable terms in other towns.  The Court found it unnecessary to view the distributors as part of the conspiracy, id., at 183, so the Court plainly viewed the affiliated entities themselves as the conspirators.  The Crescent Amusement Court, however, in affirming an order of divestiture, noted that such a remedy was appropriate when “creation of the combination is itself the violation.” Id., at 189.  This suggests that both Crescent Amusement and Yellow Cab, which cited the very page on which this passage appears, stand for a narrow rule based on the original illegality of the affiliation.

 The jury apparently concluded that the two defendant corporations— *779 Copperweld and its subsidiary Regal — had successfully delayed Independence’s entry into the steel tubing business by applying a form of economic coercion to potential suppliers of financing and capital equipment, as well as to potential customers.  Everyone seems to agree that this conduct was tortious as a matter of state law. This type of exclusionary conduct is plainly distinguishable from vertical integration designed to achieve competitive efficiencies.  If, as seems to be the case, the challenged conduct was manifestly anti-competitive, it should not be immunized from scrutiny under § 1 of the Sherman Act.  h — I Repudiation of prior cases is not a step that should be taken lightly.  As the Court wrote only days ago: “[A]ny departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification.” Arizona v. Rumsey, ante, at 212.  It is therefore appropriate to begin with an examination of the precedents.  In United States v. Yellow Cab Co., <citedDecision>332 U. S. 218</citedDecision> (1947), the Court explicitly stated that a corporate subsidiary could conspire with its parent: “The fact that these restraints occur in a setting described by the appellees as a vertically integrated enterprise does not necessarily remove the ban of the Sherman Act.  The test of illegality under the Act is the presence or absence of an unreasonable restraint on interstate commerce.  Such a restraint may result as readily from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are otherwise independent.” <citedDecision>Id., at 227</citedDecision> .  The majority attempts to explain Yellow Cab by suggesting that it dealt only with unlawful acquisition of subsidiaries.  Ante, at 761-762.  But the Court mentioned acquisitions only as an additional consideration separate from the passage *780 quoted above, 1 and more important, the Court explicitly held that restraints imposed by the corporate parent on the affiliates that it already owned in themselves violated § l. 2 At least three cases involving the motion picture industry also recognize that affiliated corporations may combine or conspire within the meaning of §1.  In United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U. S. 173 (1944), as the Court recognizes, ante, at 762, n. 6, the only conspirators were affiliated corporations.  The majority’s claim that the case involved only unlawful acquisitions because of the Court’s comments concerning divestiture of the affiliates cannot be squared with the passage immediately following that cited by the majority, which states that there had been unlawful conduct going beyond the acquisition of subsidiaries: “That principle is adequate here to justify divestiture of all interest in some of the affiliates since their acquisition was part of the fruits of the conspiracy.  But the relief need not, and under these facts should not, be so restricted [to divestiture].

 Similarly, in Schine Chain Theatres, Inc. v. United States, 334 U. S. 110 (1948), the Court held that concerted action by parents and subsidiaries constituted an unlawful conspiracy.  3 That was also the holding in United States v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100, 109 (1948).  The majority’s observation that in these cases there were alternative grounds that could have been used to reach the same result, ante, at 763, n. 8, disguises neither the fact that the holding that actually appears in these opinions rests on conspiracy between affiliated entities, nor that today’s holding is inconsistent with what was actually held in these cases. In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211 (1951), the Court’s holding was plain and unequivocal: *782 This holding is so clear that even the Court, which is not wanting for inventiveness in its reading of the prior cases, cannot explain it away.  The Court suggests only that today Kiefer-Stewart might be decided on alternative grounds, ante, at 764, ignoring the fact that today’s holding is inconsistent with the ground on which the case actually was decided.  4 *781 “Respondents next suggest that their status as ‘mere in-strumentalities of a single manufacturing-merchandizing unit’ makes it impossible for them to have conspired in a manner forbidden by the Sherman Act.  But this suggestion runs counter to our past decisions that common ownership and control does not liberate corporations from the impact of the antitrust laws.  E. g. United States v. Yellow Cab Co., <citedDecision>332 U. S. 218</citedDecision> .  The rule is especially applicable where, as here, respondents hold themselves out as competitors.” Id., at 215.  *782 A construction of the statute that reaches agreements between corporate parents and subsidiaries was again embraced by the Court in Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 598 (1951), 5 and Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U. S. 134 (1968).  6 The majority only notes that there might have been .  other grounds for decision available in these cases, ante, at 764-766, but again it cannot deny that its new rule is inconsistent with what the Court actually did write in these cases. *783 Thus, the rule announced today is inconsistent with what this Court has held on at least seven previous occasions.  7 Perhaps most illuminating is the fact that until today, whether they favored the doctrine or not, it had been the universal conclusion of both the lower courts 8 and the commentators 9 that this Court’s cases establish that a parent *784 and a wholly owned subsidiary corporation are capable of conspiring in violation of § 1.  In this very case the Court of Appeals observed: “[T]he salient factor is that the Supreme Court’s decisions, while they need not be read with complete literalism, of course they cannot be ignored.

 23 Finally, it must be remembered that not all persons who restrain trade wear grey flannel suits.  Businesses controlled by organized crime often attempt to gain control of an industry through violence or intimidation of competitors; in such cases § 1 can be applied to separately incorporated businesses which benefit from such tactics, but which may be ultimately controlled by a single criminal enterprise.  24 *792 The rule of Yellow Cab and its progeny is not one that condemns every parent-subsidiary relationship.  A single firm, no matter what its corporate structure may be, is not expected to compete with itself.  25 Functional integration by its very nature requires unified action; hence in itself it has never been sufficient to establish the existence of an unreasonable restraint of trade: “In discussing the charge in the Yellow Cab case, we said that the fact that the conspirators were integrated did not insulate them from the act, not that corporate integration violated the act.” United States v. Columbia Steel Co., 334 U. S. 495, 522 (1948).  Restraints that act only on the parent or its subsidiary as a consequence of an otherwise lawful integration do not violate § 1 of the Sherman Act.  26 But if the behavior at issue is unrelated to any functional integration between the affiliated corporations and *793 imposes a restraint on third parties of sufficient magnitude to restrain marketwide competition, as a matter of economic substance, as well as form, it is appropriate to characterize the conduct as a “combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade.” 27 For example, in Yellow Cab the Court read the complaint as alleging that integration had assisted the parent in excluding competing manufacturers from the marketplace, <citedDecision>332 U. S., at 226-227</citedDecision> , leading the Court to conclude that “restraint of interstate trade was not only effected by the combination of the appellees but was the primary object of the combination.” <citedDecision>Id., at 227</citedDecision> .  Similarly, in Crescent Amusement the Court noted that corporate affiliation between exhibitors enhanced their buying power and “was one of the instruments in .  .  .  making the conspiracy effective” in excluding independents from the market.  323 U. S., at 189-190 .  Thus, in both cases the Court found that the affiliation enhanced the ability of the parent corporation to exclude the competition of third parties, and hence raised entry *794 barriers faced by actual and potential competitors.

 Use of economic theory without reference to the competitive impact of the particular economic arrangement at issue is properly criticized when it produces overly broad per se rules of antitrust liability; 30 criticism is no less warranted when a per se rule of antitrust immunity is adopted in the same way.  In sum, the question that the Court should ask is not why a wholly owned subsidiary should be treated differently from a corporate division, since the immunity accorded that type of arrangement is a necessary consequence of Colgate.  Rather the question should be why two corporations that engage in a predatory course of conduct which produces a marketwide restraint on competition and which, as separate legal entities, can be easily fit within the language of § 1, should be immunized from liability because they are controlled by the same godfather.  That is a question the Court simply fails to confront.  I respectfully dissent.  The language I have quoted, most of which is overlooked by the majority, makes it clear that the Court’s adoption of the concept of conspiracy between affiliated corporations was unqualified.  As the first word of the sentence indicates, the Court’s following statement: “Similarly, any affiliation or integration flowing from an illegal conspiracy cannot insulate the conspirators from the sanctions which Congress has imposed,” <citedDecision>332 U. S., at 227</citedDecision> , expresses a separate if related point.  “[B]y preventing the cab operating companies under their control from purchasing cabs from manufacturers other than CCM, the appellees deny those companies the opportunity to purchase cabs in a free, competitive market.  The Sherman Act has never been thought to sanction such a conspiracy to restrain the free purchase of goods in interstate commerce.” <citedDecision>Id., at 226-227</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  “[T]he combining of the open and closed towns for the negotiation of films for the circuit was a restraint of trade and the use of monopoly power in violation of § 1 and § 2 of the Act.  The concerted action of the parent company, its subsidiaries, and the named officers and directors in that endeavor was a conspiracy which was not immunized by reason of the fact that the members were closely affiliated rather than independent.  See United States v. Yellow Cab Co., <citedDecision>332 U. S. 218, 227</citedDecision> ; United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., 323 U. S. 173 .  334 U. S., at 116.  In Kiefer-Stewart, Seagram unsuccessfully argued that Yellow Cab was confined to cases concerning unlawful acquisitions, see Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1950, No. 297, p. 21.  Thus the Kiefer-Stewart Court considered and rejected exactly the same argument embraced by today’s majority.  “The fact that there is common ownership or control of the contracting corporations does not liberate them from the impact of the antitrust laws.  E. g., Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, [340 U. S.,] at 215.  Nor do we find any support in reason or authority for the proposition that agreements between legally separate persons and companies to suppress competition among themselves and others can be justified by labeling the project a ‘joint venture.’ Perhaps every agreement and combination to restrain trade could be so labeled.” 341 U. S., at 598.  “There remains for consideration only the Court of Appeals’ alternative holding that the Sherman Act claim should be dismissed because respondents were all part of a single business entity and were therefore entitled to cooperate without creating an illegal conspiracy.  But since respondents Midas and International availed themselves of the privilege of doing business through separate corporations, the fact of common ownership could not save them from any of the obligations that the law imposes on separate entities.  See Timken Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 593, 598 (1951); United States v. Yellow Cab Co., <citedDecision>332 U. S. 218, 227</citedDecision> (1947).” 392 U. S., at 141-142 .  Also pertinent is United, States v. Citizens & Southern National Bank, 422 U. S. 86 (1975), in which the Court wrote: “The central message of the Sherman Act is that a business entity must find new customers and higher profits through internal expansion — that is, by competing successfully rather than by arranging treaties with its competitors.  This Court has held that even commonly owned firms must compete against each other, if they hold themselves out as distinct entities.  ‘The corporate interrelationships of the conspirators .  .  .  are not determinative of the applicability of the Sherman Act.’ United States v. Yellow Cab Co., <citedDecision>332 U. S. 218, 227</citedDecision> .  See also Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211, 215 ; Timken Roller Bearing Co. v.
