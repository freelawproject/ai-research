1577 , 157 A.L.R. 1366 , the finding of the requisite jurisdictional facts was made in proceedings in which the defendant appeared and participated. The question with which we are confronted, therefore, is whether such a finding made under the circumstances presented by this case may, consistent with the requirements of full faith and credit, be subjected to collateral attack in the courts of a sister State in a suit brought by the defendant in the original proceedings. 12 The question of what effect is to be given to an adjudication by a court that it possesses requisite jurisdiction in a case, where the judgment of that court is subsequently subjected to collateral attack on jurisdictional grounds, has been given frequent consideration by this Court over a period of many years. Insofar as cases originating in the federal courts are concerned, the rule has evolved that the doctrine of res judicata applies to adjudications relating either to jurisdiction of the person or of the subject matter where such adjudications have been made in proceedings in which those questions were in issue and in which the parties were given full opportunity to litigate. 14 The reasons for this doctrine have frequently been stated. Thus in Stoll v. Gottlieb, 1938, 305 U.S. 165 , 172, 59 S.Ct. 134 , 138, it was said: 'Courts to determine the rights of parties are an integral part of our system of government. It is just as important that there should be a place to end as that there should be a place to begin litigation. After a party has his day in court, with opportunity to present his evidence and his view of the law, a collateral attack upon the decision as to jurisdiction there rendered merely retries the issue previously determined. There is no reason to expect that the second decision will be more satisfactory than the first.' 13 This Court has also held that the doctrine of res judicata must be applied to questions of jurisdiction in cases arising in state courts involving the application of the full faith and credit clause where, under the law of the state in which the original judgment was rendered, such adjudications are not susceptible to collateral attack. 15 14 In Davis v. Davis, 1938, 305 U.S. 32 , 59 S.Ct. 3 , 83 L.Ed.

Res judicata forecloses relitigation if there has been an opportunity to litigate once, whether or not it has been availed of, or carried as far as possible. Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U.S. 351 , 24 L.Ed. 195 ; Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U.S. 371 , 60 S.Ct. 317 , 84 L.Ed. 329 . 15 And it applies to questions of jurisdiction of subject matter as well as to that of persons. Stol v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165 , 59 S.Ct. 134 , 83 L.Ed. 104 ; Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U.S. 66 , 60 S.Ct. 44 , 84 L.Ed. 85 . Why should it not apply where there has been a wasted opportunity to litigate, but should apply where the form of a contest has been gone through? 16 Or if more than form is required, how much of a contest must it be? Must the contest be bellicose or may it be pacific?

See note 1 supra. 19 Justices Brewer, Shiras, and Peckham dissented. Mr. Justice Holmes took no part in the case. 20 Thus, in the Andrews case, before the divorce decree was entered by the South Dakota court, the defendant withdrew her appearance in accordance with a consent agreement.

That case did not depend for its result on the fact that there had been an adjudication of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the divorce enforced, inasmuch as this Court found that the State granting the divorce was in fact that of the domicile. 305 U.S. at page 41, 59 S.Ct.
