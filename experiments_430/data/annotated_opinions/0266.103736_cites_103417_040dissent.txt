**Dissenting Opinion**
 When thirty-seven years ago Mr. Justice Holmes perpetrated this quip, it had point, for the Court was then holding divorces invalid which many, due to the confused state of the law, had thought to be good.  It is difficult to find that it has point now that the shoe is on the other foot.  In any event, I had supposed that our judicial responsibility is for the regularity of the law, not for the regularity of pedigrees.  It was twenty years before Professor Beale could justify the decision to his satisfaction.  Compare Haddock Revisited, 39 Harvard Law Review 417, with Beale, Constitutional Protection of Decrees for Divorce, 19 Harvard Law Review 586.  Others seem to lack his capacity for quick adjustment.

A spouse who appears and contests the jurisdiction of the court of another state to grant a divorce may not collaterally attack its findings of domicile- and jurisdiction made after such appearance.  Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32 .  So also, a deserter from the matrimonial domicile may be bound by a divorce granted by a court of the state where the matrimonial domicile is situated.  Whether fault on the part of the deserter is an essential seems on the basis of our cases on -jurisdiction *320 for divorce to be an open question; Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S. 155 ; Haddock v. Haddock, supra, at 570, 572, 583 ; and Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551 ; but our decisions on analogous problems might be found to afford adequate support for a decision that it is not.  Cf.
