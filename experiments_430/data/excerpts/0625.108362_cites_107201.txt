 And surely there has never been any doubt of the power of Congress to impose liability on private persons under § 2 of that amendment, “for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws .establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.” Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 20 .  See also id., at 23 ; Clyatt V. United States, 197 U. S. 207, 216, 218 ; Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S., at 437-440 .  Not only may Congress impose such liability, but the varieties of private conduct that it may make criminally punishable or civilly remediable extend far beyond the actual imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude.  By the Thirteenth Amendment, we committed ourselves as a Nation to the proposition that the former slaves and their descendants should be forever free. To keep that promise, “Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.” Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra, at 440.  We can only conclude that Congress was wholly within its powers under § 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment in creating a statutory cause of action for Negro citizens who have been the victims of conspiratorial, racially discriminatory private action aimed at depriving them of the basic rights that the law secures to all free men.  B Our cases have firmly established that the right of interstate travel is constitutionally protected, does not necessarily rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, and is assertable against private as well as governmental interference.  Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 629-631 ; id., at 642-644 (concurring opinion); United States *106 v. Guest, <citedDecision>383 U. S. 745</citedDecision> , 757-760 and n. 17; Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 97 ; Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 79-80 ; Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 44, 48-49 ; Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 492 (Taney, .  C. J., dissenting).  The “right to pass freely from State to State” has been explicitly recognized as “among the rights and privileges of National citizenship.” Twining v. New Jersey, supra, at 97 .  That right, like other rights of national citizenship, is within the power of Congress to protect by appropriate legislation.  E. g., United States v. <citedDecision>Guest, supra,</citedDecision> at 759 ; United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 314-315 ; Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651 ; Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112, 285-287 (concurring and dissenting opinion).  The complaint in this case alleged that the petitioners “were travelling upon the federal, state and local highways in and about” DeKalb, Kemper County, Mississippi.  Kemper County is on the Mississippi-Alabama border.  One of the results of the conspiracy, according to the complaint, was to prevent the petitioners and other Negroes from exercising their “rights to travel the public highways without restraint in the same terms as white citizens in Kemper County, Mississippi.” Finally, the conspiracy was alleged to have been inspired by the respondents5 erroneous belief that Grady, a Tennessean, was a worker for Negro civil rights.  Under these allegations it is open to the petitioners to prove at trial that they had been engaging in interstate travel or intended to do so, that their federal right to travel interstate was one of the rights meant to be discriminatorily impaired by the conspiracy, that the conspirators intended to drive out-of-state civil rights workers from the State, or that they meant to deter the petitioners from associating with such persons.  This and other evidence could make it clear that the petitioners had suffered from conduct that Congress may reach under its power to protect the right of interstate travel.  *107 c In identifying these two constitutional sources of congressional power, we do not imply the absence of any other.

**Concurrence Opinion**
Mb. Justice Harlan, concurring. T agree with the Court’s opinion, except that I find it unnecessary to rely on the “right of interstate travel” as a premise for justifying federal jurisdiction under •§ 1985 (3). With that reservation, I join the opinion and judgment of the Court.
