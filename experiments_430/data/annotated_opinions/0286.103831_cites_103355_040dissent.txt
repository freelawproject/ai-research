 The Witness sells books to raise money for propagandizing his faith, just as other religious groups might sponsor bazaars, or peddle tickets to church suppers, or sell Bibles or prayer books for the same object.  However high the purpose or noble the aims of the Witness, the transaction has been found by the state courts to be a sale under their ordinances and, though our doubt was greater than it is, the state's conclusion would influence us to follow its determination.  1 *120 In the opinion in Jones v. Opelika, 316 U. S. 584 , on the former hearing, attention was called to the differentiation between these cases of taxation and those of forbidden censorship, prohibition or discrimination.  There is no occasion to repeat what has been written so recently as to the constitutional right to tax the money-raising activities of religious or didactic groups.  There are, however, other reasons, not fully developed in that opinion, that add to our conviction that the Constitution does not prohibit these general occupational taxes.  The real contention of the Witnesses is that there can be no taxation of the occupation of selling books and pamphlets because to do so would be contrary to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which now is held to have drawn the contents of the First Amendment into the category of individual rights protected *121 from state deprivation.  Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, 666 ; Near v. Minnesota, 283 U. S. 697, 707 ; Cantwell v. Connecticut, <citedDecision>310 U. S. 296, 303</citedDecision> .  Since the publications teach a religion which conforms to our standards of legality, it is urged that these ordinances prohibit the free exercise of religion and abridge the freedom of speech and of the press.  The First Amendment reads as follows: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” It was one of twelve proposed on September 25, 1789, to the States by the First Congress after the adoption of the Constitution.  Ten were ratified.  They were intended to be and have become our Bill of Rights.  By their terms, our people have a guarantee that so long as law as we know it shall prevail, they shall live protected from the tyranny of the despot or the mob.  None of the provisions of our Constitution is more venerated by the people or respected by legislatures and the courts than those which proclaim for our country the freedom of religion and expression.

 Some of the witnesses spoke of ‘contributions’ but the evidence justified a finding that they sold the books and pamphlets.” The state court then repeated with approval from one of its former decisions the statements: “The constitutional right of freedom of worship does not guarantee anybody the right to sell anything from house to house or in buildings, belonging to, or in the occupancy of, other persons.” “.  .  .  we do not accede to his contention on the oral argument that the federal decisions relied upon by him- go so far as to rule that the constitutional guaranty of a free press forbids dealers in books and printed matter being subjected to our State mercantile license tax or the federal income tax as to such sales, along with dealers in other merchandise.” Pittsburgh v. Ruffner, 134 Pa. Super. Ct. 192, 199, 202 , 4 A. 2d 224 .  And after further discussion of selling, the conviction of the Witnesses was affirmed.  It can hardly be said, we think, that the state court did not treat the Jeannette canvassers as engaged in a commercial activity or occupation at the time of their arrests.  Whitney v.
