 The case is covered in this respect by Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 [(1896)].” Ibid. While appellee relies upon Hudson County, appellants rest on our summary affirmance of a three-judge District Court judgment in City of Altus v. Carr, 255 F. Supp. 828 (WD Tex.), summarily aff’d, 385 U. S. 35 (1966).  The city of Altus is located near the southern border of Oklahoma.  Large population increases rendered inadequate its source of municipal water.  It consequently obtained from the owners of land in an adjoining Texas county the contractual right to pump the ground water underlying that land and to transport it across the border.  The Texas Legislature thereafter enacted a statute that forbade the interstate exportation of ground water without the approval of that body.  7 The city filed suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the statute violated the Commerce Clause.  The city relied upon West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., <citedDecision>221 U. S. 229</citedDecision> (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State, 8 and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923), which invalidated a West Virginia statute *948 that accorded a preference to the citizens of that State in the purchase of natural gas produced therein.  9 The Texas Attorney General defended the statute on two grounds.  First, he asserted that its purpose was to conserve and protect the State’s water resources by regulating the withdrawal of ground water.  The District Court rejected that defense because similar conservation claims had met defeat in <citedDecision>West</citedDecision> v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., supra, and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, supra. 10 Second, the State argued that the statute regulated ground water and that ground water is not an article of commerce, citing Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 (1896), and Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, 209 U. S. 349 (1908).  The court rejected this argument since the statute directly regulated the interstate transportation of *949 water that had been pumped from the ground, and under Texas law such water was an article of commerce.  The court then had little difficulty in concluding that the statute imposed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.  11 In summarily affirming the District Court in City of Altus, we did not necessarily adopt the court’s reasoning.  Our affirmance indicates only our agreement with the result reached by the District Court. Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 499 (1981).  That result is not necessarily inconsistent with the Nebraska Supreme Court’s holding in this case. For Texas law differs significantly from Nebraska law regarding the rights of a surface owner to ground water that he has withdrawn.  According to the District Court in City ofAltus, the “rule in Texas was that an owner of land could use all of the percolating water he could capture from the wells on his land for whatever beneficial purposes he needed it, on or off the land, and could likewise sell it to others for use on or off the land and outside the basin where produced, just as he could sell any other species of property.” 255 F. Supp., at 833, n. 8 .

 It went on to infer that his only right in the body of the stream is to have the flow continue, and that there is a residuum of public ownership in the State.  It reinforced the State’s rights by the State’s title to the bed of the stream where flowed-by the tide, and concluded from the foregoing and other considerations that, as against the rights of riparian owners merely as such, the State was warranted in prohibiting the acquisition of the title to water on a larger scale.” Id., at 354 .  “The problems of irrigation have no place here.  Leaving them on one side, it appears to us that few public interests are more obvious, indisputable and independent of particular theory than the interest of the public of a State to maintain the rivers that are wholly within it substantially undiminished, except by such drafts upon them as the guardian of the public welfare may permit for the purpose of turning them to a more perfect use.” Id., at 356 .  The District Court quoted the statute: ‘“No one shall withdraw water from any underground source in this State for use in any other state by drilling a well in Texas and transporting the water outside the boundaries of the State unless the same be specifically authorized by an Act of the Texas Legislature and thereafter as approved by it.’” 255 F. Supp., at 830 .  Justiee Holmes, the author of the Court’s opinion in Hudson County, noted his dissent.  See <citedDecision>221 U. S., at 262</citedDecision> .  Justice Holmes dissented, expressing the view that the Court’s decision was inconsistent with Hudson County.  See 262 U. S., at 603 .  The District Court opinion, 255 F. Supp., at 839 , included these quotations from the two cases: “The statute of Oklahoma recognizes [natural gas] to be a subject of intrastate commerce, but seeks to prohibit it from being the subject of interstate commerce, and this is the purpose of its conservation.  In other words, the purpose of its conservation is in a sense commercial — the business welfare of the State, as coal might be, or timber.  Both of these products might be limited in amount, and the same consideration of the public welfare which would confine gas to the use of the inhabitants of a State would confine them to the inhabitants of the State.  If the States have such power a singular situation might result.  Pennsylvania might keep its coal, the Northwest its timber, the mining States their minerals.  And why may not the products of the field be brought within the principle?” <citedDecision>West</citedDecision> v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., <citedDecision>221 U. S., at 255</citedDecision> .  “Another consideration advanced to the same end is that natural gas is a natural product of the State and has become a necessity therein, that the supply is waning and no longer sufficient to satisfy local needs and be used abroad, and that the act is therefore a legitimate measure of conservation in the interest of the people of the State.  If the situation be as stated, it affords no ground for the assumption by the State of the power to regulate interstate commerce, which is what the act attempts to do.  That power is lodged elsewhere.” Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S., at 598 .  “Considering the statute in question only with regard to whether it regulates the transportation and use of water after it has been withdrawn from a well and becomes personal property, such statute constitutes an unreasonable burden upon and interference with interstate commerce.  Moreover, on the facts of this case it appear[s] to us that [the Texas statute] does not have for its purpose, nor does it operate to conserve water resources of the State of Texas except in the sense that it does so for her own benefit to the detriment of her sister States as in the case of West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. In the name of conservation, the statute seeks to prohibit interstate shipments of water while indulging in the substantial discrimination of permitting the unrestricted intrastate production and transportation of water between points within the State, no matter how distant; for example, from Wilbarger County to El Paso County, Texas.  Obviously, the statute had little relation to the cause of conservation.” 255 F. Supp., at 839-840 .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 In my view, these cases appropriately recognize the traditional authority of a State over resources within its boundaries which are essential not only to the well-being but often to the very lives of its citizens.  In the exercise of this authority, a State may so regulate a natural resource as to preclude that resource from attaining the status of an “article of commerce” for the purposes of the negative- impact of the Commerce Clause.  It is difficult, if not impossible, to conclude that “commerce” exists in an item that cannot be reduced to possession under state law and in which the State recognizes only a usufructuary right.  “Commerce” cannot exist in a natural resource that cannot be sold, rented, traded, or transferred, but only used.  Of course, a State may not discriminate against interstate commerce when it regulates even such a resource.  If the State allows indiscriminate intrastate commercial dealings in a particular resource, it may have a difficult task proving that an outright prohibition on interstate commercial dealings is not such a discrimination.  I had thought that this was the basis for this Court’s decisions in Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322 (1979), Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923), and West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., <citedDecision>221 U. S. 229</citedDecision> (1911).  In each case, the State permitted a natural resource to be reduced to private possession, permitted an intrastate market to exist in that resource, and either barred interstate commerce entirely or granted its residents a commercial preference.  1 *964 By contrast, Nebraska so regulates ground water that it cannot be said that the State permits any “commerce,” intrastate or interstate, to exist in this natural resource.  As with almost all of the Western States, Nebraska does- not recognize an absolute ownership interest in ground water, but grants landowners only a right to use ground water on the land from which it has been extracted.  Moreover, the landowner’s right to use ground water is limited.  Nebraska landowners may not extract ground water “in excess of a reasonable and beneficial use upon the land in which he owns, especially if such use is injurious to others who have substantial rights to the waters, and if the natural underground supply is insufficient for all owners, each is entitled to a reasonable proportion of the whole.” Olson v. City of Wahoo, 124 Neb. 802, 811 , 248 N. W. 304, 308 (1933).  With the exception of municipal water systems, Nebraska forbids any transportation of ground water off the land owned or controlled by the person who has appropriated the water from its subterranean source.
