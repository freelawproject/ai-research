**Lead Opinion**
 The factor which distinguishes the present case from Estin is that here the wife’s right to support had not been reduced to judgment prior to the husband’s ex parte divorce.  In our opinion this difference is not material on the question before us.  Since the wife was not subject to its jurisdiction, the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which she had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband.  It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.  6 Here, the Nevada divorce court *419 was as powerless to cut off the wife’s support right as it would have been to order the husband to pay alimony if the wife had brought the divorce action and he had not been subject to the divorce court’s jurisdiction.  Therefore, the Nevada decree, to the extent it purported to affect the wife’s right to support, was void and the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not obligate New York to give it recognition.  7 Petitioner claims that this case is governed by Thompson v. Thompson, <citedDecision>226 U. S. 551</citedDecision> .  For the reasons given in a concurring opinion in Armstrong v. Armstrong, 350 U. S. 568, 575 , at 580-581, the <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> case, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.  Affirmed.  The Chief Justice took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. It seems clear that in Nevada the effect of this decree was to put an end to the husband’s duty to support the wife — provided, of course, that the Nevada courts had power to do this.  Sweeney v.
