 The rule laid down in Pollard’s Lessee has been followed in an unbroken line of cases which make it clear that the title thus acquired by the State is absolute so far as any federal principle of land titles is concerned.  For example, in Weber v. Harbor Comm’rs, 18 Wall., at 65-66 , the Court reaffirmed the doctrine of Pollard’s Lessee : “Upon the admission of California into the Union upon equal footing with the original States, absolute property in, and dominion and sovereignty over, all soils under the tidewaters within her limits passed to the State, with the consequent right to dispose of the title to any part of said soils in such manner as she might deem proper, subject only to the paramount right of navigation over the waters .  .  .  .” (Emphasis added.) In Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 338 (1877), the Court extended the doctrine to waters which were nontidal but nonetheless navigable, consistent with its earlier extension of admiralty jurisdiction to such waters in The Propeller *375 Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443 (1852).  And in Shively v. Bowlby, <citedDecision>152 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1894), the Court recounted in extenso the many cases which had followed the doctrine of Pollard’s Lessee .  In summarizing its holding, <citedDecision>152 U. S., at 57-58</citedDecision> , the Court stated: “The new States admitted into the Union since the adoption of the Constitution have the same rights as the original States in the tide waters, and in the lands under them, within their respective jurisdictions.  The title and rights of riparian or littoral proprietors in the soil below [the] high water mark, therefore, are governed by the laws of the several States, subject to the rights granted to the United States by the Constitution.” At the time of our decision in Bonelli, this line of authority stood side by side with, and was wholly consistent with, other cases requiring the application of federal law to questions of land titles or boundaries.  Where Mexico had patented tidal lands to a private owner before ceding to the United States the territory which ultimately became the State of California, California did not succeed to the ownership of such lands upon her admission to the Union.  Knight v. United States Land Assn., 142 U. S. 161 (1891).  If a navigable stream is an interstate boundary, this Court, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction over suits between States, has necessarily developed a body of federal common law to determine the effect of a change in the bed of the stream on the boundary.  See, e. g., Nebraska v. Iowa, 143 U. S. 359 (1892); Arkansas v. Tennessee, 246 U. S. 158 (1918).  Congress possesses by virtue of its commerce power a “navigational servitude” with respect to navigable waters.

 This principle applies to the banks and shores of waterways, and we have consistently so held.  Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324 (1877), involved an ejectment action by the plaintiff against the city involving certain land along the banks of the Mississippi River.  After noting that the early state doctrines regarding the ownership of the soil of nontidal waters were based upon the then-discarded English view that nontidal waters were presumed nonnavigable, the Court clearly articulated the rule that the States could formulate, and modify, rules of riparian ownership as they saw fit: “Whether, as rules of property, it would now be safe to change these doctrines [arising out of the confusion of the original classification of nontidal waters as non-navigable] where they have been applied, as before remarked, is for the several States themselves to determine.  If they choose to resign to the riparian proprietor rights which properly belong to them in their sovereign capacity, it is not for others to raise objections.  In our view of the subject the correct principles were laid down in Martin v. Waddell, 16 Pet. 367 , Pollard’s Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. 212 , and Goodtitle v. Kibbe, 9 id. 471.  These cases related to tide-water, it is true; but they enunciate principles which are equally applicable to all navigable waters.” Id., at 338.  In <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bowlby</citedDecision> , the Court canvassed its previous decisions and emphasized that state law controls riparian ownership.  The Court concluded that grants by Congress of land bordering navigable waters “leave the question of the use of the shores by the owners of uplands to the sovereign control of each State, subject only to the rights *380 vested by the Constitution in the United States.” <citedDecision>152 U. S., at 58</citedDecision> .  As the Court again emphasized in Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661, 669 (1891): “ [W]hatever incidents or rights attach to the ownership of property conveyed by the government will be determined by the States, subject to the condition that their rules do not impair the efficacy of the grants or the use and enjoyment of the property by the grantee.” This doctrine was squarely applied to the case of a riparian proprietor in Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332 (1906).  The land at issue had originally been granted to the patentee’s predecessor by Spain, and Congress had confirmed the grant and issued letters patent.  This Court held that the fact that a plaintiff claimed accretions to land patented to his predecessor by the Federal Government did not confer federal-question jurisdiction, and implicitly rejected any notion that “federal common law” 8 had any application to the resolution.  Central to this result was the holding: “As this land in controversy is not the land described *381 in the letters patent or the [A]cts of Congress, but, as is stated in the petition, is formed by accretions or gradual deposits from the river, whether such land belongs to the plaintiff is, under the cases just cited, a matter of local or state law, and not one arising under the laws of the United States.” Id., at 343 .  V Upon full reconsideration of our decision in Bonelli, we conclude that it was wrong in treating the equal-footing doctrine as a source of federal common law after that doctrine had vested title to the riverbed in the State of Arizona as of the time of its admission to the Union.  We also think there was no other basis in that case, nor is there any in this case, to support the application of federal common law to override state real property law. There are obviously institutional considerations which we must face in deciding whether for that reason to overrule Bonelli or to adhere to it, and those considerations cut both ways.

 The "mystery” or "puzzle” to which our Brother refers, post, at 384, turns out to be nonexistent; in rejecting Bonelli’s equal-footing analysis, we are simply refusing to be more Roman than the Romans.  The dissent’s own abandonment of Bonelli’s ratio decidendi is anything but a ringing endorsement of the rule of stare decisis.  We think that the insistence of our dissenting Brethren that “federal common law” should be applied to a determination of title in this case, albeit not for the same reason expounded in Bonelli, misapprehends the meaning and significance of the term “common law” as it is used in several of our old cases. In the generic sense of the term, the “common law” has been defined as: “ ‘the body of those principles and rules of action, relating to the government and security of persons and property, which derive their authority solely from usages and customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts recognizing, affirming and enforcing such usages and customs; and, in this sense, particularly the ancient unwritten law of England.’ ” Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Call Pub. Co., 181 U. S. 92, 102 (1901) (citing Black’s Law Dictionary).  It is in this descriptive sense that the term is used in the two principal quotations relied upon in the dissenting opinion, New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 , 717 (1836), and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 68 (1874).  In the passage from New Orleans , the Court *381 simply summarized the accepted British common-law doctrine of accretion.  In Lovingston , the Court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois which had rested upon the proper rule of common law, without any indication that this rule was not the law of Illinois.  In light of the treatment of the subject in such later cases as Barney v. Keokuk, Packer v. Bird, Shively v. <citedDecision>Bowlby</citedDecision> , and Joy v. St. Louis , all discussed in the text, no “rule” requiring the application of “federal common law” to questions of riparian ownership may be deduced from New Orleans and Lovingston .  See post, at 387-388.

 One hundred forty years ago, this Court found it obvious that whoever had title to the land bordering water would have title to new land formed by alluvial deposits on the existing upland: “The question is well settled at common law, that the person whose land is bounded by a stream of water, which changes its course gradually by alluvial formations, shall still hold by the same boundary, including the accumulated soil.  No other rule can be applied on just principles.  Every proprietor whose land is thus bounded is subject to loss, by the same means which may add to his territory: and as he is without remedy for his loss, in this way, he cannot be held accountable for his gain.” Ibid, (emphasis added).  This statement of the law was quoted by the Court in County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 68 (1874).  *387 The Court in County of St. Clair went on to note: “The riparian right to future alluvion is a vested right.  It is an inherent and essential attribute of the original property.” Ibid, (emphasis added).  Similarly, in Shively v. Bowlby, <citedDecision>152 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1894), 6 the Court said: “The rule, everywhere admitted, that where the land encroaches upon the water by gradual and imperceptible degrees, the accretion or alluvion belongs to the owner of the land, is equally applicable to lands bounding on tide waters or on fresh waters, and to the King or the State as to private persons; and is independent of the law governing the title in the soil covered by the water.” Id., at 35 (emphasis added).  Thus, the right to such additions 7 was part of the title which passed with the federal grant, cf. 3 American Law of Property § 15.27, p. 859 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952), and was protected by federal law. By holding that state law now governs the impact of changes in the course of the bordering water on a federal riparian grant, the Court denies that “a question which concerns the validity and effect of an act done by the United States” is “necessarily a federal question.” Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296 U. S. 10, 22 (1935).  As far as federal law is concerned, a federal riparian grant *388 is now understood to have incorporated a fixed rather than ambulatory boundary.  Ante, at 376.  The rule of New Orleans v. United States, supra, and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, supra, is discarded along with Bonelli and Hughes .  The cases the Court concludes compel this dramatic shift do not even support it.  Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498 (1839), 8 was an action of ejectment brought against the commander of a United States military post to recover part of the post.

 The plaintiff claimed title to the new land by virtue of his asserted ownership of the adjacent upland.  The Court noted that “[i]t is generally conceded that the riparian title attaches to subsequent accretions to the land effected by the gradual and imperceptible operation of natural causes.” Id., at 337 .  Whether the same rule applied to land created out of the bed of the river, however, the Court considered a question of state law. The reason for this, as the Court explained, is that the riparian rights granted by the Federal Government extended only to the water’s edge; if the States wish to grant the riparian owner rights beyond that point, they may do so at their own discretion.  See id., at 338 .  The Court transforms this conclusion that the States may, if they wish, enlarge the title granted by the Federal Government into support for the proposition that the States *390 may also restrict that title.  The transformation is impressive, but it is not logical.  The issue before the Court in <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bowlby, supra,</citedDecision> was the title to land below the high-water mark of the Columbia River in Oregon.  Shively claimed under a prestatehood grant from the United States, while Bowlby based his title on a subsequent grant from the State of Oregon.  The Court held for Bowlby, finding that although Congress could have granted Shively title to the land he claimed, 11 it had not done so, nor had the State.  <citedDecision>152 U. S., at 48-57</citedDecision> .  As the majority indicates, the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court engaged in a thorough review of earlier cases. It summarized its conclusions, in part, as follows: “The title and rights of riparian or littoral proprietors in the soil below [the] high water mark, therefore, are governed by the laws of the several States, subject to the rights granted to the United States by the Constitution.” <citedDecision>Id., at 57-58</citedDecision> .  But the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court, unlike today’s majority, realized that this proposition does not affect the rights of riparian holders to the benefits of the common-law doctrines governing boundary changes.  12 Those rights are “independent of *391 the law governing the title in the soil covered by the water.” <citedDecision>Id., at 35</citedDecision> .  See <citedDecision>id., at 36</citedDecision> .  13 Thus, the cases refute the majority’s contention that the results in Hughes and Bonelli sharply departed from prior law. Today’s holding cannot, therefore, be based on interpretation of the meaning of the pre-statehood riparian grants under which Corvallis Sand & Gravel holds title, since the right to an ambulatory boundary was assumed to be part of the rights of a riparian grantee at the time the grants were made.  Moreover, the cases also demonstrate that there is no constitutional basis for today’s holding.  The only constitutional question discussed in the majority opinion is the law governing the States’ title to land beneath navigable waters, and the rights of the riparian holder are independent of that law. II Since today’s ruling cannot be a matter either of constitutional law or of interpretation of the meaning of federal grants, it must be a choice-of-law decision.  In deciding whether to formulate and apply a federal common-law rule, “normally the guiding principle is that a sig *392 nificant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of state law in the premises must first be specifically shown.” Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S. 63, 68 (1966).  See generally P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro, & H. Wechsler, Hart & Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 756-832 (2d ed. 1973).  In order to assure an informed presentation of federal policies and interests when faced with a choice between federal and state law, this Court in the past has invited the Solicitor General to file a brief amicus curiae expressing the views of the United States.

 A sudden, or avulsive, change does not effect a shift in boundaries.  These doctrines form a coherent system.  It would make no sense to hold that the federal doctrine of accretion must be applied to the benefit of a federal riparian grantee but that the federal doctrine of avulsion need not be applied.

See <citedDecision>152 U. S., at 28</citedDecision> .  The majority also quotes the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court’s statement that federal grants “ ‘leave the question of the use of the shores by the owners of uplands to the sovereign control of each State.’ ” Ante, at 379, quoting <citedDecision>152 U. S., at 58</citedDecision> .  It is clear from the context that by “shores” the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court meant the land below the high-water mark.  The State, as owner of that land, controls, it.  The Court did not suggest that the State was free to diminish the title of the upland owner by denying his right to an ambulatory boundary if the “shores” recede or the uplands grow.  The majority’s assertion that the rule of New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 (1836), and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46 (1874), is merely a description of the English common law, ante, at 380-381, n. 8, is belied by the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court’s affirmation of the independence of the riparian holder’s rights from the law governing the lands beneath the water.  The majority chooses not to discuss this aspect of Shivély.  Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 342, 343 (1906), cited ante, at 377, 380, does contain language which supports the conclusions reached by the majority.  That case, however, did not involve lands in which a grantee of the United States held or claimed title.  The land in that case was granted by Spain.  Congress confirmed the grant, but by so doing it added nothing to the title conferred by Spain.  See Joy v. St. Louis, 122 P. 524 (ED Mo. 1903), aff’d, 201 U. S. 332 (1906); United States v.
