 Before they were arrested each had made “sales” of books.  There was evidence that it was their practice in making these solicitations to request a “contribution” of twenty-five cents each for the books and five cents each for the pamphlets, but to accept lesser sums or even to donate the volumes in case an interested person was without funds.  In the present case, some donations of pamphlets were made when books were purchased.  Petitioners were convicted and fined for violation of the ordinance.  Their judgments of conviction were sustained by the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, 149 Pa. Super. Ct. 175 , 27 A. 2d 666 , against their contention that the ordinance deprived them of the freedom of speech, press, and religion guaranteed by the First Amendment.  Petitions for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania were denied.  The cases are here on petitions for writs of certiorari which we granted along with the petitions for rehearing of Jones v. Opelika, <citedDecision>316 U. S. 584</citedDecision> , and its companion cases. *108 The First Amendment, which the Fourteenth makes applicable to the states, declares that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press .  .  It could hardly be denied that a tax laid specifically on the exercise of those freedoms would be unconstitutional.  Yet the license tax imposed by this ordinance is, in substance, just that.  Petitioners spread their interpretations of the Bible and their religious beliefs largely through the hand distribution of literature by full or part time workers.  4 They claim to follow the example of Paul, teaching “publiekly, and from house to house.” Acts 20:20.  They take literally the mandate of the Scriptures, “Go ye into all tire world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” Mark 16:15.

 Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147, 160-161 .  We are concerned, however, in these cases merely with one narrow issue.  There is presented for decision no question whatsoever concerning punishment for any alleged unlawful acts during the solicitation.  Nor is there involved here any question as to the validity of a registration system for colporteurs and other solicitors.  The cases present a single issue — the constitutionality of an ordinance which as construed and applied requires religious colporteurs to pay a license tax as a condition to the pursuit of their activities.  The alleged justification for the exaction of this license tax is the fact that the religious literature is distributed with a solicitation of funds.  Thus it was stated, in <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Opelika, supra, p. 597</citedDecision> , that when a religious sect uses “ordinary commercial methods of sales of articles to raise propaganda funds,” it is proper for the state to charge “reasonable fees for the privilege of canvassing.” Situations will arise where it will be difficult to determine whether a particular activity is religious or purely commercial.  The distinction at times is vital.  As we stated only the other day, in Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413, 417 , “The states can prohibit the use of the streets for *111 the distribution of purely commercial leaflets, even though such leaflets may have ‘a civic appeal, or a moral platitude’ appended.  Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52, 55 .  They may not prohibit the distribution of handbills in the pursuit of a clearly religious activity merely because the handbills invite the purchase of books for the improved understanding of the religion or because the handbills seek in a lawful fashion to promote the raising of funds for religious purposes.” But the mere fact that the religious literature is “sold” by itinerant preachers rather than “donated” does not transform evangelism into a commercial enterprise.  If it did, then the passing of the collection plate in church would make the church service a commercial project.  The constitutional rights of those spreading their religious beliefs through the spoken and printed word are not to be gauged by standards governing retailers or wholesalers of books.

 Thus, it may not exact a license tax for the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce (McGold rick v. Berwind-White Co., 309 U. S. 33 , 56-58), although it may tax the property used in, or the income derived from, that commerce, so long as those taxes are not discriminatory.  Id., p. 47 and cases cited.  A license tax applied to activities guaranteed by the First Amendment would have the same destructive effect.  It is true that the First Amendment, like the commerce clause, draws no distinction between license taxes, fixed sum taxes, and other kinds of taxes.  But that is no reason why we should shut our eyes to the nature of the tax and its destructive influence.  The power to impose a license tax on the exercise of these freedoms is indeed as potent as the power of censorship which this Court has repeatedly struck down.  Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 ; Schneider v. State, supra; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 306 ; Largent v. Texas, 318 U. S. 418 ; Jamison v. Texas, supra. It was for that reason that the dissenting opinions in <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Opelika, supra,</citedDecision> stressed the nature of this type of tax. 316 U. S. pp. 607-609, 620, 623.  In that case, as in the present ones, we have something very different from a registration system under which those going from house to house are required to give their names, addresses and other marks of identification to the authorities.  In all of these cases the issuance of the permit or license is dependent on the payment of a license tax. And the license tax is fixed in amount and unrelated to the scope of the activities of petitioners or to their realized revenues.  It is not a nominal fee *114 imposed as a regulatory measure to defray the expenses of policing the activities in question.  8 It is in no way apportioned.  It is a flat license tax levied and collected as a condition to the pursuit of activities whose enjoyment is guaranteed by the First Amendment.  Accordingly, it restrains in advance those constitutional liberties of press and religion and inevitably tends to suppress their exercise.

 Nor can the present ordinance survive if we assume that it has been construed to apply only to solicitation from house to house.  10 The ordinance is not narrowly drawn to prevent or control abuses or evils arising from that activity.  Rather, it sets aside the residential areas as a prohibited zone, entry of which is denied petitioners unless the tax is paid.  That restraint and one which is city-wide in scope (Jones v. Opelika) are different only in degree.  Each is an abridgment of freedom of press and a restraint on the free exercise of religion.  They stand or fall together.  The judgment in <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Opelika</citedDecision> has this day been vacated.  Freed from that controlling precedent, we can restore to their high, constitutional position the liberties of itinerant evangelists who disseminate their religious beliefs and the tenets of their faith through distribution of literature.  The judgments are reversed and the causes are remanded to the Pennsylvania Superior Court for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  Reversed.  The following dissenting opinions are applicable to Nos. 280, 314, and 966 (October Term, 1941), <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> v. Opelika, ante, p. 103; and to Nos. 480-487, Murdock v. Pennsylvania, ante, p. 105.  See also opinion of Mr. Justice Jackson, post, p. 166.  Two religious books — Salvation and Creation — were sold.  Others were offered in addition to the Bible.  The Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society is alleged to be a non-profit charitable corporation.  Petitioners paid three cents each for the pamphlets and, if they devoted only their spare time to the work, twenty cents each for the books.  Those devoting full time to the work acquired the books for five cents each.

The General Conference of Seventh-Day Adventists, who filed a brief amicus curiae on the reargument of <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Opelika</citedDecision> , has given us the following data concerning their literature ministry: This denomination has 83 publishing houses throughout the world, issuing publications in over 200 languages.  Some 9,256 separate publications were issued in 1941.  By printed and spoken word, the Gospel is carried into 412 countries in 824 languages.  1942 Yearbook, p. 287.  During December 1941, a total of 1,018 colporteurs operated in North America.  They delivered during that month $97,997.19 worth of gospel literature, and for the whole year of 1941 a total of $790,610.36 — an average per person of about $65 per month. Some of these were students and temporary workers.  Colporteurs of this denomination receive half of their collections, from which they must pay their traveling and living expenses.
