Black, The Law of Admiralty §7-17, pp. 522-523 (2d ed. 1975).  2 The Government’s petition for certiorari presented the single question whether the admiralty rule of equally divided damages should be replaced by the rule of damages in proportion to fault.  The respondent did not file a cross-petition for certiorari, but it now argues that the Government was solely at fault and requests an increase of the judgment in its favor to the full amount of its damages.  However, absent a cross-petition for certiorari, the respondent may not now challenge the judgment of the Court of Appeals to enlarge its rights thereunder.  Morley Constr. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co., 300 U. S. 185, 190 ; United States v. American Railway Express Co., 265 U. S. 425, 435 .  Moreover, even if it could be argued that respondent’s challenge of the factual findings could be taken as an argument in support of the judgment, see Stern, When to Cross-Appeal or Cross-Petition — Certainty or Confusion?, 87 Harv.

Rev. 304 (1957).  Other maritime nations enacted provisions similar to Article XIV during the same period, with slight variations in the scope of the rule and the principle of division.
