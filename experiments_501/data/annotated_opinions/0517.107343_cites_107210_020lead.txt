 Indeed, that theory was expressly rejected in a series of decisions following Adler .  See Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 ; Slochower v. Board of Education, 350 U. S. 551 ; Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, supra; Baggett v. Bullitt, supra; Shelton v. Tucker, supra; Speiser v. Randall, supra; see also Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232 ; Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 .  In Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 404 , we said: “It is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of.  or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege.” We proceed then to the question of the validity of the provisions of subdivision 1 (c) of § 105 and subdivision 2 of § 3022, barring employment to members of listed organizations.  Here again constitutional doctrine has developed since Adler .  Mere knowing membership without a specific intent to further the unlawful aims of an organization is not a constitutionally adequate basis for exclusion from such positions as those held by appellants.  In Elfbrandt v. Russell, <citedDecision>384 U. S. 11</citedDecision> , we said, “Those who join an organization but do not share its unlawful purposes and who do not participate in its unlawful activities surely pose no threat, either as citizens or as public employees.” <citedDecision>Id., at 17</citedDecision> .  We there struck down a statutorily required oath binding the state employee not to become a member of the Communist Party with knowledge of its unlawful purpose, on threat of discharge and perjury prosecution if the oath were violated.  We found that “[a]ny lingering doubt that proscription of mere knowing membership, without any showing of ‘specific intent,’ would run afoul of the Constitution was set at rest by our decision in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500 .” <citedDecision>Elfbrandt</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Russell, supra, at 16</citedDecision> .  In Aptheker we held that Party membership, without knowl *607 edge of the Party’s unlawful purposes and specific intent to further its unlawful aims, could not constitutionally warrant deprivation of the right to travel abroad.  As we said in Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U. S. 118, 136 , “[U]nder our traditions beliefs are personal and not a matter of mere association, and .  .  .  men in adhering to a political party or other organization ... do not subscribe unqualifiedly to all of its platforms or asserted principles.” “A law which applies to membership without the ‘specific intent’ to further the illegal aims of the organization infringes unnecessarily on protected freedoms.  It rests on the doctrine of ‘guilt by association’ which has no place here.” <citedDecision>Elfbrandt, supra, at 19</citedDecision> .  Thus mere Party membership, even with knowledge of the Party’s unlawful goals, cannot suffice to justify criminal punishment, see Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203 ; Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290 ; Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 ; 11 nor may it warrant a finding of moral unfitness justifying disbarment.  Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232 .  These limitations clearly apply tó a provision, like § 105, subd. 1 (c), which blankets all state employees, regardless of the “sensitivity” of their positions.  But even the Feinberg Law provision, applicable primarily to activities of teachers, who have captive audiences of young minds, are subject to these limitations in favor of freedom of expression and association; the stifling effect on the academic mind from curtailing freedom of association in such manner is manifest, and has been documented in recent studies.  12 <citedDecision>Elfbrandt</citedDecision> and Aptheker state the *608 governing standard: legislation which sanctions membership unaccompanied by specific intent to further the unlawful goals of the organization or which is not active membership violates constitutional limitations.  Measured against this standard, both Civil Service Law § 105, subd. 1 (c), and Education Law § 3022, subd. 2, sweep overbroadly into association which may not be proscribed.  The presumption of disqualification arising from proof of mere membership may be rebutted, but only by (a) a denial of membership, (b) a denial that the organization advocates the overthrow of government by force, or fc) a denial that the teacher has knowledge of such advocacy.  Lederman v. Board of Education, 276 App. Div. 527 , 96 N. Y. S. 2d 466, aff’d, 301 N. Y. 476 , 95 N. E. 2d 806 .  13 Thus proof of nonactive membership or a showing of the absence of intent to further unlawful aims will not rebut the presumption and defeat dismissal.  This is emphasized in official administrative interpretations.  For example, it is said in a letter addressed to prospective appointees by the President of the State University, “You will note that .

 .  both the Law and regulations are very specifically directed toward the elimination and nonappointment of ‘Communists’ from or to our teaching ranks .  .  .  .” The Feinberg Certificate was even more explicit: “Anyone who is a *609 member of the Communist Party or of any organization that advocates the violent overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of New York or any political subdivision thereof cannot be employed by the State University.” (Emphasis supplied.) This official administrative interpretation is supported by the legislative preamble to the Feinberg Law, § 1, in which the legislature concludes as a result of its findings that “it is essential that the laws prohibiting persons who are members of subversive groups, such as the communist party and its affiliated organizations, from obtaining or retaining employment in the public schools, be rigorously enforced.” (Emphasis supplied.) Thus § 105, subd. 1 (c), and § 3022, subd. 2, suffer from impermissible “overbreadth.” <citedDecision>Elfbrandt</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Russell, supra, at 19</citedDecision> ; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, supra; N. A. A. C. P. v. Button, supra; Saia v. New York, 334 U. S. 558 ; Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 ; Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 ; cf. Hague v. C. I.  O., 307 U. S. 496, 515-516 ; see generally Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 486 .  They seek to bar employment both for association which legitimately may be proscribed and for association which may not be proscribed consistently with First Amendment rights.  Where statutes have an over-broad sweep, just as where they are vague, “the hazard of loss or substantial impairment of those precious rights may be critical,” Dombrowski v. Pfister, supra, at 486 , since those covered by the statute are bound to limit their behavior to that which is unquestionably safe.  As we said in Shelton v. Tucker, supra, at 488 , “The breadth of legislative abridgment must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose.” We therefore hold that Civil Service Law § 105, subd. 1 (c), and Education Law § 3022, subd. 2, are invalid insofar as they proscribe mere knowing membership *610 without any showing of specific intent to further the unlawful aims of the Communist Party of the United States or of the State of New York. The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Reversed and remanded.  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT.
