 The Court began to employ “neutrality” in a sense different from equipoise, however, as it explicated the distinction between “religious” and “secular” benefits to religious schools, the latter being in some circumstances permissible.  See infra, at 884-899 (discussing considerations).  Even though both Everson and Allen had anticipated some such distinction, neither ease had used the term “neutral” in this way.  In Everson , Justice Black indicated that providing *880 police, fire, and similar government services to religious institutions was permissible, in part because they were “so separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function.” 330 U. S., at 18 .  Allen similarly focused on the fact that the textbooks lent out were “secular” and approved by secular authorities, 392 U. S., at 245 , and assumed that the secular textbooks and the secular elements of education they supported were not so intertwined with religious instruction as “in fact [to be] instrumental in the teaching of religion,” id., at 248 .  Such was the Court’s premise in Lemon for shifting the use of the word “neutral” from labeling the required position of the government to describing a benefit that was nonreligious.  We spoke of “[o]ur decisions from Everson to Allen [as] permitting] the States to provide church-related schools with secular, neutral, or nonideological services, facilities, or materials,” 403 U. S., at 616, and thereafter, we regularly used “neutral” in this second sense of “secular” or “nonreligious.” See, e. g., Tilton, supra, at 687-688 (characterizing subsidized teachers in Lemon as “not necessarily religiously neutral,” but buildings as “religiously neutral”); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 365-366 (1975) (describing instructional materials as “ ‘secular, nonideologi-eal and neutral’ ” and “wholly neutral”); id., at 372 (describing auxiliary services as “religiously neutral”); Roemer, supra, at 751 (opinion of Blaekmun, J.) (describing Tilton’s approved buildings as “neutral or nonideologieal in nature”); 426 U. S., at 754 (describing Meek’s speech and hearing services as “neutral and nonideologieal”); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dish, 509 U. S. 1, 10 (1993) (discussing translator as “neutral service”); Agostini v. Felton, <citedDecision>521 U. S. 203, 232</citedDecision> (1997) (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was “neutral and nonideologieal”); cf. Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 478 (1973) (noting that District Court approved testing cost reimbursement as payment for services that were “ ‘secular, neutral, or nonideologieal’ ” in character, citing Lemon, 403 U. S., at *881 616 ); Wolman, supra, at 242 (quoting Lemon, supra, at 616 (describing permitted services aid as “secular, neutral, or nonideologieal”)).  The shift from equipoise to secular was not, however, our last redefinition, for the Court again transformed the sense of “neutrality” in the 1980’s.  Reexamining and reinterpreting Everson and Allen , we began to use the word “neutral” to mean “evenhanded,” in the sense of allocating aid on some common basis to religious and secular recipients.  Again, neither Everson nor Allen explicitly used “neutral” in this manner, but just as the label for equipoise had lent itself to referring to the secular characteristic of what a government might provide, it was readily adaptable to referring to the generality of government services, as in Everson’s paradigms, to which permissible benefits were compared.  The increased attention to a notion of evenhanded distribution was evident in Nyquist , where the Court distinguished the program under consideration from the government services approved in Allen and Everson , in part because “the class of beneficiaries [in Everson and Allen] included all schoolchildren, those in public as well as those in private schools.” 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38.  Nyquist then reserved the question whether “some form of public assistance .  .

 See, e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487 (1986) (quoting Nyquist and characterizing program as making aid “available generally”); Zobrest, swpra, at 8-9 (discussing “government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion” and citing Mueller and Witters); Agos-tini, supra, at 231 (discussing aid allocated on the basis of “neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, .  .  .  made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis”); see also Rosen-berger, 515 U. S., at 839 (“[T]he guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse”).  In sum, “neutrality” originally entered this field of jurisprudence as a eonelusory term, a label for the required rela *883 tionship between the government and religion as a state of equipoise between government as ally and government as adversary.  Reexamining Everson’s paradigm cases to derive a prescriptive guideline, we first determined that "neutral” aid was secular, nonideologieal, or unrelated to religious education.  Our subsequent reexamination of Everson and Allen, beginning in Nyquist and culminating in Mueller and most recently in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , recast neutrality as a concept of "evenhandedness.” There is, of course, good reason for considering the generality of aid and the evenhandedness of its distribution in making close calls between benefits that in purpose or effect support a school’s religious mission and those that do not.  This is just what Everson did.  Even when the disputed practice falls short of Everson’s paradigms, the breadth of evenhanded distribution is one pointer toward the law’s purpose, since on the face of it aid distributed generally and without a religious criterion is less likely to be meant to aid religion than a benefit going only to religious institutions or people.  And, depending on the breadth of distribution, looking to evenhandedness is a way of asking whether a benefit can reasonably be seen to aid religion in fact; we do not regard the postal system as aiding religion, even though parochial schools get mail.  Given the legitimacy of considering evenhandedness, then, there is no reason to avoid the term “neutrality” to refer to it.  But one crucial point must be borne in mind.  In the days when "neutral” was used in Everson’s sense of equipoise, neutrality was tantamount to constitutionality; the term was eonclusory, but when it applied it meant that the government’s position was constitutional under the Establishment Clause.  This is not so at all, however, under the most recent use of "neutrality” to refer to generality or evenhandedness of distribution.  This kind of neutrality is relevant in judging whether a benefit scheme so characterized should be seen as aiding a sectarian school’s religious *884 mission, but this neutrality is not alone sufficient to qualify the aid as constitutional.  It is to be considered only along with other characteristics of aid, its administration, its recipients, or its potential that have been emphasized over the years as indicators of just how religious the intent and effect of a given aid scheme really is.  See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 677-678 (opinion of Burger, C. J.) (acknowledging “no single constitutional caliper”); Meek, 421 U. S., at 358-359 (noting considerations as guidelines only and discussing them as a matter of degree); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 383 (1985) (quoting Meek), overruled in part by Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 203</citedDecision> ; Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 720 (1994) (opinion of O’Connor, J.) (“Experience proves that the Establishment Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single test”); Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 847-849 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (discussing need for line-drawing); id., at 852 (noting lack of a single “Grand Unified Theory” for Establishment Clause and citing Kiryas Joel)', ef.  <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 232-233</citedDecision> (examining a variety of factors).  Thus, the basic principle of establishment scrutiny of aid remains the principle as stated in Everson , that there may be no public aid to religion or support for the religious mission of any institution.  B The insufficiency of evenhandedness neutrality as a standalone criterion of constitutional intent or effect has been clear from the beginning of our interpretative efforts, for an obvious reason.  Evenhandedness in distributing a benefit approaches the equivalence of constitutionality in this area only when the term refers to such universality of distribution that it makes no sense to think of the benefit as going to any discrete group.  Conversely, when evenhandedness refers to distribution to limited groups within society, like groups of schools or schoolchildren, it does make sense to regard the benefit as aid to the recipients.  See, e. g., Everson, 330 U. S., *885 at 16 (discussing aid that approaches the “verge” of forbidden territory); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 612 (“[W]e can only dimly perceive the lines of demarcation in this extraordinarily sensitive area of constitutional law”); Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 760-761 (noting the “most perplexing questions” presented in this area and acknowledging “‘entangling] precedents’”); Mueller, 463 U. S., at 393 (quoting Lemon); Witters, 474 U. S., at 485 (quoting Lemon).  Hence, if we looked no further than evenhandedness, and failed to ask what activities the aid might support, or in fact did support, religious schools could be blessed with government funding as massive as expenditures made for the benefit of their public school counterparts, and religious missions would thrive on public money.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Third, we have found relevance in at least five characteristics of the aid itself: its religious content; its cash form; its divertibility or actually diversion to religious support; its supplantation of traditional items of religious school expense; and its substantiality.  1 Two types of school aid recipients have raised special concern.  First, we have recognized the fact that the overriding religious mission of certain schools, those sometimes called *886 “pervasively sectarian,” is not confined to a discrete element of the curriculum, Everson, 330 U. S., at 22-24 (Jackson, J., dissenting); id., at 45-47 (Rutledge, J., dissenting), but permeates their teaching.  6 Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 671 (1970); Lemon, supra, at 636-637 (“A school which operates to commingle religion with other instruction plainly cannot completely secularize its instruction.  Parochial schools, in large measure, do not accept the assumption that secular subjects should be unrelated to religious teaching”); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 621-622 (1988) (discussing pervasively sectarian private schools).  Based on record evidence and long experience, we have concluded that religious teaching in such schools is at the core of the instructors’ individual and personal obligations, cf. Canon 803, §2, Text & Commentary 568 (“It is necessary that the formation and education given in a Catholic school be based upon the principles of Catholic doctrine; teachers are to be outstanding for their correct doctrine and integrity of life”), and that individual religious teachers will teach religiously.  7 Lemon, 403 U. S., at 615-620 ; id., at 635- *887 641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 ; Meek, 421 U. S., at 369-371 ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 249-250 (discussing nonseverability of religious and secular education); Ball, 473 U. S., at 399-400 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 236</citedDecision> .  As religious teaching cannot be separated from secular education in such schools or by such teachers, we have concluded that direct government subsidies to such schools are prohibited because they will inevitably and impermissibly support religious indoctrination.  Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12 (discussing Meek and Ball).  Second, we have expressed special concern about aid to primary and secondary religious schools.  Tilton, 403 U. S., at 685-686 .  On the one hand, we have understood how the youth of the students in such schools makes them highly susceptible to religious indoctrination.  Lemon, supra, at 616 (“This process of inculcating religious doctrine is, of course, enhanced by the impressionable age of the pupils, in primary schools particularly”).  On the other, we have recognized that the religious element in the education offered in most sectarian primary and secondary schools is far more intertwined with the secular than in university teaching, where the natural and academic skepticism of most older students may separate the two, see Tilton, supra, at 686-689 ; Roermer, 426 U. S., at 750 .  Thus, government benefits accruing to these pervasively religious primary and secondary schools raise special dangers of diversion into support for the religious indoctrination of children and the involvement of government in religious training and practice.  *888 2 We have also evaluated the portent of support to an organization’s religious mission that may be inherent in the method by which aid is granted, finding pertinence in at least two characteristics of distribution.  First, we have asked whether aid is direct or indirect, observing distinctions between government schemes with individual beneficiaries and those whose beneficiaries in the first instance might be religious schools.  Everson, supra, at 18 (bus fare supports parents and not schools); Allen, 392 U. S., 243 -244, and n. 6 (textbooks go to benefit children and parents, not schools); Lemon, supra, at 621 (invalidating direct aid to schools); Levitt, supra, at 480, 482 (invalidating direct testing aid to schools); Witters, 474 U. S., at 487-488 (evaluating whether aid was a direct subsidy to schools).  Direct aid obviously raises greater risks, although recent eases have discounted this risk factor, looking to other features of the distribution mechanism.  <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 225-226</citedDecision> .  8 *889 Second, we have distinguished between indirect aid that reaches religious schools only incidentally as a result of numerous individual choices and aid that is in reality directed to religious schools by the government or in practical terms selected by religious schools themselves.  Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 ; Witters, supra, at 488 ; Zobrest, supra, at 10 .  In these cases, we have declared the constitutionality of programs providing aid directly to parents or students as tax deductions or scholarship money, where such aid may pay for education at some sectarian institutions, Mueller, supra, at 399 ; Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , but only as the result of “genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients,” id., at 487 .  We distinguished this path of aid from the route in Ball and Wolman , where the opinions indicated that “[wjhere ... no meaningful distinction can be made between aid to the student and aid to the school, the concept of a loan to individuals is a transparent fiction.” 474 U. S., at 487, n. 4 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  9 3 In addition to the character of the school to which the benefit accrues, and its path from government to school, a number of features of the aid itself have figured in the elassifica- *890 tions we have made.  First, we have barred aid with actual religious content, which would obviously run afoul of the ban on the government’s participation in religion, Everson, 330 U. S., at 16 ; Walz, 397 U. S., at 668 ; cf. Lemon, 403 U. S., at 617 (discussing variable ideological and religious character of religious teachers compared to fixed content of books).  In eases where we have permitted aid, we have regularly characterized it as “neutral” in the sense (noted supra, at 879-881) of being without religious content.  See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 688 (characterizing buildings as “religiously neutral”); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (describing translator as “neutral service”); Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 232</citedDecision> (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was “neutral and nonideological”).  See also ante, at 820 (plurality opinion) (barring aid with religious content).  10 Second, we have long held government aid invalid when circumstances would allow its diversion to religious education.  The risk of diversion is obviously high when aid in the form of government funds makes its way into the coffers of religious organizations, and so from the start we have understood the Constitution to bar outright money grants of aid to religion.  11 See Everson, 830 U. S., at 16 (“[The State] *891 cannot consistently with the ‘establishment of religion’ clause of the First Amendment contribute tax-raised funds to the support of an institution which teaches the tenets and faith of any church”); id., at 18 (“The State contributes no money to the schools.  It does not support them”); Allen, 892 U. S., at 243-244 (“[N]o funds or books are furnished to parochial schools, and the financial benefit is to parents and children, not schools”); Walz, supra, at 675 (“Obviously a direct money subsidy would be a relationship pregnant with involvement and, as with most governmental grant programs, could encompass sustained and detailed administrative relationships for enforcement of statutory or administrative standards”); Lemon, supra, at 612 (identifying “three main evils” against which Establishment Clause was to protect as “sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity,” citing Walz); 403 U. S., at 621 (distinguishing direct financial aid program from Everson and Allen and noting problems with required future surveillance); Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 762, 774 (striking down “direct money grants” for maintaining buildings because there was no attempt to restrict payments to those expenditures related exclusively to secular purposes); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480, 482 (striking down “direct money grant” for testing expenses); 12 Hunt v. *892 McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 745, n. 7 (1973) (noting approved aid is “no expenditure of public funds, either by grant or loan”); Wolman, 433 U. S., at 239 , and n. 7 (noting that “statute does not authorize any payment to nonpublic school personnel for the costs of administering the tests”); Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 228-229</citedDecision> (emphasizing that approved services are not “distributed ‘directly to the religious schools.’ ... No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a school-wide basis” (citations omitted)); Bowen, 487 U. S., at 614-615 ; Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 (noting that “we have recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions”); ef.  Lemon, 403 U. S., at 619-620 (noting that safeguards and accounting inspections required to prevent government funds from supporting religious education will cause impermissible entanglement); Roemer, 426 U. S., at 753-757 (approving segregated funds after finding recipients not pervasively religious); Ball, 473 U. S., at 392-393 (noting that “[w]ith but one exception, our subsequent eases have struck down attempts by States to make payments out of *893 public tax dollars directly to primary or secondary religious educational institutions”)?  overruled in part by <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 236</citedDecision> ; Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 (“It is equally well-settled .  .. that the State may not grant aid to a religious school, whether cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct subsidy to the religious school” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); Rosenberger, supra, at 851-852 (O’CONNOR, J., concurring) (noting that student fee was not a tax).  Divertibility is not, of course, a characteristic of cash alone, and when examining provisions for ostensibly secular supplies we have considered their susceptibility to the service of religious ends.  13 In upholding a scheme to provide students with secular textbooks, we emphasized that “each book loaned must be approved by the public school authorities; only secular books may receive approval.” Allen, 392 U. S., at 244-245 ; see also Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362 (opinion of Stewart, J.); Wolman, supra, at 237-238 .  By the same token, we could not sustain provisions for instructional materials adaptable to teaching a variety of subjects.  14 Meek, supra, at 363 ; Wolman, supra, at 249-250 .  While the textbooks had a known and fixed secular content not readily di~ *894 vertible to religious teaching purposes, the adaptable materials did not.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Tilton, 403 U. S., at 683 (plurality opinion) (“If, at the end of 20 years, the building is, for example, converted into a chapel or otherwise used to promote religious interests, the original federal grant will in part have the effect of advancing religion.  To this extent the Act therefore trespasses on the Religion Clauses”); see also Hunt, 413 U. S., at 743-744 .  We were accordingly constrained to strike down aid for repairing buildings of noiipub-lic schools because they could be used for religious education.  Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 776-777 .  Divertibility was, again, the issue in an order remanding an as-applied challenge to a grant supporting counseling on teenage sexuality for findings that the aid had not been used to support religious education.  Bowen, 487 U. S., at 621 ; see also id., at 623 (O’Connor, J., concurring).  And the most recent example of attention to the significance of divertibility occurred in our explanation that public school teachers could be assigned to provide limited instruction in religious schools in Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 223-227</citedDecision> , a majority of the Court rejecting the factual assumption that public school teachers could be readily lured into providing religious instruction.  16 *896 Third, our cases have recognized the distinction, adopted by statute in the Chapter 2 legislation, between aid that merely supplements and aid that supplants expenditures for offerings at religious schools, the latter being barred.  Although we have never adopted the position that any benefit that flows to a religious school is impermissible because it frees up resources for the school to engage in religious indoctrination, Hunt, supra, at 743 , from our first decision holding it permissible to provide textbooks for religious schools we have repeatedly explained the unconstitutionality of aid that supplants an item of the school’s traditional expense.  See, e. g., Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370, 375 (1930) (noting that religious schools “are not the beneficiaries of these appropriations.  They obtain nothing from them, nor are they relieved of a single obligation because of them” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Everson, 330 U. S., at 18 (specifically noting that bus fare program did not support or fund religious schools); Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 (stating that “the financial benefit [of providing the textbooks] is to parents and children, not to schools” (footnote omitted)); id., *897 at 244, n. 6 (explicitly recognizing that “the record contains no evidence that any of the private schools in appellants’ districts previously provided textbooks for their students”); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 656 (opinion of Brennan, J.) (noting no aid to schools was involved in Allen).  We ignored this prohibition only once, in Regan, 444 U. S., at 646 ; see also ante, at 16, n. 7, where reimbursement for budgeted expenses of required testing was not struck down, but we then quickly returned to the rule as a guideline for permissible aid.  17 In Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12 , the Court specifically distinguished Meek and Ball by explaining that the invalid programs in those eases “relieved sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students.” In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , the Court made a point of noting that the objects of the aid were “by law supplemental to the regular curricula” and, citing Zobrest , explained that the remedial education services did not relieve the religious schools of costs they would otherwise have borne.  <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 228</citedDecision> (citing Zobrest, supra, at 12 ).  The Court explicitly stated that the *898 services in question did not “supplant the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already provided in New York City’s sectarian schools.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 229</citedDecision> .  Finally, we have recognized what is obvious (however imprecise), in holding “substantial” amounts of aid to be unconstitutional whether or not a plaintiff can show that it supplants a specific item of expense a religious school would have borne.  18 In Meek, 421 U. S., at 366 , we invalidated the loan of instructional materials to religious schools because “faced with the substantial amounts of direct support authorized by [the program], it would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania’s church-related elementary and secondary schools and then characterize [the program] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.” Id., at 365 .  See id., at 366 (“Substantial aid to the educational function of such schools ... necessarily results in aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole”); see also Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 783 ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 250-251 .  In Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , the Court asked whether the aid in question was a direct subsidy to religious schools and addressed the substantiality of the aid obliquely in noting that “nothing in the record indicates that.  .  .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The concern with divertibility thus predicated is underscored by the fact that the religious schools in question here covered the primary and secondary grades, the grades in which the sectarian nature of instruction is characteristically the most pervasive, see Lemon, 403 U. S., at 616 ; cf. Tilton, 403 U. S., at 686-689 , and in which pupils are the least critical of the schools’ religious objectives, see Lemon, swpra, at 616.  No one, indeed, disputes the trial judge’s findings, based on a detailed record, that the Roman Catholic schools, 21 which made up the majority of the private schools participating, 22 were pervasively sectarian, 23 that *905 their common objective and mission was to engage in religious education, 24 and that their teachers taught religiously, 25 making them precisely the kind of primary and *906 secondary religious schools that Taise the most serious Establishment Clause concerns.  See Watz, 397 U. S., at 671 ; Hunt, 413 U. S., at 743 ; Lemon, supra, at 636-637 .  The threat to Establishment Clause values wáfe accordingly at its highest in the circumstances of this case. Such precautionary features as there were in the Jefferson Parish scheme were grossly inadequate to counter the threat.  To be sure, the disbursement of the aid was subject to statutory admonitions against diversion, see, e. g., 20 U. S. C. §§7332 , 8897, and was supposedly subject to a variety of safeguards, see ante, at 802-803, 832-834.  But the provisions for onsite monitoring visits, labeling of government property, and government oversight cannot be accepted as sufficient in the face of record evidence that the safeguard provisions proved to be empty phrases in Jefferson Parish.  Cf. Agos-tini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 228-229</citedDecision> ; Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 13 (accepting precautionary provisions in absence of evidence of them uselessness).  The plurality has already noted at length the ineffectiveness of the government’s monitoring program.  Ante, at 832-834; see also App. Illa (“A system to monitor nonpublie schools was often not in operation and therefore the [local educational agency] did not always know: (a) what was purchased or (b) how it was utilized”).  Monitors visited a non-publie school only sporadically, discussed the program with a single contact person, observed nothing more than attempts at recordkeeping, and failed to inform the teachers of the restrictions involved.  Id., at 154a-155a.  Although Chapter 2 required labeling of government property, it occurred haphazardly at best, id., at 113a, and the government’s sole monitoring system for computer use amounted to nothing more *907 than questioning school officials and examining the location of computers at the schools, id., at 118a.  No records of software and computer use were kept, and no such recordkeep-ing was even planned.

 Nor did the Court address a First Amendment challenge to a state program providing textbooks to children in Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370 (1930); it simply concluded that the program had an adequate public purpose.  The Court first squarely faced the issue in Everson .  While Everson’s dissenters parted company with the majority over the specific question of school buses, the Court stood as one behind the principle of no aid for religious teaching.  330 U. S., at 15-16 ; id., at 25-26 (Jackson, J., dissenting); id., at 28-29, 31-32 (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  In fact, religious education in Roman Catholic schools is defined as part of required religious practice; aiding it is thus akin to aiding a church service.  See 1988 Code of Canon Law, Canon 798, reprinted in The Code of Canon Law: A Text and Commentary 566 (1985) (hereinafter Text & Commentary) (directing parents to entrust children to Roman Catholic schools or otherwise provide for Roman Catholic education); Canon 800, §2, Text & Commentary 567 (requiring the faithful to support establishment and maintenance of Roman Catholic schools); Canons 802, 804, Text & Commentary 567, 568 (requiring diocesan bishop to establish and regulate schools “imparting an education imbued with the Christian spirit”).  Although the Court no longer assumes that public school teachers assigned to religious schools for limited purposes will teach religiously, see Agostini v. Felton, <citedDecision>521 U. S. 203, 228-228</citedDecision> (1997), we have never abandoned the presumption that religious teachers will teach just that way.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 615-620 (1971); id., at 635-641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 480 (1973); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 369-371 (1975); Wol- *887 man v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 249-250 (1977); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 399-400 (1985) (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 236</citedDecision> .  Cf. NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 504 (1979) (“The church-teacher relationship in a church-operated school differs from the employment relationship in a public or other nonreligious school”).  In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , the Court indicated that “we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid,” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 225</citedDecision> , and cited Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1998).  However, <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> did not rely on this dictum, instead clearly stating that “[w]hile it is true that individual students may not directly apply for Title I services, it does not follow from this premise that those services are distributed ‘directly to the religious schools.’ In fact, they are not.  No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a sehoolwide basis.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 228-229</citedDecision> (citations omitted).  Until today, this Court has never permitted aid to go directly to schools on a schoolwide basis.  The plurality misreads our precedent in suggesting that we have abandoned directness of distribution as a relevant consideration.  See ante, at 815-818.  In Wolman, we stated that nominally describing aid as to students would not bar a court from finding that it actually provided a subsidy to a school, 433 U. S., at 250 , but we did not establish that a program giving “direct” aid to schools was therefore permissible.  In Witters , we made the focus of Wolman dear, continuing to examine aid to determine *889 if it was a “direct subsidy” to a school, 474 U. S., at 487 , and distinguishing the aid at issue from impermissible aid in Ball and Wolman precisely because the designation of the student as recipient in those eases was only nominal.  474 U. S., at 487, n. 4 .  Our subsequent cases have continued to ask whether government aid programs constituted impermissible “direct subsidies” to religious schools even where they are directed by individual choice.  Zobrest, supra, at 11-13; Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 399 (1983); <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 226</citedDecision> .  We have also permitted the government to supply students with public-employee translators, Zobrest, supra, at 10, and public-employee special education teachers, <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 226,228</citedDecision> , who directly provided .them with government services in whatever schools those specific students attended, public or nonpublic.  I have already noted Agostini’s limitations.  See n. 8, supra. 1 agree with the plurality that the Establishment Clause absolutely prohibits the government from providing aid with dear religious content to religious, or for that matter nonreligious, schools.  Ante, at 822-825.  The plurality, however, misreads our precedent as focusing only on affirmatively religious content.  At the very least, a building, for example, has no such content, but we have squarely required the government to ensure that no publidy financed building be diverted to religious use.  Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 681-684 (1971).
**Dissenting Opinion**
 But the potential for impermissible fostering of religion is present.  The [state legislature] has not, and could not, provide state aid on the basis of a mere assumption that secular teachers under religious discipline can avoid conflicts.  The State must be certain, given the Religion Clauses, that subsidized teachers do not inculcate religion- A comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that these restrictions are obeyed and the First Amendment otherwise respected”).  It is true that we called the importance of the cash payment consideration into question in Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646, 657-659 (1980) (approving program providing religious school with “direct cash reimbursement” for expenses of standardized testing).  In that case, we found the other safeguards against the diversion of such funds to religious uses sufficient to allow such aid: “A *892 contrary view would insist on drawing a constitutional distinction between paying the nonpublic school to do the grading and paying state employees or some independent service to perform that task, even though the grading function is the same regardless of who performs it and would not have the primary effect of aiding religion whether or not performed by nonpublic school personnel.” Id., at 658 .  Aside from this isolated circumstance, where we found ironclad guarantees of nondiversion, we have never relaxed our prohibition on direct cash aid to pervasively religious schools, and have in fact continued to acknowledge the concern.  See <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , 521U.  S., at 228-229; cf. Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 .  The plurality concedes this basic point.  See ante, at 818-819.  Given this, I find any suggestion that this prohibition has been undermined by Mueller or Witters without foundation.  See ante, at 819-820, n. 8.  Those cases involved entirely different types of aid, namely, tax deductions and individual scholarship aid for university education, see also n. 16, infra, and were followed by Rosenberger and <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , which continued to support this absolute restriction.  I reject the plurality’s argument that divertibility is a boundless principle.  Ante, at 824-825.  Our long experience of evaluating this consideration demonstrates its practical limits.  See infra this page and 894-895.  Moreover, the Establishment Clause charges us with making such enqui-ries, regardless of their difficulty.  See supra, at 875-878, 884-885.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Similarly, the plurality is mistaken in reading our holdings in Mueller and Witters , see ante, at 821, to undermine divertibility as a relevant principle.  First, these cases approved quite factually distinct types of aid; Mueller involving tax deductions, which have a quite separate history of approval, see 468 U. S., at 396, and nn. 5, 6 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664 (1970», and Witters involving scholarship money distributed to a university, not a primary or secondary school, see Tilton, 403 U. S., at 685-686 , that was not significant enough as a whole to support that institution, Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 .  Second, in neither case did the program at issue provide direct aid on a schoolwide basis (as Chapter 2 does here); in both we found a distinction based on the genuinely independent, private choices which allocated such very different types of aid (tax deductions and university scholarship money that did not amount to substantial support of the university).  See Mueller, supra, at 399 ; Witters, supra, at 488 .  Our departure from this principle in Regan is not easily explained, but it is an isolated holding surrounded by otherwise unbroken adherence to the no-supplanting principle.  Long after Regan we have continued to find the supplement/supplant distinction, like the bar to substantial aid, to be an important consideration.  See Zobrest, supra, at 12; Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 228</citedDecision> ; c£ Witters, supra, at 487-488 (discussing rule against "direct subsidy”).  The weight that the plurality places on Regan is thus too much for it to bear.  See ante, at 815, n. 7.  Moreover, the apparent object of the Regan Court's concern was vindicating the principle that aid with fixed secular content was permissible, distinguishing it from the divertible testing aid in Levitt.  Regan, 444 U. S., at 661 -662 (citing Wolman, supra, at 263 ); c£ Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 .  The plurality provides no explanation for our continued reference to the principle of no-supplanting aid in subsequent cases, such as Zobrest and <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , which it finds trustworthy guides elsewhere in its discussion of the First Amendment.  See ante, at 822-823, 825, 827, 829-832.  Nor does the plurality explain why it places so much weight on Regan’s apparent departure from the no-supplanting rule while it ignores Regan’s core reasoning that the testing aid there was permissible because, in direct contrast to Levitt , the aid was not divertible.  1 do not read the plurality to question the prohibition on substantial aid.  The plurality challenges any rule based on the proportion of aid that a program provides to religious recipients, citing Witters and <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> .  See ante, at 812, n. 6.  I reject the plurality’s reasoning.  The plurality misreads Witters ; Justice Marshall, writing for the Court in Witters , emphasized that only a small amount of aid was provided to religious institutions, 474 U. S., at 488 , and no controlling majority rejected the importance of this fact.  The plurality also overreads <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 229</citedDecision> , which simply declined to adopt a rule based on proportionality.  Moreover, regardless of whether the proportion of aid actually provided to religious schools is relevant, we have never questioned our holding in Meek that substantial aid to religious schools is prohibited.  Adopting the plurality’s rule would permit practically any government aid to religion so long as it could be supplied on terms ostensibly comparable to the terms under which aid was provided to nonreligious recipients.  As a principle of constitutional sufficiency, the manipulability of this rule is breathtaking.  A legislature would merely need to state a secular objective in order to legalize massive aid to all religions, one religion, or even one sect, to which its largess could be directed through the easy exercise of crafting facially neutral terms under which to offer aid favoring that religious group.  Short of formally replacing the Establishment Clause, a more dependable key to the public fisc or a cleaner break with prior law would be difficult to imagine.  Indeed, the opportunity for an individual to choose not to have her religious school receive government aid is just what at least one of the respondents seeks here.
