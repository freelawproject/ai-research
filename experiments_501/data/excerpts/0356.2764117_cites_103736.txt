 Finally, it is contended that a recognition of the importance to the States of such powers demands that the requirements of full faith and credit be viewed in such a light as to permit an attack upon a divorce decree granted by a court of a sister State under the circumstances of this case even where the attack is initiated in a suit brought by the defendant in the original proceedings.  22 But the recognition of the importance of a State’s power to determine the incidents of basic social relationships into which its domiciliaries enter does not resolve the issues of this case. This is not a situation in which a State has merely sought to exert such power over a domiciliary.  This is, rather, a case involving inconsistent assertions of power by courts of two States of the Federal Union and thus presents considerations which go beyond the interests of local policy, however vital.  In resolving the issues here presented, we do not conceive it to be a part of our function to weigh the relative merits of the policies of Florida and Massachusetts with respect to divorce and related matters.  Nor do we understand the decisions of this Court to support the proposition that the obligation imposed by Article IV, § 1 of the Constitution and the Act of Congress passed thereunder amounts to something less than the duty to accord full faith and credit to decrees of *355 divorce entered by courts of sister States.  23 The full faith and credit clause is one of the provisions incorporated into the Constitution by its framers for the purpose of transforming an aggregation of independent, sovereign States into a nation.  24 If in its application local policy must at times be required to give way, such “is part of the price of our federal system.” Williams v. North Carolina, <citedDecision>317 U. S. 287, 302</citedDecision> (1942).  25 _ This is not to say that in no case may an area be recog- "] nized in which reasonable accommodations of interest | may properly be made.  But as this Court has heretofore { made clear, that area is of limited extent.  26 We believe that in permitting an attack on the Florida divorce decree which again put in issue petitioner’s Florida domicile and in refusing to recognize the validity of that decree, the Massachusetts courts have asserted a power which cannot be reconciled with the requirements of due faith and credit.  We believe that assurances that such a power will , be exercised sparingly and wisely render it no less repug- i nant to the constitutional commands.  _j It is one thing to recognize as permissible the judicial reexamination of findings of jurisdictional fact where such *356 findings have been made by a court of a sister State which has entered a divorce decree in ex parte proceedings.  27 It is quite another thing to hold that the vital rights and interests involved in divorce litigation may be held in suspense pending the scrutiny by courts of sister States of findings of jurisdictional fact made by a competent court in proceedings conducted in a manner consistent with the highest requirements of due process and in which the defendant has participated.

 Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32, 40 (1938).  And see Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 172, note 13 (1938).  See cases discussed supra. We, of course, intimate no opinion as to the scope of Congressional power to legislate under Article IV, § 1 of the Constitution.  See note 1 supra. Justices Brewer, Shiras, and Peckham dissented.  Mr. Justice Holmes took no part in the case. Thus, in the Andrews case, before the divorce decree was entered by the South Dakota court, the defendant withdrew her appearance in accordance with a consent agreement.  See note 14 supra. But cf. Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U. S. 226, 230 (1945).  Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32, 40 (1938); Williams v. North Carolina, <citedDecision>317 U. S. 287, 294</citedDecision> (1942).  Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U. S. 268, 276-277 (1935); Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, 320 U. S. 430, 439 (1943).  But we may well doubt that the judgment which we herein announce will amount to substantial interference with state policy with respect to divorce.  Many States which have had occasion to consider the matter have already recognized the impropriety of permitting a collateral attack on an out-of-state divorce decree where the defendant appeared and participated in the divorce proceedings.  See, e. g., Norris v. Norris, 200 Minn. 246 , 273 N. W. 708 (1937); Miller v. Miller, 65 N. Y. S. 2d 696 (1946), affirmed 271 App. Div. 974 , 67 N. Y. S. 2d 379 (1947); Cole v. Cole, 96 N. J.

 I cannot bring myself to believe that the Full Faith and Credit Clause gave to the few States which offer bargain-counter divorces constitutional power to control the social policy governing domestic relations of the many States which do not.  [This is also a dissent to Coe v. Coe, post, p. 378.] Nor do I regard Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32 , as contrary authority.  That case did not depend for its result on the fact that there had been an adjudication of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the divorce enforced, inasmuch as this Court found that the State granting the divorce was in fact that of the domicile.  305 U. S. at 41.  Moreover this Court’s citation therein of Andrews v. Andrews, *359 supra, indicates an absence of intention to overrule the holding of that case that opportunity to litigate the issue of domicile does not foreclose inquiry as to the true facts.  Andrews v. Andrews has since been cited with respect, as recently as Williams v. North Carolina, <citedDecision>317 U. S. 287, 309, 320, n. 7</citedDecision> , and 325 U. S. 226, 229, 240, 242 .  Compare the English laws providing for a King’s Proctor to represent the interests of the Crown in divorce proceedings.  Sections 5-7, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1860, 23 & 24 Vict., c. 144; § 1, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1873, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 31; § 181, The Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, 15 & 16 Geo. 5, c. 49, 9 Halsbury’s Statutes of England 393-94.  Rev. L. 1835, c. 76: § 39.  “When any inhabitant of this state shall go into any other state or country, in order to obtain a divorce for any cause, which had occurred here, and whilst the parties resided here, or for any cause, which would not authorize a divorce, by the laws of this state, a divorce so obtained shall be of no force or effect in this state.” § 40.  “In all other cases, a divorce decreed in any other state or country, according to the law of the place, by a court having jurisdiction of the cause and of both of the parties, shall be valid and effectual in this state.” See note 13, infra.  Del. Rev. Code, c. 86, § 29 (1935).

 Prob. 302; cf. Bergeson, The Divorce Mill Advertises, id. at 348.  Quaere, whether today’s decision applies to ex parte Nevada decrees by default, where the defendant later files a general appearance and the record is made to show jurisdiction nunc pro tunc.  Nev. Comp. Laws (1931-1941 Supp.) § 9488.  It is by no means clear that the issue before the Massachusetts courts in either of these cases was or could have been litigated in Florida or Nevada.  All that the Florida or Nevada courts could have determined was whether the jurisdictional requisites of State law and of the due process clause of the Constitution were met. And if a direct attack on these decrees had been made in this Court, all *368 that we could have decided would have been the due process point.  A divorce may satisfy due process requirements, and be valid where rendered, and still lack the jurisdictional requisites for full faith and credit to be mandatory.  Compare Williams v. North Carolina, <citedDecision>317 U. S. 287, 307</citedDecision> (concurring opinion), with Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U. S. 226 .  This is true even though the Florida and Nevada courts appear to characterize the jurisdictional prerequisites under their respective laws as domicile, Wade v. Wade, 93 Fla. 1004, 1007 ; Latterner v. Latterner, 51 Nev. 285 ; since we may be unwilling to apply as loose a test of “domicile,” in determining whether extrastate enforcement is mandatory, as those States might properly choose to use in determining what divorces might be granted and effective within their own borders.  Thus, at no point in the proceedings in Florida or Nevada in the instant cases was there an opportunity to litigate whether Mrs. Sherrer or Mr. Coe had acquired Florida or Nevada domicile, respectively, sufficient to entitle their divorces to extraterritorial recognition.  North Carolina appears to be the only other State allowing divorce on less than a year’s residence, but it does not allow divorce for many of the usual causes.  The Williams cases attest that its laws are not lax.  The easier it is made for those who through affluence are able to exercise disproportionately large influence on legislation, to obtain migratory divorces, the less likely it is that the divorce laws of their home States will be liberalized, insofar as that is deemed desirable, so as to affect all. See Groves, Migratory Divorces, 2 Law & Con-temp.  Prob. 293, 298.
