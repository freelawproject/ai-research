92291,88699,Osborne v. Mobile,yes,"In view of the course of decisions which have been made since that time, it is very certain that such an ordinance would now be regarded as repugnant to the power conferred upon Congress to regulate commerce among the several States.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Osborne v. Mobile's holding would now be considered unconstitutional and repugnant to Congress's commerce power, effectively overruling it."

The Western Union Telegraph Company, 96 U.S. 1, we held that it was not only the right, but the duty of Congress to take care that intercourse among the States and the transmission of intelligence between them be not obstructed or unnecessarily incumbered by state legislation","The Acting Decision cites and relies on this case as valid precedent to support its reasoning, rather than overruling it."
92291,90600,Telegraph Co. v. Texas,no,"In Western Union Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U.S. 460, we decided that a State cannot lay a tax on the interstate business of a telegraph company, as it is interstate commerce",The Acting Decision cites and follows this case's precedent rather than overruling it.

Pennsylvania, 122 U.S. 326",The Acting Decision cites and follows this case's precedent rather than overruling it.

Burlington, as overruled in the particular referred to, by later cases in this court. See 1 Dillon's Mun.

Britton, it appeared that a police jury... was prohibited by statute from contracting any debt or pecuniary liability without fully providing in the ordinance creating the debt the means of paying the principal and interest of the debt so contracted.",The Acting Decision cites and relies on Police Jury v. Britton as supporting precedent rather than overruling it.
93904,93354,Roberts v. Lewis (1892),no,"This certificate distinctly presents for decision the question (argued, but not decided, when this case was before this court at a former term, reported in 144 U.

Little (1881),yes,"this court is of opinion that the sound construction of this will, as to the extent of the power conferred on the widow, is in accordance with the conclusion of the state court, and not with the former decision of this court, which must, therefore, be considered as overruled","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Giles v. Little is overruled, using clear language of overruling"
91306,88061,Texas v. White (1869),yes,"The position there taken that the legislature of Texas, while the State was owner of the bonds, could limit their negotiability by an act of legislation, of which all subsequent purchasers were charged with notice, although the bonds on their face were payable to bearer, must be regarded as overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that this aspect of Texas v.

91306,88994,Vermilye & Co. v. Adams Express Co. (1875),no,"We have not quoted the language from the opinion in that case with any view of affirming it. It may admit of grave doubt whether such bonds, redeemable but not payable at a certain day, except at the option of the government, do become overdue in the sense of being dishonored if not paid or redeemed on that day.","While the Acting Decision questions and expresses doubt about aspects of Vermilye, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it."

Texas, 20 Wall. 72",The Acting Decision cites and discusses this case but does not take any explicit or implicit negative actions to overrule it.
91306,89668,Cromwell v. County of Sac (1878),no,"To hold otherwise, said this court in Cromwell v. County of Sac, 96 U.

92059,91368,Poindexter v. Greenhow,yes,"This conveys the intimation, that where the defendants who are sued as officers of the State, have not a real, but merely a nominal interest in the controversy, the State appearing to be the real defendant, and therefore an indispensable party, if the jurisdiction does not fail for want of power over the parties, it does fail, as to the nominal defendants, for want of a suitable subject matter.","The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Poindexter's interpretation of state officer suits, holding that suits against state officers acting in their official capacity are effectively suits against the state itself."
92059,91371,Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad,yes,"And now it is adjudged, in the cases before us, that a suit merely against state officers to enjoin them from bringing actions against tax-payers who have previously tendered tax-receivable coupons is a suit against the State.","The Lead Opinion explicitly rejects Allen's holding that suits against state officers to enjoin tax collection were not suits against the state, establishing a new contrary rule."
92059,88673,Davis v. Gray,no,"Making a state officer a party does not make the State a party, although her law may have prompted his action and the State may stand behind him as the real party in interest.","While the Lead Opinion discusses Davis v. Gray, it does not overrule it but rather distinguishes and limits its application."
92059,87371,Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON,no,"This view was reiterated by this court in Kentucky v.

Lee,no,"There are many cases — indeed, they are of frequent occurrence — where officers of the State, acting under legislation in conflict with the Constitution and laws of the United States — may be restrained by the Federal courts","The Lead Opinion distinguishes Lee rather than overruling it, preserving its core holding about suits against officers acting unconstitutionally."
92059,85451,Osborn v. Bank of United States,yes,"But what was said by Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, supra, must be taken in connection with its immediate context... This conveys the intimation, that where the defendants who are sued as officers of the State, have not a real, but merely a nominal interest in the controversy, the State appearing to be the real defendant, and therefore an indispensable party, if the jurisdiction does not fail for want of power over the parties, it does fail, as to the nominal defendants, for want of a suitable subject matter.","The Lead Opinion explicitly rejects Osborn's rule about state officer suits, holding that the mere naming of state officers as defendants does not avoid the 11th Amendment when the state is the real party in interest."
98124,96356,Rogers v. Peck,no,"Due process of law, this court has held, does not require the State to adopt any particular form of procedure, so long as it appears that the accused has had sufficient notice of the accusation and an adequate opportunity to defend himself in the prosecution. Rogers v. Peck, 199 U. S. 425, 435","The Acting Decision cites Rogers v. Peck as supporting authority for its position on due process requirements. The citation is used to reinforce the court's argument, not to overrule it."
98124,94455,Crain v. United States,yes,"Holding this view, notwithstanding our reluctance to overrule former decisions of this court, we now are constrained to hold that the technical enforcement of formal rights in criminal procedure sustained in the Crain Case is no longer required in the prosecution of offenses under present systems of law, and so far as that case is not in accord with the views herein expressed it is necessarily overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that it is overruling Crain v. United States, using clear language that constitutes an Explicit Negative Action."
101368,92485,Friedlander v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co. (1889),yes,We think that the Friedlander case should be overruled so far as it supports such an exception and that the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Friedlander's holding that an employer is not liable for an agent's fraudulent acts done for the agent's own benefit rather than the employer's benefit.
101368,4920593,Roy & Roy v. Northern Pacific Railway Co. (1906),no,"To this extent the case has been often cited and followed. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Nat. Park Bk., 188 Ala. 109, 119; Roy & Roy v. Northern Pacific Ry Co., 42 Wash. 572, 576",The Acting Decision merely cites Roy & Roy as following a narrow aspect of Friedlander regarding bills of lading. It does not overrule this decision.
101368,5712559,Planters' Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants' National Bank (1887),no,"The state courts, including those of Georgia where the cause of action arose, have very generally reached the opposite conclusion, holding that the liability of the principal for the false statement or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope of his authority is unaffected by his secret purpose or motives. Planters' Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants' Nat'l Bank, 78 Ga. 574",The Acting Decision cites Planters' Rice-Mill Co. approvingly as supporting its position. There is no overruling.
101368,3931352,Havens v.

98917,97893,Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell,no,"But this court, when the question came before it in Bauer v. O'Donnell, 229 U. S. 1, rejecting plausible argument and adhering to the language of the statute from which all patent right is derived, refused to give such a construction to the act of Congress","The Acting Decision cites Bauer v. O'Donnell approvingly and relies on its reasoning to support its conclusion. Far from overruling it, the court uses it as precedent."
98917,97584,Henry v. A. B. Dick Co.,yes,"It is obvious that the conclusions arrived at in this opinion are such that the decision in Henry v. Dick Co., 224 U.

Tyson had revealed its defects, political and social; and the benefits expected to flow from the rule did not accrue. Persistence of state courts in their own opinions on questions of common law prevented uniformity","While the Acting Decision discusses this case as an example of problems with Swift v. Tyson doctrine, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule this decision itself"

S. 501, the latter cannot survive.","While the Acting Decision discusses Pollock, it does not overrule it. The case is cited for historical context and discussion of judicial compensation, but there is no explicit or implicit overruling."
103214,3487033,Gordy v. Dennis,no,"The opinion claims no support from any state court decision. The one it cites, footnote 8, that of the Maryland Court of Appeals in Gordy v. Dennis, 5 A. 2d 69, held that under a clause in the Constitution of Maryland like that in Art. III, § 1, the compensation of state judges may not be taxed.","The Acting Decision merely references Gordy v. Dennis as a state court decision and does not overrule it, as it is a state court decision that federal courts cannot overrule."

S. 501, the latter cannot survive.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Miles v. Graham 'cannot survive,' which constitutes an explicit overruling of the case."

Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431, that 'the power to tax involves the power to destroy.'",The Acting Decision cites M'Culloch only for its principle about taxation and does not overrule it.

102164,3568583,"Reno Smelting, Milling & Reduction Works v. Stevenson",no,"It was in virtue of this maxim of the common law that the supreme court of Nevada, in Reno Smelting Works v. Stevenson, 20 Nev. 269; 21 Pac. 317, in a well reasoned opinion, held that the common law doctrine of riparian rights was unsuited to conditions prevailing in the arid land states",The Acting Decision cites this case approvingly as an example of courts adapting common law principles.

103172,88308,Collector v. Day,yes,"Collector v. Day, supra, and New York ex rel. Rogers v.

103172,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt,no,The determination in the Gerhardt case that the federal income tax imposed on the employees of the Port Authority was not a burden on the Port Authority made it unnecessary to consider whether the Authority itself was immune from federal taxation,"The Acting Decision relies on and affirms the Gerhardt case's reasoning about tax immunity, using it as a foundation for its current ruling."
103172,85272,M'culloch v. State of Maryland,no,These were the determining considerations that led the great Chief Justice to strike down the Maryland statute as an unambiguous measure of discrimination against the use by the United States of the Bank of the United States as one of its instruments of government.,"The Acting Decision discusses McCulloch as foundational precedent, refining its interpretation but not overruling it."
103172,100771,Metcalf & Eddy v.

103292,102488,Helvering v.

103292,101552,May v. Heiner,no,That decision is indistinguishable in principle from the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases and the instant cases,"While the Acting Decision discusses May v. Heiner, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it. The discussion is primarily historical and analytical."
103292,1477043,Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Schwarz,no,I have been able to find only one case decided contra: Commissioner v. Schwarz,"While mentioned in the dissenting opinion, the Acting Decision does not overrule this case. It is merely cited as an example of contrary precedent."

St. Louis Union Trust Co.,yes,We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine,"The Acting Decision explicitly rejects the St. Louis Trust cases, which includes Becker as it was decided the same day and created the same distinctions that the Acting Decision finds untenable."
103290,102529,Colgate v. Harvey (1935),yes,"In view of our conclusions, we look upon the decision in that case as repugnant to the line of reasoning adopted here. As a consequence, Colgate v. Harvey must be and is overruled.","The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Colgate v. Harvey is overruled, using clear overruling language."

103555,90350,Dietzsch v. Huidekoper,yes,"The Court today lays aside these cases and their reasoning. We find, therefore, that apart from Congressional authorization, only one 'exception' has been imbedded in § 265 by judicial construction, to wit, the res cases.","The Lead Opinion explicitly rejects the reasoning and holding of this case, stating that only the res exception remains valid.

103493,95793,United States v. Lynah,yes,"And we think that, so far as it sanctions such a principle, it is in irreconcilable conflict with our later decisions and cannot be considered as expressing the law.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Lynah's principle regarding compensation for riparian property damage is 'irreconcilable' with later decisions and 'cannot be considered as expressing the law.'

103927,101292,Plamals v. S. S. 'Pinar Del Rio',yes,"So far as this statement supports these assumptions, it is disapproved.

York, 326 U.S. 99, 108-109, that a right without a remedy is no right at all for purposes of enforcement by a diversity suit in a federal court sitting in the state.",The Acting Decision cites and relies on the Cited Decision's principle rather than overruling it.
104380,97674,David Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club of America,yes,"Cases like Lupton's Sons Co. v.

S. 226 (1945), the finding of the requisite jurisdictional facts was made in proceedings in which the defendant appeared and participated.",The Acting Decision distinguishes itself from the Cited Decision rather than overruling it. It uses the Cited Decision as a reference point to explain how the current case differs.
2764117,103096,Stoll v. Gottlieb (1938),no,"Thus in Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 172 (1938), it was said: 'Courts to determine the rights of parties are an integral part of our system of government...'","The Acting Decision cites and relies upon the Cited Decision's reasoning to support its own conclusion, showing it remains good law."

107679,102317,McNally v. Hill (1934),yes,We overrule McNally and hold that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is 'in custody' under any one of them for purposes of § 2241 (c)(3).,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules McNally, finding that its interpretation of the habeas corpus statute was unnecessarily narrow and inconsistent with the purposes of the writ."
107679,106507,Jones v. Cunningham (1963),no,"[The writ] is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose — the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty.",The Acting Decision cites Jones approvingly and uses it to support overruling McNally.
107679,100122,Moore v. Dempsey (1923),no,"To that extent, it also undermines Moore v. Dempsey, supra, and is inconsistent with subsequent decisions of this Court which have reaffirmed Moore.",The Acting Decision cites Moore positively and uses it as precedent to support overruling McNally.
107679,106548,Fay v. Noia (1963),no,"Calendar congestion, considerations of federalism, see, e.g., Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S., at 415-420",The Acting Decision cites Fay as supporting precedent and does not take any negative actions against it.
107606,104585,Shapiro v. United States,no,"We think that neither Shapiro nor the cases upon which it relied are applicable here... Each of the three principal elements of the doctrine, as it is described in Shapiro, is absent from this situation.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Shapiro rather than overrules it, explaining why the required records doctrine from Shapiro does not apply to the present case."
107606,105090,United States v. Kahriger,yes,We conclude that nothing in the Court's opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner's assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Kahriger in its majority opinion, stating that its reasoning about the Fifth Amendment privilege is no longer valid."
107606,101083,United States v. Sullivan,no,"Unlike the income tax return in question in United States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259, every portion of these requirements had the direct and unmistakable consequence of incriminating petitioner","The Acting Decision distinguishes Sullivan rather than overrules it, explaining how the present case differs from Sullivan's circumstances."
107606,105280,Lewis v. United States,yes,We conclude that nothing in the Court's opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner's assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Lewis in its majority opinion, rejecting its reasoning about the Fifth Amendment privilege."
107606,107110,Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board,no,"Should not this Court, especially in view of its recent decision in Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 382 U. S. 70 (1965), overrule United States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22 (1953), and Lewis v. United States, 348 U. S. 419 (1955)?",The Acting Decision cites Albertson as supporting precedent rather than overruling it. Albertson is used to help justify overruling other cases.
107606,106864,Murphy v. Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor,no,"It is suggested that these restrictions might be similar to those imposed by the Court in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U. S. 52.",The Acting Decision discusses Murphy's principles but does not overrule it. Murphy is referenced as potentially useful precedent.
107980,107685,Duncan v. Louisiana,no,"Only last Term we found that the right to trial by jury in criminal cases was 'fundamental to the American scheme of justice,' Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149 (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.",The Acting Decision cites Duncan approvingly and builds upon its precedent rather than overruling it.
107980,102879,Palko v. Connecticut,yes,"Insofar as it is inconsistent with this holding, Palko v. Connecticut is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Palko through clear language stating that it is overruled, constituting an Explicit Negative Action."
107980,94515,United States v. Ball,no,"This case is totally indistinguishable. Petitioner was acquitted of larceny. He has, under Green, a valid double jeopardy plea which he cannot be forced to waive.",The Acting Decision relies on and applies Ball's precedent rather than overruling it.
107980,107730,Sibron v. New York,no,"In Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968), we held that a criminal case did not become moot upon the expiration of the sentence imposed.",The Acting Decision cites Sibron approvingly and builds upon its precedent rather than overruling it.

Hogan,no,"In an increasing number of cases, the Court 'has rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights....' Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1964)",The Acting Decision cites Malloy approvingly and builds upon its precedent rather than overruling it.
107965,104914,Dennis v. United States (1951),no,"But in Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, we opened wide the door, distorting the 'clear and present danger' test beyond recognition.","While the Acting Decision criticizes Dennis, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it. The criticism focuses on how Dennis interpreted the 'clear and present danger' test, but does not invalidate the decision itself."
107965,102821,Herndon v. Lowry (1937),no,"The Court in Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U.

107965,99321,Frohwerk v. United States (1919),no,"Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U. S. 204, also authored by Mr. Justice Holmes, involved prosecution and punishment for publication of articles very critical of the war effort in World War I.","While the Acting Decision discusses Frohwerk historically, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it."

S. 533, held that a State in an apportionment of state representatives and senators among districts and counties could not deprive voters in the more populous counties of their proportionate share of representatives and senators.","The Acting Decision relies on and reinforces Reynolds v. Sims rather than overruling it, using it as precedent to support its reasoning about voter equality."
107919,104593,MacDougall v. Green (1948),yes,We have said enough to indicate why MacDougall v. Green is out of line with our recent apportionment cases... MacDougall v. Green is overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules MacDougall v. Green, stating it directly in the Lead Opinion."
107919,107449,Dusch v. Davis (1967),no,"Dusch v. Davis, 387 U. S. 112, is not relevant to the problem of this case.","The Acting Decision merely distinguishes Dusch v. Davis as irrelevant to the current case, but does not overrule it."
107919,104311,Colegrove v. Green (1946),no,"While the majority cited Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, as their authority for denying relief and while a few who took part in Colegrove put this type of question in the 'political' as distinguished from the 'justiciable' category, that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr","While the Acting Decision notes that Baker v. Carr resolved issues differently than Colegrove, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule Colegrove."
107919,106366,Baker v. Carr (1962),no,"that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 202. When a State makes classifications of voters which favor residents of some counties over residents of other counties, a justiciable controversy is presented.",The Acting Decision cites Baker v. Carr approvingly and relies on its precedent rather than overruling it.
107973,1178568,"Adkins v. Lear, Inc.",yes,"We are satisfied that Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., supra, itself the product of a clouded history, should no longer be regarded as sound law with respect to its 'estoppel' holding, and that holding is now overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the California Supreme Court's decision in Adkins by rejecting the licensee estoppel doctrine it relied upon.
107973,106758,"Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc.",no,"We granted certiorari in the present case, 391 U. S. 912, to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule in the light of our recent decisions emphasizing the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection.

S. 234 (1964).",The Acting Decision cites Compco approvingly and relies on it to support its reasoning. No overruling language is present.

107973,106757,"Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.",no,"We granted certiorari in the present case, 391 U. S. 912, to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule in the light of our recent decisions emphasizing the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection.

S. 234 (1964).",The Acting Decision cites Stiffel approvingly and relies on it to support its reasoning. No overruling language is present.
107973,100520,Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. v. Formica Insulation Co.,no,"The estoppel rule was first stringently limited in a situation in which the patentee's equities were far more compelling than those presented in the typical licensing arrangement. Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. v. Formica Insulation Co., 266 U. S. 342 (1924)",The Acting Decision discusses Formica as part of the historical development of the doctrine but does not overrule it.
107973,104194,Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Manufacturing Co.,no,"In Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Manufacturing Co., 326 U. S. 249 (1945), this Court adopted a position similar to the Seventh Circuit's, undermining the basis of patent estoppel even more than Formica had done.",The Acting Decision discusses Scott Paper approvingly as part of the historical erosion of the estoppel doctrine. No overruling language is present.
107973,103320,McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,no,"In McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430 (1940), the Court, while recognizing it had jurisdiction to determine whether a New York tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, refused to consider whether the tax was a prohibited impost or duty on imports and exports",The Acting Decision cites McGoldrick only as procedural precedent in Justice White's concurrence. No overruling language is present.
107973,104256,Wilson v. Cook,no,"Wilson v. Cook, 327 U. S. 474 (1946), reached a similar conclusion.",The Acting Decision cites Wilson only as procedural precedent in Justice White's concurrence. No overruling language is present.
107973,106930,Brulotte v. Thys Co.,no,"Cf. Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U. S. 29, 31 (1964)",The Acting Decision only references Brulotte in passing in Justice White's concurrence. No overruling language is present.
107979,104769,United States v. Rabinowitz,yes,"It is time, for the reasons we have stated, to hold that on their own facts, and insofar as the principles they stand for are inconsistent with those that we have endorsed today, they are no longer to be followed.",The Court explicitly overrules Rabinowitz's principle that warrantless searches incident to arrest may extend to areas under the arrestee's control beyond immediate reach.
107979,106641,Ker v. California,no,"Decisions of this Court since Rabinowitz have applied the abstract doctrine of that case to various factual situations with divergent results. Compare Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 42",The case is only cited as an example of how Rabinowitz was applied; it is not overruled.
107979,106021,Abel v. United States,no,"Decisions of this Court since Rabinowitz have applied the abstract doctrine of that case to various factual situations with divergent results. Compare [...] Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217",The case is only referenced as an example of prior applications of Rabinowitz; it is not overruled.
107979,98094,Weeks v. United States,no,Approval of a warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest seems first to have been articulated by the Court in 1914 as dictum in Weeks v. United States,The case is cited for historical context and its principles are actually reinforced rather than overruled.
107979,104576,Trupiano v. United States,no,"Less than two years later, however, the Court returned to the Harris rule in United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950), where the Court held that the reasonableness of a search does not depend upon the practicability of obtaining a search warrant, and that the fact of a valid arrest is relevant to reasonableness. Trupiano was pro tanto overruled.","While the passage mentions Trupiano was previously overruled by Rabinowitz, the Acting Decision does not itself overrule Trupiano. In fact, it appears to revive some of Trupiano's principles."
107979,101164,Marron v. United States,no,"That the Marron opinion did not mean all that it seemed to say became evident, however, a few years later in Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States",The case is discussed historically but is not overruled by the Acting Decision.

S. 1, we emphasized that 'the police must, whenever practicable, obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure'",The case is cited approvingly and its principles are reinforced rather than overruled.
107979,100567,Carroll v. United States,no,"That statement made no reference to any right to search the place where an arrest occurs, but was limited to a right to search the 'person.' Eleven years later the case of Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, brought the following embellishment of the Weeks statement",The case is discussed as historical context but is not overruled.
107979,104422,Harris v. United States,yes,"It is time, for the reasons we have stated, to hold that on their own facts, and insofar as the principles they stand for are inconsistent with those that we have endorsed today, they are no longer to be followed.","The Court explicitly overrules Harris along with Rabinowitz, as their principles regarding the scope of searches incident to arrest are found to be inconsistent with the Fourth Amendment."
108114,105687,Hoag v. New Jersey,yes,"But in the present case Missouri did not have 'the widest latitude' because Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969), decided after Hoag, held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee that no person shall 'be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb' is enforceable against the States","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Hoag's holding that states had wide latitude in allowing separate prosecutions, by incorporating double jeopardy protections against states through the Fifth Amendment"
108114,105860,Abbate v. United States,no,"The two prosecutions, the first for the robbery of Knight and the second for the robbery of Roberts, grew out of one criminal episode, and therefore I think it clear on the facts of this case that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited Missouri from prosecuting petitioner for each robbery at a different trial. Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 196-201 (1959) (separate opinion)",The Acting Decision cites Abbate as supporting authority rather than overruling it
108114,107978,North Carolina v. Pearce,no,"North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), accorded fully retroactive effect to that holding",The Acting Decision cites Pearce as supporting authority for retroactive application of double jeopardy protections rather than overruling it

S. 784, the Court held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment",The Acting Decision relies on and applies Benton's holding rather than overruling it
108114,105594,Green v. United States,no,"The Double Jeopardy Clause is a guarantee 'that the State with all its resources and power [shall] not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity . . . .' Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187 (1957)",The Acting Decision cites and builds upon Green's interpretation of double jeopardy protections rather than overruling it
108154,106432,Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson,yes,"Having concluded that Sinclair was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity, we overrule that decision and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.",The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Sinclair is overruled. The majority opinion directly and unequivocally overrules the Cited Decision.
108154,105511,Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.,no,"From the time Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills was decided, we have frequently found it necessary to consider various substantive and procedural aspects of federal labor contract law... Lincoln Mills held generally that 'the substantive law to apply in suits under § 301 (a) is federal law'",The Acting Decision relies on and affirms Lincoln Mills rather than overruling it. The decision is cited as foundational precedent.
108154,107655,Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735,no,"Subsequent to the decision in Sinclair, we held in Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge 735 that § 301 (a) suits initially brought in state courts may be removed to the designated federal forum under the federal question removal jurisdiction",The Acting Decision cites Avco as valid precedent and builds upon it rather than overruling it. The decision is discussed as creating a need to reconsider Sinclair.
108154,103292,Helvering v. Hallock,no,"Nevertheless, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote for the Court, '[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable'",The Acting Decision cites Helvering positively as precedent regarding stare decisis principles. There is no indication of overruling.
108164,105594,Green v. United States (1957),no,There is no relevant factual distinction between this case and Green v. United States. [...] The rationale of the Green holding applies here.,The Acting Decision affirms and applies Green rather than overruling it.
108164,1276937,Price v. State (1968),yes,"We granted the writ, 395 U. S. 975 (1969), and now reverse.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses this lower court decision.
108164,5726506,Brantley v. Georgia (1910),yes,"While the Brantley holding may have had some vitality at the time the Georgia courts rendered their decisions in this case, it is no longer a viable authority and must now be deemed to have been overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Brantley is overruled.
108164,94515,United States v. Ball (1896),no,The continuing jeopardy principle implicit in the Ball case would allow petitioner's retrial for voluntary manslaughter after his first conviction for that offense had been reversed.,The Acting Decision affirms and applies Ball's principles rather than overruling them.
108164,1395638,Price v. State (1968),no,The Georgia Supreme Court then transferred the case to the Court of Appeals of Georgia,This procedural decision is merely referenced and not overruled in the Acting Decision.
108164,8887067,United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins,no,"See United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 913 (1966)",The case is cited supportively rather than being overruled.
108350,103548,Reitz v. Mealey,yes,We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of Kesler and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than one of frustration.,"The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Reitz, stating that its doctrine was 'aberrational' and inconsistent with Supremacy Clause principles."
108350,1198518,Schecter v. Killingsworth,no,The Arizona court has consistently adhered to this construction of its legislation,"The Acting Decision cites Schecter as authoritative precedent for understanding Arizona law's purpose, without overruling it."
108350,288328,Perez v. Campbell,no,"The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the same two decisions.",The Acting Decision discusses this lower court decision but does not overrule it. It simply describes the procedural history.
108350,106365,Kesler v. Department of Public Safety of Utah,yes,We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of Kesler and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than one of frustration.,"The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Kesler, rejecting its doctrine as inconsistent with Supremacy Clause principles."
108350,100616,Lewis v. Roberts,no,"This is long after the Bankruptcy Act was placed on the books and, indeed, long after this Court's decision in Lewis v. Roberts, 267 U. S. 467 (1925), that a personal injury judgment is a provable claim in bankruptcy.","The Acting Decision cites Lewis v. Roberts as valid precedent for establishing that personal injury judgments are provable claims in bankruptcy, without overruling it."
108362,90728,United States v. Harris,no,"The constitutionality of § 1985 (3) might once have appeared to have been settled adversely by United States v. Harris... The Court in those cases, however, followed a severability rule that required invalidation of an entire statute if any part of it was unconstitutionally overbroad... This Court has long since firmly rejected that rule","While the Acting Decision discusses Harris, it does not overrule it. Rather, it distinguishes Harris by noting that it relied on an outdated severability rule that has since been rejected. The Acting Decision finds a way to uphold § 1985(3) without needing to overrule Harris."
108362,107201,United States v. Guest,no,"Our cases have firmly established that the right of interstate travel is constitutionally protected, does not necessarily rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, and is assertible against private as well as governmental interference. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 629-631; id., at 642-644 (concurring opinion); United States v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745, 757-760",The Acting Decision cites Guest approvingly multiple times as supporting precedent. There is no indication of overruling.
108362,107748,Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.,no,"By the Thirteenth Amendment, we committed ourselves as a Nation to the proposition that the former slaves and their descendants should be forever free. To keep that promise, 'Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.' Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.",The Acting Decision cites Jones positively as supporting precedent for Congress's power under the Thirteenth Amendment. There is no indication of overruling.
108362,96885,Twining v. New Jersey,no,The 'right to pass freely from State to State' has been explicitly recognized as 'among the rights and privileges of National citizenship.' Twining v. New Jersey,The Acting Decision cites Twining positively as supporting precedent for the right of interstate travel. There is no indication of overruling.
108362,104918,Collins v. Hardyman,yes,"Whether or not Collins v. Hardyman was correctly decided on its own facts is a question with which we need not here be concerned. But it is clear, in the light of the evolution of decisional law in the years that have passed since that case was decided, that many of the constitutional problems there perceived simply do not exist. Little reason remains, therefore, not to accord to the words of the statute their apparent meaning.","The Acting Decision explicitly rejects Collins' interpretation of § 1985(3) as requiring state action, finding that the constitutional concerns that drove that interpretation no longer exist. This represents an Implicit Negative Action that effectively overrules Collins' core holding."
108721,102839,Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co.,no,"A state legislature, in the enactment of laws, has the widest possible latitude within the limits of the Constitution... Only by faithful adherence to this guiding principle of judicial review of legislation is it possible to preserve to the legislative branch its rightful independence and its ability to function.",The Acting Decision cites Carmichael approvingly to support its reasoning about legislative discretion in taxation. There is no indication of overruling.
108721,2042261,Lake Shore Auto Parts Co. v. Korzen,no,The Illinois Supreme Court held that Art. IX-A did not affect all forms of real and personal property taxes but only personal property taxes on individuals,The Acting Decision discusses but does not overrule this case. It is merely providing background on the lower court's decision.
108721,103290,Madden v. Kentucky Ex Rel. Commissioner,no,"In taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification",The Acting Decision cites Madden positively to support its reasoning about legislative discretion in taxation. No overruling.
108721,97378,Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.,no,"The Flint case involved a federal tax upon the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity... These advantages are obvious, and have led to the formation of such companies in nearly all branches of trade.",The Acting Decision discusses Flint approvingly and uses its reasoning to support the current decision. No overruling.
108721,101317,Quaker City Cab Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,yes,Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania is only a relic of a bygone era. We cannot follow it and stay within the narrow confines of judicial review,"The Acting Decision explicitly states it will not follow Quaker City Cab and calls it a 'relic', effectively overruling it through Explicit Negative Action."
108186,107685,Duncan v. Louisiana,no,"Tempering the rigor of Duncan should be done forthrightly, by facing up to the fact that at least in this area the 'incorporation' doctrine does not fit well with our federal structure, and by the same token that Duncan was wrongly decided.","While the Acting Decision criticizes Duncan and suggests it was wrongly decided, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it. The Court continues to work within Duncan's framework while expressing disagreement with its reasoning."
108186,94866,Thompson v. Utah,yes,"The historical argument by which the Court undertakes to justify its view that the Sixth Amendment does not require 12-member juries is, in my opinion, much too thin to mask the true thrust of this decision... The necessary consequence of this decision is that 12-member juries are not constitutionally required in federal criminal trials either.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Thompson's holding that the Sixth Amendment requires 12-person juries, finding that six-person juries are constitutionally adequate."
108186,95043,Capital Traction Co. v. Hof,no,"Similarly, cases interpreting the jury trial provisions of the Seventh Amendment generally leap from the fact that the jury possessed a certain feature at common law to the conclusion that that feature must have been preserved by the Amendment's simple reference to trial by 'jury.'","While the Acting Decision criticizes the reasoning in Capital Traction, it does not overrule its holdings. The case is merely cited as an example of historical interpretation."
108186,106862,Malloy v. Hogan,no,"Given Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964), I join that part of the Court's opinion in No. 927 relating to the Florida 'alibi' procedure.",The Acting Decision explicitly accepts and applies Malloy rather than overruling it.
108186,96270,Rassmussen v. United States,yes,"A ruling that the Sixth Amendment refers to a common-law jury was essential to the holding in Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U. S. 516 (1905), where the Court held invalid a conviction by a six-man jury in Alaska... The ruling was accepted at the Government's concession without discussion or citation.",The Acting Decision overrules Rassmussen's holding that the Sixth Amendment requires 12-person juries by finding that six-person juries are constitutionally adequate.
108186,92280,Callan v. Wilson,no,"It is to the distinction between 'petty' and 'serious' offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937); Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65 (1904); Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 552 (1888).",The Acting Decision cites Callan approvingly and builds upon its distinction between petty and serious offenses rather than overruling it.
108186,106641,Ker v. California,no,"In Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963), I noted in an opinion concurring in the result that: 'The rule [of 'incorporation'] is unwise because the States, with their differing law enforcement problems, should not be put in a constitutional strait jacket'",The Acting Decision merely references Ker in discussing incorporation doctrine but does not overrule it.
108186,102801,District of Columbia v. Clawans,no,"It is to the distinction between 'petty' and 'serious' offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937)",The Acting Decision cites Clawans approvingly and builds upon its distinction between petty and serious offenses rather than overruling it.
108186,107486,United States v. Wade,no,"Although I have disagreed with particular holdings like Gilbert v. California, supra, where the Court held that the States must arrange presence of counsel at lineups, see Mr. Justice White's separate opinion in United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 250 (1967), which I joined",The Acting Decision merely references Wade in discussing counsel at lineups but does not overrule it.
108889,101340,Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Baldridge (1928),yes,"The Liggett case, being a derelict in the stream of the law, is hereby overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Liggett using clear language. The court explains that Liggett belonged to outdated decisions that exalted substantive due process and was at war with both earlier and more recent constitutional views of legislative power.
108889,107235,Mills v. Alabama (1966),no,"Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214, involved the constitutionality of a state statute in effect making it a crime for a newspaper editor on election day to urge people to vote a certain way on the issues being submitted.",The Acting Decision only cites Mills as precedent when discussing the concept of finality in judgments. There is no overruling action taken against this decision.
108889,86449,Forgay v. Conrad (1848),no,The exceptions noted have a long lineage dating back to Mr. Chief Justice Taney's opinion in Forgay v. Conrad,The Acting Decision cites Forgay positively as established precedent regarding finality of judgments. There is no overruling action taken.
108889,104183,"Radio Station Wow, Inc. v. Johnson (1945)",no,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, writing for the Court in Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, 326 U. S. 120, 124, summarized the requirement by Congress that in appeals from federal district courts as well as in review of state court decisions the judgments be 'final'",The Acting Decision cites Radio Station WOW as valid precedent when discussing the finality requirement. There is no overruling action taken.
109514,321071,Nancy Dukes v. City of New Orleans (1974),yes,"The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.","The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals decision, finding that its equal protection analysis was incorrect."
109514,105546,Morey v. Doud (1957),yes,"Morey is, as appellee and the Court of Appeals' properly recognized, essentially indistinguishable from this case, but the decision so far departs from proper equal protection analysis in cases of exclusively economic regulation that it should be, and it is, overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Morey v. Doud is overruled due to its flawed equal protection analysis.
109514,105285,"Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc. (1955)",no,"Legislatures may implement their program step by step... in such economic areas, adopting regulations that only partially ameliorate a perceived evil and deferring complete elimination of the evil to future regulations. See, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 488-489 (1955).",The Acting Decision cites Williamson approvingly as valid precedent supporting its analysis.
109514,106576,Ferguson v. Skrupa (1963),no,Ferguson presented an analogous situation... We held that the exception of lawyers was not a denial of equal protection,The Acting Decision cites Ferguson positively as supporting precedent for its equal protection analysis.
109514,107256,Katzenbach v. Morgan (1966),no,The governing constitutional principle was stated in Katzenbach v. Morgan,The Acting Decision relies on Katzenbach as valid precedent establishing governing constitutional principles.
109346,108288,Durham v. United States,yes,"To the extent that Durham v. United States, 401 U. S. 481 (1971), may be inconsistent with this ruling, Durham is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Durham using clear language ('Durham is overruled'). While the overruling is qualified with 'to the extent that Durham may be inconsistent with this ruling,' this still constitutes an Explicit Negative Action against the Cited Decision."
108730,104590,Ahrens v. Clark,yes,"In view of these developments since Ahrens v. Clark, we can no longer view that decision as establishing an inflexible jurisdictional rule","The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Ahrens by stating it can no longer be viewed as establishing the jurisdictional rule it previously set, and proceeds to establish a new interpretation of the jurisdictional requirements."
108730,107824,Smith v. Hooey,no,"In Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969), we considered a speedy trial claim similar to the one presented in the case before us, and we held that a State which had lodged a detainer against a petitioner in another State must, on the prisoner's demand, 'make a diligent, good-faith effort' to bring the prisoner to trial.",The Acting Decision cites Smith v. Hooey as valid precedent and builds upon its holding rather than overruling it.
108730,107679,Peyton v. Rowe,no,"Our decision in Peyton v. Rowe discarded the prematurity doctrine, which had permitted a prisoner to attack on habeas corpus only his current confinement, and not confinement that would be imposed in the future, and opened the door to this action.",The Acting Decision relies on and extends Peyton v. Rowe rather than overruling it.
108730,91598,Ex Parte Royall,no,"It is true, as our Brother Rehnquist points out in dissent, that federal habeas corpus does not lie, absent 'special circumstances,' to adjudicate the merits of an affirmative defense to a state criminal charge prior to a judgment of conviction by a state court. Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 253 (1886).","While the dissent argues the majority implicitly rejects Royall, the Lead Opinion explicitly acknowledges and accepts Royall's holding, showing no intent to overrule it."
108730,108193,Nelson v. George,no,"In Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224, 228 n. 5 (1970), we adverted to, but reserved judgment on, the precise question at issue here.",The Acting Decision merely references Nelson v. George as having previously noted but not decided the issue at hand. There is no indication of overruling.
109570,1489061,Walker v. Hall,yes,We reverse.,"The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Walker v. Hall decision, which had sustained the constitutionality of the gender-based differential in Oklahoma's beer law."
109570,109235,Stanton v. Stanton,no,"In this case, too, 'Reed, we feel, is controlling...' Stanton v. Stanton",The Acting Decision relies on and follows Stanton rather than overruling it.
109570,108404,Reed v. Reed,no,Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that Reed emphasized that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are 'subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.',The Acting Decision uses Reed as controlling precedent and builds upon its principles.
109570,105152,Barrows v. Jackson,no,"See, e.g., Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249, 255, 257 (1953)",The Acting Decision cites Barrows as supporting precedent for standing doctrine.
109570,108497,Stanley v. Illinois,no,"See, e.g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 656 (1972)",The Acting Decision cites Stanley as supporting precedent for rejecting administrative convenience as sufficient justification for gender discrimination.
109570,109013,Kahn v. Shevin,no,"Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498 (1975), upholding the use of gender-based classifications, rested upon the Court's perception of the laudatory purposes of those laws",The Acting Decision distinguishes Kahn rather than overruling it.
109570,108781,Frontiero v. Richardson,no,"Hence, 'archaic and overbroad' generalizations, Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra, at 508, concerning the financial position of servicewomen, Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 689 n. 23",The Acting Decision builds upon Frontiero's principles rather than overruling them.
109570,108489,Eisenstadt v. Baird,no,"Indeed, the jus tertii question raised here is answered by our disposition of a like argument in Eisenstadt v. Baird",The Acting Decision relies on Eisenstadt as controlling precedent for standing analysis.
109570,109132,Schlesinger v. Ballard,no,"Hence, 'archaic and overbroad' generalizations, Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra, at 508",The Acting Decision cites and builds upon Schlesinger rather than overruling it.
109570,104606,Goesaert v. Cleary,yes,"Insofar as Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948), may be inconsistent, that decision is disapproved.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Goesaert is disapproved to the extent it is inconsistent with the current ruling, which constitutes an overruling."
109390,104216,Marsh v. Alabama,no,The Court today holds that the First Amendment poses no bar to a shopping center owner's prohibiting speech within his shopping center... while purporting to leave Marsh untouched,"The Acting Decision explicitly states it is not overruling Marsh, and distinguishes it from Logan Valley based on Marsh involving a company town with all attributes of a municipality"
109390,107692,"Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc.",yes,"Our conclusion is that the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive the Court's decision in the Lloyd case... if it was not clear before, that the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive the Court's decision in the Lloyd case.","The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Logan Valley is overruled, making clear that its rationale did not survive Lloyd and formally overruling it in this case"
109390,108592,Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner,no,"The Court's opinion then reviewed the Marsh case in detail, emphasized the similarities between the business block in Chickasaw, Ala., and the Logan Valley shopping center",The Acting Decision relies on and reinforces Lloyd rather than overruling it
109390,105389,National Labor Relations Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co.,no,"Under the Act the task of the Board, subject to review by the courts, is to resolve conflicts between § 7 rights and private property rights, and to seek a proper accommodation between the two",The Acting Decision cites Babcock & Wilcox as valid precedent for analyzing statutory rights under the NLRA
109390,108591,Central Hardware Co. v. National Labor Relations Board,no,In Central Hardware the Court was faced with solicitation by nonemployee union organizers on a parking lot of a retail store that was not part of a shopping center complex,The Acting Decision discusses Central Hardware as valid precedent and uses it to help explain the development of the law
109344,85534,Brown v. Maryland,no,"Although it was 'sufficient' in the context of Maryland's license tax on the right to sell imported goods to note that a tax imposed directly on imported goods which have not been acted upon in any way would clearly fall within the constitutional prohibition, that observation did not apply, as the foregoing analysis indicates, to a state tax which treated those same goods without regard to the fact of their foreign origin.","The Acting Decision reinterprets Brown but does not overrule it. Instead, it clarifies that Brown's holding was limited to discriminatory taxes on imports and did not extend to nondiscriminatory property taxes."
109344,88429,Low v. Austin,yes,"It follows from the foregoing that Low v. Austin was wrongly decided. That decision therefore must be, and is, overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Low v. Austin, stating it was wrongly decided in its interpretation that the Import-Export Clause prohibited nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes on imports."
109344,105833,Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers,no,"Taxes imposed after an initial sale, after the breakup of the shipping packages, or the moment goods imported for use are committed to current operational needs are also all likely to have an incidental effect on the volume of goods imported; yet all are permissible. See, e.g., ... Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers",The Acting Decision cites Youngstown approvingly as precedent supporting its analysis. There is no indication of overruling.
109344,86429,Thurlow v. Massachusetts,no,"Mr. Chief Justice Taney's opinion is authority, precisely contrary to the reading of Low v. Austin, that nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes are not prohibited by the Import-Export Clause.",The Acting Decision cites the License Cases (Thurlow) approvingly as supporting authority. There is no indication of overruling.
109508,105999,National Labor Relations Board v. Insurance Agents' International Union,no,Our decisions since Briggs-Stratton have made it abundantly clear that state attempts to influence the substantive terms of collective-bargaining agreements are as inconsistent with the federal regulatory scheme as are such attempts by the NLRB,The Acting Decision cites Insurance Agents as supporting precedent rather than overruling it. The case is used to establish that neither states nor the NLRB can regulate certain economic weapons in labor disputes.
109508,104636,"International Union, U. A. W. A., A. F. of L., Local 232 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board",yes,"We hold today that the ruling of Briggs-Stratton, permitting state regulation of partial strike activities such as are involved in this case is likewise 'no longer of general application.' Briggs-Stratton is expressly overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Briggs-Stratton (the cited case), stating that its approach to pre-emption is no longer valid."
109508,105866,San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,no,"San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U.S., at 245 n. 4, made clear that the Briggs-Stratton approach to pre-emption is 'no longer of general application.'","The Acting Decision cites Garmon as supporting precedent that helped establish the doctrine being applied, rather than overruling it."
109508,107123,"Hanna Mining Co. v. District 2, Marine Engineers Beneficial Ass'n",no,"And in Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U.S. 181 (1965), we resolved the 'troublesome question of where lies the line between permissible and federally preempted state regulation'","The Acting Decision cites Hanna Mining as supporting precedent to explain the development of pre-emption doctrine, rather than overruling it."
109508,106827,"Local 20, Teamsters, Chauffeurs & Helpers Union v. Morton",no,"But the analysis of Garner and Insurance Agents came full bloom in the pre-emption area in Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U.S. 252 (1964)","The Acting Decision cites Morton as supporting precedent that helped establish the doctrine being applied, rather than overruling it."
109508,107886,Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co.,no,"Whether self-help economic activities are employed by employer or union, the crucial inquiry regarding pre-emption is the same: whether 'the exercise of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act's processes.'","The Acting Decision cites Jacksonville Terminal as supporting precedent that helped establish the standard being applied, rather than overruling it."
109252,88869,The Pennsylvania,no,"And the potential unfairness of the division is magnified by the application of the rule of The Pennsylvania, 19 Wall. 125, whereby a ship's relatively minor statutory violation will require her to bear half the collision damage unless she can satisfy the heavy burden of showing 'not merely that her fault might not have been one of the causes, or that it probably was not, but that it could not have been.'","The Acting Decision merely discusses The Pennsylvania rule as an example of potential unfairness, but does not overrule it."
109252,86919,The Schooner Catharine v. Dickinson,yes,"We hold that when two or more parties have contributed by their fault to cause property damage in a maritime collision or stranding, liability for such damage is to be allocated among the parties proportionately to the comparative degree of their fault... The rule has been repeatedly criticized by experienced federal judges who have correctly pointed out that the result it works has too often been precisely the opposite of what the Court sought to achieve in The Schooner Catharine","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the divided damages rule established in The Schooner Catharine, replacing it with a proportional fault rule."
109252,108166,"Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc.",no,"See also Moragne v. States Marine Lines, 398 U. S. 375, 405 n. 17",The Acting Decision merely cites Moragne as supporting precedent for the court's authority to make maritime law changes.
109252,1473714,Oriental Trading & Transport Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp.,no,"And Judge Hand had all but invited this Court to overturn the rule when, in an earlier opinion for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, he stated that 'we have no power to divest ourselves of this vestigial relic'",The Acting Decision cites Oriental Trading as criticism of the divided damages rule but does not overrule it.
109252,92846,The Max Morris,no,"The divided damages rule has been said to be justified by the difficulty of determining comparative degrees of negligence when both parties are concededly guilty of contributing fault. The Max Morris, 137 U. S. 1, 12",The Acting Decision merely discusses The Max Morris's justification for the divided damages rule but does not overrule it.
109252,105170,"Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn",no,"and in our own admiralty law a rule of comparative negligence has long been applied with no untoward difficulties in personal injury actions. See, e. g., Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U. S. 406, 409",The Acting Decision cites Pope & Talbot as supporting precedent and does not overrule it.
109252,106640,Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co.,no,"But the Judiciary has traditionally taken the lead in formulating flexible and fair remedies in the law maritime, and 'Congress has largely left to this Court the responsibility for fashioning the controlling rules of admiralty law.'

109252,88790,The Sapphire,no,"The operation of the rule was described in The Sapphire, 18 Wall. 51, 56",The Acting Decision merely cites The Sapphire to describe the divided damages rule but does not overrule it.
109252,90646,The North Star,no,"Similarly, in The North Star, 106 U. S. 17, 22, the rule was thus stated",The Acting Decision merely cites The North Star to describe the divided damages rule but does not overrule it.

Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), 'the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.'",The Acting Decision cites this case as authoritative precedent and does not overrule it.
109499,104231,Case v. Bowles (1946),no,"It also seems appropriate to note that Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92 (1946), has not been overruled as the dissent asserts.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that this case has not been overruled.

(1967)",yes,"Accordingly, we conclude that the per se rule stated in Schwinn must be overruled.",The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Schwinn must be overruled. The Court found that Schwinn's per se rule against vertical restrictions was not justified under the demanding standards of Northern Pacific R.

109450,108848,Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations,no,"The Court, to be sure, characterized the advertisements as 'classic examples of commercial speech,' id., at 385, and a newspaper's printing of the advertisements as of the same character.

109450,106761,New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,no,"It is clear, for example, that speech does not lose its First Amendment protection because money is spent to project it, as in a paid advertisement of one form or another. Buckley v.

109580,86317,Pollard's Lessee v. HAGAN,no,"Our analysis today leads us to conclude that our decision to apply federal common law in Bonelli was incorrect...

109580,89097,County of St. Clair v. Lovingston,no,"The rule of New Orleans v. United States, supra, and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, supra, is discarded along with Bonelli and Hughes.","While the dissent claims the majority discards this precedent, the majority opinion itself does not explicitly overrule it, instead characterizing it as descriptive of English common law rather than binding federal law."
109580,107555,Hughes v.

United States (1977),yes,"We now conclude that where the defendant himself seeks to have the trial terminated without any submission to either judge or jury as to his guilt or innocence, an appeal by the Government from his successful effort to do so is not barred by 18 U.S.C. §3731 (1976 ed.). We recognize the force of the doctrine of stare decisis, but we are conscious as well of the admonition of Mr. Justice Brandeis",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the principle recognized in Lee regarding double jeopardy consequences of midtrial dismissals

109895,108233,United States v. Jorn (1971),no,Society's 'willingness to limit the Government to a single criminal proceeding to vindicate its very vital interest in enforcement of criminal laws' bespeaks society's recognition of the gross unfairness of requiring the accused to undergo the strain and agony of more than one trial for any single offense,The Acting Decision cites Jorn's principles approvingly rather than overruling them

S., at 228, '[t]he self-incrimination dilemma, so central to the Jones decision, can no longer occur under the prevailing interpretation of the Constitution [in Simmons].'","The Lead Opinion cites Brown approvingly and uses it to support its reasoning.

Howard,no,"Congress has refused to extend the benefits of Monroe to school boards and has attempted to allow awards of attorney's fees against local governments even though Monroe, City of Kenosha v. Bruno, and Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U.S. 1 (1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible",The Acting Decision discusses Aldinger in context of legislative history but does not overrule it.
110799,2226827,State Ex Rel. Douglas v. Sporhase,yes,The reciprocity requirement of Neb. Rev. Stat. §46-613.01 (1978) violates the Commerce Clause.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the Nebraska Supreme Court's decision by finding its reciprocity requirement unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause.
110799,1818257,"City of Altus, Oklahoma v. Carr",no,"In summarily affirming the District Court in City of Altus, we did not necessarily adopt the court's reasoning. Our affirmance indicates only our agreement with the result reached by the District Court.","The Acting Decision discusses but does not overrule City of Altus. Instead, it distinguishes and explains its prior summary affirmance."
110799,96834,Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter,yes,"City of Altus, however, is inconsistent with Hudson County. For in the latter case the Court found Geer v. Connecticut, supra, to be controlling on the Commerce Clause issue... In expressly overruling Geer three years ago, this Court traced the demise of the public ownership theory","The Acting Decision effectively overrules Hudson County by rejecting its reliance on Geer's public ownership theory, which had been expressly overruled in Hughes v. Oklahoma."
110799,97421,West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.,no,"The city relied upon West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State",The Acting Decision cites West approvingly and uses it as supporting precedent rather than overruling it.
110799,94405,Geer v. Connecticut,no,"In expressly overruling Geer three years ago, this Court traced the demise of the public ownership theory","While the Acting Decision discusses Geer's overruling, it was not the Acting Decision that overruled it. The opinion notes that Geer was overruled three years earlier in Hughes v. Oklahoma."
110563,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady",no,"We agree with appellants that the Montana tax must be evaluated under Complete Auto Transit's four-part test. Under that test, a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it 'is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.'",The Acting Decision affirms and applies the Complete Auto Transit test rather than overruling it.
110563,109835,Department of Revenue v. Ass'n of Washington Stevedoring Companies,no,"In reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes, our goal has instead been to 'establish a consistent and rational method of inquiry' focusing on 'the practical effect of a challenged tax.'",The Acting Decision cites and follows this case's principles rather than overruling it.
110563,877181,Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State,no,The Montana Supreme Court held that the coal severance tax is 'imposed for the general support of the government.',The Acting Decision affirms rather than overrules the Montana Supreme Court's decision.
110563,104253,Nippert v. City of Richmond,no,"Not the tax in a vacuum of words, but its practical consequences for the doing of interstate commerce in applications to concrete facts are our concern.",The Acting Decision cites and applies Nippert's principles rather than overruling them.
110563,110488,Maryland v. Louisiana,no,"But at the same time the Court made clear that not all state taxation of interstate commerce is valid; a state tax will be sustained against Commerce Clause challenge only if 'the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.'",The Acting Decision cites and follows Maryland v. Louisiana rather than overruling it.
110563,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,no,It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business.,The Acting Decision cites and relies on Western Live Stock's principles rather than overruling them.
110563,106846,General Motors Corp. v. Washington,no,"As we explained in General Motors Corp. v. Washington, supra, at 440-441: '[T]he validity of the tax rests upon whether the State is exacting a constitutionally fair demand for that aspect of interstate commerce to which it bears a special relation.'",The Acting Decision cites and applies General Motors' principles rather than overruling them.
110563,103186,"Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc.",no,"We have required a showing, based on factual evidence in the record, that 'the fees charged do not appear to be manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered...'",The Acting Decision cites Clark approvingly rather than overruling it.
110563,100063,Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co.,yes,We therefore hold that a state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce. Any contrary statements in Heisler and its progeny are disapproved.,The Acting Decision explicitly disapproves and overrules Heisler's reasoning regarding state severance taxes and Commerce Clause scrutiny.
110563,105195,Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert,no,"In Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U.S. 157, 163 (1954), Texas argued that no inquiry into the constitutionality of a facially neutral tax on the 'taking' of gas was necessary because the State 'has afforded great benefits and protection to pipeline companies.'",The Acting Decision cites and applies Calvert's principles rather than overruling them.
110563,102777,Ingels v. Morf,no,"See, e.g., Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U.S. 707 (1972); Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U.S. 583 (1939); Ingels v. Morf, 300 U.S. 290 (1937).",The Acting Decision cites Ingels as supporting precedent rather than overruling it.
111103,102987,Helvering v. Mitchell,no,"Reaffirming the principles articulated in Helvering v. Mitchell, supra, the Court reasoned that the difference between the burdens of proof in the criminal and civil cases precluded the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel.",The Acting Decision relies on and reaffirms Helvering's principles rather than overruling them.
111103,110331,United States v. Ward,no,"Resolution of this question begins as a matter of statutory interpretation. Id., at 399. As the Court noted in United States v. Ward...",The Acting Decision cites and applies Ward's test rather than overruling it.
111103,106534,Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,no,"In Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), we set forth a list of considerations that has proved helpful in the past in making such determinations.",The Acting Decision relies on and applies the Mendoza-Martinez factors rather than overruling them.
111103,407595,"United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, National Rifle Association of America, Amicus Curiae",no,"A divided United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed.","This is the lower court decision being reviewed. The Acting Decision reverses it but does not overrule it, as only Supreme Court precedents can be overruled."
111103,108643,One Lot Emerald Cut Stones and One Ring v. United States,no,"Most recently, in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972) (per curiam), the Court held that a civil action for forfeiture... was not barred by the owner's prior acquittal",The Acting Decision relies on and follows Emerald Cut Stones rather than overruling it.
111103,106087,Flemming v. Nestor,no,"See Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617-621 (1960)",The Acting Decision cites Flemming as valid precedent rather than overruling it.
111103,8178595,Coffey v. United States,yes,"To the extent that Coffey v. United States suggests otherwise, it is hereby disapproved.",The Acting Decision explicitly disapproves/overrules Coffey's holding that an acquittal in a criminal trial bars a civil forfeiture action.
110719,110119,Arkansas v. Sanders,yes,The Court today ignores the clear distinction that Chadwick established between movable containers and automobiles. It also rejects all of the relevant reasoning of Sanders and offers a substitute rationale that appears inconsistent with the result. Sanders is therefore effectively overruled.,The Lead Opinion explicitly rejects Sanders' reasoning and holding that warrants are required for containers in vehicles. The dissent confirms that Sanders is effectively overruled by the majority's new rule allowing warrantless searches of containers in vehicles.
110719,100567,Carroll v. United States,no,"In Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, the Court held that a warrantless search of an automobile stopped by police officers who had probable cause to believe the vehicle contained contraband was not unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.","The Lead Opinion relies on and reaffirms Carroll's core holding about warrantless vehicle searches, using it as foundation for its ruling."
110719,109714,United States v. Chadwick,no,"Chadwick, as the majority notes, 'reaffirmed the general principle that closed packages and containers may not be searched without a warrant.'","While the Court distinguishes Chadwick, it does not overrule its holding regarding containers found outside vehicles. The Court preserves Chadwick's rule for containers not found during vehicle searches."
110719,110558,Robbins v. California,yes,"And the Court unambiguously overrules 'the disposition' of Robbins, ante, at 824, though it gingerly avoids stating that it is overruling the case itself.","The Lead Opinion explicitly states it is rejecting Robbins' disposition, and the dissent confirms that Robbins is effectively overruled by the new rule allowing warrantless container searches in vehicles."
110719,108184,Chambers v. Maroney,no,"As this Court reaffirmed in Chambers, 399 U. S., at 50, '[n]either Carroll, supra, nor other cases in this Court require or suggest that in every conceivable circumstance the search of an auto even with probable cause may be made without the extra protection for privacy that a warrant affords.'",The Lead Opinion cites Chambers approvingly and builds upon its precedent rather than overruling it.
110719,392944,"United States v. Albert Ross, Jr.",no,"The en banc Court of Appeals considered, and rejected, the argument that it was reasonable for the police to open both the paper bag and the leather pouch because they were entitled to conduct a warrantless search of the entire vehicle in which the two containers were found.","This is the lower court decision being reviewed. The Supreme Court cannot overrule itself, and this case is the Acting Decision being analyzed."
110719,108377,Coolidge v. New Hampshire,no,"We have soundly rejected attempts to create such an exception in the past, see Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971), and we should do so again today.","While the dissent argues the majority's approach conflicts with Coolidge, the Lead Opinion does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it. The case is cited but not overruled."
111218,104463,United States v. Yellow Cab Co.,yes,"To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Yellow Cab's intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, which had held that parent and subsidiary corporations could conspire in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The Court rejects this doctrine and holds that a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary are incapable of conspiring for purposes of Section 1."
111218,104915,Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States,yes,"To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Timken's support for the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine. The Court rejects the doctrine's application to parent-subsidiary relationships and holds that affiliated corporations cannot conspire under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
111218,104839,"Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc.",yes,"To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Kiefer-Stewart's holding that commonly owned corporations could conspire in violation of Section 1. The Court rejects this interpretation and establishes that parent and wholly owned subsidiary corporations are incapable of conspiracy.
111218,107732,"Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp.",yes,"To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Perma Life Mufflers' support for the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, rejecting its holding that separate incorporation alone could subject affiliated corporations to Section 1 liability."
111218,102041,"Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States",no,"As we shall see, infra, at 771-774, it is the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine itself that 'makes but an artificial distinction' at the expense of substance.","The Acting Decision cites Appalachian Coals supportively rather than overruling it, using its reasoning to reject the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine."
111218,104037,United States v. Crescent Amusement Co.,yes,"To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Crescent Amusement's support for the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine between affiliated corporations.
111218,1292673,United States v. American Tobacco Co.,no,"In Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1 (1911), and United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106 (1911), the trust or holding company device brought together previously independent firms to lessen competition and achieve monopoly power.","The Acting Decision cites American Tobacco as historical context and does not overrule it. The case is discussed as an example of actual anti-competitive combinations, distinct from the parent-subsidiary relationships addressed in the current ruling."
111218,106009,"United States v. Parke, Davis & Co.",no,We have already noted that Congress left this 'gap' for eminently sound reasons.,The Acting Decision cites Parke Davis to support its reasoning rather than overrule it. The case is used to illustrate the distinction between unilateral and concerted conduct under the Sherman Act.
111218,409686,Independence Tube Corporation v. Copperweld Corporation,yes,"Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals decision that had found a parent corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary capable of conspiring under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
111404,91894,Ex Parte Bain,yes,"To avoid further confusion, we now explicitly reject that proposition. Rejecting this aspect of Bain is hardly a radical step, however, given that in the years since Bain this Court has largely ignored this element of the case.",The Acting Decision explicitly rejects and overrules the proposition from Bain that dropping unnecessary allegations from an indictment constitutes an unconstitutional amendment.
111404,105978,Stirone v. United States,no,"Stirone, however, stands for a very different proposition... In contrast to Stirone, Miller was tried on an indictment that clearly set out the offense for which he was ultimately convicted.","The Acting Decision distinguishes and upholds Stirone's core holding about not broadening indictments, while clarifying that Stirone does not apply to narrowing indictments."
111404,423986,United States v. James Rual Miller,yes,The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed.,The Acting Decision explicitly reverses this Court of Appeals decision.
111404,102436,Berger v. United States,no,"See also Berger v. United States, 295 U.S. 78 (1935)","The Acting Decision cites Berger positively multiple times as supporting precedent, with no indication of overruling."
111404,106407,Russell v. United States,no,"Russell v. United States, 369 U.S., at 770 (citing Bain for the 'settled rule in the federal courts that an indictment may not be amended except by resubmission to the grand jury, unless the change is merely a matter of form')","The Acting Decision cites Russell positively and uses it to support its analysis, with no indication of overruling."
111404,103976,United States v. Ballard,no,"That our holding today is fully consistent with prior legal understanding is apparent from an examination of the state of the law, as seen by Chief Justice Stone, more than 40 years ago","The Acting Decision cites Ballard's analysis approvingly to support its holding, with no indication of overruling."
111404,100951,Salinger v. United States,no,"In Salinger v. United States, supra, for example, the Court was presented with facts quite similar to the instant case","The Acting Decision relies heavily on Salinger as supporting precedent, with no indication of overruling."
111308,109499,National League of Cities v. Usery,yes,"Our conclusion is that National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), is overruled.",The Lead Opinion explicitly states that National League of Cities is overruled because it is unworkable and inconsistent with established principles of federalism.
111308,110881,Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Wyoming,no,"Of course, we continue to recognize that the States occupy a special and specific position in our constitutional system and that the scope of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause must reflect that position.",The Acting Decision cites EEOC v. Wyoming as precedent and does not overrule it.
111308,110516,"Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc.",no,The prerequisites for governmental immunity under National League of Cities were summarized by this Court in Hodel.,The Acting Decision uses Hodel to explain previous doctrine but does not overrule it.
111308,110673,United Transportation Union v. Long Island Rail Road,no,"During the pendency of those appeals, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678 (1982), was decided.",The Acting Decision discusses Long Island as precedent but does not overrule it.
111308,104222,New York v. United States,no,"We note and accept Justice Frankfurter's observation in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 583 (1946)",The Acting Decision explicitly accepts and endorses New York v. United States rather than overruling it.
111308,110718,Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Mississippi,no,"For example, recently the Federal Government has, with this Court's blessing, undertaken to tell the States... the regulatory standards, procedures, and even the agenda which their utilities commissions must consider and follow. See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742 (1982).",The Acting Decision cites FERC v. Mississippi as valid precedent and does not overrule it.
111308,109259,Fry v. United States,no,"Even if a particular individual's activity has no perceptible interstate effect, it can be reached by Congress through regulation of that class of activity in general as long as that class, considered as a whole, affects interstate commerce. Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975)",The Acting Decision cites Fry as valid precedent and does not overrule it.
111308,107734,Maryland v. Wirtz,no,"The application of the FLSA to public schools and hospitals was ruled to be within Congress' power under the Commerce Clause. Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968).","While the Acting Decision notes that Wirtz was previously overruled by National League of Cities, it does not itself overrule Wirtz. In fact, by overruling National League of Cities, it effectively reinstates Wirtz."
111308,2239255,San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority v. Donovan,no,"The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and these cases are remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.","While the Acting Decision reverses the District Court's judgment in Donovan, this is not the same as overruling the decision - it is simply reviewing and reversing a lower court's ruling."

111308,96357,South Carolina v.

111555,110478,Parratt v. Taylor,yes,"Upon reflection, we agree and overrule Parratt to the extent that it states that mere lack of due care by a state official may 'deprive' an individual of life, liberty, or property under the Fourteenth Amendment.",The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules Parratt's holding that negligent conduct by state officials can constitute a 'deprivation' under the Due Process Clause.
111555,111252,Hudson v. Palmer,no,"Historically, this guarantee of due process has been applied to deliberate decisions of government officials to deprive a person of life, liberty, or property... Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U. S. 517 (1984) (intentional destruction of inmate's property)",The case is cited as supporting precedent and there is no indication of overruling.
111555,109635,Ingraham v. Wright,no,"The Due Process Clause, petitioner notes, 'was intended to give Americans at least the protection against governmental power that they had enjoyed as Englishmen against the power of the crown.' Ingraham v. Wright, 430 U. S., at 672-673",The case is cited as supporting precedent and there is no indication of overruling.

111555,87021,South v. Maryland Ex Rel. Pottle,no,"We read South v. Maryland, supra, an action brought under federal diversity jurisdiction on a Maryland sheriff's bond, as stating no more than what this Court thought to be the principles of common law and Maryland law applicable to that case",The case is discussed but not overruled; the Court merely clarifies its limited scope.
111555,106170,Monroe v. Pape,no,"As explained in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961), this conclusion derives from the fact that the statute — the Ku Klux Act of 1871 — was intended to provide a federal remedy for the violation of a federal constitutional right",The case is cited as supporting precedent and there is no indication of overruling.

S. 277 (1980), we held that California's immunity statute did not violate the Due Process Clause simply because it operated to defeat a tort claim arising under state law",The case is cited as supporting precedent and there is no indication of overruling.
111948,107953,O'Callahan v. Parker (1969),yes,"On reexamination of O'Callahan, we have decided that the service connection test announced in that decision should be abandoned... We therefore hold that the requirements of the Constitution are not violated where, as here, a court-martial is convened to try a serviceman who was a member of the Armed Services at the time of the offense charged.","The Lead Opinion explicitly states that O'Callahan is being overruled, abandoning its 'service connection' test for court-martial jurisdiction."
111948,105326,United States Ex Rel. Toth v. Quarles (1955),no,"The constitutional grant of power to Congress to regulate the Armed Forces, Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, appears in the same section as do the provisions granting Congress authority, inter alia, to regulate commerce among the several States, to coin money, and to declare war.","While the Court discusses Toth, it does not overrule it. The case is cited as precedent and discussed in historical context."
111948,8982256,"Relford v. Commandant, US Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth (1971)",no,"The service connection approach, even as elucidated in Relford, has proved confusing and difficult for military courts to apply.","While the Court criticizes the application of Relford's service connection approach, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule the decision itself."
111948,105525,Reid v. Covert (1957),no,"In an unbroken line of decisions from 1866 to 1960, this Court interpreted the Constitution as conditioning the proper exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over an offense on one factor: the military status of the accused.",The Court cites Reid as part of historical precedent and does not take any action to overrule it.
111948,105981,Kinsella v. United States Ex Rel. Singleton (1960),no,"As explained in Kinsella v. Singleton, supra: 'The test for jurisdiction ... is one of status, namely, whether the accused in the court-martial proceeding is a person who can be regarded as falling within the term 'land and naval Forces.'",The Court cites Kinsella approvingly and uses it to support its reasoning. There is no explicit or implicit overruling.

112276,1098406,Ex Parte Smith (1988),yes,"The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.","The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling in Ex Parte Smith, finding that no presumption of vindictiveness applies when a second sentence after trial is heavier than a first sentence after guilty plea."
112276,107978,North Carolina v. Pearce,no,"While the Pearce opinion appeared on its face to announce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent cases have made clear that its presumption of vindictiveness 'do[es] not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.'",The Acting Decision limits and distinguishes Pearce but does not overrule it. It merely clarifies that the Pearce presumption does not apply in guilty plea situations.
112276,108569,Colten v. Kentucky,no,"In Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104 (1972), for example, we refused to apply the presumption when the increased sentence was imposed by the second court in a two-tiered system",The Acting Decision cites Colten approvingly as precedent and uses its reasoning to support its conclusion. There is no overruling.
112276,111602,Texas v. McCullough,no,"As we explained in Texas v. McCullough, 'the evil the [Pearce] Court sought to prevent' was not the imposition of 'enlarged sentences after a new trial' but 'vindictiveness of a sentencing judge.'",The Acting Decision relies on and cites McCullough favorably as supporting precedent. There is no overruling.
112276,110748,United States v. Goodwin,no,"Because the Pearce presumption 'may operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus . . . block a legitimate response to criminal conduct,' United States v. Goodwin, supra, at 373",The Acting Decision cites Goodwin approvingly and uses its reasoning to support its analysis. There is no overruling.
111940,87371,"Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON, GOVERNOR, &C.",yes,Kentucky v. Dennison is the product of another time. The conception of the relation between the States and the Federal Government there announced is fundamentally incompatible with more than a century of constitutional development... We conclude that it may stand no longer.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Dennison's holding that federal courts cannot compel state officials to perform extradition duties.
111940,109961,Michigan v. Doran,no,"The language of the Clause is 'clear and explicit.' Michigan v. Doran, 439 U.S. 282, 286 (1978).",The Acting Decision cites Doran approvingly and relies on its interpretation.
111940,105312,Brown v. Board of Education,no,"It would be superfluous to restate all the occasions on which this Court has imposed upon state officials a duty to obey the requirements of the Constitution, or compelled the performance of such duties; it may suffice to refer to Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294 (1955)",The Acting Decision cites Brown as supportive precedent.

111940,105221,Brown v. Board of Education,no,"Long continuation of decisional law or administrative practice incompatible with the requirements of the Constitution cannot overcome our responsibility to enforce those requirements. See, e.g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954)",The Acting Decision cites Brown as supportive precedent.
111940,105766,Cooper v. Aaron,no,"It would be superfluous to restate all the occasions on which this Court has imposed upon state officials a duty to obey the requirements of the Constitution, or compelled the performance of such duties; it may suffice to refer to Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U.S. 294 (1955), and Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U.S. 1 (1958)",The Acting Decision cites Cooper as supportive precedent.
111940,96519,Appleyard v. Massachusetts,no,"see Biddinger v. Commissioner of Police, 245 U.S. 128, 132-133 (1917); Appleyard v. Massachusetts, 203 U.S. 222, 227 (1906)",The Acting Decision cites Appleyard as supportive precedent.

111940,110718,Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Mississippi,no,"FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742, 761 (1982)",The Acting Decision cites FERC as supportive precedent.
112040,111308,Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,no,"Garcia holds that the limits are structural, not substantive— i. e., that States must find their protection from congressional regulation through the national political process, not through judicially defined spheres of unregulable state activity.",The Acting Decision cites Garcia as current precedent and builds upon its principles rather than overruling it.
112040,104222,New York v. United States,no,"Two Justices reasoned that any nondiscriminatory tax on a State was constitutional, even if directly collected from the State.",The Acting Decision discusses New York v. United States as valid precedent that helps establish the modern intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine.
112040,103172,Graves v. New York Ex Rel. O'Keefe,no,"In Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 (1939), the Court announced: 'The theory . . . that a tax on income is legally or economically a tax on its source, is no longer tenable.'",The Acting Decision cites Graves as important precedent that helped establish modern intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine.
112040,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt,no,"Prior to that the Court had already confined Collector v. Day to its facts in Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405 (1938), which upheld the constitutionality of a federal tax on the salaries of state employees involved in state construction projects.",The Acting Decision cites Helvering as valid precedent that helped develop the modern intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine.
112040,110718,Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Mississippi,no,The extent to which the Tenth Amendment claim left open in FERC survives Garcia or poses constitutional limitations independent of those discussed in Garcia is far from clear.,"The Acting Decision acknowledges but does not resolve FERC's continuing validity, explicitly declining to overrule it."
112040,101762,Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States,no,"The Court in King & Boozer overruled Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U. S. 218 (1928).","While the Acting Decision discusses Indian Motocycle extensively, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it."
112040,94174,Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.,yes,We thus confirm that subsequent case law has overruled the holding in Pollock that state bond interest is immune from a nondiscriminatory federal tax.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Pollock's holding regarding state bond interest immunity from federal taxation.
112301,111683,Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority,no,"Applying these principles, we concluded that the New York statute had an impermissible extraterritorial effect",The Acting Decision relies on and reaffirms Brown-Forman rather than overruling it. The Court uses Brown-Forman as precedent to strike down the Connecticut statute.
112301,107217,"Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter",yes,"In the interest of removing any lingering uncertainty about the constitutional validity of affirmation statutes and of avoiding further litigation on the subject of liquor-price affirmation, we recognize today what was all but determined in Brown-Forman: to the extent that Seagram holds that retrospective affirmation statutes do not facially violate the Commerce Clause, it is no longer good law.","The Court explicitly overrules Seagram's holding regarding retrospective affirmation statutes, stating it is 'no longer good law.'"
112301,102402,"Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.",no,"Writing for the Court, Justice Cardozo pronounced that the Commerce Clause does not permit a State 'to establish a wage scale or a scale of prices for use in other states, and to bar the sale of the products . . . unless the scale has been observed.'",The Acting Decision relies on Baldwin as valid precedent rather than overruling it. The Court cites Baldwin's principles to support its analysis.
112301,110758,Edgar v. Mite Corp.,no,"The Brown-Forman Court cited a third extraterritorial decision, Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U. S. 624 (1982), which, though not discussed at length there, significantly illuminates the contours of the constitutional prohibition on extraterritorial legislation.",The Acting Decision cites Edgar approvingly and uses it to support its analysis rather than overruling it.
112301,507765,In Re Beer Institute,no,"As in Healy I, the Court of Appeals reversed. It held that the 1984 law (even as interpreted by the declaratory ruling), like its predecessor, violated the Commerce Clause",The Acting Decision reviews and affirms the Court of Appeals decision rather than overruling it.
112301,2370562,United States Brewers Ass'n v. Healy,no,"The District Court, relying primarily on this Court's decision in Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter, 384 U. S. 35 (1966), upheld the 1981 law.",The Acting Decision discusses this case as part of the procedural history but does not overrule it. The case is cited to explain the background of the litigation.
112471,94866,Thompson v. Utah,yes,"To the extent that Thompson v. Utah rested on the Ex Post Facto Clause and not the Sixth Amendment, we overrule it.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Thompson v. Utah to the extent it relied on the Ex Post Facto Clause, stating that the right to jury trial is not related to the definition of crimes, defenses, or punishments which is the concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause."
112471,100734,Beazell v. Ohio,no,"The Beazell definition, then, is faithful to the use of the term 'ex post facto law' at the time the Constitution was adopted.","Far from overruling Beazell, the Acting Decision repeatedly cites it approvingly and uses its framework as the correct interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause."
112471,90760,Kring v. Missouri,yes,We accordingly overrule Kring.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Kring, stating that its interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause departed from the original understanding of the Constitution and was not supported by later cases."
112471,1787505,Bogany v. State,no,"In Bogany, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a jury verdict which included a punishment unauthorized by law was void at its inception and had to be set aside.","The Acting Decision merely discusses Bogany as background context and does not overrule it. The Texas legislature modified the effect of Bogany through statute, but the Acting Decision itself did not overrule it."
112471,98427,Malloy v. South Carolina,no,"Later, in Malloy v. South Carolina, supra, we stated that even with regard to procedural changes, the Ex Post Facto Clause was 'intended to secure substantial personal rights against arbitrary and oppressive legislative action.'",The Acting Decision cites Malloy as precedent and does not overrule it. The decision is discussed as part of the historical development of Ex Post Facto Clause jurisprudence.
112258,109016,Procunier v. Martinez,yes,"To the extent that Martinez itself suggests such a distinction, we today overrule that case; the Court accomplished much of this step when it decided Turner.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Martinez's standard as it applies to incoming prisoner correspondence and publications, limiting Martinez only to outgoing correspondence."
112258,111904,Turner v. Safley,no,"We now hold that the District Court correctly anticipated that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the regulations are 'reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,' Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987)",The Acting Decision affirms and applies Turner's reasonableness standard rather than overruling it.
112258,109718,"Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc.",no,The Court's decision to apply a reasonableness standard in these cases rather than Martinez' less deferential approach stemmed from its concern that language in Martinez might be too readily understood as establishing a standard of 'strict' or 'heightened' scrutiny,The Acting Decision cites Jones approvingly as precedent for applying a reasonableness standard rather than overruling it.
112258,109079,Pell v. Procunier,no,"We have recognized, however, that these rights must be exercised with due regard for the 'inordinately difficult undertaking' that is modern prison administration.",The Acting Decision cites Pell favorably as supporting precedent rather than overruling it.
112258,492021,Abbott v. Meese,no,"We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals on the issue of facial validity, but we agree with that court's remand of the case to the District Court for a determination of the validity of the regulations as applied to each of the 46 publications.","While the Acting Decision disagrees with part of Abbott v. Meese's reasoning, it does not overrule it, and even agrees with part of its holding regarding remand."
112258,110075,Bell v. Wolfish,no,"It is equally certain that '[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution,' Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S., at 84, nor do they bar free citizens from exercising their own constitutional rights by reaching out to those on the 'inside,' id., at 94-99; Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979)",The Acting Decision cites Bell v. Wolfish as supporting precedent rather than overruling it.
112609,1573917,"Exxon Corp. v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc. (1989)",no,The District Court noted that '[a] prerequisite to the existence of a maritime lien based on a breach of contract is that the subject matter of the contract must fall within the admiralty jurisdiction.',The Acting Decision discusses this case but does not overrule it. The case is simply part of the procedural history being reviewed.
112609,88300,Insurance Co. v. Dunham,no,"In Insurance Co. v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1 (1871), the Court explained that, in determining whether a contract falls within admiralty, 'the true criterion is the nature and subject-matter of the contract, as whether it was a maritime contract, having reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.'",The Acting Decision cites this case favorably and relies on its principles to help justify overruling Minturn. There is no indication of overruling.
112609,105375,Archawski v. Hanioti,no,"In Archawski, supra, the Court held that an action cognizable as assumpsit would no longer be automatically excluded from admiralty.",The Acting Decision cites this case positively as precedent that helped discredit one of Minturn's rationales. There is no indication of overruling.
112609,86949,Minturn v. Maynard,yes,We conclude that Minturn is incompatible with current principles of admiralty jurisdiction over contracts and therefore should be overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Minturn, stating it is incompatible with current principles of admiralty jurisdiction. This is a clear example of Explicit Negative Action."
112608,110719,United States v. Ross,no,"Until today, this Court has drawn a curious line between the search of an automobile that coincidentally turns up a container and the search of a container that coincidentally turns up in an automobile. The protections of the Fourth Amendment must not turn on such coincidences. We therefore interpret Carroll as providing one rule to govern all automobile searches.","The Acting Decision does not overrule Ross, but rather extends and relies upon its reasoning to establish a broader rule about container searches in automobiles."
112608,109714,United States v. Chadwick,yes,We conclude that it is better to adopt one clear-cut rule to govern automobile searches and eliminate the warrant requirement for closed containers set forth in Sanders... The Chadwick-Sanders rule is the antithesis of a 'clear and unequivocal' guideline.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the Chadwick rule requiring warrants for container searches in automobiles.
112608,110119,Arkansas v. Sanders,yes,We conclude that it is better to adopt one clear-cut rule to govern automobile searches and eliminate the warrant requirement for closed containers set forth in Sanders.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Sanders and its warrant requirement for container searches in automobiles.
112608,111305,United States v. Johns,no,"In United States v. Johns, 469 U. S. 478 (1985), we rejected the respondent's reliance on Chadwick with a straightforward explanation of why that case, unlike Ross, did not involve an exception to the warrant requirement.",The Acting Decision cites Johns approvingly and relies on its reasoning rather than overruling it.
112608,100567,Carroll v. United States,no,We therefore interpret Carroll as providing one rule to govern all automobile searches.,The Acting Decision expands and builds upon Carroll's automobile exception rather than overruling it.
112608,104504,Johnson v. United States,no,"In his opinion for the Court in Johnson v. United States, id., at 13-14, Justice Jackson explained: 'The point of the Fourth Amendment...is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence.'",The Acting Decision cites Johnson approvingly for its explanation of Fourth Amendment principles rather than overruling it.
112608,108184,Chambers v. Maroney,no,"The Court refined the exigency requirement in Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 (1970), when it held that the existence of exigent circumstances was to be determined at the time the automobile is seized.",The Acting Decision cites Chambers approvingly and builds upon its principles rather than overruling it.
112608,110979,United States v. Place,no,"In United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983), we held that, although reasonable suspicion justifies the temporary detention of an airline passenger's luggage, the seizure in that particular case was unreasonable because of the prolonged delay in ascertaining the existence of probable cause.",The Acting Decision discusses Place in historical context without overruling it.
112608,110558,Robbins v. California,no,"The holding in Belton was supportable under a straightforward application of the automobile exception. See Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420, 449-453 (1981)",The Acting Decision mentions Robbins only in passing without overruling it.
112739,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady (1977)",no,"Complete Auto emphasized the importance of looking past 'the formal language of the tax statute [to] its practical effect,' 430 U. S., at 279, and set forth a four-part test that continues to govern the validity of state taxes under the Commerce Clause.",The Acting Decision relies on and applies Complete Auto's four-part test rather than overruling it.
112739,1591860,State Ex Rel. Heitkamp v. Quill Corp. (1991),yes,"Having granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 808, we must either reverse the State Supreme Court or overrule Bellas Hess. While we agree with much of the state court's reasoning, we take the former course.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the North Dakota Supreme Court's decision.
112739,107425,"National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue (1967)",yes,"Thus, to the extent that our decisions have indicated that the Due Process Clause requires physical presence in a State for the imposition of duty to collect a use tax, we overrule those holdings as superseded by developments in the law of due process.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Bellas Hess's due process holding while retaining its Commerce Clause holding.
112739,109630,National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization (1977),no,"We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval ever since. For example, in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 263 (1989), we expressed 'doubt that termination of an interstate telephone call, by itself, provides a substantial enough nexus for a State to tax a call. See National Bellas Hess...(receipt of mail provides insufficient nexus).' See also D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988); Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S., at 437; National Geographic Society, 430 U. S., at 559.",The Acting Decision cites National Geographic approvingly and relies on it as precedent.
112739,110563,Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana (1981),no,"Indeed, even if we were convinced that Bellas Hess was inconsistent with our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, 'this very fact [might] giv[e us] pause and counse[l] withholding our hand, at least for now. Congress has the power to protect interstate commerce from intolerable or even undesirable burdens.' Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 463 U. S., at 637",The Acting Decision cites Commonwealth Edison approvingly and relies on it as precedent.
112739,112066,"D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (1988)",no,"We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval ever since... See also D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988)",The Acting Decision cites D.H. Holmes approvingly and relies on it as precedent.
112739,105829,Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota (1959),no,"By the time the Court decided Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959), Justice Rutledge was no longer on the Court, but his view of the nexus requirement as grounded in the Due Process Clause was decisively adopted.",The Acting Decision discusses Northwestern States Portland Cement as important precedent without overruling it.
112739,110927,Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Public Service Commission (1983),no,"Notwithstanding the benefits of bright-line tests, we have, in some situations, decided to replace such tests with more contextual balancing inquiries. For example, in Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U. S. 375 (1983), we reconsidered a bright-line test set forth in Public Util. Comm'n of R. I. v. Attleboro Steam & Electric Co., 273 U. S. 83 (1927).","The Acting Decision discusses Arkansas Electric Cooperative as an example of replacing bright-line tests, but does not overrule it."
117931,105287,United States v. Bramblett,yes,Bramblett is hereby overruled. We hold that a federal court is neither a 'department' nor an 'agency' within the meaning of § 1001.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Bramblett, finding its interpretation of §1001 was erroneous and that coherence and stability in law will be better served by overturning it."
117931,112296,Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,no,"Stare decisis has special force when legislators or citizens 'have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.'","The Acting Decision cites and discusses Patterson but does not overrule it. Rather, it uses Patterson's principles to analyze whether to overrule Bramblett."
117931,258536,Morgan v. United States,no,"First suggested over 30 years ago in Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d 234 (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), this doctrine limits the extent to which § 1001 reaches conduct occurring in the federal courts.",The Acting Decision discusses Morgan as historical context for the judicial function exception but does not overrule it.
117931,276778,United States v. James Ralph Erhardt,no,"Relying on Morgan, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a conviction several years later 'because § 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents as evidence in a criminal proceeding.'",The Acting Decision discusses Erhardt as part of the historical development of the judicial function exception but does not overrule it.
117931,109680,Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,no,"Respect for precedent is strongest 'in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation.'",The Acting Decision cites Illinois Brick approvingly for its discussion of stare decisis principles but does not overrule it.
117931,101894,Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.,no,"'Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.'",The Acting Decision cites Burnet's discussion of stare decisis principles but does not overrule it.
117958,101414,Sinclair v. United States (1929),yes,"Thus, while Sinclair is not strictly controlling, it is fair to say that we cannot hold for respondent today while still adhering to the reasoning and the holding of that case... Whatever support it gave to the validity of those decisions was obiter dicta, and may properly be disregarded.","The Acting Decision explicitly rejects and repudiates Sinclair's reasoning and holding regarding the judge's role in determining materiality, stating that its reasoning has been 'proved manifestly erroneous' and its underpinnings eroded."
117958,112848,United States v. Olano,no,The Court today has no occasion to review the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the constitutional error here 'cannot be harmless.',The Acting Decision discusses Olano's framework but does not overrule it. The case is cited as valid precedent in the concurring opinion.
117958,673512,United States v. Michael E. Gaudin,no,The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.,"This is the lower court decision being reviewed and affirmed, not overruled."
117958,112868,Sullivan v. Louisiana,no,"We have held that these provisions require criminal convictions to rest upon a jury determination that the defendant is guilty of every element of the crime with which he is charged, beyond a reasonable doubt. Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 277-278 (1993).",The Acting Decision cites Sullivan approvingly and relies on its reasoning to support its holding.
117958,109698,Patterson v. New York,no,"Within broad constitutional bounds, legislatures have flexibility in defining the elements of a criminal offense. See Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 210 (1977).",The Acting Decision cites Patterson as valid authority and relies on its principles.
117958,94082,Sparf v. United States,no,"Sparf, supra, the case on which the Government relies, had nothing to do with the issue before us here.","While the Acting Decision distinguishes Sparf and limits its application, it does not overrule it, instead explaining that Sparf addressed a different issue."
117958,112052,Kungys v. United States,no,"But as we have observed, the characterization of a mixed question of law and fact for one purpose does not govern its characterization for all purposes.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Kungys rather than overruling it, explaining that its holding was limited to a different context and its statements about materiality were merely dicta."
118155,112259,United States v. Halper,yes,We believe that Halper's deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered... We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect.,The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Halper's test for determining whether a sanction is punitive was unworkable and should be disavowed. The Court clearly overrules Halper's method of analysis.
118155,106534,Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,no,"In making this latter determination, the factors listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), provide useful guideposts",The Court reaffirms and relies on Kennedy's factors as the proper framework for analysis. The decision is cited positively throughout the opinion.
118155,1087946,Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch,no,"We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect. See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14 (1994)",The Court cites Kurth Ranch to support its reasoning. There is no indication of overruling.
118155,110331,United States v. Ward,no,"reaffirm the previously established rule exemplified in United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980)",The Court explicitly reaffirms Ward's approach to determining whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil.
118155,118052,United States v. Ursery,no,"that there is little evidence, much less the clearest proof that we require, suggesting that either OCC money penalties or debarment sanctions are 'so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal despite Congress' intent to the contrary.' Ursery, supra, at 290",The Court cites and relies on Ursery's analysis positively throughout the opinion.
118155,102987,Helvering v. Mitchell,no,"The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense, Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938)",The Court cites Helvering approvingly as establishing foundational principles about double jeopardy.
118155,106087,Flemming v. Nestor,no,"While petitioners have been prohibited from further participating in the banking industry, this is 'certainly nothing approaching the infamous punishment of imprisonment.' Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960)",The Court cites Flemming positively to support its analysis of civil versus criminal sanctions.
118155,112906,United States v. Dixon,no,"This fact is insufficient to render the money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, 518 U. S., at 292, particularly in the double jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704 (1993)",The Court cites Dixon supportively in its analysis of double jeopardy principles.
118011,92702,Hans v. Louisiana,no,"We have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition ... which it confirms.","The Acting Decision reaffirms and builds upon Hans rather than overruling it, using it as foundation for its holding that Congress cannot abrogate state sovereign immunity."
118011,84681,Chisholm v. Georgia,no,"The Eleventh Amendment, of course, repudiated Chisholm and clearly divested federal courts of some jurisdiction as to cases against state parties.","While the Acting Decision discusses how Chisholm was repudiated by the 11th Amendment, it was not the Acting Decision itself that overruled Chisholm."
118011,112291,Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.,yes,"We feel bound to conclude that Union Gas was wrongly decided and that it should be, and now is, overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Union Gas's holding that Congress could abrogate state sovereign immunity under Article I.
118011,111503,Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,no,"In the past, we have assumed that a plain-statement requirement is sufficient to protect the States from undue federal encroachments upon their traditional immunity from suit.",The Acting Decision cites and builds upon Atascadero rather than overruling it.
118011,102271,Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi,no,"That presupposition, first observed over a century ago in Hans v. Louisiana, has two parts: first, that each State is a sovereign entity in our federal system; and second, that '[i]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent.'",The Acting Decision relies on Monaco's reasoning rather than overruling it.
118011,96819,Ex Parte Young,no,The narrow exception to the Eleventh Amendment provided by the Ex parte Young doctrine cannot be used to enforce § 2710(d)(3).,"While limiting Ex parte Young's application in this specific context, the Acting Decision does not overrule the doctrine itself."
118011,85330,Cohens v. Virginia,no,"The point of the Eleventh Amendment, according to Cohens, was to bar jurisdiction in suits at common law by Revolutionary War debt creditors.",The Acting Decision discusses Cohens' interpretation but does not overrule it.
118011,109520,Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,no,"Previously, in conducting that inquiry, we have found authority to abrogate under only two provisions of the Constitution. In Fitzpatrick, we recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment... had fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution.",The Acting Decision reaffirms rather than overrules Fitzpatrick's holding about Congress's 14th Amendment abrogation power.
118011,111949,Welch v. Texas Department of Highways & Public Transportation,no,A majority of this Court was willing to make that assumption in... Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp.,The Acting Decision discusses Welch's assumptions but does not overrule its holdings.
118011,112800,"Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.",no,"See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, supra, at 146 ('The Amendment is rooted in a recognition that the States, although a union, maintain certain attributes of sovereignty, including sovereign immunity').",The Acting Decision cites Puerto Rico Aqueduct approvingly rather than overruling it.
118011,658639,Seminole Tribe of Florida v. State of Florida,no,"The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court, holding that the Eleventh Amendment barred petitioner's suit against respondents.",The Acting Decision reviews but does not overrule the lower court decision.
112728,112640,Coleman v. Thompson (1991),no,"Again addressing the issue of state procedural default in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722 (1991), we described Fay as based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules","The Acting Decision cites Coleman approvingly and relies on it to support its reasoning, rather than overruling it"
112728,106544,Townsend v. Sain (1963),yes,"Because the holding of Townsend v. Sain that Fay v. Noia's deliberate bypass standard is applicable in a case like this had not been reversed, it is quite understandable that the Court of Appeals applied that standard in this case. However, in light of more recent decisions of this Court, Townsend's holding in this respect must be overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Townsend's holding regarding the deliberate bypass standard must be overruled
112728,112573,McCleskey v. Zant (1991),no,"In McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467 (1991), we held that the same standard used to excuse state procedural defaults should be applied in habeas corpus cases where abuse of the writ is claimed by the government.",The Acting Decision cites McCleskey approvingly and builds upon its reasoning rather than overruling it
112728,105074,Brown v. Allen (1953),no,Brown was inconsistent with the holding of Townsend regarding habeas petitioners who failed to adequately develop federal claims in state-court proceedings,"While noting Brown's inconsistency with Townsend, the Acting Decision does not directly overrule Brown"
112728,109717,Wainwright v. Sykes (1977),no,"In Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72 (1977), we rejected the application of Fay's standard of 'knowing waiver' or 'deliberate bypass'",The Acting Decision cites Wainwright approvingly and relies on its reasoning rather than overruling it
112728,111727,Murray v. Carrier (1986),no,"We noted in Murray, a procedural default case, that objective factors external to the defense may impede counsel's efforts to comply",The Acting Decision cites Murray approvingly and builds upon its principles rather than overruling it
112728,556624,Jose Tamayo-Reyes v. J.C. Keeney (1991),no,"The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit recognized that the alleged failure to translate the mens rea element of first-degree manslaughter, if proved, would be a basis for overturning respondent's plea",The Acting Decision reviews but does not overrule this lower court decision
112728,111235,Reed v. Ross (1984),no,"We have consistently reaffirmed that the 'cause-and-prejudice' standard embodies the correct accommodation between the competing concerns implicated in a federal court's habeas power. Reed v. Ross, 468 U.S. 1, 11 (1984)",The Acting Decision cites Reed approvingly and relies on its principles rather than overruling it
112728,109439,Francis v. Henderson (1976),no,"In Francis v. Henderson, 425 U.S. 536 (1976), we acknowledged a federal court's power to entertain an application for habeas even where the claim has been procedurally waived in state proceedings",The Acting Decision cites Francis approvingly and builds upon its reasoning rather than overruling it
118149,107615,Albrecht v. Herald Co. (1968),yes,"We conclude that Albrecht should be overruled... In overruling Albrecht, we of course do not hold that all vertical maximum price fixing is per se lawful. Instead, vertical maximum price fixing, like the majority of commercial arrangements subject to the antitrust laws, should be evaluated under the rule of reason.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Albrecht, finding its theoretical underpinnings weak and its assumptions about the harmful effects of vertical maximum price fixing unsupported by evidence or experience."
118149,109716,Continental T. v. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc. (1977),no,"Nine years later, in Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 438 U. S. 36 (1977), the Court overruled Schwinn, thereby rejecting application of a per se rule in the context of vertical nonprice restrictions.",The Acting Decision cites GTE Sylvania approvingly and uses it as precedent to support its own reasoning. There is no indication of overruling.
118149,725024,"Barkat U. Khan and Khan & Associates, Inc. v. State Oil Company (1996)",no,The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed. 93 F. 3d 1358 (1996).,"This is the lower court decision being reviewed. The Acting Decision vacates and remands it, but does not overrule it as a precedent."
118149,112425,Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co. (1990),no,"Most recently, in ARCO, 495 U. S. 328 (1990), although Albrecht's continuing validity was not squarely before the Court, some disfavor with that decision was signaled",The Acting Decision cites ARCO as supporting precedent and does not overrule it.
118149,110747,Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society (1982),no,We noted in Maricopa County that vertical restraints are generally more defensible than horizontal restraints.,The Acting Decision cites Maricopa County approvingly and uses it as supporting precedent.
118149,107491,"United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co. (1967)",no,"Four years later, in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967), the Court reconsidered the status of exclusive dealer territories","While the Acting Decision discusses Schwinn, it notes that Schwinn was already overruled by GTE Sylvania. The Acting Decision itself does not overrule Schwinn."
118230,104079,House v. Mayo (1945),yes,"Today's opinion permits review where Congress, with unmistakable clarity, has denied it. To reach this result, the Court ignores the obvious intent of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, distorts the meaning of our own jurisdictional statute, 28 U. S. C. § 1254 (1), and overrules a 53-year-old precedent, House v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42 (1945) (per curiam).",The Lead Opinion explicitly overrules House v. Mayo's holding that the Court lacks statutory certiorari jurisdiction over denials of certificates of probable cause.
118230,103707,Ex Parte Quirin (1942),no,"The Court's only response to these arguments is that they are foreclosed by our precedent, since we decided an analogous issue in Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942).",The Lead Opinion relies on and affirms Ex parte Quirin rather than overruling it.
118230,112643,Payne v. Tennessee (1991),no,"Stare decisis is 'the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.' Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).",The Lead Opinion cites Payne v. Tennessee as valid precedent to support its analysis rather than overruling it.
118230,111885,Gray v. Mississippi (1987),no,"Gray, however, did not deny stare decisis effect to an opinion rendered without full briefing and argument — it accorded stare decisis effect.",The Lead Opinion discusses Gray v. Mississippi but does not overrule it. The dissent argues about Gray's interpretation but neither opinion suggests overruling it.
118428,99610,Evans v. Gore,yes,"We now overrule Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before enactment of the tax.","The Court explicitly overruled Evans, stating that its reasoning was no longer sound law. The Court adopted Justice Holmes' dissenting view that judges should not be exempt from general, non-discriminatory taxes that all citizens must pay."
118428,103214,O'MALLEY v. Woodrough,no,"In 1939, 14 years after Miles extended Evans' tax immunity to judges appointed after enactment of the tax, this Court retreated from that extension. See O'Malley, 307 U.S., at 283 (overruling Miles). And in so doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans dissent.",The Court actually reaffirmed and relied upon O'Malley's reasoning that non-discriminatory taxes can be applied to judges. The Court used O'Malley as precedent to help overturn Evans.
118428,110365,United States v. Will,no,"We have previously explained why that is so. See Will, 449 U.S., at 226.","The Court cited Will multiple times as valid precedent and relied on its reasoning regarding the Compensation Clause. There is no indication that Will was overruled; rather, it was used to support the Court's analysis."
118428,702629,Hatter v. United States,no,"The Court of Appeals reversed, ordering summary judgment for the judges as to liability. 64 F. 3d 647 (1995).","This case is merely cited as part of the procedural history. The Court was reviewing this decision and while it partially reversed and partially affirmed the judgment, this does not constitute overruling the decision as precedent."
118317,118011,Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida,no,Our opinion today has sought to discern what the bounds are; Justice Breyer's dissent denies them any permanent place.,The Acting Decision reinforces and extends Seminole Tribe rather than overruling it. The majority opinion repeatedly cites Seminole Tribe as valid precedent.
118317,108763,Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health,no,"Only nine years later, in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279 (1973), we began to retreat from Parden.",The Acting Decision cites Employees approvingly as part of the evolution of doctrine away from Parden. It does not overrule Employees.
118317,106821,Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama State Docks Department,yes,Whatever may remain of our decision in Parden is expressly overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that it is overruling Parden, describing it as an 'anomaly' that is being discarded."
118317,111949,Welch v. Texas Department of Highways & Public Transportation,no,"Several Terms later, in Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468 (1987), although we expressly avoided addressing the constitutionality of Congress's conditioning a State's engaging in Commerce Clause activity upon the State's waiver of sovereign immunity, we said there was 'no doubt that Parden's discussion of congressional intent to negate Eleventh Amendment immunity is no longer good law.'",The Acting Decision cites Welch approvingly as part of the evolution of doctrine. It does not overrule Welch.
118317,111503,Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,no,"Later case law, suggesting that a waiver may be found in a State's acceptance of a federal grant, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 247 (1985), supports Parderis conclusion.",The Acting Decision discusses Atascadero as valid precedent and does not overrule it.
118317,112291,Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.,no,"'All congressional creations of private rights of action attach recovery to the defendant's commission of some act, or possession of some status, in a field where Congress has authority to regulate conduct.'",The Acting Decision cites Union Gas for a general principle but does not overrule it.
118317,110880,"White v. Massachusetts Council of Construction Employers, Inc.",no,"The 'market participant' cases from our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, relied upon by the United States, are inapposite.","While the Acting Decision distinguishes White, it does not overrule it. It merely finds it inapplicable to the current context."
118317,105513,California v. Taylor,no,"These considerations make Congress' need to possess the power to condition entry into the market upon a waiver of sovereign immunity (as 'necessary and proper' to the exercise of its commerce power) unusually strong, for to deny Congress that power would deny Congress the power effectively to regulate private conduct. Cf. California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553, 566 (1957).",The Acting Decision cites Taylor as supporting authority and does not overrule it.
118317,109520,Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,no,"While this immunity from suit is not absolute, we have recognized only two circumstances in which an individual may sue a State. First, Congress may authorize such a suit in the exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment — an Amendment enacted after the Eleventh Amendment and specifically designed to alter the federal-state balance. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976).",The Acting Decision cites Fitzpatrick as establishing valid precedent for when states can be sued and does not overrule it.
118273,111516,Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife v. Klamath Indian Tribe,no,"The Court cited Race Horse in Klamath, but we did not in so doing reaffirm the equal footing doctrine as a bar to the continuation of Indian treaty-based usufructuary rights.","The Acting Decision discusses Klamath but explicitly states it did not overrule it. Rather, it distinguishes and explains how Klamath's citation of Race Horse was limited."
118273,96304,United States v. Winans,no,"See United States v. Winans, 198 U.S. 371, 382-384 (1905). See also Menominee Tribe v. United States, supra, at 411, n. 12.",The Acting Decision cites Winans as supporting precedent multiple times and does not take any actions to overrule it.
118273,746267,Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v. Minnesota (1997),no,The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed. 124 F. 3d 904 (1997).,The Acting Decision reviews and affirms this lower court decision rather than overruling it.
118273,94506,Ward v. Race Horse,yes,"But Race Horse rested on a false premise. As subsequent cases have made clear, an Indian tribe's treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on state land are not irreconcilable with a State's sovereignty over the natural resources in the State.",The Acting Decision explicitly rejects Race Horse's core premise and overrules its holding regarding treaty rights and state sovereignty.
118273,110146,Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn.,no,"We have held that Indian treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the Indians, Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U.S., at 675-676",The Acting Decision cites this case as valid precedent multiple times and relies on its principles.
118273,2261846,Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v. Minnesota (1994),no,"After a bench trial on the Phase I issues, the District Court concluded that the Mille Lacs Band retained its usufructuary rights as guaranteed by the 1837 Treaty. 861 F. Supp. 784 (1994).",The Acting Decision reviews and affirms this lower court decision rather than overruling it.
118273,105018,Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer,no,"The Court of Appeals began its analysis of this question with a statement of black letter law: 'The President's power, if any, to issue the order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.' (quoting Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952))",The Acting Decision cites Youngstown as valid precedent and relies on its principles.
118273,98773,New York Ex Rel. Kennedy v. Becker,no,The Court characterized the Senecas' claim as one 'sought to be maintained in derogation of the sovereignty of the State.',"While the Acting Decision discusses Kennedy, it does not take any explicit or implicit action to overrule it."
118273,103642,Tulee v. Washington,no,"The conservation necessity standard appears to have its origin in Tulee v. Washington, 315 U.S. 681 (1942).",The Acting Decision discusses Tulee as valid precedent and builds upon its principles rather than overruling them.
118273,96748,Winters v. United States,no,"We have held that Indian treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the Indians...and that any ambiguities are to be resolved in their favor, Winters v. United States, 207 U.S. 564, 576-577 (1908)",The Acting Decision cites Winters as valid precedent and relies on its principles for treaty interpretation.
112640,111020,Michigan v. Long,no,"We now make it explicit: In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice",The Acting Decision builds upon and refines Long's presumption rather than overruling it. It limits Long's application but does not reject its core holding.
112640,112205,Harris v. Reed,no,Coleman reads Harris too broadly. A predicate to the application of the Harris presumption is that the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner presented his federal claims must fairly appear to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with federal law.,The Acting Decision clarifies and limits Harris's scope but does not overrule its fundamental holding about the plain statement rule.
112640,109717,Wainwright v. Sykes,no,Our cases since Sykes have been unanimous in applying the cause and prejudice standard.,The Acting Decision reinforces and builds upon Sykes rather than overruling it.
112640,106548,Fay v. Noia,yes,"We now make it explicit: In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice... Fay was based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Fay's deliberate bypass standard and replaces it with the cause and prejudice standard.
112640,105074,Brown v. Allen,no,"In Daniels v. Allen, the companion case to Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953), we confronted a situation nearly identical to that here.",The Acting Decision cites Brown as precedent and builds upon it rather than overruling it.
112640,110692,Engle v. Isaac,no,"Our cases since Sykes have been unanimous in applying the cause and prejudice standard. Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107 (1982), held that the standard applies even in cases in which the alleged constitutional error impaired the truthfinding function of the trial.",The Acting Decision reinforces and builds upon Engle rather than overruling it.
112640,111880,Pennsylvania v. Finley,no,"There is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings. Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U.S. 551 (1987)",The Acting Decision relies on Finley as controlling precedent rather than overruling it.
112640,111727,Murray v. Carrier,no,"Murray v. Carrier considered the circumstances under which attorney error constitutes cause. [...] We rejected this claim, explaining that the costs associated with an ignorant or inadvertent procedural default are no less than where the failure to raise a claim is a deliberate strategy",The Acting Decision applies and extends Murray's principles rather than overruling them.
112640,1280169,O'BRIEN v. Socony Mobil Oil Company,no,"Coleman argues that O'Brien demonstrates that the Virginia Supreme Court will review the merits of constitutional claims before deciding whether to dismiss an appeal as untimely. The court in O'Brien did conduct such a review, but the court also explicitly declined to announce a rule that there is a constitutional exception to the time requirement for filing a notice of appeal.",The Acting Decision discusses O'Brien's holding but does not overrule it.
112640,106591,Sanders v. United States,no,"As Justice Harlan once observed, '[b]oth the individual criminal defendant and society have an interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation'",The Acting Decision cites Sanders approvingly rather than overruling it.
112640,536051,"Roger K. Coleman v. Charles Thompson, Warden",no,"See 895 F. 2d, at 143. Coleman did not petition for certiorari on this question, and we therefore accept the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the bar was adequate.",The Acting Decision affirms rather than overrules the Court of Appeals decision.
112640,109439,Francis v. Henderson,no,"Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), involved a Louisiana prisoner challenging in federal habeas the composition of the grand jury that had indicted him... We held that Francis' claim was barred in federal habeas unless he could establish cause and prejudice.",The Acting Decision cites Francis as established precedent and builds upon it rather than overruling it.
107748,90897,Civil Rights Cases,no,"Although the Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, suggest how Senator Trumbull might have expected § 2 to affect persons other than 'officers' in spite of its 'under color' language",The Acting Decision discusses and distinguishes the Civil Rights Cases but does not overrule it. The Civil Rights Cases are cited multiple times as precedent and their reasoning is built upon rather than rejected.
107748,104546,Hurd v. Hodge,no,"This Court last had occasion to consider the scope of 42 U. S. C. § 1982 in 1948, in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24",The Acting Decision relies on and expands upon Hurd v. Hodge rather than overruling it. The Court uses Hurd as supporting precedent for its analysis.
107748,1447641,Hodges v. United States,yes,"The conclusion of the majority in Hodges rested upon a concept of congressional power under the Thirteenth Amendment irreconcilable with the position taken by every member of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases and incompatible with the history and purpose of the Amendment itself. Insofar as Hodges is inconsistent with our holding today, it is hereby overruled.","The Court explicitly states that it is overruling Hodges to the extent it is inconsistent with the current holding, finding its reasoning incompatible with the purpose of the Thirteenth Amendment."
107748,100887,Corrigan v. Buckley,no,"Even if Corrigan should be regarded as an adjudication that 42 U. S. C. § 1982 does not prohibit private individuals from agreeing not to sell their property to Negroes, Corrigan would not settle the question whether § 1982 prohibits an actual refusal to sell to a Negro","While the Court questions and distinguishes Corrigan's reasoning, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it. Instead, it finds the present case presents a different question than what was decided in Corrigan."
107748,90040,Virginia v. Rives,no,"Two of this Court's early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action. Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318",The Court acknowledges Virginia v. Rives contains relevant dicta but does not overrule it. The Court merely notes its limited precedential value as dicta rather than holding.
108990,96819,Ex Parte Young,no,But the relief awarded in Ex parte Young was prospective only; the Attorney General of Minnesota was enjoined to conform his future conduct of that office to the requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment.,"The Acting Decision discusses Ex parte Young extensively but does not overrule it. Rather, it distinguishes and limits Ex parte Young's application while preserving its core holding regarding prospective relief."
108990,106821,Parden v. Terminal Railway,no,Both Parden and Employees involved a congressional enactment which by its terms authorized suit by designated plaintiffs against a general class of defendants which literally included States or state instrumentalities.,The Acting Decision discusses Parden to distinguish it from the present case but does not overrule it.
108990,108763,Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health,no,"Since Employees, supra, where Congress had expressly authorized suits against a general class of defendants and the only thing left to implication was whether the described class of defendants included States, was decided adversely to the putative plaintiffs on the waiver question, surely this respondent must also fail on that issue.",The Acting Decision relies on and applies Employees rather than overruling it.
108990,105869,Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission,no,"Similarly, Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, supra, involved congressional approval, pursuant to the Compact Clause, of a compact between Tennessee and Missouri.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Petty but does not overrule it.
108990,104057,Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury,no,"Were we to uphold this portion of the District Court's decree, we would be obligated to overrule the Court's holding in Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, supra.",The Acting Decision explicitly chooses to follow rather than overrule Ford Motor Co.
108990,307980,Jordan v. Weaver,no,"The Court of Appeals rejected these contentions and affirmed the judgment of the District Court. Jordan v. Weaver, 472 F. 2d 985 (1973).","While the Acting Decision reverses part of the lower court's judgment, this is not an overruling of precedent."
108990,108113,Rosado v. Wyman,no,We do not regard Rosado as controlling either way since the Court was not faced with a district court judgment ordering retroactive payments or with a challenge based on the Eleventh Amendment.,The Acting Decision distinguishes Rosado but does not overrule it.
108990,107743,King v. Smith,no,"We adhere to King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309 (1968), which implicitly rejected the argument that the statutory provisions for HEW review of plans should be read to curtail judicial relief.",The Acting Decision explicitly adheres to King rather than overruling it.
108990,8901897,Rothstein v. Wyman,no,"Addressing himself to a similar situation in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d 226 (CA2 1972), cert. denied, 411 U. S. 921 (1973), Judge McGowan observed for the court...",The Acting Decision cites Rothstein approvingly and relies on its reasoning rather than overruling it.
108990,102271,Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi,no,"Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934), reaffirmed the principle that the Eleventh Amendment was no bar to a suit by the United States against a State.",The Acting Decision cites Monaco for its principles rather than overruling it.
108990,107901,Shapiro v. Thompson,no,Shapiro v. Thompson and these three summary affirmances obviously are of precedential value in support of the contention that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the relief awarded by the District Court in this case.,"While the Acting Decision disapproves of certain Eleventh Amendment holdings in Shapiro, this does not constitute overruling the entire decision."
108990,108075,Wyman v. Bowens,no,Three fairly recent District Court judgments requiring state directors of public aid to make the type of retroactive payment involved here have been summarily affirmed by this Court...,"While the Acting Decision disapproves of certain aspects of Wyman regarding Eleventh Amendment issues, this does not constitute overruling the entire decision."
108990,8989511,Sterrett v. Mothers' & Children's Rights Organization,no,Three fairly recent District Court judgments requiring state directors of public aid to make the type of retroactive payment involved here have been summarily affirmed by this Court...,"While the Acting Decision disapproves of certain aspects of Sterrett regarding Eleventh Amendment issues, this does not constitute overruling the entire decision."

Zarate,no,Three fairly recent District Court judgments requiring state directors of public aid to make the type of retroactive payment involved here have been summarily affirmed by this Court...,"While the Acting Decision disapproves of certain aspects of Zarate regarding Eleventh Amendment issues, this does not constitute overruling the entire decision."
118023,110312,Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission (1980),no,"Because Rhode Island's regulation fails even the less stringent standard set out in Central Hudson, nothing here requires adoption of a new analysis for the evaluation of commercial speech regulation.","The Acting Decision applies and upholds the Central Hudson test, using it as the basis for analyzing commercial speech regulations. While the court suggests some limitations of the test, it explicitly does not overrule it."
118023,109450,"Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. (1976)",no,"In Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976), we expanded on our holding in Bigelow and held that the State's blanket ban on advertising the price of prescription drugs violated the First Amendment.","The Acting Decision reinforces and builds upon Virginia Board of Pharmacy's precedent regarding commercial speech protection, rather than overruling it."
118023,111744,Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico (1986),yes,"Because the 5-to-4 decision in Posadas marked such a sharp break from our prior precedent, and because it concerned a constitutional question about which this Court is the final arbiter, we decline to give force to its highly deferential approach.","The Acting Decision explicitly rejects Posadas' reasoning and approach to commercial speech regulation, stating it was wrongly decided and will no longer be followed."
118023,117924,Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co. (1995),no,"Last Term we held that a federal law abridging a brewer's right to provide the public with accurate information about the alcoholic content of malt beverages is unconstitutional. Rubin v.

Racine (1993)",no,"In his findings of fact, the District Judge first noted that there was a pronounced lack of unanimity among researchers who have studied the impact of advertising on the level of consumption of alcoholic beverages.","The Acting Decision discusses Racine's findings but does not overrule it; rather, it builds upon the district court's analysis."
118023,112836,"City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc. (1993)",no,"The State's regulation must indicate a 'carefu[l] calculation of the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by its prohibition.' Cincinnati v.

S. 328 (1986), and United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418 (1993), Rhode Island first argues that, because expert opinions as to the effectiveness of the price advertising ban 'go both ways,' the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the ban constituted a 'reasonable choice' by the legislature.","While the Acting Decision rejects some arguments based on Edge Broadcasting, it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule the decision itself."
118023,109649,"Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Township of Willingboro (1977)",no,"For example, in Linmark, 431 U. S., at 92-94, we concluded that a ban on 'For Sale' signs was 'content based' and failed to leave open 'satisfactory' alternative channels of communication.",The Acting Decision cites Linmark approvingly and uses it to support its analysis.
118023,117963,"Florida Bar v. Went for It, Inc. (1995)",no,"Moreover, last Term we upheld a 30-day prohibition against a certain form of legal solicitation largely because it left so many channels of communication open to Florida lawyers.

118023,2040250,Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Ass'n v. Attorney General (1985),no,"There, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that Queensgate did not control because it involved a far narrower restriction on liquor advertising than the one that Michigan had imposed.",The Acting Decision merely references this case in discussing other courts' treatment of Queensgate; it does not overrule it.
118023,108636,California v. LaRue (1973),yes,"Without questioning the holding in LaRue, we now disavow its reasoning insofar as it relied on the Twenty-first Amendment.","The Acting Decision explicitly disavows LaRue's reasoning regarding the Twenty-first Amendment, though it maintains the ultimate holding on other grounds."
112906,92534,Nielsen (1889),no,Justice Souter has apparently been led astray by his misinterpretation of the word 'incidents' in the following passage of Nielsen,"While the Acting Decision discusses Nielsen extensively, it does not overrule it.

112906,112432,Grady v. Corbin,yes,We therefore accept the Government's invitation to overrule Grady,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Grady, finding it was 'a mistake' that 'contradicted an unbroken line of decisions,' contained 'less than accurate historical analysis,' and produced 'confusion.'"
112906,109695,Brown v. Ohio,no,Brown v. Ohio contains no support for his position except a footnote that cites Nielsen,"While the Acting Decision criticizes certain interpretations of Brown, it does not overrule the decision itself."

112906,109736,Harris v. Oklahoma,no,"Harris never uses the word 'conduct,' and its entire discussion focuses on the elements of the two offenses",The Acting Decision reinterprets Harris but does not overrule it.
112906,110307,Illinois v. Vitale,no,"Justice Souter misdescribes Vitale. Despite his bold assertion to the contrary, Vitale unquestionably reads Harris as merely an application of the double jeopardy bar to lesser and greater included offenses",The Acting Decision reinterprets Vitale but does not overrule it.
112906,111893,Young v. United States Ex Rel. Vuitton Et Fils S. A.,no,"We explained in Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U. S. 787 (1987)",The Acting Decision cites Young as valid precedent and does not overrule it.

Colorado,no,"Congress, following its own conception of public policy concerning the restrictions which may appropriately be imposed on interstate commerce, is free to exclude from the commerce articles whose use in the states for which they are destined it may conceive to be injurious to the public health, morals or welfare, even though the state has not sought to regulate their use. Reid v. Colorado, supra",The Acting Decision cites Reid v. Colorado as supporting precedent for Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce
103442,103191,Mulford v. Smith,no,"So far as Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, is inconsistent with this conclusion, its doctrine is limited in principle by the decisions under the Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act, which we have cited and which we follow.

United States,no,"It is no objection to the assertion of the power to regulate interstate commerce that its exercise is attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise of the police power of the states. Seven Cases v. United States, 239 U. S. 510, 514",The Acting Decision cites Seven Cases as valid supporting precedent
103442,99412,United States v.

At best, the Ross case should be left as a relic from a different era.",The Lead Opinion explicitly states that Ross should not be followed and represents outdated thinking. The Court directly repudiates Ross's approach that the Constitution has no applicability abroad.

105525,96130,Dorr v.

105525,99954,Balzac v. Porto Rico,no,"Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U. S. 298, is not good authority for the proposition that jury trials need never be provided for American citizens tried by the United States abroad.","While the Court limits Balzac's application, it distinguishes rather than overrules it."

Catalina Foothills School District,no,"In Zobrest, we examined whether the IDEA was constitutional as applied to a deaf student who sought to bring his state-employed sign-language interpreter with him to his Roman Catholic high school. We held that this was permissible, expressly disavowing the notion that 'the Establishment Clause [laid] down [an] absolute bar to the placing of a public employee in a sectarian school.'","The Acting Decision uses Zobrest as supporting precedent and builds upon its reasoning to overturn other cases. Far from being overruled, Zobrest's principles are reinforced and expanded."
118133,111506,Aguilar v. Felton,yes,"We therefore conclude that our Establishment Clause law has 'significant[ly] change[d]' since we decided Aguilar... We therefore hold that Aguilar is not consistent with our subsequent Establishment Clause decisions and further conclude that, on the facts presented here, petitioners are entitled under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) to relief from the operation of the District Court's prospective injunction.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Aguilar, finding it inconsistent with subsequent Establishment Clause jurisprudence."
118133,111561,Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind,no,"In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U.

Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed.",no,"Certainly, no evidence has ever shown that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students.",The Acting Decision cites this case as factual background but does not overrule it.
118133,117870,Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v.

118133,112679,Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,no,"In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, supra, at 384, we held that it is appropriate to grant a Rule 60(b)(5) motion when the party seeking relief from an injunction or consent decree can show 'a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.'",The Acting Decision relies on Rufo's principles rather than overruling them.
118133,117967,Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of University of Virginia,no,"Petitioners also argue that... Aguilar has in any event been undermined by subsequent Establishment Clause decisions, including... Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995).",The Acting Decision cites Rosenberger as supporting precedent rather than overruling it.
118133,112138,Bowen v. Kendrick,no,"For example, we continue to ask whether the government acted with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting religion, and the nature of that inquiry has remained largely unchanged. See...

117947,110338,Fullilove v. Klutznick,no,"Of course, it follows that to the extent (if any) that Fullilove held federal racial classifications to be subject to a less rigorous standard, it is no longer controlling. But we need not decide today whether the program upheld in Fullilove would survive strict scrutiny as our more recent cases have defined it.","While the Acting Decision modifies how Fullilove should be interpreted going forward, it explicitly states it is not overruling the actual holding in Fullilove."
117947,112176,City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co.,no,"With Croson, the Court finally agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict scrutiny of all race-based action by state and local governments.",The Acting Decision affirms and builds upon Croson rather than overruling it.

Federal Communications Commission",yes,"To the extent that Metro Broadcasting is inconsistent with that holding, it is overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Metro Broadcasting's holding that federal racial classifications need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny.

S. 267 (1986), the Court considered a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to another form of remedial racial classification.",The Acting Decision cites and builds upon Wygant's precedent rather than overruling it.

117947,103875,Hirabayashi v. United States,no,"These ideas have long been central to this Court's understanding of equal protection, and holding 'benign' state and federal racial classifications to different standards does not square with them.","While critical of aspects of Hirabayashi, the Acting Decision does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it."
117947,105222,Bolling v. Sharpe,no,"Bolling relied on those observations, and reiterated 'that the Constitution of the United States, in its present form, forbids, so far as civil and political rights are concerned, discrimination by the General Government, or by the States'",The Acting Decision affirms and builds upon Bolling's precedent rather than overruling it.
117947,1879640,"Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner",no,The District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment.,"The Acting Decision discusses this lower court ruling but does not overrule it, as it is not a Supreme Court precedent to overrule."
117947,109469,Washington v. Davis,no,"(We note, incidentally, that this case concerns only classifications based explicitly on race, and presents none of the additional difficulties posed by laws that, although facially race neutral, result in racially disproportionate impact and are motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose.)",The Acting Decision distinguishes its scope from Davis rather than overruling it.
117947,104040,Korematsu v. United States,no,Korematsu demonstrates vividly that even 'the most rigid scrutiny' can sometimes fail to detect an illegitimate racial classification,"While highly critical of Korematsu, the Acting Decision does not explicitly or implicitly overrule it."
117947,111827,United States v.
