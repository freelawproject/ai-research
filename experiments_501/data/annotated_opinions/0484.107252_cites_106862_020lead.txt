 Thus we may view the historical development of the privilege as one which groped for the proper scope of governmental power over the citizen.  As a “noble principle often transcends its origins,” the privilege has come rightfully to be recognized in part as an individual’s substantive right, a “right to a private enclave where he may lead a private life. That right is the hallmark of our democracy.” United States v. Grunewald, 233 F. 2d 556, 579, 581-582 (Frank, J., dissenting), rev’d, 353 U. S. 391 (1957).  We have recently noted that the privilege against self-incrimination — the essential mainstay of our adversary system — is founded on a complex of values, Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n, 378 U. S. 52, 55-57, n. 5 (1964); Tehan v. Shott, 382 U. S. 406, 414-415, n. 12 (1966).  All these policies point to one overriding thought: the constitutional foundation underlying the privilege is the respect a government — state or federal— must accord to the dignity and integrity of its citizens.  To maintain a “fair state-individual balance,” to require the government “to shoulder the entire load,” 8 Wigmore, Evidence 317 (McNaughton rev. 1961), to respect the inviolability of the human personality, our accusatory system of criminal justice demands that the government seeking to punish an individual produce the evidence against him by its own independent labors, rather than by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own mouth.  Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227, 235-238 (1940).  In sum, the privilege is fulfilled only when the person is guaranteed the right “to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will.” Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1, 8</citedDecision> (1964).  The question in these cases is whether the privilege is fully applicable during a period of custodial interroga *461 tion.  In this Court, the privilege has consistently been accorded a liberal construction.  Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70, 81 (1965); Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S.. 479, 486 (1951); Arndstein v. McCarthy, 254 U. S. 71, 72-73 (1920); Counselman v. Hitchock, 142 U. S. 547, 562 (1892).  We are satisfied that all the principles embodied in the privilege apply to informal compulsion exerted by law-enforcement officers during in-custody questioning.  An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak.  As a practical matter, the compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the police station may well be greater than in courts or other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery.

 In fact, the Government concedes this point as well established in No. 761, Westover v. United States, stating: “We have no doubt .  .  .  that it is possible for a suspect’s Fifth Amendment right to be violated during in-custody questioning by a law-enforcement officer.” 31 Because of the adoption by Congress of Rule 5 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and this Court’s effectuation of that Rule in McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943), and Mallory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449 (1957), we have had little occasion in the past quarter century to reach the constitutional issues in dealing with federal interrogations.  These supervisory rules, requiring production of an arrested person before a commissioner “without unnecessary delay” and excluding evidence obtained in default of that statutory obligation, were nonetheless responsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment policy that unavoidably face us now as to the States.  In McNabb, 318 U. S., at 343-344 , and in Mallory, 354 U. S., at 455-456 , we recognized both the dangers of interrogation and the appropriateness of prophylaxis stemming from the very fact of interrogation itself.  32 Our decision in Malloy v. Hogan, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1964), necessitates an examination of the scope of the privilege in state cases as well.  In <citedDecision>Malloy</citedDecision> , we squarely held the *464 privilege applicable to the States, and held that the substantive standards underlying the privilege applied with full force to state court proceedings.  There, as in Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n, 378 U. S. 52 (1964), and Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), we applied the existing Fifth Amendment standards to the case before us.  Aside from the holding itself, the reasoning in <citedDecision>Malloy</citedDecision> made clear what had already become apparent — that the substantive and procedural safeguards surrounding admissibility of confessions in state cases had become exceedingly exacting, reflecting all the policies embedded in the privilege, 378 U. S., at 7-8.  33 The voluntariness doctrine in the state cases, as <citedDecision>Malloy</citedDecision> indicates, encompasses all interrogation practices which are likely to exert such pressure upon an individual as to disable him from *465 making a free and rational choice.  34 The implications of this proposition were elaborated in our decision in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 , decided one week after <citedDecision>Malloy</citedDecision> applied the privilege to the States.  Our holding there stressed the fact that the police had not advised the defendant of his constitutional privilege to remain silent at the outset of the interrogation, and we drew attention to that fact at several points in the decision, 378 U. S., at 483, 485, 491.  This was no isolated factor, but an essential ingredient in our decision.  The entire thrust of police interrogation there, as in all the cases today, was to put the defendant in such an emotional state as to impair his capacity for rational judgment.  The abdication of the constitutional privilege— the choice on his part to speak to the police — was not made knowingly or competently because of the failure to apprise him of his rights; the compelling atmosphere of the in-custody interrogation, and not an independent decision on his part, caused the defendant to speak.  A different phase of the Escobedo decision was significant in its attention to the absence of counsel during the questioning.  There, as in the cases today, we sought a protective device to dispel the compelling atmosphere of the interrogation.

 Independent of any other constitutional proscription, this action constitutes a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel and excludes any statement obtained in its *466 wake.  See People v. Donovan, 13 N. Y. 2d 148, 193 N. E. 2d 628 , 243 N. Y. S. 2d 841 (1963) (Fuld, J.).  In re Groban, 352 U. S. 330, 340-352 (1957) (Black, J., dissenting); Note, 73 Yale L. J. 1000, 1048-1051 (1964); Comment, 31 U. Chi. L. Rev. 313 , 320 (1964) and authorities cited.  See p. 454, supra. Lord Devlin has commented: “It is probable that even today, when there is much less ignorance about these matters than formerly, there is still a general belief that you must answer all questions put to you by a policeman, or at least that it will be the worse for you if you do not.” Devlin, The Criminal Prosecution in England 32 (1958).  In accord with our decision today, it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation.  The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.  Cf. Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965); Malloy v.
