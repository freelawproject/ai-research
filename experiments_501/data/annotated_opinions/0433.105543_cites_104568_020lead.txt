**Lead Opinion**
 While the New York court found the Nevada decree valid and held that it had effectively dissolved the marriage, it nevertheless entered an order, under § 1170-b *418 of the New York Civil Practice Act, 4 directing petitioner to make designated support payments to respondent.  207 Misc. 294 , 138 N. Y. S. 2d 222.  The New York Court of Appeals upheld the support order.  1 N. Y. 2d 342, 135 N. E. 2d 553 .  Petitioner then applied to this Court for certiorari contending that § 1170-b, as applied, is unconstitutional because it contravenes the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  5 We granted certiorari, 352 U. S. 820 .  In Estin v. Estin, <citedDecision>334 U. S. 541</citedDecision> , this Court decided that a Nevada divorce court, which had no personal jurisdiction over the wife, had no power to terminate a husband’s obligation to provide her support as required in a preexisting New York separation decree.  The factor which distinguishes the present case from <citedDecision>Estin</citedDecision> is that here the wife’s right to support had not been reduced to judgment prior to the husband’s ex parte divorce.  In our opinion this difference is not material on the question before us.  Since the wife was not subject to its jurisdiction, the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which she had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband.  It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.  6 Here, the Nevada divorce court *419 was as powerless to cut off the wife’s support right as it would have been to order the husband to pay alimony if the wife had brought the divorce action and he had not been subject to the divorce court’s jurisdiction.  Therefore, the Nevada decree, to the extent it purported to affect the wife’s right to support, was void and the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not obligate New York to give it recognition.  7 Petitioner claims that this case is governed by Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551 .  For the reasons given in a concurring opinion in Armstrong v. Armstrong, 350 U. S. 568, 575 , at 580-581, the Thompson case, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.  Affirmed.  The Chief Justice took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. It seems clear that in Nevada the effect of this decree was to put an end to the husband’s duty to support the wife — provided, of course, that the Nevada courts had power to do this.  Sweeney v.
