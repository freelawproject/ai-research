 That was the thrust of the Schwartz opinion: “Although the intercepted calls would be inadmissible in a federal court, it does not follow that such evidence is inadmissible in a state court. Indeed, evidence obtained by a state officer by means which would constitute an unlawful search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution is nonetheless admissible in a state court, Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 , while such evidence, if obtained by a federal officer, would be clearly inadmissible in a federal court. Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 .” Ibid. The fact that a state official would be violating the express terms of the federal statute by the very act of divulging the intercepted communications as evidence for the prosecution at the trial, the Court in Schwartz said, was “simply an additional factor for a state to consider in formulating a rule of evidence for use in its own courts.” Ibid. But in Benanti v. United States, 355 U. S. 96 , five years later, the Court returned to the teaching of Nardone in giving emphatic recognition to the language of the statute that itself makes illegal the divulgence of intercepted communications.  In Benanti the Court held inadmissible in a federal trial communications that had been intercepted by state officers.  7 “Section 605,” the Court said, “contains an express, absolute prohibition against the divulgence of intercepted communications.” 355 U. S., at 102.  *385 After the Benanti decision, therefore, the only remaining support for Schwartz v. Texas, supra, was the holding in Wolf v. Colorado, supra, that state courts, unlike federal courts, were free to decide for themselves whether to condone violations of federal law by accepting the products of such violations as evidence.  That doctrinal underpinning of the Schwartz decision was, of course, completely removed by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , which overruled Wolf and squarely held that evidence obtained by state officers in an unreasonable search is inadmissible in a state criminal trial. In view of the Nardone and Benanti decisions, 8 the doctrine of Schwartz v. Texas cannot survive the demise of Wolf v. Colorado, supra. In the Mapp case, the Court in overruling Wolf imposed a judicially devised exclusionary rule in order to insure that a State could not adopt rules of evidence calculated to permit the invasion of rights protected by federal organic law. In the present case the federal law itself explicitly protects intercepted communications from divulgence, in a court or any other place.  But the decision we reach today is not based upon language and doctrinal symmetry alone.  It is buttressed as well by the “imperative of judicial integrity.” Elkins v. United States, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 206, 222</citedDecision> .  9 Under our Consti *386 tution no court, state or federal, may serve as an accomplice in the willful transgression of “the Laws of the United States,” laws by which “the Judges in every State [are] bound .  .  .  .” 10 Finally, our decision today is counseled by experience.  The hope was expressed in Schwartz v. Texas that “[enforcement of the statutory prohibition in § 605 can be achieved under the penal provisions” of the Communications Act.  344 U. S., at 201 .  11 That has proved to be a vain hope.  Research has failed to uncover a single reported prosecution of a law enforcement officer for violation of § 605 since the statute was enacted.  12 We conclude, as we concluded in <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> and in Mapp , that *387 nothing short of mandatory exclusion of the illegal evidence will compel respect for the federal law “in the only effectively available way — by removing the incentive to disregard it.” <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>364 U. S., at 217</citedDecision> .  Reversed.  Lee v. State, 191 So. 2d 84 .  389 U. S. 1033 .  Issues under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments were also presented in the petition for certiorari.  We do not reach those issues.

 The court based its conclusions upon several previous Florida cases: Perez v. State, 81 So. 2d 201 ; Williams v. State, 109 So. 2d 379 ; Griffith v. State, 111 So. 2d 282 ; Barber v. State, 172 So. 2d 857 .  A party-line user’s privacy is obviously vulnerable, but it does not necessarily follow that his telephone conversations are completely unprotected by § 605.  In many areas of the country private telephone lines are not available; in other areas they are available only at higher rates than party lines.  There is nothing in the language or history of § 605 to indicate that Congress meant to afford any less protection to those who, by virtue of geography or financial hardship, must use party-line telephones.  Section 605 prohibits interception and divulgence of intrastate as well as interstate communications.  Weiss v. United States, 308 U. S. 321 .  It was not until two Terms later, in Elkins v. United States, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 206</citedDecision> , that the Court repudiated the “silver platter doctrine,” under which evidence obtained by state officers in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments could be received as evidence in federal courts.  See also the second Nardone case, Nardone v. United States, 308 U. S. 338 .  “[I]t cannot be lawful to authorize what is an illegal act.  .  .  .  [I]f the police officer violates the Federal statute by tapping wires notwithstanding a warrant issued out of this court pursuant to New York law — if that act be illegal — those who set the act in motion have condoned if not instigated illegality.

**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Black, dissenting. In 1937, Nardone v. United States, 302 U. S. 379 , held that 47 U. S. C. § 605 forbids the introduction of intercepted and divulged telephone conversations in federal courts. In Schwartz v. Texas, 344 U. S. 199 (1952), this Court held, however, that the section does not forbid the use of such evidence in state criminal trials, saying: “[W]e do not believe that Congress intended to impose a rule of evidence on the state courts.” 344 U. S., at 203 . I thought the holding in Schwartz was correct then and still think so. The Court holds, however, that § 605 now compels state courts to exclude such intercepted telephone messages from state trials. The effect of this holding is to overrule Schwartz v. Texas . The Court’s holding is made despite the fact that Congress itself has not changed the section. Nor does Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), undermine Schwartz as the Court intimates, for in Schwartz we dealt, as we do here, with conduct that violates only a federal statute and so deserves only the sanctions contemplated by that statute. The Communications Act explicitly provides for penal sanctions, 47 U. S. C. § 501 , and some civil remedies might be implied as a matter of federal law, cf. J. I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U. S. 426 (1964). But the creation by statute of a federal substantive right does not mean that the States are required by the Supremacy Clause to give every procedural trial remedy afforded by federal courts or that failure to afford such remedies renders the State “an accomplice in the willful transgression of 'the Laws of the United States.’ ” Ante, at 386. *388 I think it would be more appropriate for the Court to leave this job of rewriting § 605 to the Congress. Waiting for Congress to rewrite its law, however, is too slow for the Court in this day of the rapid creation of new judicial rules, many of which inevitably tend to make conviction of criminals more difficult. I cannot agree that there is the slightest justification for overruling Schwartz and would affirm these Florida gambling convictions.
