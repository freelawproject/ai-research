 Argued April 21-22, 1970 Decided June 1, 1970 CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.  *236 Joseph M. McLaughlin argued the cause and filed briefs for petitioner.  Kenneth M. Schwartz argued the cause for respondent.  With him on the brief were Laurence D. Steinsapir and Robert M. Dohrmann.  *237 Briefs of amici curiae were filed by William H. Willcox and Lawrence M. Cohen for the Chamber of Commerce of the United States; by George R. Fearon for Associated Industries of New York State, Inc.; by John E. Branch and James Pulm Swann, Jr., for General Electric Co.; by Carl M. Gould and Stanley E. Tobin for the Plumbing-Heating & Piping Employers Council of Southern California, Inc.; by Harold I.  Elbert for Peabody Coal Co.; and by J. Albert Woll, Laurence Gold, and Thomas E. Harris for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations.  MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court. In this case we re-examine the holding of Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, <citedDecision>370 U. S. 195</citedDecision> (1962), that the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act [1] preclude a federal district court from enjoining a strike in breach of a no-strike obligation under a collective-bargaining *238 agreement, even though that agreement contains provisions, enforceable under § 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, [2] for binding arbitration of the grievance dispute concerning which the strike was called.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, considering itself bound by Sinclair, reversed the grant by the District Court for the Central District of California of petitioner's prayer for injunctive relief.  416 F. 2d 368 (1969).  We granted certiorari.  396 U. S. 1000 (1970).  Having concluded that Sinclair was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity, we overrule that decision and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I In February 1969, at the time of the incidents that produced this litigation, petitioner and respondent were parties to a collective-bargaining agreement which provided, inter alia, that all controversies concerning its interpretation or application should be resolved by adjustment and arbitration procedures set forth therein [3] and that, during the life of the contract, there should *239 be "no cessation or stoppage of work, lock-out, picketing or boycotts .
**Combined Opinion**
 Furthermore, an action for damages prosecuted during or after a labor dispute would only tend to aggravate industrial strife and delay an early resolution of the difficulties between employer and union.  [17] *249 Even if management is not encouraged by the unavailability of the injunction remedy to resist arbitration agreements, the fact remains that the effectiveness of such agreements would be greatly reduced if injunctive relief were withheld.  Indeed, the very purpose of arbitration procedures is to provide a mechanism for the expeditious settlement of industrial disputes without resort to strikes, lockouts, or other self-help measures.  This basic purpose is obviously largely undercut if there is no immediate, effective remedy for those very tactics that arbitration is designed to obviate.  Thus, because Sinclair, in the aftermath of Avco, casts serious doubt upon the effective enforcement of a vital element of stable labor-management relationsarbitration agreements with their attendant no-strike obligationswe conclude that Sinclair does not make a viable contribution to federal labor policy.  IV We have also determined that the dissenting opinion in Sinclair states the correct principles concerning the accommodation necessary between the seemingly absolute terms of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the policy considerations underlying § 301 (a).  [18] <citedDecision>370 U. S., at 215</citedDecision> .  *250 Although we need not repeat all that was there said, a few points should be emphasized at this time.  The literal terms of § 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act must be accommodated to the subsequently enacted provisions of § 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act and the purposes of arbitration.  Statutory interpretation requires more than concentration upon isolated words; rather, consideration must be given to the total corpus of pertinent law and the policies that inspired ostensibly inconsistent provisions.  See Richards v. United States, 369 U. S. 1, 11 (1962); Mastro Plastics Corp. v. NLRB, 350 U. S. 270, 285 (1956); United States v. Hutcheson, 312 U. S. 219, 235 (1941).  The Norris-LaGuardia Act was responsive to a situation totally different from that which exists today.  In the early part of this century, the federal courts generally were regarded as allies of management in its attempt to prevent the organization and strengthening of labor unions; and in this industrial struggle the injunction became a potent weapon that was wielded against the activities of labor groups.
**Combined Opinion**
 We do not undermine the vitality of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  We deal only with the situation in which a collective-bargaining contract contains a mandatory grievance adjustment or arbitration procedure.  Nor does it follow from what we have said that injunctive relief is appropriate *254 as a matter of course in every case of a strike over an arbitrable grievance.  The dissenting opinion in Sinclair suggested the following principles for the guidance of the district courts in determining whether to grant injunctive reliefprinciples that we now adopt: "A District Court entertaining an action under § 301 may not grant injunctive relief against concerted activity unless and until it decides that the case is one in which an injunction would be appropriate despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act.  When a strike is sought to be enjoined because it is over a grievance which both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate, the District Court may issue no injunctive order until it first holds that the contract does have that effect; and the employer should be ordered to arbitrate, as a condition of his obtaining an injunction against the strike.  Beyond this, the District Court, must, of course, consider whether issuance of an injunction would be warranted under ordinary principles of equitywhether breaches are occurring and will continue, or have been threatened and will be committed; whether they have caused or will cause irreparable injury to the employer; and whether the employer will suffer more from the denial of an injunction than will the union from its issuance." <citedDecision>370 U. S., at 228</citedDecision> .  (Emphasis in original.) In the present case there is no dispute that the grievance in question was subject to adjustment and arbitration under the collective-bargaining agreement and that the petitioner was ready to proceed with arbitration at the time an injunction against the strike was sought and obtained.  The District Court also concluded that, by reason of respondent's violations of its no-strike obligation, petitioner "has suffered irreparable injury and will continue to suffer irreparable injury." Since we now *255 overrule Sinclair, the holding of the Court of Appeals in reliance on Sinclair must be reversed.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case with directions to enter a judgment affirming the order of the District Court. It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL took no part in the decision of this case. MR. JUSTICE STEWART, concurring.  When Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, <citedDecision>370 U. S. 195</citedDecision> , was decided in 1962, I subscribed to the opinion of the Court. Before six years had passed I had reached the conclusion that the Sinclair holding should be reconsidered, and said so in Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge 735, 390 U. S. 557, 562 (concurring opinion).  Today I join the Court in concluding "that Sinclair was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity .  .  .  ." In these circumstances the temptation is strong to embark upon a lengthy personal apologia.  But since MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN has so clearly stated my present views in his opinion for the Court today, I simply join in that opinion and in the Court's judgment.

Henslee v. Union Planters Bank, 335 U. S. 595, 600 (dissenting opinion).  MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.  Congress in 1932 enacted the Norris-LaGuardia Act, § 4 of which, 29 U. S. C. § 104 , with exceptions not here relevant, specifically prohibited federal courts in the broadest and most comprehensive language from *256 issuing any injunctions, temporary or permanent, against participation in a labor dispute.  Subsequently, in 1947, Congress gave jurisdiction to the federal courts in "[s]uits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization." Although this subsection, § 301 (a) of the Taft-Hartley Act, 29 U. S. C. § 185 (a), explicitly waives the diversity and amount-in-controversy requirements for federal jurisdiction, it says nothing at all about granting injunctions.  Eight years ago this Court considered the relation of these two statutes: after full briefing and argument, relying on the language and history of the Acts, the Court decided that Congress did not wish this later statute to impair in any way Norris-LaGuardia's explicit prohibition against injunctions in labor disputes.  Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, <citedDecision>370 U. S. 195</citedDecision> (1962).  Although Congress has been urged to overrule our holding in Sinclair, it has steadfastly refused to do so. Nothing in the language or history of the two Acts has changed.  Nothing at all has changed, in fact, except the membership of the Court and the personal views of one Justice.  I remain of the opinion that Sinclair was correctly decided, and, moreover, that the prohibition of the Norris-LaGuardia Act is close to the heart of the entire federal system of labor regulation.  In my view Sinclair should control the disposition of this case. Even if the majority were correct, however, in saying that Sinclair misinterpreted the Taft-Hartley and Norris-LaGuardia Acts, I should be compelled to dissent.  I believe that both the making and the changing of laws which affect the substantial rights of the people are primarily for Congress, not this Court. Most especially is this so when the laws involved are the focus of strongly held views of powerful but antagonistic political and economic interests.  The Court's function in the application and interpretation of such laws must be carefully limited to avoid encroaching on the power of *257 Congress to determine policies and make laws to carry them out.

 And it is Congress, not this Court, that is elected by the people.  This Court should, therefore, interject itself as little as possible into the law-making and law-changing process.  Having given our view on the meaning of a statute, our task is concluded, absent extraordinary circumstances.  When the Court changes its mind years later, simply because the judges have changed, in my judgment, it takes upon itself the function of the legislature.  The legislative effect of the Court's reversal is especially clear here.  In Sinclair the Court invited Congress to act if it should be displeased with the judicial interpretation of the statute.  We said, <citedDecision>370 U. S., at 214</citedDecision> -215: "Strong arguments are made to us that it is highly desirable that the Norris-LaGuardia Act be changed in the public interest.  If that is so, Congress itself might see fit to change that law and repeal the anti-injunction provisions of the Act insofar as suits for violation of collective agreements are concerned, as the House bill under consideration originally provided.  It might, on the other hand, decide that if injunctions are necessary, the whole idea of enforcement of these agreements by private suits should *259 be discarded in favor of enforcement through the administrative machinery of the Labor Board, as Senator Taft provided in his Senate bill.  Or it might decide that neither of these methods is entirely satisfactory and turn instead to a completely new approach.  The question of what change, if any, should be made in the existing law is one of legislative policy properly within the exclusive domain of Congressit is a question for lawmakers, not law interpreters." Commentators on our holding found this invitation to legislative action clear, and judicial self-restraint proper.  See Dunau, Three Problems in Labor Arbitration, 55 Va. L. Rev. 427 , 464-465 (1969); Wellington & Albert, Statutory Interpretation and the Political Process: A Comment on Sinclair v. Atkinson, 72 Yale L. J. 1547, 1565-1566 (1963).

 For example, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS noted in dissent in Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 133-134 (1965): "An error in interpreting a federal statute may be easily remedied.  If this Court has failed to perceive the intention of Congress, or has interpreted a statute in such a manner as to thwart the legislative purpose, Congress may change it.  The lessons of experience are not learned by judges alone." See also United Gas Improvement Co. v. Continental Oil Co., 381 U. S. 392, 406 (1965) (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting).  Apparently, however, some members of the Court are willing to give greater weight to stare decisis in constitutional than in statutory matters.  See, e. g., Orozco v. Texas, 394 U. S. 324, 327-328 (1969) (HARLAN, J., concurring).  MR. JUSTICE WHITE dissents for the reasons stated in the majority opinion in Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson, <citedDecision>370 U. S. 195</citedDecision> (1962).
