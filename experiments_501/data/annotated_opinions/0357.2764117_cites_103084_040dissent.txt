**Dissenting Opinion**
 honored, had required of the Massachusetts court explicit i avowal of the presumption in favor of the Florida and j Nevada decrees, I should have remained silent.  But the .j crux of today’s decision is that regardless of how overr: whelming the evidence may have been that the asserted', domicile in the State offering bargain-counter divorces was a sham, the home State of the parties is not permitted j to question the matter if the form of a controversy has \ been gone through.  To such a proposition I canjapt-d assent.  pDecisibns of this Court that have not stood the test of time have been due not to want of foresight by the prescient Framers of the Constitution, but to misconceptions regarding its requirements.

That case did not depend for its result on the fact that there had been an adjudication of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the divorce enforced, inasmuch as this Court found that the State granting the divorce was in fact that of the domicile.  305 U. S. at 41.  Moreover this Court’s citation therein of Andrews v. Andrews, *359 supra, indicates an absence of intention to overrule the holding of that case that opportunity to litigate the issue of domicile does not foreclose inquiry as to the true facts.  Andrews v. Andrews has since been cited with respect, as recently as Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 309, 320, n. 7 , and 325 U. S. 226, 229, 240, 242 .
