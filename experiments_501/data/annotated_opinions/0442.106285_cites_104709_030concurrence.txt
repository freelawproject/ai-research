**Concurrence Opinion**
 Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 ; Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 .  For, as stated in the former decision, “The effect of the Fourth Amendment is to put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints .  .  .  .” Id., 391-392.  It was therefore held that evidence obtained (which in that case was documents and correspondence) from a home without any warrant was not admissible in a federal prosecution.  We held in Wolf v. Colorado, <citedDecision>338 U. S. 25</citedDecision> , that the Fourth Amendment was applicable to the States by reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  But a majority held that the exclusionary rule of the Weeks case was not required of the States, that they could apply such sanctions as they chose.  That position had the necessary votes to carry the day. But with all respect it was not the voice of reason or principle.  *670 As stated in the Weeks case, if evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment can be used against an accused, “his right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value, and .  .  .  might as well be stricken from the Constitution.” 232 U. S., at 393 .  When we allowed States to give constitutional sanction to the “shabby business” of unlawful entry into a home (to use an expression of Mr. Justice Murphy, <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> , at 46), we did indeed rob the Fourth Amendment of much meaningful force.  There are, of course, other theoretical remedies.  One is disciplinary action within the hierarchy of the police system, including prosecution of the police officer for a crime.  Yet as Mr. Justice Murphy said in <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> , at 42, “Self-scrutiny is a lofty ideal, but its exaltation reaches new heights if we expect a District Attorney to prosecute himself or his associates for well-meaning violations of the search and seizure clause during a raid the District Attorney or his associates have ordered.” The only remaining remedy, if exclusion of the evidence is not required, is an action of trespass by the homeowner against the offending officer.  Mr. Justice Murphy showed how onerous and difficult it would be for the citizen to maintain that action and how meagre the relief even if the citizen prevails.  338 U. S. 42 -44.  The truth is that trespass actions against officers who make unlawful searches and seizures are mainly illusory remedies.  Without judicial action making the exclusionary rule applicable to the States, <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> in practical effect reduced the guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures to “a dead letter,” as Mr. Justice Rutledge said in his dissent.  See <citedDecision>338 U. S., at 47</citedDecision> .  <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado, supra,</citedDecision> was decided in 1949.  The immediate result was a storm of constitutional controversy which only today finds its end.  I believe that this is an appropriate case in which to put an end to the asymmetry which <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> imported into the law. See *671 Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 ; Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; Elkins v. United States, supra; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 .  It is an appropriate case because the facts it presents show — as would few other cases— the casual arrogance of those who have the untrammelled power to invade one’s home and to seize one’s person.  It is also an appropriate case in the narrower and more technical sense.  The issues of the illegality of the search and the admissibility of the evidence have been presented to the state court and were duly raised here in accordance with the applicable Rule of Practice.  4 The question was raised in the notice of appeal, the jurisdictional statement and in appellant’s brief on the merits.  5 It is true that argument was mostly directed to another issue in the case, but that is often the fact.  See Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 535-540 .  Of course, an earnest advocate of a position always believes that, had he only an additional opportunity for argument, his side would win. But, subject to the sound discretion of a court, all argument must at last come to a halt.  This is especially so as to an issue about which this Court said last year that “The arguments of its antagonists and of its proponents have been so many times marshalled as to require no lengthy elaboration here.” Elkins v. United States, supra, 216.  Moreover, continuance of <citedDecision>Wolf</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Colorado</citedDecision> in its full vigor breeds the unseemly shopping around of the kind revealed in Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U. S. 381 .  Once evidence, inadmissible in a federal court, is admissible in *672 a state court a “double standard” exists which, as the Court points out, leads to “working arrangements” that undercut federal policy and reduce some aspects of law enforcement to shabby business.  The rule that supports that practice does not have the force of reason behind it.  Memorandum of Me. Justice Stewart.  Agreeing fully with Part I of Me. Justice Harlan’s dissenting opinion, I express no view as to the merits of the constitutional issue which the Court today decides.  I would, however, reverse the judgment in this case, because I am persuaded that the provision of § 2905.34 of the Ohio Revised Code, upon which the petitioner’s conviction was based, is, in the words of Mr. Justice Harlan, not “consistent with the rights of free thought and expression assured against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment.” This “confidential source” told the police, in the same breath, that “there was a large amount of policy paraphernalia being hidden in the home.” The purported warrant has disappeared from the case. The State made no attempt to prove its existence, issuance or contents, either at the trial or on the hearing of a preliminary motion to suppress.  The Supreme Court of Ohio said: “There is, in the record, considerable doubt as to whether there ever was any warrant for the search of defendant’s home.
