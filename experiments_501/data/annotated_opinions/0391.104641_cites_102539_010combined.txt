**Combined Opinion**
Mr. Justice Rutledge delivered the opinion of the Court. The principal question is whether a lessee of mineral rights in allotted and restricted Indian lands is immunized by the Constitution against payment of nondiscriminatory state gross production taxes and state excise taxes on petroleum produced from such lands.  In effect the issue is whether this Court’s previous decisions in Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U. S. 503 ; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U. S. 549 ; and Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, <citedDecision>296 U. S. 521</citedDecision> , invalidating such taxes as applied to like lessees, have been so undermined by later decisions, in particular Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376 , that they should now be overruled.  With certain exceptions, 1 the lands from which was extracted the petroleum sought to be taxed are held in *344 trust by the United States, pursuant to allotments made under the General Allotment Act, 2 for various members of the Pottawatomie, Apache, Comanche, and Otoe and Missouria Tribes.  3 All the lands are located within the State of Oklahoma and at all material times they were restricted 4 against alienation by the Indian cestui owners without the consent of the Secretary of the Interior.  5 He *345 approved each of the leases now in question.  The respondents Texas Company (No. 40) and Magnolia Petroleum Company (No. 41) acquired their leases before Oklahoma levied the assessments now in issue, either as original lessees or by assignment from non-Indians who were such lessees.  The companies thus became owners of all right, title and interest in their respective leases, subject only to the one-eighth royalty interest reserved to the Indian lessors, and were such owners at the times of the respective assessments.  It may be taken that they have operated the leases in conformity with the applicable regulations of the Department of the Interior 6 and of the State of Oklahoma, 7 except for the payment of the state taxes in question.
**Combined Opinion**
 It is imposed on every person engaged in the production in Oklahoma of petroleum, crude oil or other mineral oil, and natural gas and casinghead gas.  The tax is exacted in lieu of all taxes by the state *346 and its political subdivisions on property rights in minerals and mineral rights, producing leases, machinery used in connection with any oil or gas well, the oil and gas during the tax year in which it is produced, and any investment in any leases, minerals, or other property.  The statute authorizes the state board of equalization to raise or lower the rate of tax to equate the amount payable with the amount which would be payable if the general ad valorem property tax were assessed against the property of the producers subject to taxation.  The board’s rate changes are subject to review by the state supreme court. 9 In consequence of these provisions, the tax has been construed consistently by the state courts to be a tax on the lessee’s property, not an occupation or excise tax. 10 *347 The petroleum excise tax requires payment of one mill, formerly one-eighth of one cent, 11 per barrel on every barrel of petroleum produced in Oklahoma.  The statute was enacted first in 1933 to defray the expenses of administering the state’s newly adopted proration law 12 and has been reenacted at each subsequent session of the legislature.  13 The tax, unlike the gross production tax, is construed by the Oklahoma Supreme Court as an excise tax on the production of oil.  Barnsdall Refineries v. Oklahoma Tax Commission, 171 Okla. 145 , affirmed, <citedDecision>296 U. S. 521</citedDecision> .  In No. 40 the Oklahoma Tax Commission, petitioner here, assessed both gross production and petroleum excise taxes against the Texas Company for production, less royalties to the Indian lessors, 14 during September, Oc *348 tober and November, 1942.  In No. 41 the commission likewise assessed both taxes, less royalties, on the Magnolia Company’s production for various periods between June 1, 1942, and March 1, 1946.  The orders were entered after the cases were consolidated for hearing before the commission and were thus heard by it.  In No. 40 the Texas Company paid the taxes under protest and brought suit to recover them in an Oklahoma trial court. After hearing, that court sustained the commission’s demurrer to the company’s amended petition and ordered it dismissed.  Appeal was duly taken to the state supreme court. In No. 41, following a different statutory procedure, the Magnolia Company appealed from the assessments against it directly to that court. In both cases the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, with one judge dissenting, held the assessments invalid.  The decisions rested flatly on the ground that the lessee was an instrumentality of the Federal Government and as such, under prior and controlling decisions of this Court, particularly in the Large Oil, Gipsy Oil, and Barnsdall Refineries cases, supra, not subject to the taxes in question.

 The opinion, indicating the writer’s personal view that reconsideration of the earlier decisions well might be sought, nevertheless stated: “But it is thought beyond the power of this court to now engage in such reconsideration, in view of the cited decisions of the higher authority which thus far wholly sustain the claim of [the Texas Company] to immunity from the tax here involved.  “Upon questions of federal law, citizens and their attorneys have the right to rely upon decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, and upon such questions it is our fixed duty to follow such decisions, leaving to the United States Congress or Supreme Court the making of the necessary changes in such legal rules.” From the state supreme court’s decisions 16 the Oklahoma Tax Commission filed appeals in this Court. We dismissed the appeals for want of jurisdiction.  But treating them as applications for certiorari, 17 we granted the writs and consolidated the cases for argument.  333 U. S. 870 .  The Solicitor General was requested to file a brief as amicus curiae.  I.  But for the course of decision here from Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. Harrison, 235 U. S. 292 , decided in 1914, to *350 Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, <citedDecision>296 U. S. 521</citedDecision> , decided in 1936, the problems of taxation and intergovernmental immunity these cases present would seem subject to solution on well-settled or fairly obvious legal principles.  It has long been established that property owned by a private person and used by him in performing services for the Federal Government is subject to state and local ad valorem taxes.  18 And the oil and gas produced is, of course, subject to such taxation.  Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, 288 U. S. 325 .  Both by the substance of the statute’s explicit provisions and by the consistent construction of the Oklahoma Supreme Court, 19 ' that state’s so-called gross production tax in its presently applicable form is a tax on the lessee’s property used in carrying- out its contractual obligations with the Federal Government and on the oil and gas during the tax year in which it was produced.  The tax is levied expressly in lieu of all property taxes which the state might constitutionally impose in ad valorem form, the gross production levy being a tentative measure for the value of that property.  To guard against that measure’s being utilized to lay in effect a tax not actually of that character, the state board of equalization is authorized, indeed is required upon complaint, to equate the amount payable with what would be payable if the general ad valorem tax were assessed against the property of the producing lessees subject to taxation, with provision for judicial review of the board’s action.
**Combined Opinion**
 Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, supra. The Oklahoma legislature revised the gross production tax statute in 1915 and again in 1916, a principal change being the provision that the tax was in lieu of all other ad valorem taxes.  26 The revised tax was held by the Oklahoma Supreme Court to be a property tax. 27 But this Court rejected that construction sub silentio and invalidated the tax in memorandum opinions citing only the Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. case ( 235 U. S. 292 ) and *357 the Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. case ( 240 U. S. 522 ).  Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U. S. 503 ; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U. S. 549 .  Suspicions that this Court had overlooked the fact that under the revised statute the gross production tax was in lieu of rather than in addition to all other ad valorem property taxes, 28 were dispelled by Mr. Justice Holmes’ remark in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra at 504 — 505, that the statutory change had been noticed and regarded as immaterial.  29 If a gross receipts tax was a burden on the Federal Government “so as to interfere with the performance of its functions, it could not be saved because it was in lieu of a tax upon property or was so characterized.” See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134, 158.  The high-water mark of immunity for non-Indian lessees of restricted and allotted Indian lands came in 1922 when the Gillespie decision, supra, invalidated an Oklahoma net income tax upon income derived by a lessee from sales of his share of oil produced from restricted lands.  The non-Indian lessee’s immunity was last sustained here by Oklahoma v. Barnsdall <citedDecision>Refineries, supra.</citedDecision> That decision held, on application of a rule of strict construction of congressional waivers, that Congress’ express waiver of immunity from gross production taxes on oil produced from the specified Indian lands did not extend to petroleum excise taxes.  The state did not challenge *358 the implied constitutional immunity but pitched its argument on the ground of statutory exemption.  30 The instrumentality doctrine has been applied to confer a correlative immunity upon private lessees of state-owned lands.  The Texas rule that oil and gas leases are present sales to the lessees of the oil and gas in place caused this Court to sustain the imposition of the federal income tax upon income of the lessee derived from the sale of oil and gas produced from lands leased from that state.  It was observed that “.  .  .

 Production from the latter lands has been subject to Oklahoma’s gross production tax since 1928.  See note 42 infra.  The Government, in its brief amicus curiae, states that, because differences in the value of different tracts of land would be reflected in the bonuses which lessees are willing to pay, an exact comparison of bonuses is impossible.  37 See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134, 160-161 ; Pittman v. Home Owners Corp., 308 U. S. 21, 32-33 ; Maricopa County v. Talley Bank, 318 U. S. 357, 361 ; Board of Commissioners *366 v. Seber, 318 U. S. 705, 715-719 ; Oklahoma Tax Commission v. United States, 319 U. S. 598, 606-607 ; Mayo v. United States, 319 U. S. 441, 446 ; Smith v. Davis, 323 U. S. 111, 116-119 .  38 See Cohen, op. cit. supra note 5, at 255-256.  39 41 Stat. 1250 .  As has been stated, Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, <citedDecision>296 U. S. 521</citedDecision> , held that this statute did not authorize the imposition of the state’s petroleum excise tax. See text at note 30 supra. 40 43 Stat. 176 .  41 41 Stat. 1248 , as amended, 50 Stat. 68 .  42 45 Stat. 496 .  43 H. R. Rep. No. 1377, 66th Cong., 3d Sess. 4; H. R. Rep. No. 1278, 66th Cong., 3d Sess. 2-3; S. Rep. No. 704, 66th Cong., 3d Sess. 3 (all relating to the Osage Act, note 39 supra); H. R. Rep. No. 269, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. 3; S. Rep. No. 433, 68th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (both relating to the Kaw Act, note 40 supra); H. R. Rep. No. 431, 75th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Rep. No. 234, 75th Cong., 1st Sess. 2 (both relating to the Quapaw Act, note 41 supra); H. R. Rep. No. 1193, 70th Cong., 1st Sess. 5; S. Rep. No. 982, 70th Cong., 1st Sess. 4-5 (both relating to the Five Civilized Tribes Act, note 42 supra).  44 Respondents also urge that the Oklahoma legislature has recognized the immunity they assert here by authorizing the refund of “payment made in error on account of the production being derived from restricted Indian lands and therefore exempt from taxation.” 68 Okla. Stat. §832 (1941).  Although respondents tell us that this argument was urged upon the Oklahoma Supreme Court, that court did not mention this possible state ground but rested its decision exclusively on the federal ground.  We do not purport to decide whether Oklahoma law affords the exemption which federal law denies.
