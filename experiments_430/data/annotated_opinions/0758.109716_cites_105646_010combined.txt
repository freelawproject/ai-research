 .  , or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce." Since the early years of this century a judicial gloss on this statutory language has established the "rule of reason" as the prevailing standard of analysis.  Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1 (1911).  Under this rule, the factfinder weighs all of the circumstances of a case in deciding whether a restrictive practice should be prohibited as imposing an unreasonable restraint on competition.  [15] Per se rules of illegality *50 are appropriate only when they relate to conduct that is manifestly anticompetitive.  As the Court explained in Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>356 U. S. 1, 5</citedDecision> (1958), "there are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use." [16] In essence, the issue before us is whether Schwinn's per se rule can be justified under the demanding standards of Northern Pac. R. Co. The Court's refusal to endorse a per se rule in White Motor Co. was based on its uncertainty as to whether vertical restrictions satisfied those standards.  Addressing this question for the first time, the Court stated: "We need to know more than we do about the actual impact of these arrangements on competition to decide whether they have such a `pernicious effect on competition and lack .  .  .  any redeeming virtue' ( Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, supra, p. 5) and therefore should *51 be classified as per se violations of the Sherman Act." 372 U. S., at 263 .

 .  .  ." 388 U. S., at 379-380 .  [27] And even Continental does not urge us to hold that all such restrictions are per se illegal.  We revert to the standard articulated in Northern Pac. R. Co., and reiterated in White Motor, for determining whether vertical restrictions must be "conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use." <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 5</citedDecision> .  Such restrictions, in varying forms, are widely used in our free market economy.  As indicated above, there is substantial scholarly and judicial authority *58 supporting their economic utility.  There is relatively little authority to the contrary.  [28] Certainly, there has been no showing in this case, either generally or with respect to Sylvania's agreements, that vertical restrictions have or are likely to have a "pernicious effect on competition" or that they "lack .  .  .  any redeeming virtue." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> [29] Accordingly, we conclude that the per se rule stated in Schwinn must be overruled.  [30] In so holding we do not foreclose the possibility that particular applications of vertical restrictions might justify per se prohibition under Northern Pac. R. Co. But we do make clear that departure from the rule-of-reason standard *59 must be based upon demonstrable economic effect rather thanas in Schwinn upon formalistic line drawing.  In sum, we conclude that the appropriate decision is to return to the rule of reason that governed vertical restrictions prior to Schwinn.  When anticompetitive effects are shown to result from particular vertical restrictions they can be adequately policed under the rule of reason, the standard traditionally applied for the majority of anticompetitive practices challenged under § 1 of the Act.  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the judgment.  Although I agree with the majority that the location clause at issue in this case is not a per se violation of the Sherman Act and should be judged under the rule of reason, I cannot agree that this result requires the overruling of United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U. S. 365 (1967).

Ante, at 52 n. 19.  See also ante, at 54.  [6] Second is the view, argued forcefully in the economic literature cited by the majority, that the potential benefits of vertical restraints in promoting interbrand competition are particularly strong where the manufacturer imposing the restraints is seeking to enter a new market or to expand a small market share.  Ibid. [7] The majority even recognizes that Schwinn "hinted" at an exception for new entrants and failing firms from its per se rule.  Ante, at 53-54, n. 22.  In other areas of antitrust law, this Court has not hesitated to base its rules of per se illegality in part on the defendant's market power.  Indeed, in the very case from which the majority draws its standard for per se rules, Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>356 U. S. 1, 5</citedDecision> (1958), the *66 Court stated the reach of the per se rule against tie-ins under § 1 of the Sherman Act as extending to all defendants with "sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product .  .  .  ." <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 6</citedDecision> .  And the Court subsequently approved an exception to this per se rule for "infant industries" marketing a new product.  United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545 (ED Pa. 1960), aff'd per curiam, 365 U. S. 567 (1961).  See also United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U. S. 321, 363 (1963), where the Court held presumptively illegal a merger "which produces a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market.  .  .  ."

 To determine that question the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied; its condition before and after the restraint was imposed; the nature of the restraint and its effect, actual or probable.  The history of the restraint, the evil believed to exist, the reason for adopting the particular remedy, the purpose or end sought to be attained, are all relevant facts.  This is not because a good intention will save an otherwise objectionable regulation or the reverse; but because knowledge of intent may help the court to interpret facts and to predict consequences." [16] Per se rules thus require the Court to make broad generalizations about the social utility of particular commercial practices.  The probability that anticompetitive consequences will result from a practice and the severity of those consequences must be balanced against its pro-competitive consequences.  Cases that do not fit the generalization may arise, but a per se rule reflects the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to identify them.  Once established, per se rules tend to provide guidance to the business community and to minimize the burdens on litigants and the judicial system of the more complex rule-of-reason trials, see Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 5</citedDecision> ; United States v. Topco Associates, Ine., 405 U. S. 596, 609-610 (1972), but those advantages are not sufficient in themselves to justify the creation of per se rules.  If it were otherwise, all of antitrust law would be reduced to per se rules, thus introducing an unintended and undesirable rigidity in the law. [17]  After White Motor Co., the Courts of Appeals continued to evaluate territorial restrictions according to the rule of reason.  Sandura Co. v. FTC, 339 F. 2d 847 (CA6 1964); Snap-On Tools Corp. v. FTC, 321 F. 2d 825 (CA7 1963).  For an exposition of the history of the antitrust analysis of vertical restrictions before Schwinn, see ABA Monograph No. 2, pp. 6-8.  [18]  As in Schwinn, we are concerned here only with nonprice vertical restrictions.  The per se illegality of price restrictions has been established firmly for many years and involves significantly different questions of analysis and policy.  As MR. JUSTICE WHITE notes, post, at 69-70, some commentators have argued that the manufacturer's motivation for imposing vertical price restrictions may be the same as for nonprice restrictions.

 We quite agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART'S dissenting comment in Schwinn that "the state of the common law 400 or even 100 years ago is irrelevant to the issue before us: the effect of the antitrust laws upon vertical distributional restraints in the American economy today." 388 U. S., at 392 .  We are similarly unable to accept Judge Browning's interpretation of Schwinn.  In his dissent below he argued that the decision reflects the view that the Sherman Act was intended to prohibit restrictions on the autonomy of independent businessmen even though they have no impact on "price, quality, and quantity of goods and services," 537 F. 2d, at 1019.  This view is certainly not explicit in Schwinn, which purports to be based on an examination of the "impact [of the restrictions] upon the marketplace." 388 U. S., at 374 .  Competitive economies have social and political as well as economic advantages, see c. g., Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>356 U. S., at 4</citedDecision> , but an antitrust policy divorced from market considerations would lack any objective bench-marks.  As Mr. Justice Brandeis reminded us: "Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains.  To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence." Chicago Bd. of Trade v. United States, 246 U. S., at 238 .  Although MR. JUSTICE WHITE'S opinion endorses Judge Browning's interpretation, post, at 66-68, it purports to distinguish Schwinn on grounds inconsistent with that interpretation, post, at 71.  [22]  In that regard, the Court specifically stated that a more complete prohibition "might severely hamper smaller enterprises resorting to reasonable methods of meeting the competition of giants and of merchandising through independent dealers." 388 U. S., at 380 .
