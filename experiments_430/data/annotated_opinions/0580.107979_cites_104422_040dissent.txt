**Dissenting Opinion**
 “It is not an assertion of the right on the part of the Government, always recognized under English and American law, to search the person of the accused when legally arrested to discover and seize the fruits or evidences of crime.  This right has been uniformly maintained in many cases. ... Nor is it the case of burglar’s tools or other proofs of guilt found upon his arrest within the control of the accused.” Id., at 392.  (Emphasis added.) This scope of search incident to arrest, extending to all items under the suspect’s “control,” was reaffirmed in a dictum in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 158 (1925).  Accord, Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20, 30 (1925) (holding that “the place where the arrest is made” may be searched “is not to be doubted”).  The rule was reaffirmed in Marron v. United States, 275 U. S. 192, 199 (1927), where the Court asserted that authority *771 to search incident to an arrest “extended to all parts of the premises used for the unlawful purpose.” Within five years, this rule was qualified by two Prohibition Act cases, Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 344, 356-358 (1931), and United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U. S. 452, 463-467 (1932).  If Go-Bart and Lefkowitz represented a retreat from the rule of Weeks, Carroll, Agnello, and Marron , the vigor of the earlier rule was reaffirmed in Harris v. United States, <citedDecision>331 U. S. 145</citedDecision> (1947), which has, but for one brief interlude, clearly been the law until today.  The very next Term after <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> , in Trupiano v. United States, 334 U. S. 699 (1948), the Court held unjustifiable the seizure of a still incident to the arrest of a man at the still site, even though the still was contraband, had been visible through an open door before entering the premises to be “searched,” and although a crime was being committed in the officers’ presence.  Accord, that year, McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 (1948) (gambling game seen through transom before entry).  Less than two years later, however, the Court returned to the <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> rule in United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950), where the Court held that the reasonableness of a search does not depend upon the practicability of obtaining a search warrant, and that the fact of a valid arrest is relevant to reasonableness.  Trupiano was pro tanto overruled.  Such rapid reversals have occurred before, 1 but they are rare.  Here there had been two about-faces, one following hard upon the other.  Justice Frankfurter objected in this language: “Especially ought the Court not reenforce needlessly the instabilities of our day by giving fair ground for the belief that Law is the expression of *772 chance — for instance, of unexpected changes in the Court’s composition and the contingencies in the choice of successors.” 339 U. S., at 86 .  Since that time, the rule of Weeks, Marron, Harris, and Rabinowitz has clearly been the law. E. g., Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., writing for the Court) ; Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963).  2 II.
