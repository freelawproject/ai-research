<p id="b342-6">Because my decision to join Justice Brennan’s dissent is a departure from the opinion I expressed in <em>Florida Dept. of Health </em>v. <em>Florida Nursing Home Assn., </em>450 U. S. 147, 151 (1981), a word of explanation is in order. As I then explained, notwithstanding my belief that <em>Edelman </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>415 U. S. 651 (1974), was incorrectly decided, see 450 U. S., at 151, n. 2,1 then concluded that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>required that <em>Edelman </em>be followed. Since then, however, the Court has not felt constrained by <em>stare decisis </em>in its expansion of the protective mantle of sovereign immunity— having repudiated at least 28 cases in its decision in <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </em>v. <em>Halderman, </em>465 U. S. 89, 165-166, n. 50 (1984) (Stevens, J., dissenting) — and additional study has made it abundantly clear that not only <em>Edelman, </em>but <em>Hans </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>134 U. S. 1 (1890), as well, can properly be characterized as “egregiously incorrect.” 450 U. S., at 153. I am now persuaded that a fresh examination of the Court’s Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence will produce benefits that far outweigh “the consequences of further unraveling the doctrine of <em>stare decisis” </em>in this area of the law. <em>Id., </em>at 155.</p>
