 In the context of direct review of a state court judgment, the independent and adequate state ground doctrine is jurisdictional.  Because this Court has no power to review a state law determination that is sufficient to support the judgment, resolution of any independent federal ground for the decision could not affect the judgment and would therefore be advisory.  See Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125-126 (1945) (“We are not permitted to render an advisory opinion, and if the same judgment would be rendered by the state court after we corrected its views of federal laws, our review could amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion”).  We have applied the independent and adequate state ground doctrine not only in our own review of state court judgments, but in deciding whether federal district courts should address the claims of state prisoners in habeas corpus actions.  The doctrine applies to bar federal habeas when *730 a state court declined to address a prisoner’s federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement.  In these cases, the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.  See Wainwright v. Sykes, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 72, 81, 87</citedDecision> (1977); Ulster County Court v. Allen, 442 U. S. 140, 148 (1979).  See generally Harris, supra, at 262 .  The basis for application of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in federal habeas is somewhat different than on direct review by this Court. When this Court reviews a state court decision on direct review pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1257 , it is reviewing the judgment; if resolution of a federal question cannot affect the judgment, there is nothing for the Court to do.  This is not the case in habeas.  When a federal district court reviews a state prisoner’s ha-beas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 2254 , it must decide whether the petitioner is “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.” Ibid. The court does not review a judgment, but the lawfulness of the petitioner’s custody simpliciter.  See Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 430 (1963).  Nonetheless, a state prisoner is in custody pursuant to a judgment.

 .  .  give greater preclu-sive effect to procedural defaults by federal defendants than to similar defaults by state defendants.  To hold otherwise would reflect an anomalous and erroneous view of federal-state relations.’ Kaufman v. United States, 394 U. S. 217, 228 .” Francis, 425 U. S., at 541-542 .  We held that Francis’ claim was barred in federal habeas unless he could establish cause and prejudice.  Id., at 542 .  Wainwright v. Sykes, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 72</citedDecision> (1977), applied the cause and prejudice, standard more broadly.  Sykes did not object at trial to the introduction of certain inculpatory statements he had earlier made to the police.  Under Florida law, this failure barred state courts from hearing the claim on either direct appeal or state collateral review.  We recognized that this contemporaneous objection rule served strong state interests in the finality of its criminal litigation.  <citedDecision>Id., at *74788-90</citedDecision> .  To protect these interests, we adopted the same presumption against federal habeas review of claims defaulted in state court for failure to object at trial that Francis had adopted in the grand jury context: the cause and prejudice standard.  “We believe the adoption of the Francis rule in this situation will have the salutary effect of making the state trial on the merits the ‘main event,’ so to speak, rather than a ‘tryout on the road’ for what will later be the determinative federal habeas hearing.” Id., at 90.  In so holding, <citedDecision>Sykes</citedDecision> limited Fay to its facts.  The cause and prejudice standard in federal habeas evinces far greater respect for state procedural rules than does the deliberate bypass standard of Fay .  These incompatible rules are based on very different conceptions of comity and of the importance of finality in state criminal litigation.  See Hill, The Forfeiture of Constitutional Rights in Criminal Cases, 78 Colum. L. Rev. 1050 , 1053-1059 (1978).  In <citedDecision>Sykes</citedDecision> , we left open the question whether the deliberate bypass standard still applied to a situation like that in Fay , where a petitioner has surrendered entirely his right to appeal his state conviction.  Sykes, <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 88, n. 12</citedDecision> .  We rejected explicitly, however, “the sweeping language of Fay v. Noia , going far beyond the facts of the case eliciting it.” Id., at 87-88.  Our cases since <citedDecision>Sykes</citedDecision> have been unanimous in applying the cause and prejudice standard.  Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107 (1982), held that the standard applies even in cases in which the alleged constitutional error impaired the truthfinding function of the trial. Respondents had failed to object at trial to jury instructions that placed on them the burden of proving self-defense.  Ohio’s contemporaneous objection rule barred respondents’ claim on appeal that the burden should have been on the State.  We held that this independent and adequate state ground barred federal habeas as well, absent a showing of cause and prejudice.  Recognizing that the writ of habeas corpus “is a bulwark against convictions that violate fundamental fairness,” we *748 also acknowledged that “the Great Writ entails significant costs.” Id., at 126 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The most significant of these is the cost to finality in criminal litigation that federal collateral review of state convictions entails: “As Justice Harlan once observed, ‘[b]oth the individual criminal defendant and society have an interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation, and that attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community.’ Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1963) (dissenting opinion).” Id., at 127 .  Moreover, “[f]ederal intrusions into state criminal trials frustrate both the States’ sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.” Id., at 128 .

 .  channels], to the extent possible, the resolution of various types of questions to the stage of the judicial process at which they can be resolved most fairly and efficiently.’ [Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 10 (1984).] .  .  .  Failure to raise a claim on appeal reduces the finality of appellate proceedings, deprives the appellate court of an opportunity to review trial error, and ‘undercuts] the State’s ability to enforce its procedural rules.’ Engle, 456 U. S., at 129 .” Id., at 490-491.  In Carrier , as in <citedDecision>Sykes</citedDecision> , we left open the question whether Fay’s deliberate bypass standard continued to apply under the facts of that case, where a state prisoner has defaulted his entire appeal.  See Carrier, supra, at 492 ; <citedDecision>Sykes, supra, at 88, n. 12</citedDecision> .  We are now required to answer this question.  By filing late, Coleman defaulted his entire state collateral appeal.  This was no doubt an inadvertent error, and respondent concedes that Coleman did not “understandingly and knowingly” forgo the privilege of state collateral appeal.  See Fay, 372 U. S., at 439 .  Therefore, if the Fay deliberate bypass standard still applies, Coleman’s state procedural default will not bar federal habeas.  In Harris, we described in broad terms the application of the cause and prejudice standard, hinting strongly that Fay had been superseded: “Under <citedDecision>Sykes</citedDecision> and its progeny, an adequate and independent finding of procedural default will bar federal ha-beas review of the federal claim, unless the habeas petitioner can show ‘cause’ for the default and ‘prejudice *750 attributable thereto,' Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 485 (1986), or demonstrate that failure to consider the federal claim will result in a ‘ “ ‘fundamental miscarriage of justice.”” Id., at 495 , quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 135 (1982).  See also Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 537 (1986).” Harris, 489 U. S., at 262 .  We now make it explicit: In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  Fay was based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules.  The several cases after Fay that applied the cause and prejudice standard to a variety of state procedural defaults represent a different view.  We now recognize the important interest in finality served by state procedural rules, and the significant harm to the States that results from the failure of federal courts to respect them.  Cf. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491 (1991) (“Though Fay v. Noia, supra, may have cast doubt upon these propositions, since Fay we have taken care in our habeas corpus decisions to reconfirm the importance of finality”).

 See, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991).  Such unreflective cost-benefit analysis is inconsistent with the very idea of rights.  See generally Cover & Aleinikoff, Dialectical Federalism: Habeas Corpus and the Court, 86 Yale L. J. 1035, 1092 (1977).  The Bill of Rights is not, after all, a collection of technical interests, and “surely it is an abuse to deal too casually and too lightly with rights guaranteed” therein.  Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S., at 498 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  It is well settled that the existence of a state procedural default does not divest a federal court of jurisdiction on collateral review.  See Wainwright v. Sykes, <citedDecision>433 U. S. 72, 82-84</citedDecision> (1977).  Rather, the important office of the federal courts in vindicating federal rights gives way to the States’ enforcement of their procedural rules to protect the States’ interest in being an equal partner in safeguarding federal rights.  This accommodation furthers the values underlying federalism in two ways.  First, encouraging a defendant to assert his federal rights in the appropriate state forum makes it possible for transgressions to be arrested sooner and before they influence an erroneous deprivation of liberty.  Second, thorough examination of a prisoner’s federal claims in state court permits more effective review of those claims in federal court, honing the accuracy of the writ as an implement to eradicate unlawful detention.  See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 519 (1982); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S., at 500-501 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  The majority ignores these purposes in concluding that a State need not bear the burden of making clear its intent to rely on such a rule.
