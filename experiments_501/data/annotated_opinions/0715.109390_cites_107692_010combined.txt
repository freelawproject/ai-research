**Combined Opinion**
 On January 22, 1971, four of the striking warehouse employees entered the center's enclosed mall carrying placards which read: "Butler Shoe Warehouse on Strike, AFL-CIO, Local 315." The general manager of the shopping center informed the employees that they could not picket within the mall or on the parking lot and threatened them with arrest if they did not leave.  The employees departed but returned a short time later and began picketing in an area of the mall immediately adjacent to the entrances of the Butler store.  After the picketing had continued for approximately 30 minutes, the shopping center manager again informed the pickets that if they did not leave they would be arrested for trespassing.  The pickets departed.  The union subsequently filed with the Board an unfair labor practice charge against Hudgens, alleging interference with rights protected by ยง 7 of the Act, 29 *510 U. S. C. ยง 157.  [2] Relying on this Court's decision in Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 308</citedDecision> , the Board entered a cease-and-desist order against Hudgens, reasoning that because the warehouse employees enjoyed a First Amendment right to picket on the shopping center property, the owner's threat of arrest violated ยง 8 (a) (1) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. ยง 158 (a) (1).  [3] Hudgens filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  Soon thereafter this Court decided Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 , and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 , and the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of those two decisions.  The Board, in turn, remanded to an Administrative Law Judge, who made findings of fact, recommendations, and conclusions to the effect that Hudgens had committed an unfair labor practice by excluding the pickets.  *511 This result was ostensibly reached under the statutory criteria set forth in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105 , a case which held that union organizers who seek to solicit for union membership may intrude on an employer's private property if no alternative means exist for communicating with the employees.  But the Administrative Law Judge's opinion also relied on this Court's constitutional decision in Logan Valley for a "realistic view of the facts." The Board agreed with the findings and recommendations of the Administrative Law Judge, but departed somewhat from his reasoning.
**Combined Opinion**
 There is nothing to stop highway traffic from coming onto the business block and upon arrival a traveler may make free use of the facilities available there.  In short the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the property belongs to a private corporation." Id., at 502-503 .  The Court pointed out that if the "title" to Chickasaw had "belonged not to a private but to a municipal corporation and had appellant been arrested for violating a municipal ordinance rather than a ruling by those appointed by the corporation to manage a company town it would have been clear that appellant's conviction must be reversed." Id., at 504 .  Concluding that Gulf's "property interests" should not be allowed to lead to a different result in Chickasaw, which did "not function differently from any other town," id., at 506-508 , the Court invoked the First and Fourteenth Amendments to reverse the appellant's conviction.  It was the Marsh case that in 1968 provided the foundation for the Court's decision in Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 308</citedDecision> .  That case involved peaceful picketing within a large *515 shopping center near Altoona, Pa. One of the tenants of the shopping center was a retail store that employed a wholly nonunion staff.  Members of a local union picketed the store, carrying signs proclaiming that it was nonunion and that its employees were not receiving union wages or other union benefits.  The picketing took place on the shopping center's property in the immediate vicinity of the store.  A Pennsylvania court issued an injunction that required all picketing to be confined to public areas outside the shopping center, and the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the issuance of this injunction.  This Court held that the doctrine of the Marsh case required reversal of that judgment.  The Court's opinion pointed out that the First and Fourteenth Amendments would clearly have protected the picketing if it had taken place on a public sidewalk: "It is clear that if the shopping center premises were not privately owned but instead constituted the business area of a municipality, which they to a large extent resemble, petitioners could not be barred from exercising their First Amendment rights there on the sole ground that title to the property was in the municipality.  Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 (1938); Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496 (1939); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413 (1943).  The essence of those opinions is that streets, sidewalks, parks, and other similar public places are so historically associated with the exercise of First Amendment rights that access to them for the purpose of exercising such rights cannot constitutionally be denied broadly and absolutely." <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 315</citedDecision> .  The Court's opinion then reviewed the Marsh case in detail, emphasized the similarities between the business *516 block in Chickasaw, Ala., and the Logan Valley shopping center, and unambiguously concluded: "The shopping center here is clearly the functional equivalent of the business district of Chickasaw involved in Marsh .  " <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 318</citedDecision> .  Upon the basis of that conclusion, the Court held that the First and Fourteenth Amendments required reversal of the judgment of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. There were three dissenting opinions in the Logan Valley case, one of them by the author of the Court's opinion in Marsh , Mr. Justice Black. His disagreement with the Court's reasoning was total: "In affirming petitioners' contentions the majority opinion relies on Marsh v. Alabama, supra , and holds that respondents' property has been transformed to some type of public property.  But Marsh was never intended to apply to this kind of situation.  Marsh dealt with the very special situation of a company-owned town, complete with streets, alleys, sewers, stores, residences, and everything else that goes to make a town.  .  .  .  I can find very little resemblance between the shopping center involved in this case and Chickasaw, Alabama.  There are no homes, there is no sewage disposal plant, there is not even a post office on this private property which the Court now considers the equivalent of a `town.' " <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 330-331</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  "The question is, Under what circumstances can private property be treated as though it were public?  The answer that Marsh gives is when that property has taken on all the attributes of a town, i.  e., `residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a "business block" on which business places are situated.' 326 U. S., at 502 .  I *517 can find nothing in Marsh which indicates that if one of these features is present, e. g., a business district, this is sufficient for the Court to confiscate a part of an owner's private property and give its use to people who want to picket on it." Id., at 332.

 See NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox, supra, at 112; cf. NLRB v. Erie Resistor Corp., supra, at 235-236; *523 NLRB v. Truckdrivers Union, 353 U. S. 87, 97 .  "The responsibility to adapt the Act to changing patterns of industrial life is entrusted to the Board." NLRB v. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U. S. 251, 266 .  For the reasons stated in this opinion, the judgment is vacated and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals with directions to remand to the National Labor Relations Board, so that the case may be there considered under the statutory criteria of the National Labor Relations Act alone.  It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, concurring.  Although I agree with MR. JUSTICE WHITE'S view concurring in the result that Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 (1972), did not overrule Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 308</citedDecision> (1968), and that the present case can be distinguished narrowly from Logan Valley, I nevertheless have joined the opinion of the Court today.  The law in this area, particularly with respect to whether First Amendment or labor law principles are applicable, has been less than clear since Logan Valley analogized a shopping center to the "company town" in Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U. S. 501 (1946).  Mr. Justice Black, the author of the Court's opinion in Marsh , thought the decisions were irreconcilable.  [1] I now agree *524 with Mr. Justice Black that the opinions in these cases cannot be harmonized in a principled way.  Upon more mature thought, I have concluded that we would have been wiser in Lloyd Corp. to have confronted this disharmony rather than draw distinctions based upon rather attenuated factual differences.  [2] The Court's opinion today clarifies the confusion engendered by these cases by accepting Mr. Justice Black's reading of Marsh and by recognizing more sharply the distinction between the First Amendment and labor law issues that may arise in cases of this kind.  It seems to me that this clarification of the law is desirable.  MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the result.  While I concur in the result reached by the Court, I find it unnecessary to inter Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 308</citedDecision> (1968), and therefore do not join the Court's opinion.  I agree that "the constitutional guarantee of free expression has no part to play in a case such as this," ante, at 521; but Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, 407 U. S. 551 (1972), did not overrule Logan Valley, either expressly or implicitly, and I would not, somewhat after the fact, say that it did.  One need go no further than Logan Valley itself, for the First Amendment protection established by Logan Valley was expressly limited to the picketing of a specific store for the purpose of conveying information with respect to the operation in the shopping center of that store: "The picketing carried on by petitioners was *525 directed specifically at patrons of the Weis Market located within the shopping center and the message sought to be conveyed to the public concerned the manner in which that particular market was being operated.  We are, therefore, not called upon to consider whether respondents' property rights could, consistently with the First Amendment, justify a bar on picketing which was not thus directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put." <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 320</citedDecision> n. 9.  On its face, Logan Valley does not cover the facts of this case. The pickets of the Butler Shoe Co. store in the North DeKalb Shopping Center were not purporting to convey information about the "manner in which that particular [store] was being operated" but rather about the operation of a warehouse not located on the center's premises.  The picketing was thus not "directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put." The First Amendment question in this case was left open in Logan Valley.  I dissented in Logan Valley, 391 U. S., p. 337, and I see no reason to extend it further.  Without such extension, the First Amendment provides no protection for the picketing here in issue and the Court need say no more.  Lloyd v. Tanner is wholly consistent with this view.  There is no need belatedly to overrule Logan Valley, only to follow it as it is.  MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN joins, dissenting.  The Court today holds that the First Amendment poses no bar to a shopping center owner's prohibiting speech within his shopping center.  After deciding this far-reaching constitutional question, and overruling Food *526 Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 308</citedDecision> (1968), in the process, the Court proceeds to remand for consideration of the statutory question whether the shopping center owner in this case unlawfully interfered with the Butler Shoe Co. employees' rights under ยง 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U. S. C. ยง 157 .  In explaining why it addresses any constitutional issue at all, the Court observes simply that the history of the litigation has been one of "shifting positions on the part of the litigants, the Board, and the Court of Appeals," ante, at 512, as to whether relief was being sought, or granted, under the First Amendment, under ยง 7 of the Act, or under some combination of the two.  On my reading, the Court of Appeals' decision and, even more clearly, the Board's decision here for review, were based solely on ยง 7, not on the First Amendment; and this Court ought initially consider the statutory question without reference to the First Amendmentยthe question on which the Court remands.  But even under the Court's reading of the opinions of the Board and the Court of Appeals, the statutory question on which it remands is now before the Court. By bypassing that question and reaching out to overrule a constitutionally based decision, the Court surely departs from traditional modes of adjudication.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on purely statutory grounds.  And on the merits of the only question that the Court decides, I dissent from the overruling of Logan Valley.  I The Court views the history of this litigation as one of "shifting positions" and "considerable confusion."
**Combined Opinion**
 To be sure, some Members of the Court, myself included, believed that Logan Valley called for a different result in Lloyd and alluded in dissent to the possibility that "it is Logan Valley itself that the Court finds bothersome." 407 U. S., at 570, 584 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  But the fact remains that Logan Valley explicitly reserved the question later decided in Lloyd, and Lloyd carefully preserved the holding of Logan Valley.  And upon reflection, I am of the view that the two decisions are reconcilable.  A In Logan Valley the Court was faced with union picketing against a nonunion supermarket located in a large shopping center.  Our holding was a limited one: "All we decide here is that because the shopping center serves as the community business block `and is freely accessible and open to the people in the area and those passing through,' Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U. S., at 508 , the State may not delegate the power, through the use of its trespass laws, wholly to exclude those members of the public wishing to exercise their First Amendment rights on the premises in a manner and for a purpose generally consonant with the use to which the property is actually put." <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 319-320</citedDecision> (footnote omitted).  We carefully noted that we were "not called upon to consider whether respondents' property rights could, consistently with the First Amendment, justify a bar on picketing which was not .  .  .  directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property was being put." <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 320 n. 9.  Lloyd involved the distribution of antiwar handbills in a large shopping center, and while some of us viewed *536 the case differently, 407 U. S., at 570, 577-579 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting), the Court treated it as presenting the question left open in Logan Valley.  But the Court did no more than decide that question.  It preserved the holding of Logan Valley, as limited to cases in which (1) the picketing is directly related in its purpose to the use to which the shopping center property is put, and (2) "no other reasonable opportunities for the pickets to convey their message to their intended audience [are] available." 407 U. S., at 563.  The Court today gives short shrift to the language in Lloyd preserving Logan Valley, and quotes extensively from language that admittedly differs in emphasis from much of the language of Logan Valley.  But even the language quoted by the Court says no more than that the dedication of the Lloyd Center to public use was more limited than the dedication of the company town in Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U. S. 501 (1946), and that the pickets in Lloyd were not entitled to exercise "the asserted First Amendment rights"ยthat is, the right to distribute antiwar handbills.
**Combined Opinion**
 Our institutional duty in this case, if we consider the constitutional question at all, is to examine whether Lloyd and Logan Valley can continue to stand side by side, and, if they cannot, to decide which one must fall.  I continue to believe that the First Amendment principles underlying Logan Valley are sound, and were unduly limited in Lloyd.  But accepting Lloyd, I am not convinced that Logan Valley must be overruled.  The foundation of Logan Valley consisted of this Court's decisions recognizing a right of access to streets, sidewalks, parks, and other public places historically associated with the exercise of First Amendment rights.  E. g., Hague v. CIO, 307 U. S. 496, 515-516 (1939) (opinion of Roberts, J.); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 (1939); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 308 (1940); Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569, 574 (1941); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413 (1943); Saia v. New York, 334 U. S. 558 (1948).  Thus, the Court in Logan Valley observed that access to such forums "cannot constitutionally be denied broadly and absolutely." <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 315</citedDecision> .  The importance of access to such places for speech-related purposes is clear, for they are often the only places for effective speech and assembly.  Marsh v. Alabama, supra , which the Court purports to leave untouched, made clear that in applying those cases granting a right of access to streets, sidewalks, and other public places, courts ought not let the formalities of title put an end to analysis.  The Court in Marsh observed that "the town and its shopping district are accessible to and freely used by the public in general and there is nothing to distinguish them from any other town and shopping center except the fact that the title to the *539 property belongs to a private corporation." 326 U. S., at 503 .  That distinction was not determinative: "Ownership does not always mean absolute dominion.  The more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it."
**Combined Opinion**
 Also, as in Marsh, supra, Lloyd's private police are given full police power by the city of Portland, even though they are hired, fired, controlled, and paid by the owners of the Center.  This was not true in Logan Valley.  " 407 U. S., at 575 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  [6]  See id., at 570 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  [7]  This was the entire thrust of MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL'S dissenting opinion in the Lloyd case. See id., at 584.  [8]  MR. JUSTICE WHITE clearly recognized this principle in his Logan Valley dissenting opinion.  <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 339</citedDecision> .  [9]  The Court has in the past held that some expression is not protected "speech" within the meaning of the First Amendment.  Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476 ; Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568 .  [10]  A wholly different balance was struck when the organizational activity was carried on by employees already rightfully on the employer's property, since the employer's management interests rather than his property interests were there involved.  Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 .  This difference is "one of substance." NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S., at 113 .
**Combined Opinion**
 [1]  In his dissent in Logan Valley, Mr. Justice Black stated that " Marsh was never intended to apply to this kind of situation.  .  .  .  [T]he basis on which the Marsh decision rested was that the property involved encompassed an area that for all practical purposes had been turned into a town; the area had all the attributes of a town and was exactly like any other town in Alabama.  I can find very little resemblance between the shopping center involved in this case and Chickasaw, Alabama." <citedDecision>391 U. S., at 330, 331</citedDecision> .  [2]  The editorial "we" above is directed primarily to myself as the author of the Court's opinion in Lloyd Corp. [1]  203 N. L. R. B. 265 (1973), enforcement denied, NLRB v. Visceglia, 498 F. 2d 43 (CA3 1974).  [2]  The Board found the "principles of Babcock & Wilcox .  .  .  to be applicable," 203 N. L. R. B., at 266-267, but seized upon a factual distinction that the Babcock & Wilcox Court had itself suggestedยnamely, the distinction between activity by employees, as in Visceglia , and activity by nonemployees, as in Babcock & Wilcox.  [3]  The Board's General Counsel urged a rule, based upon Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 (1945), that the employee pickets could not be excluded from the shopping center unless it could be shown that the picketing interfered with the center's normal functioning.
**Combined Opinion**
 And the court did not even make the factual finding of functional equivalence to a business district that it recognized as a prerequisite to the application of the First Amendment.  501 F. 2d, at 164 .  [5]  It is irrelevant, in my view, that the property in this case was owned by the shopping center owner rather than by the employer.  The nature of the property interest is the same in either case. [6]  The only alternative means of communication referred to in Babcock & Wilcox were "personal contacts on streets or at home, telephones, letters or advertised meetings to get in touch with the employees." 351 U. S., at 111 .  [7]  No point would be served by adding to the observations in Logan Valley and my dissent in Lloyd with respect to the growth of suburban shopping centers and the proliferation of activities taking place in such centers.
