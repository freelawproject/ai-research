Howard, 248 U.S. 549 , 39 S.Ct. 183 , 63 L.Ed. 416 ; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, <targetCase>257 U.S. 501</targetCase> , <targetCase>42 S.Ct. 171</targetCase> , 66 L.Ed. 338 . In all those cases a non-Indian lessee of restricted Indian lands was held immune from state taxation of various kinds because, and only because, the lands themselves and the leasing of them were held to be immune from taxation, and this in turn because they were the lands of Indians held in Government tutelage, who were permitted to lease the lands only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. This immunity for lessees was withdrawn by Helvering v. Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376 , 58 S.Ct. 623 , 82 L.Ed. 907 , which overruled Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra. Cf.
