 4 See also the NATO Status of Forces Agreement, supra, Art. VII, §§ 2, 3.  The Government makes the final argument that these civilian dependents are part of the United States military contingent abroad in the eyes of the foreign nations concerned and that their conduct may have a profound effect on our relations with these countries, with a consequent effect on the military establishment there.  But the argument that military court-martials in capital cases are necessitated by this factor assumes either that a military court-martial constitutes a stronger deterrent to this sort of conduct or that, in the absence of such a trial, no punishment would be meted out and our foreign policy thereby injured.  The reasons why these considerations carry no conviction have already been indicated.  I therefore conclude that, in capital cases, the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over civilian dependents in time of peace cannot be justified by Article I, considered in connection with the specific protections of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  Since the conclusion thus reached differs from what the Court decided last Term, a decent respect for the judicial process calls for re-examination of the two grounds that then prevailed.  The Court sustained its action on the *50 authority of the cases dealing with the power of Congress to “make all needful Rules and Regulations” for the Territories, reinforced by In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> , in which this Court, in 1891, sustained the criminal jurisdiction of a consular court in Japan.  5 These authorities grew out of, and related to, specific situations very different from those now here.  They do not control or even embarrass the problem before us.  Legal doctrines are not self-generated abstract categories.  They do not fall from the sky; nor are they pulled out of it.  They have a specific juridical origin and etiology.  They derive meaning and content from the circumstances that gave rise to them and from the purposes they were designed to serve.  To these they are bound as is a live tree to its roots.  Doctrines like those expressed by the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case and the series of cases beginning with American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511 , must be placed in their historical setting.  They cannot be wrenched from it and mechanically transplanted into an alien, unrelated context without suffering mutilation or distortion.  “If a precedent involving a black horse is applied to a case involving a white horse, we are not excited.  If it were an elephant or an animal ferae naturae or a chose in action, then we would venture into thought.  The difference might make a difference.  We really are concerned about precedents chiefly when their facts differ somewhat from the facts in the case at bar.  Then there is a gulf or hiatus that has to be bridged by a concern for principle and a concern for practical results and practical wisdom.” Thomas Reed Powell, Vagaries and Varieties in Constitutional Interpretation, *51 36.

 The process of decision appropriate to the problem led to a detailed examination of the relation of the specific “Territory” to the United States.  This examination, in its similarity to analysis in terms of “due process,” is essentially the same as that to be made in the present cases in weighing congressional power to make “Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces” against the safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  The results in the cases that arose by reason of the acquisition of exotic “Territory” do not control the present cases, for the territorial cases rest specifically on Art. IV, § 3, which is a grant of power to Congress to deal with “Territory” and other Government property.  Of course the power sought to be exercised in Great Britain and Japan does not relate to “Territory.” 7 The Court’s *54 opinions in the territorial cases did not lay down a broad principle that the protective provisions of the Constitution do not apply outside the continental limits of the United States.  This Court considered the particular situation in each newly acquired territory to determine whether the grant to Congress of power to govern “Territory” was restricted by a specific provision of the Constitution.  The territorial cases, in the emphasis put by them on the necessity for considering the specific circumstances of each particular case, are thus relevant in that they provide an illustrative method for harmonizing constitutional provisions which appear, separately considered, to be conflicting.  The Court last Term relied on a second source of authority, the consular court case, In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> .  Pursuant to a treaty with Japan, Ross, a British subject but a member of the crew of a United States ship, was tried and convicted in a consular court in Yokohama for murder of a fellow seaman while the ship was in Yokohama harbor.  His application for a writ of habeas corpus to a United States Circuit Court was denied, 44 F. 185 , and on appeal here, the judgment was affirmed.  This Court set forth the ground of the Circuit Court, “the long and uniform acquiescence by the executive, administrative and legislative departments of the government in the validity of the legislation,” 140 U. S., at. 461, and then stated: “The Circuit Court might have found an additional ground for not calling in question the legislation of Congress, in the uniform practice of civilized governments for centuries to provide consular tribunals in other than Christian countries .  .  .  for the *55 trial of their own subjects or citizens for offences committed in those countries, as well as for the settlement of civil disputes between them; and in the uniform recognition, down to the time of the formation of our government, of the fact that the establishment of such tribunals was among the most important subjects for treaty stipulations.

 .  The Constitution can have no operation in another country.  When, therefore, the representatives or officers of our government are permitted to exercise authority of any kind in another country, it must be on such conditions as the two countries may agree, the laws of neither one being obligatory upon the other.  The deck of a private *56 American vessel, it is true, is considered for many purposes constructively as territory of the United States, yet persons on board of such vessels, whether officers, sailors, or passengers, cannot invoke the protection of the provisions referred to until brought within the actual territorial boundaries of the United States.  .  .  <citedDecision>140 U. S., at 462-464</citedDecision> .  One observation should be made at the outset about the grounds for decision in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> .  Insofar as the opinion expressed a view that the Constitution is not operative outside the United States — and apparently Mr. Justice Field meant by “United States” all lands over which the United States flag flew, see John W. Burgess, How May the United States Govern Its Extra-Continental Territory?, 14 Pol. Sci. Q. 1 (1899) — it expressed a notion that has long since evaporated.  Governmental action abroad is performed under both the authority and the restrictions of the Constitution — for example, proceedings before American military tribunals, whether in Great Britain or in the United States, are subject to the applicable restrictions of the Constitution.  See opinions in Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137 .  The significance of the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case and its relevance to the present cases cannot be assessed unless due regard is accorded the historical context in which that case was decided.  <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> is not rooted in any abstract principle or comprehensive theory touching constitutional power or its restrictions.  It was decided with reference to a very particular, practical problem with a long history.  To be mindful of this does not attribute to Mr. Justice Field’s opinion some unavowed historical assumption.  On behalf of the whole Court, he spelled out the considerations that controlled it: “The practice of European governments to send officers to reside in foreign countries, authorized to *57 exercise a limited jurisdiction over vessels and seamen of their country, to watch the interests of their countrymen and to assist in adjusting their disputes and protecting their commerce, goes back to a very early period, even preceding what are termed the Middle Ages.  ... In other than Christian countries they were, by treaty stipulations, usually clothed with authority to hear complaints against their countrymen and to sit in judgment upon them when charged with public offences.  After the rise of Islamism, and the spread of its followers over eastern Asia and other countries bordering on the Mediterranean, the exercise of this judicial authority became a matter of great concern.  The intense hostility of the people of Moslem faith to all other sects, and particularly to Christians, affected all their intercourse, and all proceedings had in their tribunals.  Even the rules of evidence adopted by them placed those of different faith on unequal grounds in any controversy with them.  For this cause, and by reason of the barbarous and cruel punishments inflicted in those countries, and the frequent use of torture to enforce confession from parties accused, it was a matter of deep interest to Christian governments to withdraw the trial of their subjects, when charged with the commission of a public offence, from the arbitrary and despotic action of the local officials.  Treaties conferring such jurisdiction upon these consuls were essential to the peaceful residence of Christians within those countries and the successful prosecution of commerce with their people.” <citedDecision>140 U. S., at 462-463</citedDecision> .  “It is true that the occasion for consular tribunals in Japan may hereafter be less than at present, as every year that country progresses in civilization and in the assimilation of its system of judicial pro *58 cedure to that of Christian countries, as well as in the improvement of its penal statutes; but the system of consular tribunals ... is of the highest importance, and their establishment in other than Christian countries, where our people may desire to go in pursuit of commerce, will often be essential for the protection of their persons and property.” <citedDecision>Id., at 480</citedDecision> .  8 It is important to have a lively sense of this background before attempting to draw on the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case. Historians have traced grants of extraterritorial rights as far back as the permission given by Egypt in the 12th or 13th century B. C. to the merchants of Tyre to establish factories on the Nile and to live under their own law and practice their own religion.  Numerous other instances of persons living under their own law in foreign lands existed in the later pre-Christian era and during the Roman Empire and the so-called Dark and Middle Ages — Greeks in *59 Egypt, all sorts of foreigners in Rome, inhabitants of Christian cities and states in the Byzantine Empire, the Latin kingdoms of the Levant, and other Christian cities and states, Mohammedans in the Byzantine Empire and China, and many others lived in foreign lands under their own law. While the origins of this extraterritorial jurisdiction may have differed in each country, the notion that law was for the benefit of the citizens of a country and its advantages not for foreigners appears to have been an important factor.  Thus, there existed a long-established custom of extraterritorial jurisdiction at the beginning of the 15th century when the complete conquest of the Byzantine Empire by the Turks and the establishment of the Ottoman Empire substantially altered political relations between Christian Europe and the Near East.  But commercial relations continued, and in 1535 Francis I of France negotiated a treaty with Suleiman I of Turkey that provided for numerous extraterritorial rights, including criminal and civil jurisdiction over all disputes among French subjects.  1 Ernest Char-riére, Négociations de la France dans le Levant 283.  Other nations and eventually the United States in 1830, 8 Stat. 408 , later negotiated similar treaties with the Turks.  (For a more complete history of the development of extraterritorial rights and consular jurisdiction see 1 Calvo, Le Droit International Théorique et Pratique (5th ed., Rousseau, 1896), 2-18, 2 id., 9-12; Hinckley, American Consular Jurisdiction in the Orient, 1-9; 1 Mil-titz, Manuel des Consuls passim; Ravndal, The Origin of the Capitulations and of the Consular Institution, S. Doc. No. 34, 67th Cong., 1st Sess. 5-45, 56-96; Shih Shun Liu, Extraterritoriality, 23-66, 118 Studies in History, Economics and Public Law, Columbia University (1925); Twiss, The Law of Nations (Rev. ed. 1884), 443-457.) *60 The emergence of the nation-state in Europe and the growth of the doctrine of absolute territorial sovereignty changed the nature of extraterritorial rights.  No longer were strangers to be denied the advantages of local law. Indeed, territorial sovereignty meant the exercise of sovereignty over all residents within the borders of the state, and the system of extraterritorial consular jurisdiction tended to die out among Christian nations in the 18th and 19th centuries.  But a new justification was found for the continuation of that jurisdiction in those countries whose systems of justice were considered inferior, and it was this strong feeling with respect to Moslem and Far Eastern countries that was reflected, as we have seen, in the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> opinion.  Until 1842, China had asserted control over all foreigners within its territory, Shih Shun Liu, op. cit. supra, 76-89, but, as a result of the Opium War, Great Britain negotiated a treaty with China whereby she obtained consular offices in five open ports and was granted extraterritorial rights over her citizens.  On July 3, 1844, Caleb Cushing negotiated a similar treaty on behalf of the United States.  8 Stat. 592 .  In a letter to Secretary of State Calhoun, he explained: “I entered China with the formed general conviction that the United States ought not to concede to any foreign state, under any circumstances, jurisdiction over the life and liberty of a citizen of the United States, unless that foreign state be of our own family of nations, — in a word, a Christian state.” Quoted in 7 Op. Atty. Gen. 495, 496-497.  Later treaties continued the extraterritorial rights of the United States, and the Treaty of 1903 contained the following article demonstrating the purpose of those rights: “The Government of China having expressed a strong desire to reform its judicial system and to bring it into accord with that of Western nations, the *61 United States agrees to give every assistance to such reform and will also be prepared to relinquish extraterritorial rights when satisfied that the state of the Chinese laws, the arrangements for their administration, and other considerations warrant it in doing so.” 33 Stat. 2208 , 2215.  The first treaty with Japan was negotiated by Commodore Perry in 1854.

 .” (Appendix, p. 353.) The Statesman's Yearbook of 1890 shows: China at the end of 1888: 1,020 Americans (p. 411); Japan in 1887: 711 Americans (p. 709); Morocco, 1889 estimate: “The number of Christians is very small, not exceeding 1,500.” (P. 739.) The Statesman’s Yearbook of 1901 shows: China at the end of 1899: 2,335 Americans (p. 484); Japan, December 31,1898, just before the termination of our extraterritorial rights: 1,165 Americans (p. 809); Morocco: “The number of Christians does not exceed 6,000; the Christian population of Tangier alone probably amounts to 5,000.” (P. 851.) These figures of course do not include those civilians temporarily in the country coming within consular jurisdiction.  *64 The consular court jurisdiction, then, was exercised in countries whose legal systems at the time were considered so inferior that justice could not be obtained in them by our citizens.  The existence of these courts was based on long-established custom and they were justified as the best possible means for securing justice for the few Americans present in those countries.  The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case, therefore, arose out of, and rests on, very special, confined circumstances, and cannot be applied automatically to the present situation, involving hundreds of thousands of American citizens in countries with civilized systems of justice.  If Congress had established consular courts or some other non-military procedure for trial that did not contain all the protections afforded by Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments for the trial of civilian dependents of military personnel abroad, we would be forced to a detailed analysis of the situation of the civilian dependent population abroad in deciding whether the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case should be extended to cover such a case. It is not necessary to do this in the present cases in view of our decision that the form of trial here provided cannot constitutionally be justified.  The Government, apparently recognizing the constitutional basis for the decision in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> , has, on rehearing, sought to show that civilians in general and civilian dependents in particular have been subject to military order and discipline ever since the colonial period.  The materials it has submitted seem too episodic, too meager, to form a solid basis in history, preceding and contemporaneous with the framing of the Constitution, for constitutional adjudication.  What has been urged on us falls far too short of proving a well-established practice — to be deemed to be infused into the Constitution — of court-martial jurisdiction, certainly not in capital cases, over such civilians in time of peace.  “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces .  .  .  .” Article 2 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provides: “The following persons are subject to this code: .
