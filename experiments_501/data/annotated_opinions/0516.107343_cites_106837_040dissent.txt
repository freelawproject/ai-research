**Dissenting Opinion**
 And also on the same day my Brother Brennan himself cited Garner with approval in Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513 (1958).  Since that time the Adler line of cases has been cited again and again with approval: Shelton v. Tucker, 364 *625 U. S. 479 (1960), in which both Adler and Beilan were quoted with approval, and Garner and Lerner were cited in a like manner; likewise in Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, 368 U. S. 278 (1961), Adler was quoted twice with approval; and, in a related field where the employee was discharged for refusal to answer questions as to his loyalty after being ordered to do so, Nelson v. Los Angeles County, 362 U. S. 1 (1960), the Court cited with approval all of the cases which today it says have been rejected, i.  e., Garner, Adler, Beilan and Lerner .  Later Konigsberg v. State Bar, 366 U. S. 36 (1961), likewise cited with approval both Beilan and Garner .  And in our decision in In re Anastaplo, 366 U. S. 82 (1961), Garner, Beilan and Lerner were all referred to.  Finally, only three Terms ago my Brother White relied upon Cramp , which in turn cited Adler with approval twice.  See Baggett v. Bullitt, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 360</citedDecision> (1964).  In view of this long list of decisions covering over 15 years of this Court’s history, in which no opinion of this Court even questioned the validity of the Adler line of cases, it is strange to me that the Court now finds that the “constitutional doctrine which has emerged since .  .  .  has rejected [Adler’s] major premise.” With due respect, as I read them, our cases have done no such thing.  III. The majority also finds that Adler did not pass upon § 3021 of the Education Law, nor subdivision 3 of § 105 of the Civil Service Law, nor upon the vagueness questions of subdivisions 1 (a), 1 (b) and 1 (c) of § 105.  I will now discuss them.
