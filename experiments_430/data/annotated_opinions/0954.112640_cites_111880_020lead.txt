 We rejected this claim, explaining that the costs associated with an ignorant or inadvertent procedural default are no less than where the failure to raise a claim is a deliberate strategy: It deprives the state courts of the opportunity to review trial errors.  When a federal habeas court hears such a claim, it undercuts the State’s ability to enforce its procedural rules just as surely as when the default was deliberate.  477 U. S., at 487.  We concluded: “So long as a defendant is represented by counsel whose performance is not constitutionally ineffective under the standard established in Strickland v. Washington, [ 466 U. S. 668 (1984)], we discern no inequity in requiring him to bear the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.” Id., at 488.  Applying the Carrier rule as stated, this case is at an end.  There is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings.  Pennsylvania v. Finley, <citedDecision>481 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1987); Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989) (applying the rule to capital cases).  Consequently, a petitioner cannot claim constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel in such proceedings.  See Wainwright v. Torna, 455 U. S. 586 (1982) (where there is no constitutional right to counsel there can be no deprivation of effective assistance).  Coleman contends that it was his attorney’s error that led to the late filing of his state habeas appeal.  This error cannot be constitutionally ineffective; therefore Coleman must “bear *753 the risk of attorney error that results in a procedural default.” Coleman attempts to avoid this reasoning by arguing that Carrier does not stand for such a broad proposition.  He contends that Carrier applies by its terms only in those situations where it is possible to state a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.  Where there is no constitutional right to counsel, Coleman argues, it is enough that a petitioner demonstrate that his attorney’s conduct would meet the Strickland standard, even though no independent Sixth Amendment claim is possible.

 *755 B Among the claims Coleman brought in state habeas, and then again in federal habeas, is ineffective assistance of counsel during trial, sentencing, and appeal.  Coleman contends that, at least as to these claims, attorney error in state ha-beas must constitute cause.  This is because, under Virginia law at the time of Coleman’s trial and direct appeal, ineffective assistance of counsel claims related to counsel’s conduct during trial or appeal could be brought only in state habeas.  See Walker v. Mitchell, 224 Va. 568, 571 , 299 S. E. 2d 698, 699-700 (1983); Dowell v. Commonwealth, 3 Va. App. 555, 562 , 351 S. E. 2d 915, 919 (1987).  Coleman argues that attorney error in failing to file timely in the first forum in which a federal claim can be raised is cause.  We reiterate that counsel’s ineffectiveness will constitute cause only if it is an independent constitutional violation.  <citedDecision>Finley</citedDecision> and Giarratano established that there is no right to counsel in state collateral proceedings.  For Coleman to prevail, therefore, there must be an exception to the rule of <citedDecision>Finley</citedDecision> and Giarratano in those cases where state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can present a challenge to his conviction.  • We need not answer this question broadly, however, for one state court has addressed Coleman’s claims: the state habeas trial court. The effectiveness of Coleman’s counsel before that court is not at issue here.  Coleman contends that it was the ineffectiveness of his counsel during the appeal from that determination that constitutes cause to excuse his default.  We thus need to decide only whether Coleman had a constitutional right to counsel on appeal from the state habeas trial court judgment.  We conclude that he did not.  Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 (1963), established that an indigent criminal defendant has a right to appointed counsel in his first appeal as of right in state court. Evitts v. Lucey, sUpra, held that this right encompasses a right to effective assistance of counsel for all criminal defendants in *756 their first appeal as of right.  We based our holding in Douglas on that “equality demanded by the Fourteenth Amendment.” 372 U. S., at 358.  Recognizing that “[a]bsolute equality is not required,” we nonetheless held that “where the merits of the one and only appeal an indigent has as of right are decided without benefit of counsel, we think an unconstitutional line has been drawn between rich and poor.” Id., at 357 (emphasis in original).  Coleman has had his “one and only appeal,” if that is what a state collateral proceeding may be considered; the Buchanan County Circuit Court, after a 2-day evidentiary hearing, addressed Coleman’s claims of trial error, including his ineffective assistance of counsel claims.  What Coleman requires here is a right to counsel on appeal from that determination.  Our case law will not support it.  In Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600 (1974), and Pennsylvania v. Finley, <citedDecision>481 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1987), we declined to extend the right to counsel beyond the first appeal of a criminal conviction.  We held in Ross that neither the fundamental fairness required by the Due Process Clause nor the Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection guarantee necessitated that States provide counsel in state discretionary appeals where defendants already had one appeal as of right.  “The duty of the State under our cases is not to duplicate the legal arsenal that may be privately retained by a criminal defendant in a continuing effort to reverse his conviction, but only to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State’s appellate process.” 417 U. S., at 616 .  Similarly, in <citedDecision>Finley</citedDecision> we held that there is no right to counsel in state collateral proceedings after exhaustion of direct appellate review.  <citedDecision>481 U. S., at 556</citedDecision> (citing Ross, supra).  These cases dictate the answer here.  Given that a criminal defendant has no right to counsel beyond his first appeal in pursuing state discretionary or collateral review, it would defy logic for us to hold that Coleman had a right to counsel *757 to appeal a state collateral determination of his claims of trial error.  Because Coleman had no right to counsel to pursue his appeal in state habeas, any attorney error that led to the default of Coleman’s claims in state court cannot constitute cause to excuse the default in federal habeas.  As Coleman does not argue in this Court that federal review of his claims is necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice, he is barred from bringing these claims in federal habeas.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.  This rule does not apply if the petitioner failed to exhaust state remedies and the court to which the petitioner would be required to present his claims in order to meet the exhaustion requirement would now find the claims procedurally barred.
