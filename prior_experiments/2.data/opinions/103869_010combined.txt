      <p class="indent">The United States brought these three actions to recover inheritance taxes imposed by the State of Oklahoma upon the transfer of the estates of three deceased members of the Five Civilized Tribes and paid under protest by the Secretary of the Interior from funds under his control belonging to those estates. The district court entered judgment on the merits for the state in each case. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. Unied States v. Oklahoma Tax Comm., 10 Cir., <span class="citation no-link">131 F.2d 635</span>. We granted certiorari because of the importance of the cases in the administration of Indian affairs and to the State of Oklahoma. Oklahoma Tax Comm. v. United States, <span class="citation no-link">318 U.S. 748</span>, <span class="citation no-link">63 S.Ct. 663</span>, 87 L.Ed. &#8212;-. The basic questions to be decided are whether, as a matter of state law, the state taxing statutes reach these estates, and whether Congress has taken from the State of Oklahoma the power to levy taxes upon the transfer of all or a part of property and funds of these deceased Indians.</p>

      <p class="indent">The properties of which the estates are composed fall into four main categories: land exempt from direct taxation; land not exempt from direct taxation; restricted cash and securities held for the Indians by the Secretary of the Interior; and miscellaneous personal properties and insurance. The total value of the three estates was assessed at approximately $1,245,000, of which about 90% represents the value of the cash and securities.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a></p>

      <p class="indent">Initially we are met with the contention that Oklahoma did not intend to tax the estates of the members of the Five Civilized Tribes. We cannot agree with this view. The two controlling statutes broadly provide for a tax upon all transfers made in contemplation of death or intended to take effect after death as well as transfers 'by will or the intestate laws of this state.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">2</a> The language of the statutes does not except either Indians or any other persons from their scope. Efforts of Oklahoma to apply this tax to the estate of a deceased Quapaw Indian were frustrated by this Court's opinion in Childers v. Beaver, <span class="citation" data-id="100830"><a href="/opinion/100830/childers-v-beaver/">270 U.S. 555</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="100830"><a href="/opinion/100830/childers-v-beaver/">46 S.Ct. 387</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">70 L.Ed. 730</span>, decided in 1926. Shortly afterwards the Oklahoma Supreme Court refused to sustain the tax on an Osage estate under the impression that this result was required by the Beaver decision; but, significantly, the Oklahoma Court held that the scope of the state law should not be limited 'further than the rule therein established.' Childers v. Pope, <span class="citation no-link">119 Okl. 300</span>, 303, <span class="citation no-link">249 P. 726</span>, 729. About 1938, the Oklahoma taxing authorities apparently initiated new efforts to collect an estate tax from Indians. This state action followed our decision in Superintendent v. Commissioner, <span class="citation" data-id="102466"><a href="/opinion/102466/superintendent-of-five-civilized-tribes-v-commissioner/">295 U.S. 418</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="102466"><a href="/opinion/102466/superintendent-of-five-civilized-tribes-v-commissioner/">55 S.Ct. 820</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">79 L.Ed. 1517</span>, in which we held that the restricted income of Indians was subject to the federal income tax, and our decision in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., <span class="citation" data-id="102986"><a href="/opinion/102986/helvering-v-mountain-producers-corp/">303 U.S. 376</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="102986"><a href="/opinion/102986/helvering-v-mountain-producers-corp/">58 S.Ct. 623</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">82 L.Ed. 907</span>, which overruled previous decisions limiting the power of the state to impose certain types of taxes on incomes derived from tax exempt and restricted Indian property. The state tax authorities have with reasonable consistency interpreted their acts as covering estates such as these, and have attempted to enforce the statutes except when they considered enforcement precluded by decisions of this Court. The district court held that the state law does apply to these estates. This interpretation is consistent with that given by the state administrative authorities, with the language of the acts themselves and with the State Supreme Court's holding in Childers v. Pope, supra.</p>

      <p class="indent">The respondent's second and major contention is that the state may not impose an estate tax upon the transfer of the restricted cash and securities because Congress by placing restrictions upon this property manifested a purpose to exempt it from Oklahoma estate taxes. Restricted property of an Indian is that which may not be freely alienated or used by the Indian without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. We find, upon an examination of both the cases dealing generally with the taxation of Indian property and the statute which imposes the restriction, that the restriction, without more, is not the equivalent of a congressional grant of estate tax immunity for the cash and securities.<a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref">3</a></p>

    <div class="num" id="p5">
      <span class="num">5</span>
      <p class="indent">The many cases dealing generally with the problem of Indian tax exemptions provide no basis for the government's argument that Congress, in view of the existing legal framework, must have assumed that it would immunize the securities and cash from estate taxes by restricting their alienation. Worcester v. Georgia, <span class="citation no-link">6 Pet. 515</span>, <span class="citation no-link">8 L.Ed. 483</span>, held that a state might not regulate the conduct of persons in Indian territory on the theory that the Indian tribes were separate political entities with all the rights of independent status&#8212;a condition which has not existed for many years in the State of Oklahoma. The same principle was carried into the tax filed in The Kansas Indians, <span class="citation" data-id="87869"><a href="/opinion/87869/the-kansas-indians/">5 Wall. 737</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">18 L.Ed. 667</span>, and for the same reasons. That case also emphasized that the Indians could 'not look to Kansas for protection', 759 of 5 Wall., and that Kansas was not 'obliged to confer any rights on them', 758 of 5 Wall. The tax exemption, said the Court, must last until the Indians were 'clothed with the rights and bound to all the duties of citizens', 756 of 5 Wall. A similar result was reached in The New York Indians, <span class="citation" data-id="87870"><a href="/opinion/87870/the-new-york-indians/">5 Wall. 761</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">18 L.Ed. 70</span>, decided the same day, where the State sought to raise money by taxes to build roads in Indian reservations and where existing treaties forbade the state's building such roads. Later, for a period of time, Indian lands held in trust by the United States were found to be constitutionally tax exempt on the theory that they were federal instrumentalities, i.e., that the lands were held by the United States for the Indians, and were therefore non-taxable. United States v. Rickert, <span class="citation" data-id="95792"><a href="/opinion/95792/united-states-v-rickert/">188 U.S. 432</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="95792"><a href="/opinion/95792/united-states-v-rickert/">23 S.Ct. 478</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">47 L.Ed. 532</span>. In time, this constitutional concept was expanded to grant tax exemption to the income derived from Indian lands, whether tribally or individually owned, even when the privilege of exploitation had been granted to non-Indian lessees.<a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref">4</a> The instrumentality concept ultimately resulted in a decision exempting Indian estates from taxation. Childers v. Beaver, <span class="citation" data-id="100830"><a href="/opinion/100830/childers-v-beaver/">supra.</a></span> None of these cases held, nor has this Court ever decided, that congressional restriction of an Indian's income carried an implication of estate tax exemption.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p6">
      <span class="num">6</span>
      <p class="indent">The underlying principles on which these decisions are based do not fit the situation of the Oklahoma Indians. Although there are remnants of the form of tribal sovereignty, these Indians have no effective tribal autonomy as in Worcester v. Georgia, supra; and, unlike the Indians involved in The Kansas Indians case, supra, they are actually citizens of the State with little to distinguish them from all other citizens except for their limited property restrictions and their tax exemptions.<a class="footnote" href="#fn5" id="fn5_ref">5</a> Their lands are held in fee, not in trust, as in the Rickert case, and the doctrine of constitutional immunity from taxation for the income of their holdings on the federal instrumentality theory has been renounced. Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corporation, supra. Chil ers v. Beavers, supra, was in effect overruled by the Mountain Producers decision. The immunity formerly said to rest on constitutional implication cannot now be resurrected in the form of statutory implication.</p>

    <div class="num" id="p7">
      <span class="num">7</span>
      <p class="indent">The cash and securities of which these estates are almost entirely composed were restricted by the Act of January 27, 1933.<a class="footnote" href="#fn6" id="fn6_ref">6</a> Unless the tax immunity is granted by the restriction clause itself, there is not a word in the Act which even remotely suggests that Congress meant to exempt Indians' cash and securities from Oklahoma's estate taxes. We conclude that this Act does not exempt the restricted property from taxation for two reasons: (1) the legislative history of the Act refutes the contention that an exemption was intended; and (2) application of the normal rule against tax exemption by statutory implication prevents our reading such an implication into the Act.</p>

      <p class="indent">The 1933 Act was intended to serve two purposes relevant to this case. One was to continue the restrictions on Indian property for the purpose of protecting the Indians from loss to individuals who might take advantage of them; and the other was to preserve the status of certain Indian land as non-taxable until 1956. See the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Rutledge in Board of Commissioners v. Seber, <span class="citation" data-id="103816"><a href="/opinion/103816/board-of-county-commrs-v-seber/">318 U.S. 705</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="103816"><a href="/opinion/103816/board-of-county-commrs-v-seber/">63 S.Ct. 920</a></span>, 87 L.Ed. &#8212;-, decided this term. This Act was before two Congresses, the 71st and the 72nd. It was the subject of exhaustive debate, as well as of several committee reports, and there is no indication whatever in all that discussion of an intention to exempt Indians from estate taxes.<a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref">7</a></p>

      <p class="indent">The bill was sponsored by Oklahoma Congressmen who said nothing which supports the imputation that they intended to deprive their state of this income. It was decribed by its sponsor, Congressman Hastings, as follows:</p>

    <div class="num" id="p10">
      <span class="num">10</span>
      <p class="indent">'You ask me what the bill does. If the Members of Congress understood the bill there would not be a vote against it. Oil has been struck underneath some of the lands allotted to the members of thes  tribes. Some of these full-blood allottees without business experience, now have to their credit $100,000, $200,000, and it is estimated, up to $1,000,000. Suppose one of these Indian allottees died after April 26, 1931. Then this money must be turned over to these heirs without supervision. Do you want to do that? Is there a man on the floor of the House who would want to do that?'<a class="footnote" href="#fn8" id="fn8_ref">8</a></p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p11">
      <span class="num">11</span>
      <p class="indent">This purpose, and none other, is reiterated throughout the discussion&#8212;not a word of an intention to expand tax exemptions was spoken by any Congressman.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p12">
      <span class="num">12</span>
      <p class="indent">The legislative history not only fails to give any affirmative support to such an implication but expressly negatives that intent. The principal clause of the bill dealing with taxation is that which continues a limited land tax exemption for twenty-five years. On two separate occasions, in two Congresses, the bill's sponsor assured the House of Representatives: 'This (bill) only applies to restricted and tax-exempt land. This does not increase tax-exempt land at all.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn9" id="fn9_ref">9</a> Such a bill, carefully drawn so as not to widen tax exemptions for land, and without a word of such intent in its legislative history, cannot be supposed by implication to have prohibited estate taxes. If there could be any doubt of this proposition it is surely removed by a later clause of the 1933 statute which provides that all minerals extracted from the land should be subject to state taxation.<a class="footnote" href="#fn10" id="fn10_ref">10</a> Congress could not have intended that the minerals themselves should be subject to taxation, but that the proceeds of their sale, even further removed from the land itself, should be immune.</p>

      <p class="indent">This Court has repeatedly said that tax exemptions are not granted by implication. United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, <span class="citation" data-id="103192"><a href="/opinion/103192/united-states-trust-co-v-helvering/">307 U.S. 57</a></span>, 60, <span class="citation" data-id="103192"><a href="/opinion/103192/united-states-trust-co-v-helvering/">59 S.Ct. 692</a></span>, 693, <span class="citation no-link">83 L.Ed. 1104</span>. It has applied that rule to taxing acts affecting Indians as to all others. As was said of an excise tax on tobacco produced by the Cherokee Indians in 1870, 'If the exemption had been intended it would doubtless have been expressed.' The Cherokee Tobacco, <span class="citation" data-id="88351"><a href="/opinion/88351/the-cherokee-tobacco/">11 Wall. 616</a></span>, 620, <span class="citation no-link">20 L.Ed. 227</span>. In holding the income tax applicable to Indians, the Court said, 'The terms of the 1928 Revenue Act (26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 345 et seq.) are very broad, and nothing there indicates that Indians are to be excepted. * * * If exemption exists it must derive plainly from agreements with the Creeks or some Act of Congress dealing with their affairs.' Superintendent v. Commissioner, <span class="citation" data-id="102466"><a href="/opinion/102466/superintendent-of-five-civilized-tribes-v-commissioner/">supra,</a></span> <span class="citation no-link">295 U.S. 420</span>, <span class="citation no-link">55 S.Ct. 821</span>, <span class="citation no-link">79 L.Ed. 1517</span>. If Congress intends to prevent the State of Oklahoma from levying a general non-discriminatory estate tax applying alike to all its citizens, it should say so in plain words. Such a conclusion can not rest on dubious inferences. 'Nontaxability and restriction upon alienation are distinct things', Superintendent v. Commissioner, <span class="citation" data-id="102466"><a href="/opinion/102466/superintendent-of-five-civilized-tribes-v-commissioner/">supra,</a></span> <span class="citation no-link">295 U.S. 421</span>, <span class="citation" data-id="102471"><a href="/opinion/102471/youngstown-sheet-tube-co-v-united-states/">55 S.Ct. 822</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">79 L.Ed. 1517</span>, and when Congress wants to require both non-alienability and nontaxability it can, as it has so often done, say so explicitly.<a class="footnote" href="#fn11" id="fn11_ref">11</a></p>

      <p class="indent">It is true that our interpretation of the 1933 statute must be in accord with the generous and protective spirit which the United States properly feels toward its Indian wards, but we cannot assume that Congress will choose to aid the Indians by permenently granting them immunit  from taxes which they are as able as other citizens to pay. It runs counter to any traditional concept of the guardian and ward relationship to suppose that a ward should be exempted from taxation by the nature of his status, and the fact that the federal government is the guardian of its Indian ward is no reason, by itself, why a state should be precluded from taxing the estate of the Indian. We have held that the Indians, like all other citizens, must pay federal income taxes. Superintendent v. Commissioner, <span class="citation" data-id="102466"><a href="/opinion/102466/superintendent-of-five-civilized-tribes-v-commissioner/">supra,</a></span> <span class="citation no-link">295 U.S. 421</span>, <span class="citation" data-id="102471"><a href="/opinion/102471/youngstown-sheet-tube-co-v-united-states/">55 S.Ct. 822</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">79 L.Ed. 1517</span>. 'Wardship with limited power over his property' did not there 'without more, render (the Indian) immune from the common burden.' A federal court has held, in a well reasoned decision defended before us by the Solicitor General of the United States, who is not a party to this action, that an Indian's estate is subject to the federal estate tax. Landman v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., <span class="citation no-link">123 F.2d 787</span>.<a class="footnote" href="#fn12" id="fn12_ref">12</a> Congress cannot have intended to impose federal income and inheritance taxes on the Indians and at the same time exempt them by implication from similar state taxes.</p>

Citizens of Oklahoma must pay for these benefits. If some pay less, others must pay more. Since Oklahoma has become a state, it has been authoritatively stated that tax losses resulting from tax immunity of Indians have totaled more than $125,000,000, a sum only slightly less than the bonded indebtedness of the state.<a class="footnote" href="#fn14" id="fn14_ref">14</a> If Congress intended to relieve these Indians from the burden of a state inheritance tax as a consequence of our national policy toward Indians, there is still no reason why we should imply that it intended the burden to be borne so heavily by one state. But there is a complete absence of any evidence of congressional belief that these exemptions are required on equitable grounds, no matter on which sovereign the burden falls. Here is a tax based solely on ability to pay.<a class="footnote" href="#fn15" id="fn15_ref">15</a> 'Only the same duties are exacted as from our own citizens. The burden must rest somewhere.

      <p class="indent">The validity of the taxes on the transfer of the land presents a somewhat different problem. Some of these lands are exempt from direct taxation by virtue of explicit congressional command. The Act of May 10, 1928, <span class="citation no-link">45 Stat. 495</span>, for example, provides that Indians of a class which includes the three deceased should select up to 160 acres of his allotted, inherited or devised restricted lands, which 'shall remain exempt from taxation while the title remains in the Indian designated * * * or in any full-blood Indian heir of devisee', while all other restricted lands are made subject to taxation by Oklahoma. The state argues that congressional exemption of the land from direct state taxation does not exempt the land from an estate tax, because of the principles announced in United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, supra. A majority of the Court concludes that this principle does not apply to Indian lands specifically exempted from direct taxation. We therefore hold that the transfer of those lands which Congress has exempted from direct taxation by the  tate are also exempted from estate taxes.</p>

      <p class="indent">I dissent because the opinion of the Court rejects a century and a half of history. We are not here dealing with mere property or income that is tax exempt. This is not the ordinary case of government and its citizens, or a group of citizens who seek to avoid their obligations. Our concern here is entirely different. It is with a people who are our wards and towards whom Congress has fashioned a policy of protection due to obligations well known to all of us. It rests with Congress to choose when we are done with that trusteeship. Meanwhile it is our obligation to interpret in the light of the history of that relationship all legislation which Congress has enacted to carry out its Indian policy.</p>

      <p class="indent">Normally it is true that strong considerations of fiscal and social policy view tax exemptions with a hostile eye. Such exemptions are not to be lightly implied, and every reasonable implication in construing legislation is to be made against their grant. But this general doctrine against tax exemption is irrelevant in considering the taxing power of a state in relation to Indians. For as to them a totally different principle comes into operation, namely, the special status of Indians during the whole course of our constitutional and legal history. There can be no doubt of Congress' plenary power to exempt Indians and their property from all forms of state taxation. Such power exists to prevent impairment of the manner in, or means by which Congress effectuates its Indian policy, at least so long as Congress has not determined that the interests of the Indians require their complete release from tutelage or the final termination of the United States' guardian hip over them.

To deny such constitutional power is to deny the presupposition of all legislation relating to Indians as well as an unbroken line of decisions on Indian law in this Court and all that underlies them. This course of legislation and adjudication may be fairly summarized as recognizing the special relation of Indians toward the United States and the exclusion of state power with relation to them, except in so far as the federal government has actually released to the state governments its constitutional supremacy over this special field. Therefore, so far as the power of state to tax Indian property is concerned, the ordinary rule of tax exemption is reversed; a state must make an affirmative showing of a grant by Congress of the withdrawal of the immunity of Indian property from state taxation. This is so because it is Indian property and because Indians stand in a special relation to the federal government from which the states are excluded unless the Congress has manifested a clear purpose to terminate such an immunity and allow states to treat Indians as part of the general community.</p>

      <p class="indent">Congress has manifested no such purpose with regard to the estates of the deceased Indians before us. On the contrary, those Indians were subject to federal control.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1-1" id="fn1-1_ref">1</a> Most of their allotted lands were expressly exempt from taxation, and, as the opinion of the Court recognizes, this removed them from the operation of Oklahoma's estate tax.<a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref">2</a> But apart from these express exemptions, the bulk of the properties in the three estates were restricted against alienation and encumbrance by various acts of Congress.<a class="footnote" href="#fn3-1" id="fn3-1_ref">3</a> History, as well as statements of Congress itself,<a class="footnote" href="#fn4-1" id="fn4-1_ref">4</a> leave no doubt that property so restricted is beyond the taxing power of the states, unless and until Congress gives its consent.

In all those cases a non-Indian lessee of restricted Indian lands was held immune from state taxation of various kinds because, and only because, the lands themselves and the leasing of them were held to be immune from taxation, and this in turn because they were the lands of Indians held in Government tutelage, who were permitted to lease the lands only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. This immunity for lessees was withdrawn by Helvering v.

In neither the Coronado case nor in the Producers case was there any contention that the land in the hands of the lessors was subject to taxation. That was recognized and accepted as correct. The point was that even though the land was tax immune in the hands of the lessor, the lessor's immunity did not extend to the lessee who had no personal immunity and who acquired the land for his own purposes and made a profit from it. In other words, the withdrawal of immunity from a non-Indian lessee of restricted Indian land rests upon the remoteness of the effect of that taxation upon such I dian property, cf. Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, <span class="citation" data-id="103172"><a href="/opinion/103172/graves-v-new-york-ex-rel-okeefe/">306 U.S. 466</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="103172"><a href="/opinion/103172/graves-v-new-york-ex-rel-okeefe/">59 S.Ct. 595</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">83 L.Ed. 927</span>, <span class="citation no-link">120 A.L.R. 1466</span>, not upon a notion that Congress did not intend by imposing restrictions to prohibit state taxation of the interest of Indians in their restricted property, nor upon the supposition that Congress lacks power to do so.

This allotment program evolved out of the historical background sketched above, and took its cue from the previous protection and freedom from state control accorded Indians and their lands. The Indian surrendered tribal land, protected against state taxation as well as against all other forms of voluntary and involuntary encumbrance and alienation. Cf. The Kansas Indians, supra; The New York Indians, supra. Under the various allotment acts he received in return land which was intended to have the same measure of protection for a temporary period, generally subject to extension. Thus the General Allotment Act of 1887, <span class="citation no-link">24 Stat. 388</span>, provided for the issuance to allottees of trust patents which were to declare: 'the United States does * * * hold the land thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust * * * and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian * * * in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge and incumbrance whatsoever.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn8-1" id="fn8-1_ref">8</a> Lands so held in trust are immune from state taxation.

      <p class="indent">State taxation of 'restricted' lands as well as taxation of 'trust' lands, in the absence of Congressional authorization, is a possible cause of the loss which Congress has said shall not occur. The restrictions are not limited to voluntary sale consistently with their purpose they extend to all forms of transfer or encumbrance, involuntary as well as voluntary. Cf. Goudy v. Meath, <span class="citation" data-id="96513"><a href="/opinion/96513/james-goudy-plff-in-err-v-edward-meath-assessor-of-pierce-county/">203 U.S. 146</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="96513"><a href="/opinion/96513/james-goudy-plff-in-err-v-edward-meath-assessor-of-pierce-county/">27 S.Ct. 48</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">51 L.Ed. 130</span>. The interference of state taxation with Congress' program of protection is made clear by the fact that the instant Oklahoma inheritance tax acts impose liens upon the property until the taxes are paid.<a class="footnote" href="#fn10-1" id="fn10-1_ref">10</a> The possible consequences of a tax lien upon Indian property are pointed out in The New York Indians, supra, where it was held that the mere existence of a lien in a state taxing act invalidates it, despite a provision to the effect that no foreclosure of a lien should affect the Indian's right of occupancy. And, even when permitting specified forms of state taxation of restricted Indian property, Congress has significantly provided in numerous statutes that no tax lien should attach.<a class="footnote" href="#fn11-1" id="fn11-1_ref">11</a> I conclude that when Congress imposed restrictions upon Indian property, it meant, and was saying in effect, that the property was exempt from state taxation while the restrictions continue or until Congress waives the immunity. Indeed, Congress has clearly stated that this was its intention by declaring in the Act of April 17, 1937, <span class="citation no-link">50 Stat. 68</span>, which permitted a gross production tax to be imposed by Oklahoma on lead and zinc produced from restricted Quapaw lands: 'In accordance with the uniform policy of the United States Government to hold the lands of the Quapaw Indians while restricted and the income therefrom free from State taxation of whatsoever nature, except as said immunity is expressly waived, and, in pursuance of said fixed policyIt is herein expressly provided that the waiver of tax immunity herein provided shall be in lieu of all other State taxes of whatever nature on said restricted lands or the income therefrom, * * *.'<a class="footnote" href="#fn12-1" id="fn12-1_ref">12</a></p>

They still exist (&#167; 28 of Act of April 26, 1906, <span class="citation no-link">34 Stat. 137</span>), and have recently been authorized to resume some of their former powers (Act of June 26, 1936, <span class="citation no-link">49 Stat. 1967</span>, <span class="citation no-link">25 U.S.C.A. &#167; 501</span> et seq.). Congress has regarded their members of the half Indian blood or more, whether enrolled or not, as restricted tribal Indians subject to federal control. The fact that these Indians are citizens is not inconsistent with their restricted status or the exercise of federal supervision over them. See Board of Commissioners v. Seber, <span class="citation" data-id="103816"><a href="/opinion/103816/board-of-county-commrs-v-seber/">supra;</a></span> Glenn v.

        <p>The fact that the exemptions do not mention inheritance or estate taxes is unimportant. As pointed out before, contrary to the general rule Indian tax exemptions are to be liberally construed. See Carpenter v.

        <p> There are various other expressions of Congressional understanding on this point. For example, H. Rep. No. 2415, 71st Cong., 3d Sess., p. 1, advocating passage of what is now the Act of February 14, 1931, <span class="citation no-link">46 Stat. 1108</span>, declares: 'Under existing law the restricted allotted lands of Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes are tax exempt while restricted.'

        <p> Two of the decedents died before the Act was passed. The House Committee report, however, makes it clear that the restriction on funds was intended to be declaratory and retroactive. H.Rep. No. 1015, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. In view of this there is no reason why the restricted funds in the estates of those decedents, held by the Secretary, should not be deemed covered by that Act, and hence tax exempt by virtue of the restrictions.</p>
