*123 Mr. Justice Roberts, dissenting.  There is certainly a distinction in fact between the transaction considered in Klein v. United States, 283 U. S. 231 , and those under review in Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., 296 U. S. 39 , and Becker v. St. Louis Uniont Trust Co., 296 U. S. 48 .  The courts, the Board of Tax Appeals, and the Treasury have found no difficulty in observing the distinction in specific cases. I believe it is one of substance, not merely of terminology, and not dependent on the niceties of conveyancing or recondite doctrines of ancient property law. But if I am wrong in this, I still think the judgments in Nos. 110-112, and 183 should be affirmed and that in 399 should be reversed.  The rule of interpretation adopted in the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases should now be followed for two reasons: First, that rule was indicated by decisions of this court as the one applicable in the circumstances here disclosed, as early as 1927; was progressively developed and applied by the Board of Tax Appeals, the lower federal courts, and this court, up to the decision of McCormick v. Burnet, <citedDecision>283 U. S. 784</citedDecision> , in 1931; and has since been followed by those tribunals in not less than fifty cases. It ought not to be set aside after such a history.  Secondly.  The rule was not contrary to any treasury regulation; was, indeed, in accord with such regulations as there were on the subject; .was subsequently embodied in a specific regulation, and, with this background, Congress has three times reenacted the law without amending § 302 (c) in respect of the matter here in issue.  The settled doctrine, that reenactment of a statute so construed, without alteration, renders such construction a part of the statute itself, should not be ignored but observed.  *124 1.  The Revenue Act of 1926 lays a tax upon the transfer of the net estate of a decedent.  That estate is defined to embrace the value of all his property, real or personal, tangible or intangible (less certain deductions), at the time of his death.

 There is no tax imposed by the statute because there is no transfer any more than there would be in the case of a similar life estate given A by his grandmother.  (This is May v. Heiner, 281 U. S. 238 .) If, on the other hand, A creates an estate for years or for life in B, retaining the remaining beneficial interest .in the property for himself, and, whether by the terms of the grant, or by the terms of A’s will, or under the intestate law, that remainder passes to someone else at his death, such passage renders the transfer taxable.  (This is Klein v. United States, supra.) If what A does is to transfer his property irrevocably, with provision that it shall be.  enjoyed successively by various persons for life and then go absolutely to a named person, but that if he, A, shall outlive that person, the property shall come back to him, and A dies in the lifetime of the person in question, A has merely" lost the chance that the beneficial ownership of the property may revert to him.  That chance cannot pass under his will or under the intestate laws.  As there is no transfer which can become effective at his death by the shifting of any interest from him, no tax is imposed, (This is <citedDecision>McCormick</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Burnet, supra,</citedDecision> and Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Company, supra.) 2.  These governing principles were indicated as early as 1927 4 and were thereafter developed, in application to specific cases, in a consistent line of authorities.  In May v. Heiner, supra, it was held that a transfer in trust under which the income was payable to.  the trans-feror’s husband for his life and, after his death, to the transferor during her life, with remainder to her children, was not subject to tax as a'transfer intended to; take effect *127 in possession or enjoyment at or after death.  .  This court said (p. 243): “.  .  .  At the death of Mrs. May no interest in the property held under the trust deed, passed from her to the living; title thereto had been definitely fixed by the trust deed.  The interest therein which she possessed .immediately prior to her death was obliterated by that event.” [Italics supplied.] It will be noted that this is the equivalent of the Treasury’s statement, supra, that such an interest lapses at death'.  That decision is indistinguishable in principle from the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases and the instant cases; and what was there said serves to distinguish the Klein case. <citedDecision>McCormick</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Burnet</citedDecision> followed May v. Heiner .  The court there held that neither a reservation by the grantor of a life estate with remainders over, nor a provision for a reverter in case all the beneficiaries should die in the lifetime of the grantor, made the gifts transfers intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the grantor’s death.  In the Circuit Court of Appeals the Commissioner urged that the provision for payment of the trust estate to the settlor in case she survived all the beneficiaries rendered the transfer taxable.  That court dealt at length with the point and sustained his view.  ( 43 F. 2d 277, 279 .) The Commissioner made the same contention in this court, but it was overruled upon the authority of May v. Heiner .  Then came the two St. Louis Union Trust Company cases, decided upon the authority of May v. Heiner and <citedDecision>McCormick</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Burnet</citedDecision> .  Finally, the <citedDecision>McCormick</citedDecision> case wad followed in Bingham v. United States, 296 U. S. 211 .  Since the opinion of the- court appears to treat the St. Louis cases as the origin of the principle there announced, *128 it is important to emphasize the fact that the rule had been settled by this court as early as 1930; and to note, other decisions rendered prior to the St. Louis cases. In seven, intervening between May v. Heiner and the St. Louis cases, the Board 'of Tax Appeals reached the same conclusion as that announced in the St. Louis cases. 5 The Board’s action was affirmed in four of them.  6 Four other decisions by Circuit Courts of Appeals were to the same effect.  7 In practically all, reliance was placed upon Shukert v. Allen, Reinecke v. Northern Trust Company, May v. Heiner , and <citedDecision>McCormick</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Burnet</citedDecision> , or some of them.  Thus, when the question came before this court again in the St. Louis cases, there was a substantial body of authority following and applying the Heiner and <citedDecision>McCormick</citedDecision> cases. Since the St. Louis cases were decided, the principle on which they went has been repeatedly applied by the Board of Tax Appeals and the courts.  The Board has followed the cases in no less than seventeen instances.  8 *129 The record is the same in the courts.  The St. Louis cases have been followed in fourteen cases. 9 In some of these the Government has sought review in this court but in none, except those now presented, has it asked the court to overrule those decisions.  If there ever was an instance in which the doctrine of stare decisis should govern, this is it.  Aside from the obvious hardship involved in treating the taxpayers in the present cases differently from many others whose cases have been decided or closed in accordance with the settled rule, there are the weightier considerations that the judgments now rendered disappoint the just expectations of those who have acted in reliance upon the uniform construction of the statute by this and all other federal tribunals; and that, to upset these precedents now, must necessarily shake the confidence of the bar and the public in the stability of the rulings of the courts and make it impossible for inferior tribunals to adjudicate controversies in reliance on the decisions of this court. To nullify more than fifty decisions, five of them by.  this *130 court, some of which have stood for a decade, in order to change a mere rule of statutory construction, seems to me an altogether unwise and unjustified exertion of power.

 Section 302 (c) was the successor of analogous sections in earlier acts and the predecessor of similar sections in later acts.  10 The subsection has been amended in successive Revenue Acts.  As a result of the Treasury’s experience in the enforcement of the law, Congress has from time to ktime thought it necessary to extend the scope of the subsection in the interest of more efficient administration.  Within constitutional limits spch extension is a matter of legislative policy for Congress alone.  11 It is familiar practice for Congress to amend a statute to obviate a construction given it by the courts.  The legislative history of § 302 (c) demonstrates that Congress has elected not to make such 'an amendment to *131 meet the construction placed upon it by this court in the St. Louis cases. May v. Heiner was decided in 1930.  The Treasury' was dissatisfied with the decision and in three later cases attacked the ruling, amongst- them <citedDecision>McCormick</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Burnet</citedDecision> .  The court announced its judgments in these cases on March 2, 1931, reaffirming May v. Heiner .  On the following day Congress adopted a joint resolution amending § 302 (c) to tax a transfer with reservation of a life estate to the grantor, but, in so doing, it omitted to deal, with a contingent interest reserved to the grantor or the possibility of reverter remaining in him, involved in both Heiner and <citedDecision>McCormick</citedDecision> .  See Hassett v. Welch, 303 U. S. 303, 308-9 .  The omission is significant.  It may be argued that in the haste of preparing and passing the amendment the point was overlooked.  But the joint resolution was reenacted by § 803 of the Revenue Act of 1932, 12 without any alteration to cover- the point.  The Revenue Act of 1934 13 amended § 302 (d) of the Revenue Act of 1926 but did not change § 302 (c) as it then stood.  The day the St. Louis cases were decided, this court announced its opinion in White v. Poor, 296 U. S. 98 , construing § 302 (d) of the Act of 1926.
