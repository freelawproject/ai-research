**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
Justice Scalia, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with the Court that extending the Social Security tax to sitting Article III judges in 1984 violated Article Ill’s Compensation Clause. I part paths with the Court on the issue of extending the Medicare tax to federal judges in 1983, which I think was also unconstitutional. 1 *582 I As an initial matter, I think the Court is right in concluding that Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920) — holding that new taxes of general applicability cannot be applied to sitting Article III judges — is no longer good law, and should be overruled. We went out of our way in O’Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277, 280-281 (1939), to catalog criticism of Evans, and subsequently recognized, in United States v. Will, <targetCase>449 U.S. 200</targetCase>, 227, and n. 31 (1980), that O’Malley had “undermine[d] the reasoning of Evans.” The Court’s decision today simply recognizes what should be obvious: that Evans has not only been undermined, but has in fact collapsed. II My disagreement with the Court arises from its focus upon the issue of discrimination, which turns out to be dispositive with respect to the Medicare tax. The Court holds “that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax . . . upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect.” Ante, at 571. Since “the Medicare tax is just such a nondiscriminatory tax,” the Court concludes that “application of [that] tax law to federal judges is [ejonstitutional.” Ante, at 572.
