 And if, on the other hand, it appears after a realistic assessment of the situation that the fault of both parties is roughly equal, then there is no reason why a rule that apportions damages would be any less likely to induce a settlement than a rule that always divides damages equally.  Experience with comparative negligence in the personal injury area teaches that a rule of fairness in court will produce fair out-of-court settlements.  13 But even if this argument were more persuasive than it is, it could hardly be accepted.  For, at bottom, it asks us to continue the operation of an archaic rule because its facile application out of court yields quick, though inequitable, settlements, and relieves the courts of some litigation.  Congestion in the courts cannot justify a legal rule that produces unjust results in litigation simply to encourage speedy out-of-court accommodations.  *409 Finally, the respondent suggests that the creation of a new rule of damages in maritime collision cases is a task for Congress and not for this Court. 14 But the Judiciary has traditionally taken the lead in formulating flexible and fair remedies in the law maritime, and “Congress has largely left to this Court the responsibility for fashioning the controlling rules of admiralty law.” Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co., 374 U. S. 16, 20 .  See also Moragne v. States Marine Lines, <citedDecision>398 U. S. 375</citedDecision> , 405 n. 17; Kermarec v. Compagnie Generate Transatlantique, 358 U. S. 625, 630-632 .  No statutory or judicial precept precludes a change in the rule of divided damages, and indeed a proportional fault rule would simply bring recovery for property damage in maritime collision cases into line with the rule of admiralty law long since established by Congress for personal injury cases. See the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. § 688 .  15 *410 As the authors of a leading admiralty law treatise have put the matter: “[T]here is no reason why the Supreme Court cannot at this late date ‘confess error’ and adopt the proportional fault doctrine without Congressional action.  The resolution to follow the divided damages rule, taken 120 years ago, rested not on overwhelming authority but on judgments of fact and of fairness which may have been tenable then but are hardly so today.  No ‘vested rights,’ in theory or fact, have intervened.  The regard for ‘settled expectation’ which is the heart-reason of .  .

 12 See, e. g., The City of New York, 147 U. S. 72 , 85: “Where fault on the part of one vessel is established by uneontradicted testimony, and such fault is, of itself, sufficient to account for the disaster, it is not enough for such vessel, to raise a doubt with regard to the management of the other vessel.  There is some presumption at least adverse to its claim, and any reasonable doubt with regard to the propriety of the conduct of such other vessel should be resolved in its favor.” See also The Victory & The Plymothian, 168 U. S. 410 ; The Umbria, 166 U. S. 404 ; The Oregon, 158 U. S. 186 ; The Ludvig Holberg, 157 U. S. 60 .  13 The rule of comparative negligence applicable to personal injury actions in our maritime law, see the Jones Act, 46 U. S. C. § 688 ; Death on the High Seas Act, 46 U. S. C. § 766 , does not appear to discourage the negotiation of settlements in such litigation.  It has been reported, for example, that of the marine personal injury cases involving a federal question that were terminated in fiscal year 1974, only 9.6% ever reached trial. 1974 Proceedings of the Judicial Conference of the United States and Annual Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, Table C4, p. 416.  14 The respondent also relies on the fact that the Senate has twice failed to ratify the Brussels Convention with its proportional fault rule.  It is urged that this inaction indicates “grave doubt” in Congress that rejection of the divided damages rule will further justice.  But even if we could find guidance in such "negative legislation,” Moragne v. States Marine Lines, <citedDecision>398 U. S. 375</citedDecision> , 405 n. 17, it appears that the Senate took no action with respect to the Convention, not because of opposition to a proportional fault rule, but because of the Convention’s poor translation and the opposition of cargo interests to the provision which would prevent cargo from recovering in full from the noncarrying vessel by eliminating joint and several liability of vessels for cargo damage.  See H. Baer, Admiralty Law of the Supreme Court 414-415 (2d ed. 1969); Staring, supra, n. 3, at 343.  See also Comment, 64 Yale L. J. 878 (1955).  15 This Court, in other appropriate contexts, has not hesitated to overrule an earlier decision and settle a matter of continuing concern, even though relief might have been obtained by legislation.

S. 393 , 406 n. 1 (Brandéis, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  16 See also Donovan & Ray, Mutual Fault — Half-Damage Rule — A Critical Analysis, 41 Ins. Coun.
