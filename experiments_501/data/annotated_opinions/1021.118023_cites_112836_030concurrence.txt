 If both these conditions are met, we must decide whether the regulation “directly advances the governmental interest asserted, and whether it is not more extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.” Central Hudson Gas & Elec. *529 Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557, 566 (1980).  Given the means by which this regulation purportedly serves the State’s interest, our conclusion is plain: Rhode Island’s regulation fails First Amendment scrutiny.  Both parties agree that the first two prongs of the Central Hudson test are met. Even if we assume, arguendo, that Rhode Island’s regulation also satisfies the requirement that it directly advance the governmental'interest, Rhode Island’s regulation fails the final prong; that is, its ban is more extensive than necessary to serve the State’s interest.  As we^ have explained, in order for a speech restriction to pass muster under the final prong, there must be a fit between the legislature’s goal and method, “a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable; that represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one whose scope is in proportion to the interest served.” Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).  While the State need not employ the least restrictive means to accomplish its goal, the fit between means and ends must be “narrowly tailored.” Ibid. The scope of the restriction on speech must be reasonably,, though it need not be perfectly, targeted to address the harm, intended to be regulated.  See Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 632-634 (1995).  The State’s regulation must indicate a “carefu[l] calculation of J the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by its prohibition.” Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., <citedDecision>507 U. S. 410, 417</citedDecision> (1993) (internal quotation, marks omitted).  The availability of less burdensome, alternatives to reach the stated goal signals that the fit between the legislature’s ends and the means chosen to accomplish those ends may be too imprecise to withstand First Amendment scrutiny.  See Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 486-487 (1995); <citedDecision>Cincinnati, supra, at 417, n. 13</citedDecision> .  If alternative channels permit communication of the restricted speech, the regulation is *530 more likely to be considered reasonable.  See Florida Bar, supra, at 632-634 .  Rhode Island offers one, and only one, justification for its ban on price advertising.  Rhode Island says that the ban is intended to keep alcohol prices high as a way to keep consumption low. By preventing sellers from informing customers of prices, the regulation prevents competition from driving prices down and requires consumers to spend more time to find the best price for alcohol.  Brief for Respondent State of Rhode Island 22.  The higher cost of obtaining alcohol, Rhode Island argues, will lead to reduced consumption.

 Respondents point for support to Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328 (1986), where, applying the Central Hudson test, we upheld the constitutionality of a Puerto Rico law that prohibited the advertising of casino gambling aimed at residents of Puerto Rico, but permitted such advertising aimed at tourists.  The Court there accepted as reasonable the legislature’s belief that the regulation would be effective, and concluded that, because the restriction affected only advertising of casino gambling aimed at residents of Puerto Rico, not that aimed at tourists, the restriction was narrowly tailored to serve Puerto Rico’s interest.  478 U. S., at 341-344 .  The Court accepted without question Puerto Rico’s account of the effectiveness and reasonableness of its speech restriction.  Respondents ask us to make a similar presumption here to uphold the validity of Rhode Island’s law. It is true that Posadas accepted as reasonable, without further inquiry, Puerto Rico’s assertions that the regulations furthered the government’s interest and were no more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.  Since Posa-das, however, this Court has examined more searchingly the State’s professed goal, and the speech restriction put into place to further it, before accepting a State’s claim that the speech restriction satisfies First Amendment scrutiny.  See, e. g., Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., supra; Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., supra; Ibanez v. Florida Dept. of Business and Professional Regulation, Bd. of Accountancy, 512 U. S. 136 (1994); Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761 (1993); <citedDecision>Cincinnati</citedDecision> v. Discovery Network, Inc., supra. In each of these cases we declined to accept at face value the proffered justification for the State’s regulation, but examined carefully the relationship between the asserted goal and the speech restriction used to reach that goal.  The closer look that we have required since Posadas comports better with the purpose of *532 the analysis set out in Central Hudson, by requiring the State to show that the speech restriction directly advances its interest and is narrowly tailored.  Under such a closer look, Rhode Island’s price-advertising ban clearly fails to pass muster.  Because Rhode Island’s regulation fails even the less stringent standard set out in Central Hudson, nothing here requires adoption of a new analysis for the evaluation of commercial speech regulation.  The principal opinion acknowledges that “even under the less than strict standard that generally applies in commercial speech cases, the State has failed to establish a reasonable fit between its abridgment of speech and its temperance goal.” Ante, at 507 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Because we need go no further, I would not here undertake the question whether the test we have employed since Central Hudson should be displaced.  Respondents argue that an additional factor, the Twenty-first Amendment, tips the First Amendment analysis in Rhode Island’s favor.
