 The case was disposed of in the District Court on the pleadings and the record before the Commission.  Below, the Government made no objection to the District Court’s jurisdiction, nor did that Court raise the question sua sponte.  3 It sustained the Corpmission’s action on the merits and dismissed the bill.  Here, the Government urges that under the doctrine of “negative orders” the Commission’s order was not reviewable, but, in the alternative, supports the decree on the merits.  The relation of action by the Federal Communications Commission to the reviewing power of the courts is here *129 for the first time.  The jurisdictional objection raised by the Government in this case implicates other federal regulatory bodies as well, because the various statutory schemes for judicial review have either been carried over from the Urgent Deficiencies Act, pertaining to orders under the Acts to Regulate Commerce, or because different statutory provisions have by analogy been assimilated to the “negative order” doctrine.  That doctrine has not had wholly plain sailing in the many casés, both here and in the lower federal courts, since it first got under way in 1912, in Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>225 U. S. 282</citedDecision> .  The important procedural problems with which this case is entangled therefore call for clarification.  The prior decisions involving the “negative order” doctrine fall into three categories: 4 (1) Where the action sought to be reviewed may have the effect of forbidding or compelling conduct on the part of the person seeking to review it, but only if some further action is taken by the Commission.  Such a situation is presented by an attempt to review a valuation made by the Interstate Commerce Commission which has no immediate legal effect although it may be the basis of a subsequent rate order.  (2) Where the action sought to be reviewed declines to relieve the complainant from a statutory command forbidding or compelling conduct on his part.  The most obvious case is a denial of permission by the Interstate Commerce Commission for a departure from the long-short haul clause.  *130 (3) Where the action sought to be reviewed does not forbid or compel conduct on the part of the person seeking review but is attacked because it does not forbid or compel conduct by a third person.

 Such an analysis emerges from a long sequence of cases under the Urgent Deficiencies Act viewed in the setting of general doctrines of federal jurisdiction.  On the other hand, the result in the Lehigh Valley case was reached in the earlier phases of modern administrative law and did not deal with its specific jurisdictional problems in the perspective of underlying principles governing federal equitable jurisdiction.  In consequence, the phrase “negative orders” gained currency as though it were descriptive of some technical doctrine of jurisdiction having peculiar relevance to judicial review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commission and comparable regulatory bodies.  12 *135 This brings us to the cases in group (3).  Here review is sought of action by the Commission which affects the complainant because it does not forbid or compel conduct with reference to him by a third person.  This type of situation is illustrated by Procter & Gamble Co. v. United.  States, <citedDecision>225 U. S. 282</citedDecision> .  Since this case gave rise to the notion that there is a specialized jurisdictional doctrine pertaining to "negative orders,” it calls for re-examination.  Procter & Gamble Co. filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission to set aside demurrage rules that imposed charges on private cars left unloaded for over forty-eight hours on private tracks.  The Commission dismissed the complaint on the ground that the rules were within the carriers’ authority to make conditions for the acceptance of private cars.  Procter & Gamble then petitioned the Commerce Court to annul the Commission’s action and to enjoin the carriers from enforcing the rules.  The Commerce Court took jurisdiction' but found the Commission’s action to be within its authority.  On appeal this Court held that the Com *136 merce Court erred in taking jurisdiction and remanded the cause for dismissal.

While this case would seem to control the Lehigh Valley case and at least to be persuasive in the Piedmont & Northern case, it was not mentioned in them.  After these two cases, subsequent decisions in this group indicated that the “negative order” doctrine might prevent review of the refusal by the Secretary of Agriculture to accept rates for filing, the Packers and Stockyards Act prohibiting the charging of rates except those on file with the Secretary, United States v. Corrick, 298 U. S. 435 , and of the refusal to grant an increase in rates of compensation for carrying of mail, the Railway Mail Pay Act of 1916 requiring the carrier to carry the mail at the rate set, United States v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 226 .  But in both these decisions the result reached was supported by factors irrelevant to the present discussion.  On the other.hand, in Powell v. United States, 300 U. S. 276 , action of the Commission, striking from its files a tariff on the ground that a point was not served by the carrier, was held subject to review' as a command to the railway which had filed the tariff not to give the service covered by the tariff.  13 The Chicago Junction Case, 264 U. S. 258 ; Venner v. Michigan Central R. Co., 271 U. S. 127 ; Colorado v. United States, 271 U. S. 153 ; Claiborne-Annapolis Ferry Co. v. United States, 285 U. S. 382 ; United States v. Idaho, 298 U. S. 105 .  14 ... we have learned of no instance where it was held or even seriously asserted, that as to subjects which in their nature were administrative and within the competency of the Commission to decide, there was power in a court, by an exercise of original action, to enforce its conceptions as to the meaning of the' act to regulate commerce by, dealing directly with the subject irrespective of any prior affirmative command or action by the Interstate Commerce Commission.  On the contrary, by a long line of decisions, whereby applications to enforce orders of the Commission were considered and disposed of or where requests to restrain the enforcement of such orders were passed upon, it appears by the reasoning indulged in that it was never considered that there was power in the courts as an original question without previous affirmative action by the Commission to deal with what might be termed in a broad sense the administrative features of the act to regulate commerce by determining as an original question that there had been a compliance or •noncompliance with the provisions of the act.” <citedDecision>225 U. S. at 296-97</citedDecision> .  "... the recognition of a right in a court to assert the power now claimed would of necessity amount to a substitution of the court for the Commission or at all events would be to create a divided authority on a matter where from the beginning primary singleness of action and unity was deemed to be imperative.” <citedDecision>225 U. S. at 298-99</citedDecision> .  15 See Chief Justice Taft’s estimate of the services of Chief Justice White in “a new field of administrative law”; “The capital importance which our railroad system has come to have, in the welfare of this country made the judicial construction of the interstate commerce act of critical moment.  It is not too much to say that Chief Justice White in construing the measure and its great amendments has had more to do with placing this vital part of our practical govern *138 ment on a useful basis than any other judge. His -opinions in the case of the Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. The Abilene Cotton Oil Co., and the cases which followed, it, are model's of clear and satisfactory reasoning which gave to the people, to state- legislatures, to Congress, and the courts a much-needed knowledge of the practical functions the Commerce Commission was to discharge, and of how they were to be reconciled to existing governmental machinery, for the vindication of the rights of the public in respect of national transportation.  They are a conspicuous instance of his unusual and remarkable power and facility in statesmanlike interpretation of statute law.” Proceedings on the Death of Chief Justice White, 257 U. S. v, xxv.  16 34 Stat. 584 .  17 36 Stat. 539 .  18 Laws of New York, One Hundred and Thirtieth Session, c. 429 (1907).

 28 Compare Inland Steel Co. v. United States, 306 U. S. 153 , 157: "... the Commission was acting in the interest of shippers generally and in behalf of the public and’ the national railroad system.” 29 In the- Procter & Gamble case the judicial relief asked was that the order of the Commission dismissing the complaint against .the demurrage rules be annulled and that the carriers be enjoined from applying those rules.  In the New River Coal Co. case the judicial relief asked was that the car rule under attack be adjudged invalid, that the order of the Commission dismissing the complaint against it be adjudged invalid, that the- carriers be enjoined from complying with the rule and that the Commission be enjoined from restricting the commerce of the complainants by its order and by the rule.  In the Lehigh Valley case the judicial relief asked was that the enforcement of the order of the Commission and the institution of any proceedings thereunder against the complainant be enjoined.  In the Intermountain Rate cases the judicial relief asked was that the order of the Commission be set aside, that § 4 of the Act to Regulate Commerce be declared invalid, and that the Commission and the Attorney General be enjoined from taking any proceedings to prosecute the carriers for violation of § 4.  30 Compare United States v.
