 Francis B. Burch, Attorney General of Maryland, Henry R. Lord, Deputy Attorney General, and Glenn E. Bushel, Assistant Attorney General, filed a brief for appellant in No. 74-878.  Solicitor General Bork reargued the cause for appellee in both cases. With him on the briefs on reargument *835 was Jacob I.  Karro.  With him on the brief on the original argument were Allan Abbot Tuttle and Mr. Karro.  [] MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court. Nearly 40 years ago Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act, [1] and required employers covered by the Act to pay their employees a minimum hourly wage [2] and to pay them at one and one-half times their regular *836 rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 during a workweek.  [3] By this Act covered employers were required to keep certain records to aid in the enforcement of the Act, [4] and to comply with specified child labor standards.  [5] This Court unanimously upheld the Act as a valid exercise of congressional authority under the commerce power in United States v. Darby, <citedDecision>312 U. S. 100</citedDecision> (1941), observing: "Whatever their motive and purpose, regulations of commerce which do not infringe some constitutional prohibition are within the plenary power conferred on Congress by the Commerce Clause." <citedDecision>Id., at 115</citedDecision> .  The original Fair Labor Standards Act passed in 1938 specifically excluded the States and their political sub-divisions from its coverage.  [6] In 1974, however, Congress enacted the most recent of a series of broadening amendments to the Act.  By these amendments Congress has extended the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions to almost all public employees employed by the States and by their various political subdivisions.  Appellants in these cases include individual cities and States, the National League of Cities, and the National Governors' Conference; [7] they brought an action in the District *837 Court for the District of Columbia which challenged the validity of the 1974 amendments.  They asserted in effect that when Congress sought to apply the Fair Labor Standards Act provisions virtually across the board to employees of state and municipal governments it "infringed a constitutional prohibition" running in favor of the States as States.  The gist of their complaint was not that the conditions of employment of such public employees were beyond the scope of the commerce power had those employees been employed in the private sector but that the established constitutional doctrine of inter-governmental immunity consistently recognized in a long series of our cases affirmatively prevented the exercise of this authority in the manner which Congress chose in the 1974 amendments.

 .  .  `the utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity,' " which they feared.  392 U. S., at 196 .  Appellee Secretary in this case, both in his brief and upon oral argument, has agreed that our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.  See, e. g., Brief for Appellee 30-41; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-43.  In Fry, supra, the Court recognized that an express declaration of this limitation is found in the Tenth Amendment: "While the Tenth Amendment has been characterized as a `truism,' stating merely that `all is retained which has not been surrendered,' United States v. *843 Darby, <citedDecision>312 U. S. 100, 124</citedDecision> (1941), it is not without significance.  The Amendment expressly declares the constitutional policy that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system." 421 U. S., at 547 n. 7.  In New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), Mr. Chief Justice Stone, speaking for four Members of an eight-Member Court [13] in rejecting the proposition that Congress could impose taxes on the States so long as it did so in a nondiscriminatory manner, observed: "A State may, like a private individual, own real property and receive income.  But in view of our former decisions we could hardly say that a general non-discriminatory real estate tax (apportioned), or an income tax laid upon citizens and States alike could be constitutionally applied to the State's capitol, its State-house, its public school houses, public parks, or its revenues from taxes or school lands, even though all real property and all income of the citizen is taxed." Id., at 587-588 .  [14] *844 The expressions in these more recent cases trace back to earlier decisions of this Court recognizing the essential role of the States in our federal system of government.

 [1] Only 34 years ago, Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 120 (1942), reaffirmed that "[a]t the beginning Chief Justice Marshall .  .  .  made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature of [Congress' commerce] power by *858 warning that effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes." My Brethren do not successfully obscure today's patent usurpation of the role reserved for the political process by their purported discovery in the Constitution of a restraint derived from sovereignty of the States on Congress' exercise of the commerce power.  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall recognized that limitations "prescribed in the constitution," Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, at 196 , restrain Congress' exercise of the power.  See Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184, 191 (1964); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 305 (1964); United States v. Darby, <citedDecision>312 U. S. 100, 114</citedDecision> (1941).  Thus laws within the commerce power may not infringe individual liberties protected by the First Amendment, Mabee v. White Plains Publishing Co., 327 U. S. 178 (1946); the Fifth Amendment, Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6 (1969); or the Sixth Amendment, United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570 (1968).  But there is no restraint based on state sovereignty requiring or permitting judicial enforcement anywhere expressed in the Constitution; our decisions over the last century and a half have explicitly rejected the existence of any such restraint on the commerce power.  [2] *859 We said in United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175, 184 (1936), for example: "The sovereign power of the states is necessarily diminished to the extent of the grants of power to the federal government in the Constitution.  .  .  .

 Rather, as the Tenth Amendment's significance was more recently summarized: "The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.  There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers.  .  .  .  "From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted *863 end." United States v. Darby, <citedDecision>312 U. S., at 124</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  [5] My Brethren purport to find support for their novel state-sovereignty doctrine in the concurring opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Stone in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 586 (1946).  That reliance is plainly misplaced.  That case presented the question whether the Constitution either required immunity of New York State's mineral water business from federal taxation or denied to the Federal Government power to lay the tax. The Court sustained the federal tax. Mr. Chief Justice Stone observed in his concurring opinion that "a federal tax which is not discriminatory as to the subject matter may nevertheless so affect the State, merely because it is a State that is being taxed, as to interfere unduly with the State's performance of its sovereign functions of government." Id., at 587 .  But the Chief Justice was addressing not the question of a state-sovereignty restraint upon the exercise of the commerce power, but rather the principle of implied immunity of the States *864 and Federal Government from taxation by the other: "The counterpart of such undue interference has been recognized since Marshall's day as the implied immunity of each of the dual sovereignties of our constitutional system from taxation by the other." Ibid. In contrast, the apposite decision that Term to the question whether the Constitution implies a state-sovereignty restraint upon congressional exercise of the commerce power is Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92 (1946).

 The state can no more deny the power if its exercise has been authorized by Congress than can an individual.  " Id., at 183-185 (emphasis added).  [7] *867 Today's repudiation of this unbroken line of precedents that firmly reject my Brethren's ill-conceived abstraction can only be regarded as a transparent cover for invalidating a congressional judgment with which they disagree.  [8] The only analysis even remotely resembling that *868 adopted today is found in a line of opinions dealing with the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment that ultimately provoked a constitutional crisis for the Court in the 1930's E. g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238 (1936); United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1 (1936); Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251 (1918).  See Stern, The Commerce Clause and the National Economy, 1933-1946, 59 Harv. L. Rev. 645 (1946).  We tend to forget that the Court invalidated legislation during the Great Depression, not solely under the Due Process Clause, but also and primarily under the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment.  It may have been the eventual abandonment of that overly restrictive construction of the commerce power that spelled defeat for the Courtpacking plan, and preserved the integrity of this institution, id., at 682, see, e. g., United States v. Darby, <citedDecision>312 U. S. 100</citedDecision> (1941); Mulford v. Smith, 307 U. S. 38 (1939); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1 (1937), but my Brethren today are transparently trying to cut back on that recognition of the scope of the commerce power.  My Brethren's approach to this case is not far different from the dissenting opinions in the cases that averted the crisis.  See, e. g., Mulford v. Smith, supra, at 51 (Butler, J., dissenting); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, at 76 (McReynolds, J., dissenting).  [9] *869 That no precedent justifies today's result is particularly clear from the awkward extension of the doctrine of state immunity from federal taxationan immunity conclusively distinguished by Mr. Justice Stone in California , and an immunity that is "narrowly limited" because "the people of all the states have created the national government and are represented in Congress," Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 416 (1938) (Stone, J.) [10] to fashion a judicially enforceable restraint on *870 Congress' exercise of the commerce power that the Court has time and again rejected as having no place in our constitutional jurisprudence.  [11] "[W]here [Congress] *871 keeps within its sphere and violates no express constitutional limitation it has been the rule of this Court, going back almost to the founding days of the Republic, not to interfere." Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S., at 305 .  To argue, as do my Brethren, that the 1974 amendments are directed at the "States qua States," and "displac[e] state policies regarding the manner in which they will structure delivery of those governmental services which their citizens require," ante, at 847, and therefore "directly penaliz[e] the States for choosing to hire governmental employees on terms different from those which Congress has sought to impose," ante, at 849, is only to advance precisely the unsuccessful arguments made by the State of Washington in Case v. Bowles and the State of California in United States v. California .

 .  ." The only import of the footnote in Fry , then, is that Congress may not invade state sovereignty by exercising powers not delegated to it by the Constitution; since the wage ceilings at issue in Fry were clearly within the commerce power, we found no "drastic invasion of state sovereignty." Id., at 548 n. 7.  Even the author of today's opinion stated in Fry that the Tenth Amendment does not "by its terms" restrict Congress' power to regulate commerce.  Id., at 557 (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting).  [5]  In support of the first-quoted paragraph, <citedDecision>Darby</citedDecision> cited 2 J. Elliot, Debates 123, 131 (2d ed. 1787); 3 id., at 450, 464, 600; 4 id., at 140, 148; 1 Annals of Congress 432, 761, 767-768 (1789); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution §§ 1907-1908 (2d ed. 1851) ("It is plain, therefore, that it could not have been the intention of the framers of this amendment to give it effect, as an abridgment of any of the powers granted under the constitution, whether they are express or implied, direct or incidental.  Its sole design is to exclude any interpretation, by which other powers should be assumed beyond those which are granted").  Decisions expressly rejecting today's interpretation of the Tenth Amendment also include Sperry v. Florida ex rel. Florida Bar, 373 U. S. 379, 403 (1963); Oklahoma v. CSC, 330 U. S. 127, 143 (1947); Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92, 102 (1946); Fernandez v. Wiener, 326 U. S. 340 , 362 (1945); Oklahoma ex rel. Phillips v. Atkinson Co., 313 U. S. 508, 534 (1941); United States v. Sprague, 282 U. S. 716, 733-734 (1931).  [6] Case also expressed concerns about creating a state-sovereignty limitation on a delegated power that are equally applicable to restrictions on the commerce power: "The result would be that the constitutional grant of the power to make war would be inadequate to accomplish its full purpose.  And this result would impair a prime purpose of the Federal Government's establishment." 327 U. S., at 102.  My Brethren intimate that Congress' war power is more properly viewed as "a prime purpose of the Federal Government's establishment" than the commerce power.
