<author id="b346-8">The CHIEF JUSTICE,</author>
<judges id="AZ6">and Messrs. Justices SWAYNE, DAVIS, and MILLER</judges>
<p id="A-T">dissented. In behalf of this portion of the court, a dissenting opinion was delivered by Mr. Justice Miller. This opinion applied equally or more to the case of <em>Ex parte Garland </em>(the case next following), which involved principles of a character similar to those discussed in this case. The dissenting opinion is, therefore, published after the opinion of the court in that case.</p>
