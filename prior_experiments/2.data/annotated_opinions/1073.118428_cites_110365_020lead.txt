See O’Malley, 307 U.S., at 283 (overruling Miles). And in so doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans dissent. The Court said that the question was whether judges are immune “from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes ... is subjected.” 307 U.S., at 282. Holding that judges are not “immun[e] from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government,” ibid., the Court pointed out that the legal profession had criticized Evans’ contrary conclusion, and that courts outside the United States had resolved similar matters differently, 307 U.S., at 281. And the Court concluded that “a non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not, when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution *571 of his salary within the prohibition of Article III.” Id., at 282. The Court conceded that Miles had reached the opposite conclusion, but it said that Miles “cannot survive.” 307 U. S., at 283. Still later, this Court noted that “[b]ecause Miles relied on Evans v. Gore, O’Malley must also be read to undermine the reasoning of Evans.” United States v. Will, <targetCase>449 U.S. 200</targetCase>, 227, n. 31 (1980). Finally, and most importantly, we believe that the reasoning of Justices Holmes and Brandéis, and of this Court in O’Malley, is correct. There is no good reason why a judge should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens. We concede that this Court has held that the Legislature cannot directly reduce judicial salaries even as part of an equitable effort to reduce all Government salaries. See 449 U. S., at 226. But a tax law, unlike a law mandating a salary reduction, affects compensation indirectly, not directly. See ibid.

89, 99 (1938); see also Comment, 20 Ill. L. Rev. 376, 377 (1925); Corwin, Constitutional Law in 1919-1920, 14 Am. Pol. Sei. Rev. 635, 642 (1920). And in <targetCase>Will</targetCase>, the Court yet more strongly indicated that the Compensation Clause bars indirect efforts to reduce judges’ salaries through taxes when *577 those taxes discriminate. 449 U.S., at 226. Indeed, the Government itself “assume[s] that discriminatory taxation of judges would contravene fundamental principles underlying Article III, if not the [Compensation] Clause itself.” Brief for United States 37, n. 27. The Government also argues that there is no evidence here that Congress singled out judges for special treatment in order to intimidate, influence, or punish them. But this Court has never insisted upon such evidence. To require it is to invite legislative efforts that embody, but lack evidence of, some such intent, engendering suspicion among the branches and consequently undermining that mutual respect that the Constitution demands.

And we therefore agree with the Court of Appeals’ similar conclusion. 185 F. 3d, at 1363 (“[Ejverything in the record” suggests that the increase was meant to halt “the slide in purchasing power resulting from continued and unadjusted-for inflation”). The Government says that a circumstance-specific approach may prove difficult to administer. Brief for United States 43. And we concede that examining the circumstances in order to determine whether there is or is not a relation between an earlier violation and a later increase is more complex than the Government’s proposed automatic approach. But we see no reason why such relief as damages or an exemption from Social Security would prove unworkable. Finally, the Government looks to our decision in <targetCase>Will</targetCase> for support. In that case, federal judges challenged the constitutionality of certain legislative “freezes” that Congress had imposed upon earlier enacted Government-wide cost-of-living salary adjustments. The Court found a Compensation Clause violation in respect to the freeze for what was designated Year One (where Congress had rescinded an earlier voted 4.8% salary increase). <targetCase>Will</targetCase>, 449 U.S., at 225-226. The Government points out that the <targetCase>Will</targetCase> Court “noted that Congress, later in that fiscal year, enacted a statutory increase in judges’ salaries that exceeded the salaries that judges would have received” without the rescission. Brief for United States 41. And the Government adds that “it was unquestioned in Will” that the judges could not receive damages for the time subsequent to this later enactment. Id., at 41-42. The <targetCase>Will</targetCase> Year One example, however, shows only that, in the circumstances, and unlike the case before us, the later salary increase was related to the earlier salary diminishment. Regardless, the very fact that the matter was “un *581 questioned” in <targetCase>Will</targetCase> shows that it was not argued. See 449 U. S., at 206, n. 3 (noting that the judges’ complaint sought relief for Year One’s diminution only up to the moment of the subsequent salary increase). Hence the Court did not decide the matter now before us. We conclude that later statutory salary increases did not cure the preceding unconstitutional harm. < Insofar as the Court of Appeals found the application of Medicare taxes to the salaries of judges taking office before 1988 unconstitutional, its judgment is reversed. Insofar as that court found the application of Social Security taxes to the salaries of judges taking office before 1984 unconstitutional, its judgment is affirmed. We also affirm the Court of Appeals’ determination that the 1984 salary increase received by federal judges did not cure the Compensation Clause violation.
