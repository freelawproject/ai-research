 12 This requirement was recognized by the Florida court which rendered the divorce decree, and the principle has been given frequent application in decisions of the State Supreme Court. 13 But whether or not petitioner was domiciled in Florida at the time the divorce was granted was a matter to be resolved by judicial determination.  Here, unlike the situation presented in Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U. S. 226 (1945), the finding of the requisite jurisdictional facts was made in proceedings in which the defendant appeared and participated.  The question with which we are confronted, therefore, is whether such a finding made under the circumstances presented by this case may, consistent with the requirements of full faith and credit, be subjected to collateral attack in the courts of a sister State in a suit brought by the defendant in the original proceedings.  The question of what effect is to be given to an adjudication by a court that it possesses requisite jurisdiction in a case, where the judgment of that court is subsequently *350 subjected to collateral attack on jurisdictional grounds, has been given frequent consideration by this Court over a period of many years.  Insofar as cases originating in the federal courts are concerned, the rule has evolved that the doctrine of res judicata applies to adjudications relating either to jurisdiction of the person or of the subject matter where such adjudications have been made in proceedings in which those questions were in issue and in which the parties were given full opportunity to litigate.  14 The reasons for this doctrine have frequently been stated.  Thus in Stoll v. Gottlieb, <citedDecision>305 U. S. 165, 172</citedDecision> (1938), it was said: “Courts to determine the rights of parties are an integral part of our system of government.  It is just as important that there should be a place to end as that there should be a place to begin litigation.  After a party has his day in court, with opportunity to present his evidence and his view of the law, a collateral attack upon the decision as to jurisdiction there rendered merely retries the issue previously determined.  There is no reason to expect that the second decision will be more satisfactory than the first.” This Court has also held that the doctrine of res judi-cata must be applied to questions of jurisdiction in cases arising in state courts involving the application of the full faith and credit clause where, under the law of the state in which the original judgment was rendered, such adjudications are not susceptible to collateral attack.  15 *351 In Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32 (1938), the courts of the District of Columbia had refused to give effect to a decree of absolute divorce rendered in Virginia, on the ground that the Virginia court had lacked jurisdiction despite the fact that the defendant had appeared in the Virginia proceedings and had fully litigated the issue of the plaintiff’s domicile.  This Court held that in failing to give recognition to the Virginia decree, the courts of the District had failed to accord the full faith and credit required by the Constitution.  During the course of the opinion, this Court stated: “As to petitioner’s domicil for divorce and his standing to invoke jurisdiction of the Virginia court, its finding that he was a bona fide resident of that State for the required time is binding upon respondent in the courts of the District.

No Florida case has been called to our attention involving a collateral attack on a divorce decree questioning the domicile of the parties, and hence the jurisdiction of the court which entered the decree, where both parties appeared in the divorce proceedings.  See generally Everette v. Petteway, 131 Fla. 516, 528-529 , 179 So. 666, 671-672 (1938); State ex rel. Goodrich Co. v. Trammell, 140 Fla. 500, 505 , 192 So. 175, 177 (1939).  But cf. Chisholm v. Chisholm, 98 Fla. 1196 , 125 So. 694 (1929); Dye v. Dolbeck, 114 Fla. 866 , 154 So. 847 (1934), involving attacks on jurisdictional findings made in ex parte divorce proceedings.  Bell v. Bell, 181 U. S. 175 (1901).  See note 3 supra. Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men’s Association, 283 U. S. 522 (1931); Stoll v. Gottlieb, <citedDecision>305 U.

Irving Trust Co., 311 U. S. 494 (1941).  And see Forsyth v. Hammond, 166 U. S. 506 (1897); Heiser v. Woodruff, 327 U. S. 726 (1946).  American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, 287 U. S. 156 (1932); Treinies v.

We, of course, intimate no opinion as to the scope of Congressional power to legislate under Article IV, § 1 of the Constitution.  See note 1 supra. Justices Brewer, Shiras, and Peckham dissented.  Mr. Justice Holmes took no part in the case. Thus, in the Andrews case, before the divorce decree was entered by the South Dakota court, the defendant withdrew her appearance in accordance with a consent agreement.  See note 14 supra. But cf. Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U. S. 226, 230 (1945).  Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32, 40 (1938); Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 294 (1942).  Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U. S. 268, 276-277 (1935); Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, 320 U. S. 430, 439 (1943).  But we may well doubt that the judgment which we herein announce will amount to substantial interference with state policy with respect to divorce.  Many States which have had occasion to consider the matter have already recognized the impropriety of permitting a collateral attack on an out-of-state divorce decree where the defendant appeared and participated in the divorce proceedings.  See, e. g., Norris v. Norris, 200 Minn. 246 , 273 N. W. 708 (1937); Miller v. Miller, 65 N. Y. S. 2d 696 (1946), affirmed 271 App. Div. 974 , 67 N. Y. S. 2d 379 (1947); Cole v. Cole, 96 N. J. Eq. 206, 124 A. 359 (1924).  Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642 (1935); Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 294-295 (1942).  Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U. S. 226 (1945).  Cf. Stoll v. Gottlieb, <citedDecision>305 U. S. 165, 172</citedDecision> (1938).

 Fortunately, today’s decision does not go that far.  But its practical result will be to offer new inducements for conduct by parties and counsel, which, in any other type of litigation, would be regarded as perjury, but which is not so regarded where divorce is involved because ladies and gentlemen indulge in it.  But if the doctrine of res judicata as to jurisdictional facts in controversies involving exclusively private interests as infused into the Full Faith and Credit Clause is applied to divorce decrees so as to foreclose subsequent inquiry into jurisdiction, there is neither logic nor reason nor practical desirability in not taking the entire doctrine over.  Res judicata forecloses relitigation if there has been an opportunity to litigate once, whether or not it has been availed of, or carried as far as possible.  Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351 ; Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U. S. 371 .  15 And it applies to questions of jurisdiction of subject matter as well as to that of persons.  Stoll v. Gottlieb, <citedDecision>305 U. S. 165</citedDecision> ; Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U. S. 66 .  Why should it not apply where there has been a wasted opportunity to litigate, but should apply where the form of a contest has been gone through?  16 Or if more than form is required, how much of a contest must it be?  Must the contest be bellicose or *368 may it be pacific?  Must it be fierce or may it be tepid?  Must there .be a cloud of witnesses to negative the testimony of the plaintiff, or may a single doubter be enough?  Certainly if the considerations that establish res judicata as between private litigants in the ordinary situations apply to the validity of a divorce against the public policy of the State of domicile, it cannot make a rational difference that the question of domicile is contested with bad feeling rather than amicably adjusted.
