<author id="b288-7">Mr. Justice Harlan</author>
<judges id="Asx">and Mr. Justice Stewart,</judges>
<p id="A4ul">concurring.</p>
<p id="b288-8">Although we joined the <em>per curiam </em>decision in <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>362 U. S. 574, we are now persuaded that what the Court there decided was wrong insofar as it held that even though a man be in custody when he initiates <page-number citation-index="1" label="243">*243</page-number>a habeas corpus proceeding, the statutory power of the federal courts to proceed to a final adjudication of his claims depends upon his remaining in custody. Consequently we concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court.</p>
<judges id="b289-5">Mr. Justice Harlan also notes that his views upon the issue discussed in his separate concurring opinion in <em>Parker, id., </em>at 576, have not changed.</judges>
