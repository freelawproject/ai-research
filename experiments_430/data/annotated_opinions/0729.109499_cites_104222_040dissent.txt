 Rather, as the Tenth Amendment’s significance was more recently summarized: “The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.  There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers.  .  .  .  “From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the per *863 mitted end.” United States v. Darby, 312 U. S., at 124 (emphasis added).  5 My Brethren purport to find support for their novel state-sovereignty doctrine in the concurring opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Stone in New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572, 586</citedDecision> (1946).  That reliance is plainly misplaced.  That case presented the question whether the Constitution either required immunity of New York State’s mineral water business from federal taxation or denied to the Federal Government power to lay the tax. The Court sustained the federal tax. Mr. Chief Justice Stone observed in his concurring opinion that “a federal tax which is not discriminatory as to the subject matter may nevertheless so affect the State, merely because it is a State that is being taxed, as to interfere unduly with the State’s performance of its sovereign functions of government.” <citedDecision>Id., at 587</citedDecision> .  But the Chief Justice was addressing not the question of a state-sovereignty restraint upon the exercise of the commerce power, but rather the principle of implied immunity of the States *864 and Federal Government from taxation by the other: “The counterpart of such undue interference has been recognized since Marshall's day as the implied immunity of each of the dual sovereignties of our constitutional system from taxation by the other.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> In contrast, the apposite decision that Term to the question whether the Constitution implies a state-sovereignty restraint upon congressional exercise of the commerce, power is Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92 (1946).  The question there was whether the Emergency Price Control Act could apply to the sale by the State of Washington of timber growing on lands granted by Congress to the State for the support of common schools.  The State contended that “there is a doctrine implied in the Federal Constitution that 'the two governments, national and state, are each to exercise its powers so- as not to interfere with the free and full exercise of the powers of the other’ .  .  .  [and] that the Act cannot be applied to this sale because it was ‘for the purpose of gaining revenue to carry out an essential governmental function — the education of its citizens.’ ” Id., at 101 .  The Court emphatically rejected that argument, in an opinion joined by Mr. Chief Justice Stone, reasoning: “Since the Emergency Price Control Act has been sustained as a congressional exercise of the war power, the [State’s] argument is that the extent of that power as applied to state functions depends on whether these are ‘essential’ to the state government.  The use of the same criterion in measuring the constitutional power of Congress to tax has proved to be unworkable, and we reject it as a guide in the field here involved.  Cf. United States v. California, ... 297 U. S. at 183-185 .” Ibid. 6 *865 The footnote to this statement rejected the suggested dichotomy between essential and nonessential state governmental functions as having "proved to be unworkable” by referring to “the several opinions in New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572</citedDecision> .” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 101 n. 7.  Even more significant for our purposes is the Court’s citation of United States v. California , a case concerned with Congress’ power to regulate commerce, as supporting the rejection of the State’s contention that state sovereignty is a limitation on Congress’ war power.  California directly presented the question whether any state-sovereignty restraint precluded application of the Federal Safety Appliance Act to a state owned and operated railroad.  The State argued “that as the state is operating the railroad without profit, for the purpose of facilitating the commerce of the port, and is using the net 'proceeds of operation for harbor improvement, ... it is engaged in performing a public function in its sovereign capacity and for that reason cannot constitutionally be subjected to the provisions of the federal Act.” 297 U. S.,.  at 183.  Mr. Justice Stone rejected the contention in an opinion *866 for a unanimous Court. His rationale is a complete refutation of today’s holding: “That in operating its railroad [the State] is acting within a power reserved to the states cannot be doubted.  .

 Thus, although my Brethren by fiat strike down the 1974 amendments without analysis of countervailing national considerations, Fry by contrary logic remains undisturbed because, on balance, countervailing national considerations override the interference with the State’s freedom.  Moreover, it is sophistry to say the Economic Stabilization Act “displaced no state choices,” ante, at 853, but that the 1974 amendments do, ante, at 848.  Obviously the Stabilization Act — no less than every exercise of a national power delegated to Congress by the Constitution — displaced the State’s freedom.  It is absurd to suggest that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between curbs against increasing wages and curbs against paying wages lower than the federal minimum.  Today’s holding patently is in derogation of the sovereign power of the Nation to regulate interstate commerce.  Can the States engage in businesses competing with the private sector and then come to the courts arguing that withdrawing the employees of those businesses from the private sector evades the power of the Federal Government to regulate commerce?  See <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> v. *873 United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 582</citedDecision> (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  No principle given meaningful content by my Brethren today precludes the States from doing just that.  Our historic decisions rejecting all suggestions that the States stand in a different position from affected private parties when challenging congressional exercise of the commerce power reflect that very concern.  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936).  Fry only last Term emphasized “that States are not immune from all federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status.” 421 U. S., at 548 (emphasis added).  For “[b]y empowering Congress to regulate commerce .  .

 There is no reason whatever to suppose that in enacting the 1974 amendments Congress, even if it might extensively obliterate state sovereignty by fully exercising its plenary power respecting commerce, had any purpose to do so. Surely the presumption must be to the contrary.  Any realistic assessment of our federal political system, dominated as it is by representatives of the people elected from the States, yields the conclusion that it is highly unlikely that those representatives will ever be motivated to disregard totally the concerns of these States.  13 The Federalist No. 46, supra, at 319.  Certainly this was the premise upon which the Constitution, as authoritatively explicated in Gibbons v. Ogden , was founded.  Indeed, though the States are represented in *878 the National Government, national interests are not similarly represented in the States’ political processes.  Perhaps my Brethren’s concern with the Judiciary’s role in preserving federalism might better focus on whether Congress, not the States, is in greater need of this Court’s protection.  See <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 582</citedDecision> (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); Helvering v. Oerhardt, 304 U. S., at 416 .  A sense of the enormous impact of States’ political power is gained by brief reference to the federal budget.  The largest estimate by any of the appellants of the cost impact of the 1974 amendments — $1 billion — pales in comparison with the financial assistance the States receive from the Federal Government.  In fiscal 1977 the President’s proposed budget recommends $60.5 billion in federal assistance to the States, exclusive of loans.  Office of Management and Budget, Special Analyses: Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1977, p. 255.  Appellants complain of the impact of the amended FLSA on police and fire departments, but the 1977 budget contemplates outlays for law enforcement assistance of $716 million.  Id., at 258.

 And this result would impair a prime purpose of the Federal Government’s establishment.” 327 U. S., at 102.  My Brethren intimate that Congress’ war power is more properly viewed as “a prime purpose of the Federal Government’s establishment” than the commerce power.  Ante, at 855 n. 18.  Nothing could be further from the fact.  “The sole purpose for which Virginia initiated the movement which ultimately produced the Constitution was ‘to take into consideration the trade of the United States; to examine the relative situations and trade of the said States; to consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common interest and their permanent harmony’ .... No other federal power was so 'Universally assumed to be necessary, no other state power was so readily relinquished.” H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 533-534 (1949); see id., at 532-535 .  Even in the tax area the States’ immunity has not gone unchallenged.  The separate opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in New *867 York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572, 573</citedDecision> (1946), argued that the only limitation on the federal power to tax was that Congress not discriminate against the States.  There is no such discrimination in the 1974 amendments, since they apply to both public and private employers.  Mr. Justice Frankfurter noted a distinction between immunities claimed to invalidate state taxes on federal activities and those urged as a basis for rejecting federal taxes.  “The federal government is the government of all the States, and all the States share in the legislative process by which a tax of general applicability is laid.” <citedDecision>Id., at 577</citedDecision> .  See M'Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405-406 (1819).  He also recognized that immunity in this area had been significantly eroded since it was first used to protect state officials from a federal tax in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871).  See, e. g., Graves v. New York ex rel. O’Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 (1939), overruling Collector v. Day, supra; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376 (1938); Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U. S. 123 (1932).  Even more significantly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out that the existence of a state immunity from federal taxation, to the extent that it was based on any vague sovereignty notions, was inconsistent with the holding in United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), that state sovereignty does not restrict federal exercise of the commerce power.  <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 582</citedDecision> .  My Brethren's reliance on Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869), and Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869), is puzzling to say the least.  The Brethren make passing reference to the unique historical setting in which those cases were decided, ante, at 844, but pointedly ignore the significance of the events of those days.  During the tenure of Mr. Chief Justice Chase, the War Between the States, fought to preserve the supremacy of the Union, was won; Congress and the States then enacted three constitutional Amendments, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, enlarging federal power and concomitantly contracting the States’ power, see Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 345 (1880); and Congress enacted a variety of laws during Reconstruction further restricting state *868 sovereignty.  Texas v. White itself noted that the Constitution empowered Congress to form a new government in a State if the citizens of that State were being denied a republican form of government.  7 Wall., at 729.  And the Court recognized in Lane County that “[t)he people of the United States constitute one nation, under one government, and this government, within the scope of the powers with which it is invested, is supreme.” 7 Wall., at 76.
