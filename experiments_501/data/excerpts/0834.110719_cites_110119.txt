 Prior to trial, he moved to suppress the heroin found in the paper bag and the currency found in the leather pouch.  After an eviden-tiary hearing, the District Court denied the motion to suppress.  The heroin and currency were introduced in evidence at trial and Ross was convicted.  A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.  It held that the police had probable cause to stop and search Ross’ car and that, under Carroll v. United States, supra, and Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 , the officers lawfully could search the automobile — including its trunk — without a warrant.  The court considered separately, however, the warrantless search of the two containers found in the trunk.  On the basis of Arkansas v. Sanders, *802 <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753</citedDecision> , the court concluded that the constitutionality of a warrantless search of a container found in an automobile depends on whether the owner possesses a reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents.  Applying that test, the court held that the warrantless search of the paper bag was valid but the search of the leather pouch was not.  The court remanded for a new trial at which the items taken from the paper bag, but not those from the leather pouch, could be admitted.  2 The entire Court of Appeals then voted to rehear the case en banc.  A majority of the court rejected the panel’s conclusion that a distinction of constitutional significance existed between the two containers found in respondent’s trunk; it held that the police should not have opened either container without first obtaining a warrant.  The court reasoned: “No specific, well-delineated exception called to our attention permits the police to dispense with a warrant to open and search ‘unworthy’ containers.  Moreover, we believe that a rule under which the validity of a war-rantless search would turn on judgments about the durability of a container would impose an unreasonable and unmanageable burden on police and courts.  For these reasons, and because the Fourth Amendment protects all persons, not just those with the resources or fastidiousness to place their effects in containers that decision-makers would rank in the luggage line, we hold that the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement forbids the warrantless opening of a closed, opaque paper bag to the same extent that it forbids the warrantless opening of a small unlocked suitcase or a zippered leather pouch.” 210 U. S. App. D. C. 342, 344, 655 F. 2d 1159, 1161 (1981) (footnote omitted).  *803 The en banc Court of Appeals considered, and rejected, the argument that it was reasonable for the police to open both the paper bag and the leather pouch because they were entitled to conduct a warrantless search of the entire vehicle in which the two containers were found. The majority concluded that this argument was foreclosed by <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> .  Three dissenting judges interpreted <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> differently.  3 Other courts also have read the <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> opinion in different ways.  4 Moreover, disagreement concerning the proper interpretation of <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> was at least partially responsible for the fact that Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 , was decided last Term without a Court opinion.  There is, however, no dispute among judges about the importance of striving for clarification in this area of the law. For countless vehicles are stopped on highways and public *804 streets every day, and our cases demonstrate that it is not uncommon for police officers to have probable cause to believe that contraband may be found in a stopped vehicle.  In every such case a conflict is presented between the individual’s constitutionally protected interest in privacy and the public interest in effective law enforcement.  No single rule of law can resolve every conflict, but our conviction that clarification is feasible led us to grant the Government’s petition for certiorari in this case and to invite the parties to address the question whether the decision in Robbins should be reconsidered.  454 U. S. 891 .  II We begin with a review of the decision m Carroll itself.  In the fall of 1921, federal prohibition agents obtained evidence that George Carroll and John Kiro were “bootleggers” who frequently traveled between Grand Rapids and Detroit in an Oldsmobile Roadster.

 The Court in Chadwick specifically rejected the argument that the warrantless search was “reasonable” because a footlocker has some of the mobile characteristics that support warrantless searches of automobiles.  The Court recognized that “a person’s expectations of privacy in personal luggage are substantially greater than in an automobile,” id., at 13 , and noted that the practical problems associated with the temporary detention of a piece of luggage during the period of time necessary to obtain a warrant are significantly less than those associated with the detention of an automobile.  Id., at 13, n. 7 .  In ruling that the warrantless search of the *812 footlocker was unjustified, the Court reaffirmed the general principle that closed packages and containers may not be searched without a warrant.  Cf. Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727 ; United States v. Van Leeuwen, 397 U. S. 249 .  In sum, the Court in Chadwick declined to extend the rationale of the “automobile exception” to permit a warrantless search of any movable container found in a public place.  16 The facts in Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753</citedDecision> , were similar to those in Chadwick .  In <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , a Little Rock police officer received information from a reliable informant that Sanders would arrive at the local airport on a specified flight that afternoon carrying a green suitcase containing marihuana.  The officer went to the airport.  Sanders arrived on schedule and retrieved a green suitcase from the airline baggage service.  Sanders gave the suitcase to a waiting companion, who placed it in the trunk of a taxi.  Sanders and his companion drove off in the cab; police officers followed and stopped the taxi several blocks from the airport.  The officers opened the trunk, seized the suitcase, and searched it on the scene without a warrant.  As predicted, the suitcase contained marihuana.

 .  “.  .  .  Here, as in Chadwick , it was the luggage being transported by respondent at the time of the arrest, not the automobile in which it was being carried, that was the suspected locus of the contraband.  The relationship between the automobile and the contraband was purely coincidental, as in Chadwick .  The fact that the suitcase was resting in the trunk of the automobile at the time of respondent’s arrest does not turn this into an ‘automobile’ exception case. The Court need say no more.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 766-767</citedDecision> .  The Court in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> did not, however, rest its decision solely on the authority of Chadwick .  In rejecting the State’s *814 argument that the warrantless search of the suitcase was justified on the ground that it had been taken from an automobile lawfully stopped on the street, the Court broadly suggested that a warrantless search of a container found in an automobile could never be sustained as part of a warrantless search of the automobile itself.  19 The Court did not suggest that it mattered whether probable cause existed to search the entire vehicle.  It is clear, however, that in neither Chadwick nor <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> did the police have probable cause to search the vehicle or anything within it except the footlocker in the former case and the green suitcase in the latter.  Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 , however, was a case in which suspicion was not directed at a specific container.  In that case the Court for the first time was forced to consider whether police officers who are entitled to conduct a warrantless search of an automobile stopped on a public roadway may open a container found within the vehicle.  In the early morning of January 5, 1975, police officers stopped Robbins’ station wagon because he was driving erratically.  Robbins got out of the car, but later returned to obtain the vehicle’s registration papers.  When he opened the car door, the officers smelled marihuana smoke.  One of the officers searched Robbins and discovered a vial of liquid; in a search of the interior of the car the officer found marihuana.

 Robbins was charged with various drug offenses and moved to suppress the contents of the plastic packages.  The California Court of Appeal held that “[s]earch of the automobile was proper when the officers learned that appellant was smoking marijuana when they stopped him” 20 and that the warrantless search of the packages was justified because “the contents of the packages could have been inferred from their outward appearance, so that appellant could not have held a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the contents.” People v. Robbins, 103 Cal. App. 3d 34, 40 , 162 Cal. Rptr. 780, 783 (1980).  This Court reversed.  Writing for a plurality, Justice Stewart rejected the argument that the outward appearance of the packages precluded Robbins from having a reasonable expectation of privacy in their contents.  He also squarely rejected the argument that there is a constitutional distinction between searches of luggage and searches of “less worthy” containers.  Justice Stewart reasoned that all containers are equally protected by the Fourth Amendment unless their contents are in plain view.  The plurality concluded that the warrantless search was impermissible because Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> had established that “a closed piece of luggage found in a lawfully searched car is constitutionally protected to the same extent as are closed pieces of luggage found anywhere else.” 453 U. S., at 425 .  In an opinion concurring in the judgment, JUSTICE POWELL, the author of the Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , stated that “[t]he plurality’s approach strains the rationales of our prior cases and imposes substantial burdens on law enforcement without vindicating any significant values of privacy.” 453 *816 U. S., at 429 .  21 He noted that possibly “the controlling question should be the scope of the automobile exception to the warrant requirement,” id., at 435 , and explained that under that view “when the police have probable cause to search an automobile, rather than only to search a particular container that fortuitously is located in it, the exigencies that allow the police to search the entire automobile without a warrant support the warrantless search of every container found therein.  See post, at 451, and n. 13 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This analysis is entirely consistent with the holdings in Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , neither of which is an ‘automobile case,’ because the police there had probable cause to search the double-locked footlocker and the suitcase respectively before either came near an automobile.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> The parties in Robbins had not pressed that argument, how *817 ever, and Justice Powell concluded that institutional constraints made it inappropriate to reexamine basic doctrine without full adversary presentation.  He concurred in the judgment, since it was supported — although not compelled— by the Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , and stated that a future case might present a better opportunity for thorough consideration of the basic principles in this troubled area.  That case has arrived.  Unlike Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , in this case police officers had probable cause to search respondent’s entire vehicle.  22 Unlike Robbins, in this case the parties have squarely addressed the question whether, in the course of a legitimate warrantless search of an automobile, police are entitled to open containers found within the vehicle.  We now address that question.  Its answer is determined by the scope of the search that is authorized by the exception to the warrant requirement set forth in Carroll .  IV In Carroll itself, the whiskey that the prohibition agents seized was not in plain view.  It was discovered only after an officer opened the rumble seat and tore open the upholstery of the lazyback.  The Court did not find the scope of the search unreasonable.
**Lead Opinion**
 In its application of Carroll , this Court in fact has sustained warrantless searches of containers found during a lawful search of an automobile.  In Husty v. United States, 282 U. S. 694 , the Court upheld a warrantless seizure of whiskey found during a search of an automobile, some of which was discovered in “whiskey bags” that could have contained other goods.  23 In Scher v. United States, 305 U. S. 251 , federal of- *819 fleers seized and searched packages of unstamped liquor found in the trunk of an automobile searched without a warrant.  As described by a police officer who participated in the search: “I turned the handle and opened the trunk and found the trunk completely filled with packages wrapped in brown paper, and tied with twine; I think somewhere around thirty packages, each one containing six bottles.” 24 In these cases it was not contended that police officers needed a warrant to open the whiskey bags or to unwrap the brown paper packages.  These decisions nevertheless “have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench.” Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (Marshall, C. J.).  The fact that no such argument was even made illuminates the profession’s understanding of the scope of the search permitted under Carroll .  Indeed, prior to the decisions in Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , courts routinely had held that containers and packages found during a legitimate warrantless search of an automobile also could be searched without a warrant.  25 *820 As we have stated, the decision in Carroll was based on the Court’s appraisal of practical considerations viewed in the perspective of history.  It is therefore significant that the practical consequences of the Carroll decision would be largely nullified if the permissible scope of a warrantless search of an automobile did not include containers and packages found inside the vehicle.  Contraband goods rarely are strewn across the trunk or floor of a car; since by their very nature such goods must be withheld from public view, they rarely can be placed in an automobile unless they are enclosed within some form of container.  26 The Court in Carroll held that “contraband goods concealed and illegally transported in an automobile or other vehicle may be searched for without a warrant.” 267 U. S., at 153 (emphasis added).  As we noted in Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98, 104 , the decision in Carroll “merely relaxed the requirements for a warrant on grounds of practicability.” It neither broadened nor limited the scope of a lawful search based on probable cause.  A lawful search of fixed premises generally extends to the entire area in which the object of the search may be found and is not limited by the possibility that separate acts of en *821 try or opening may be required to complete the search.
**Lead Opinion**
 These interests must yield to the authority of a search, however, which — in light of Carroll — does not itself require the prior approval of a magistrate.  The scope of a warrantless search based on probable cause is no narrower — and no broader — than the scope of a search authorized by a warrant supported by probable cause.  Only the prior approval of the magistrate is waived; the search otherwise is as the magistrate could authorize.  32 *824 The scope of a warrantless search of an automobile thus is not defined by the nature of the container in which the contraband is secreted.  Rather, it is defined by the object of the search and the places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found. Just as probable cause to believe that a stolen lawnmower may be found in a garage will not support a warrant to search an upstairs bedroom, probable cause to believe that undocumented aliens are being transported in a van will not justify a warrantless search of a suitcase.  Probable cause to believe that a container placed in the trunk of a taxi contains contraband or evidence does not justify a search of the entire cab.  V Our decision today is inconsistent with the disposition in Robbins v. California and with the portion of the opinion in <citedDecision>Arkansas</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> on which the plurality in Robbins relied.  Nevertheless, the doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude this action.  Although we have rejected some of the reasoning in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , we adhere to our holding in that case; although we reject the precise holding in Robbins, there was no Court opinion supporting a single rationale for its judgment, and the reasoning we adopt today was not presented by the parties in that case. Moreover, it is clear that no legitimate reliance interest can be frustrated by our decision today.  33 Of greatest importance, we are convinced that the rule we apply in this case is faithful to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that the Court has followed with substantial consistency throughout our history.  We reaffirm the basic rule of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence stated by Justice Stewart for a unanimous Court in Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385 , 390: *825 “The Fourth Amendment proscribes all unreasonable searches and seizures, and it is a cardinal principle that ‘searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment — subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.’ Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 357 (footnotes omitted).” The exception recognized in Carroll is unquestionably one that is “specifically established and well delineated.” We hold that the scope of the warrantless search authorized by that exception is no broader and no narrower than a magistrate could legitimately authorize by warrant.  If probable cause justifies the search of a lawfully stopped vehicle, it justifies the search of every part of the vehicle and its contents that may conceal the object of the search.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.  The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.  The court rejected the Government’s argument that the warrantless search of the leather pouch was justified as incident to respondent’s arrest.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 137a.  The Government has not challenged this holding.  Judge Tamm, the author of the original panel opinion, reiterated the view that <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> prohibited the warrantless search of the leather pouch but not the search of the paper bag.  Judge Robb agreed that this result was compelled by <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> , although he stated that in his opinion “the right to search an automobile should include the right to open any container found within the automobile, just as the right to search a lawfully arrested prisoner carries with it the right to examine the contents of his wallet and any envelope found in his pocket, and the right to search a room includes authority to open and search all the drawers and containers found within the room.” 210 U. S. App. D. C., at 363, 655 F. 2d, at 1180 .  Judge MacKinnon concurred with Judge Tamm that <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> did not prohibit the warrantless search of the paper bag.  Concerning the leather pouch, he agreed with Judge Wilkey, who dissented on the ground that <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> should not be applied retroactively.  Many courts have held that <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> requires that a warrant be obtained only for personal luggage and other “luggage-type” containers.  See, e. g., United States v. Brown, 635 F. 2d 1207 (CA6 1980); United States v. Jimenez, 626 F. 2d 39 (CA7 1980).  One court has held that <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> does not apply if the police have probable cause to search an entire vehicle and not merely an isolated container within it.  Cf. State v. Bible, 389 So. 2d 42 (La. 1980), vacated and remanded, 453 U. S. 918 ; State v. Hernandez, 408 So. 2d 911 (La. 1981); see also 210 U. S. App. D. C., at 363, 655 F. 2d, at 1180 (Robb, J., dissenting).  On September 29, 1921, Carroll and Kiro met the agents in Grand Rapids and agreed to sell them three cases of whiskey.  The sale was not consummated, however, possibly because Carroll learned the agents’ true identity.  In October, the agents discovered Carroll and Kiro driving the Oldsmobile Roadster on the road to Detroit, which was known as an active center for the introduction of illegal liquor into this country.  The agents followed the roadster as far as East Lansing, but there abandoned the chase. The legislation authorized customs officials to search any ship or vessel without a warrant if they had probable cause to believe that it concealed goods subject to duty.  The same legislation required a warrant for searches of dwelling places.

 See id., at 17 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  The Court concluded that there is a significant difference between the seizure of a sealed package and a subsequent search of its contents; the search of the container in that case was “a far greater intrusion into Fourth Amendment values than the impoundment of the footlocker.” Id., at 14, n. 8 .  A temporary seizure of a package or piece of luggage often may be accomplished without as significant an intrusion upon the individual — and without as great a burden on the police — as in the case of the seizure of an automobile.  See n. 9, supra. The Arkansas Supreme Court carefully reviewed the facts of the case and concluded: “The information supplied to the police by the confidential informant is adequate to support the State’s claim that the police had probable cause to believe that appellant’s green suitcase contained a controlled substance when the police confiscated the suitcase and opened it.” Sanders v. State, 262 Ark. 595, 599 , 559 S. W. 2d 704, 706 (1977).  The court also noted: “The evidence in this case supports the conclusion that the relationship between the suitcase and the taxicab is coincidental.” Id., at 600, n. 2 , 559 S. W. 2d, at 706, n. 2 .  Moreover, none of the practical difficulties associated with the detention of a vehicle on a public highway that made the immediate search in Carroll reasonable could justify an immediate search of the suitcase, since the officers had no interest in detaining the taxi or its driver.  The Court stated that “the extent to which the Fourth Amendment applies to containers and other parcels depends not at all upon whether they are seized from an automobile.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 764, n. 13</citedDecision> .  This general rule was limited only by the observation that “[n]ot all containers and packages found by police during the course of a search will deserve the full protection of the Fourth Amendment.  Thus, some containers (for example a kit of burglar tools or a gun case) by their very nature cannot support any reasonable expectation of privacy because their contents can be inferred from their outward appearance.  Similarly, in some cases the contents of a package will be open to ‘plain view,’ thereby obviating the need for a warrant.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> People v. Robbins, 103 Cal. App. 3d 34, 39 , 162 Cal. Rptr. 780, 782 (1980).  “While the plurality’s blanket warrant requirement does not even purport to protect any privacy interest, it would impose substantial new burdens on law enforcement.  Confronted with a cigar box or a Dixie cup in the course of a probable-cause search of an automobile for narcotics, the conscientious policeman would be required to take the object to a magistrate, fill out the appropriate forms, await the decision, and finally obtain the warrant.  Suspects or vehicles normally will be detained while the warrant is sought.  This process may take hours, removing the officer from his normal police duties.  Expenditure of such time and effort, drawn from the public’s limited resources for detecting or preventing crimes, is justified when it protects an individual’s reasonable privacy interests.  In my view, the plurality’s requirement cannot be so justified.

*826 Justice Powell, concurring.  In my opinion in Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420, 429 (1981), concurring in the judgment, I stated that the judgment was justified, though not compelled, by the Court’s opinion in Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1979).  I did not agree, however, with the “bright line” rule articulated by the plurality opinion.  Rather, I repeated the view I long have held that one’s “reasonable expectation of privacy” is a particularly relevant factor in determining the validity of a warrantless search.  I have recognized that, with respect to automobiles in general, this expectation can be only a limited one.  See <citedDecision>Arkansas</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Sanders, supra, at 761</citedDecision> ; Almeida-Sanchez v. United States, 413 U. S. 266, 279 (1973) (Powell, J., concurring).  I continue to think that in many situations one’s reasonable expectation of privacy may be a decisive factor in a search case. It became evident last Term, however, from the five opinions written in Robbins — in none of which The Chief Justice joined — that it is essential to have a Court opinion in automobile search cases that provides “specific guidance to police and courts in this recurring situation.” Robbins v. California, supra, at 435 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  The Court’s opinion today, written by Justice Stevens and now joined by The Chief Justice and four other Justices, will afford this needed guidance.  It is fair also to say that, given Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 (1925), and Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 (1970), the Court’s decision does not depart substantially from Fourth Amendment doctrine in automobile cases. Moreover, in enunciating a readily understood and applied rule, today’s decision is consistent with the similar step taken last Term in New York v. Belton, 453 U. S. 454 (1981).

 2 This alternative creates an unacceptably high risk of losing the contents of the vehicle, and is a principal basis for the Court’s automobile exception to the warrant requirement.  See Chambers, supra, at 51, n. 9 .  In many cases, however, the police will, prior to searching the car, have cause to arrest the occupants and bring them to the station for booking.  In this situation, the police can ordinarily seize the automobile and bring it to the station.  Because the vehicle is now in the exclusive control of the authorities, any subsequent search cannot be justified by the mobility of the car. Rather, an immediate warrantless search of the vehicle is permitted because of the second major justification for the automobile exception: the diminished expectation of privacy in an automobile.  Because an automobile presents much of its contents in open view to police officers who legitimately stop it on a public way, is used for travel, and is subject to significant gov *831 ernment regulation, this Court has determined that the intrusion of a warrantless search of an automobile is constitutionally less significant than a warrantless search of more private areas.  See Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753, 761</citedDecision> (1979) (collecting cases).  This justification has been invoked for warrantless automobile searches in circumstances where the exigency of mobility was clearly not present.  See, e. g., South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364, 367-368 (1976); Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, at 441-442 .  By focusing on the defendant’s reasonable expectation of privacy, this Court has refused to require a warrant in situations where the process of obtaining such a warrant would be more intrusive than the actual search itself.  Cf. Katz v. United States, supra. A defendant may consider the seizure of the car a greater intrusion than an immediate search.  See Chambers, supra, at 51-52 .  Therefore, even where police can bring both the defendant and the automobile to the station safely and can house the car while they seek a warrant, the police are permitted to decide whether instead to conduct an immediate search of the car. In effect, the warrantless search is permissible because a warrant requirement would not provide significant protection of the defendant’s Fourth Amendment interests.  B The majority’s rule is flatly inconsistent with these established Fourth Amendment principles concerning the scope of the automobile exception and the importance of the warrant requirement.  Historically, the automobile exception has been limited to those situations where its application is compelled by the justifications described above.  Today, the majority makes no attempt to base its decision on these justifications.  This failure is not surprising, since the traditional rationales for the automobile exception plainly do not support extending it to the search of a container found inside a vehicle.  *832 The practical mobility problem — deciding what to do with both the car and the occupants if an immediate search is not conducted — is simply not present in the case of movable containers, which can easily be seized and brought to the magistrate.  See Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 762-766</citedDecision> , and nn. 10, 14.  The lesser-expectation-of-privacy rationale also has little force.  A container, as opposed to the car itself, does not reflect diminished privacy interests.  See <citedDecision>id., at 762, 764-765</citedDecision> .  Moreover, the practical corollary that this Court has recognized — that depriving occupants of the use of a car may be a greater intrusion than an immediate search — is of doubtful relevance here, since the owner of a container will rarely suffer significant inconvenience by being deprived of its use while a warrant is being obtained.  Ultimately, the majority, unable to rely on the justifications underlying the automobile exception, simply creates a new “probable cause” exception to the warrant requirement for automobiles.  We have soundly rejected attempts to create such an exception in the past, see Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971), and we should do so again today.  In purported reliance on Carroll v. United States, supra, the Court defines the permissible scope of a search by reference to the scope of a probable-cause search that a magistrate could authorize.  Under Carroll , however, the mobility of an automobile is what is critical to the legality of a warrantless search.  Of course, Carroll properly confined the search to the probable-cause limits that would also limit a magistrate, but it did not suggest that the search could be as broad as a magistrate could authorize upon a warrant.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 After all, what justifies the warrantless search is not probable cause alone, but probable cause coupled with the mobility of the automobile.  Because the scope of a warrantless search should depend on the scope of the justification for dispensing with a warrant, the entire premise of the majority’s opinion fails to support its conclusion.  The majority’s rule masks the startling assumption that a policeman’s determination of probable cause is the functional equivalent of the determination of a neutral and detached magistrate.  This assumption ignores a major premise of the warrant requirement — the importance of having a neutral and detached magistrate determine whether probable cause exists.  See supra, at 828-829.  The majority’s explanation that the scope of the warrantless automobile search will be “limited” to what a magistrate could authorize is thus inconsistent with our cases, which firmly establish that an on- *834 the-spot determination of probable cause is never the same as a decision by a neutral and detached magistrate.  C Our recent decisions in United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977), <citedDecision>Arkansas</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Sanders, supra,</citedDecision> and Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 (1981), clearly affirm that movable containers are different from automobiles for Fourth Amendment purposes.  In Chadwick , the Court drew a constitutional distinction between luggage and automobiles in terms of substantial differences in expectations of privacy.  433 U. S., at 12 .  Moreover, the Court held that the mobility of such containers does not justify dispensing with a warrant, since federal agents had seized the luggage and safely transferred it to their custody under their exclusive control.  <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> explicitly held that “the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies to personal luggage taken from an automobile to the same degree it applies to such luggage in other locations.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 766</citedDecision> .  And Robbins reaffirmed the <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> rationale as applied to wrapped packages found in the unlocked luggage compartment of a vehicle.  453 U. S., at 425 .  3 In light of these considerations, I conclude that any movable container found within an automobile deserves precisely the same degree of Fourth Amendment warrant protection that it would deserve if found at a location outside the automobile.  See Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 763-765</citedDecision> , and n. 13; Chadwick, supra, at 17, n. 1 (Brennan, J., concurring).  Chadwick , as the majority notes, “reaffirmed the general principle that closed packages and containers may not be *835 searched without a warrant.” Ante, at 812.  Although there is no need to describe the exact contours of that protection in this dissenting opinion, it is clear enough that closed, opaque containers — regardless of whether they are “worthy” or are always used to store personal items — are ordinarily fully protected.  Cf. <citedDecision>Sanders, supra, at 764, n. 13</citedDecision> .  4 Here, because respondent Ross had placed the evidence in question in a closed paper bag, the container could be seized, but not searched, without a warrant.  No practical exigencies required the warrantless searches on the street or at the station: Ross had been arrested and was in custody when both searches occurred, and the police succeeded in transporting the bag to the station without inadvertently spilling its contents.  5 II In announcing its new rule, the Court purports to rely on earlier automobile search cases, especially Carroll v. United States.  The Court’s approach, however, far from being “faithful to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment that the Court has followed with substantial consistency throughout our history,” ante, at 824, is plainly contrary to the letter and the spirit of our prior automobile search cases. Moreover, the new rule produces anomalous and unacceptable consequences.  *836 A The majority’s argument that its decision is supported by our decisions in Carroll and Chambers is misplaced.  The Court in Carroll upheld a warrantless search of an automobile for contraband on the basis of the impracticability of securing a warrant in cases involving the transportation of contraband goods.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 In a footnote, the majority suggests that “practical considerations” militate against securing containers found during an automobile search and taking them to the magistrate.  Ante, at 821, n. 28.  The Court confidently remarks: “[Pjrohibiting police from opening immediately a container in which the object of the search is most likely to be found and instead forcing them first to comb the entire vehicle would actually exacerbate the intrusion on privacy interests.  Moreover, until the container itself was opened the police could never be certain that the contraband was not secreted in a yet undiscovered portion of the vehicle.” Ibid. The vehicle would have to be seized while a warrant was obtained, a requirement inconsistent with Carroll and Chambers.  Ante, at 821, n. 28.  This explanation is unpersuasive.  As this Court explained in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> and as the majority today implicitly concedes, the burden to police departments of seizing a package or personal luggage simply does not compare to the burden of seizing and safeguarding automobiles.  Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 765, n. 14</citedDecision> ; ante, at 811, and n. 16.  Other aspects of the Court’s explanation are also implausible.  The search will not always require a “combing” of the entire vehicle, since police may be looking for a particular item and may discover it promptly.  If, instead, they are looking more generally for evidence of a crime, the immediate opening of the container will not protect the defendant’s privacy; whether or not it contains contraband, the police will continue to search for new evidence.  Finally, the defendant, not the police, should be afforded the choice whether he prefers the immediate opening of his suitcase or other container to the delay incident to seeking a warrant.  Cf. <citedDecision>Sanders, supra, at 764, n. 12</citedDecision> .  The more rea *839 sonable presumption, if a presumption is to replace the defendant’s consent, is surely that the immediate search of a closed container will be a greater invasion of the defendant’s privacy interests than a mere temporary seizure of the container.  8 B Finally, the majority’s new rule is theoretically unsound and will create anomalous and unwarranted results.  These consequences are readily apparent from the Court’s attempt to reconcile its new rule with the holdings of Chadwick and Sanders.  9 The Court suggests that probable cause to search only a container does not justify a warrantless search of an automobile in which it is placed, absent reason to believe that the contents could be secreted elsewhere in the vehicle.  This, the majority asserts, is an indication that the new rule is carefully limited to its justification, and is not inconsistent with Chadwick and Sanders.  But why is such a container more private, less difficult for police to seize and store, or in any other relevant respect more properly subject to the war *840 rant requirement, than a container that police discover in a probable-cause search of an entire automobile?  10 This rule plainly has peculiar and unworkable consequences: the Government “must show that the investigating officer knew enough but not too much, that he had sufficient knowledge to establish probable cause but insufficient knowledge to know exactly where the contraband was located.” 210 U. S. App. D. C. 342, 384, 655 F. 2d 1159, 1201 (1981) (en banc) (Wilkey, J., dissenting).  Alternatively, the majority may be suggesting that Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> may be explained because the connection of the container to the vehicle was incidental in these two cases. That is, because police had pre-existing probable cause to seize and search the containers, they were not entitled to wait until the item was placed in a vehicle to take advantage of the automobile exception.  Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971); 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 519-525 (1978).  I wholeheartedly agree that police cannot employ a pretext to escape Fourth Amendment prohibitions and cannot rely on an exigency that they could easily have avoided.  This interpretation, however, might well be an exception that swallows up the majority’s rule.  In neither Chadwick nor <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> did the Court suggest that the delay of the police was a pretext for taking advantage of the automobile exception.  For all that appears, the Government may have had legitimate reasons for not searching as soon as they had probable cause.  In any event, asking police to rely *841 on such an uncertain line in distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate searches for containers in automobiles hardly indicates that the majority’s approach has brought clarification to this area of the law. Ante, at 804; see Robbins, 453 U. S., at 435 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  11 I — I I — J HH The Court today ignores the clear distinction that Chadwick established between movable containers and automobiles.  It also rejects all of the relevant reasoning of <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> 12 and offers a substitute rationale that appears inconsistent with the result.  See supra, at 832.  <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> is therefore effectively overruled.  And the Court unambiguously overrules “the disposition” of Robbins, ante, at 824, though it gingerly avoids stating that it is overruling the case itself.  The only convincing explanation I discern for the majority’s broad rule is expediency: it assists police in conducting *842 automobile searches, ensuring that the private containers into which criminal suspects often place goods will no longer be a Fourth Amendment shield.  See ante, at 820.  “When a legitimate search is under way,” the Court instructs us, “nice distinctions between .  .  .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Seizures of automobiles can be distinguished because of the greater interest of defendants in continuing possession of their means of transportation; in the case of automobiles, a seizure is more likely to be a greater intrusion than an immediate search.  See Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42, 51-52 (1970).  Both cases would appear to fall within the majority’s new rule.  In United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977), federal agents had probable cause to search a footlocker.  Although the footlocker had been placed in the trunk of a car and the occupants were about to depart, the Court refused to rely on the automobile exception to uphold the search.  (It is true that the United States did not argue in this Court that the search was justified pursuant to that exception, but the theory was hardly so novel that this Court could not have responsibly relied upon it.) In Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1979), too, the suitcase was mobile and police had probable cause to search it; it was carried in an automobile for several blocks before the automobile was stopped and the suitcase was seized and searched.  Again, however, this Court invalidated the search.  In a footnote, the Court appears to suggest a more pragmatic rationale for distinguishing Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> — that no practical problems comparable to those engendered by a general search of a vehicle would arise if the official suspicion is confined to a particular piece of luggage.  Ante, at 816, n. 21.  This suggestion is illogical.  A general search might disclose only a single item worth searching; conversely, pre-existing suspicion might attach to a number of items later placed in a car. Surely the protection of the warrant requirement cannot depend on a numerical count of the items subject to search.  Unless one of these alternative explanations is adopted, the Court’s attempt to distinguish the holdings in Chadwick and <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> is not only unpersuasive but appears to contradict the Court’s own theory.  The Court suggests that in each case, the connection of the container to the vehicle was simply coincidental, and notes that the police did not have probable cause to search the entire vehicle.  But the police assuredly did have probable cause to search the vehicle for the container.  The Court states that the scope of the permitted warrantless search is determined only by what a magistrate could authorize.  Ante, at 823.  Once police found that container, according to the Court’s own rule, they should have been entitled to search at least the container without a warrant.  There was probable cause to search and the car was mobile in each case. The Court suggests that it rejects “some of the reasoning in Sanders.” Ante, at 824.  But the Court in <citedDecision>Sanders</citedDecision> unambiguously stated: “[W]e hold that the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies to personal luggage taken from an automobile to the same degree it applies to such luggage in other locations.” <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 766</citedDecision> .  The Court today instead adopts the reasoning of the opinion of The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Stevens, who refused to join the majority opinion because of the breadth of its rationale.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Of course, efficiency and promptness can never be substituted for due process and adherence to the Constitution.  Is not a dictatorship the most “efficient” form of government?  The Court purports to restrict its rule to areas that the police have probable cause to search, as “defined by the object of the search and the *843 places in which there is probable cause to believe that it may be found.” Ante, at 824.  I agree, of course, that the probable-cause component of the automobile exception must be strictly construed.  I fear, however, that the restriction that the Court emphasizes may have little practical value.  See 210 U. S. App. D. C. 342, 351, n. 21, 655 F. 2d 1159, 1168, n. 21 (1981) (en banc).  If police open a container within a car and find contraband, they may acquire probable cause to believe that other portions of the car, and other containers within it, will contain contraband.

 2 This alternative creates an unacceptably high risk of losing the contents of the vehicle, and is a principal basis for the Court’s automobile exception to the warrant requirement.  See Chambers, supra, at 51, n. 9 .  In many cases, however, the police will, prior to searching the car, have cause to arrest the occupants and bring them to the station for booking.  In this situation, the police can ordinarily seize the automobile and bring it to the station.  Because the vehicle is now in the exclusive control of the authorities, any subsequent search cannot be justified by the mobility of the car. Rather, an immediate warrantless search of the vehicle is permitted because of the second major justification for the automobile exception: the diminished expectation of privacy in an automobile.  Because an automobile presents much of its contents in open view to police officers who legitimately stop it on a public way, is used for travel, and is subject to significant gov *831 ernment regulation, this Court has determined that the intrusion of a warrantless search of an automobile is constitutionally less significant than a warrantless search of more private areas.  See Arkansas v. Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S. 753, 761</citedDecision> (1979) (collecting cases).  This justification has been invoked for warrantless automobile searches in circumstances where the exigency of mobility was clearly not present.  See, e. g., South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364, 367-368 (1976); Cady v. Dombrowski, supra, at 441-442 .  By focusing on the defendant’s reasonable expectation of privacy, this Court has refused to require a warrant in situations where the process of obtaining such a warrant would be more intrusive than the actual search itself.  Cf. Katz v. United States, supra. A defendant may consider the seizure of the car a greater intrusion than an immediate search.  See Chambers, supra, at 51-52 .  Therefore, even where police can bring both the defendant and the automobile to the station safely and can house the car while they seek a warrant, the police are permitted to decide whether instead to conduct an immediate search of the car. In effect, the warrantless search is permissible because a warrant requirement would not provide significant protection of the defendant’s Fourth Amendment interests.  B The majority’s rule is flatly inconsistent with these established Fourth Amendment principles concerning the scope of the automobile exception and the importance of the warrant requirement.  Historically, the automobile exception has been limited to those situations where its application is compelled by the justifications described above.  Today, the majority makes no attempt to base its decision on these justifications.  This failure is not surprising, since the traditional rationales for the automobile exception plainly do not support extending it to the search of a container found inside a vehicle.  *832 The practical mobility problem — deciding what to do with both the car and the occupants if an immediate search is not conducted — is simply not present in the case of movable containers, which can easily be seized and brought to the magistrate.  See Sanders, <citedDecision>442 U. S., at 762-766</citedDecision> , and nn. 10, 14.  The lesser-expectation-of-privacy rationale also has little force.  A container, as opposed to the car itself, does not reflect diminished privacy interests.  See <citedDecision>id., at 762, 764-765</citedDecision> .  Moreover, the practical corollary that this Court has recognized — that depriving occupants of the use of a car may be a greater intrusion than an immediate search — is of doubtful relevance here, since the owner of a container will rarely suffer significant inconvenience by being deprived of its use while a warrant is being obtained.  Ultimately, the majority, unable to rely on the justifications underlying the automobile exception, simply creates a new “probable cause” exception to the warrant requirement for automobiles.  We have soundly rejected attempts to create such an exception in the past, see Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971), and we should do so again today.  In purported reliance on Carroll v. United States, supra, the Court defines the permissible scope of a search by reference to the scope of a probable-cause search that a magistrate could authorize.  Under Carroll , however, the mobility of an automobile is what is critical to the legality of a warrantless search.  Of course, Carroll properly confined the search to the probable-cause limits that would also limit a magistrate, but it did not suggest that the search could be as broad as a magistrate could authorize upon a warrant.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 After all, what justifies the warrantless search is not probable cause alone, but probable cause coupled with the mobility of the automobile.  Because the scope of a warrantless search should depend on the scope of the justification for dispensing with a warrant, the entire premise of the majority’s opinion fails to support its conclusion.  The majority’s rule masks the startling assumption that a policeman’s determination of probable cause is the functional equivalent of the determination of a neutral and detached magistrate.  This assumption ignores a major premise of the warrant requirement — the importance of having a neutral and detached magistrate determine whether probable cause exists.  See supra, at 828-829.  The majority’s explanation that the scope of the warrantless automobile search will be “limited” to what a magistrate could authorize is thus inconsistent with our cases, which firmly establish that an on- *834 the-spot determination of probable cause is never the same as a decision by a neutral and detached magistrate.  C Our recent decisions in United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977), <citedDecision>Arkansas</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Sanders, supra,</citedDecision> and Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 (1981), clearly affirm that movable containers are different from automobiles for Fourth Amendment purposes.
