 This is not an instance when we can say that Congress may have neglected to change the law because it did not know what *232 was going on in the courts or because it was not asked to do so, as was the case in Helvering v. Hallock.  16 Nor is this a case in which subsequent affirmative congressional action manifested a view inconsistent with our prior decision, as was true in Girouard v. United States.  17 What we have here instead is a case in which Congress has not passed bills that have been introduced to make embezzled funds taxable and thereby make failure to report them as income a federal crime.  For this Court to hold under such circumstances that the inherent ambiguity of legislative inaction gives the Court license to repudiate the long-standing interpretation of the income tax statute and thereby bring additional conduct within the tax evasion criminal statute seems to us to be flagrantly violative of the almost universally accepted axiom that criminal statutes are narrowly and strictly construed.  Our Brethren cite no precedent in which this or any other court in the English-speaking world has so deliberately overruled a long-standing prior interpretation of a statute in order to create a crime which up to that time did not exist.  This Court as well as Congress was fully apprised of the various criticisms made in some Courts of Appeals opinions and elsewhere against the Wilcox holding, yet it has likewise until today steadfastly refused to overrule that holding during these fifteen years.  This has been in the face of the fact that the Government expressly urged that we do so in 1955, nine years after Wilcox was decided *233 and three years after the decision in Rutkin v. United States, <citedDecision>343 U. S. 130</citedDecision> .  On that occasion the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, speaking through Judge Frank for himself and Judge Medina, had held in the case of J. J. Dix, Inc., v. Commissioner that embezzled funds were not taxable as income, relying wholly on the Wilcox decision.  18 Judge Hincks dissented, saying that if the facts of Dix were not enough to distinguish it from Wilcox he would not follow Wilcox .  In urging us to grant certiorari, the Government said that the case presented a recurring problem in the administration of the income tax laws.  One of the arguments the Government presented for overruling Wilcox , strange as it may seem, was that “[s]everal prosecutions have recently been authorized and are now pending in various District Courts, even though the disputed income in those cases apparently came from embezzlements or closely analogous crimes.” 19 And the next to the last sentence of its petition was: “In short, the question whether the proceeds of embezzlement, unlike other illegal income, are to enjoy a preferred tax-exempt status, will continue to perplex the lower courts until it is settled by this Court.” 20 We denied certiorari.  21 There is surely less reason to repudiate and “devitalize” Wilcox now, six years after the Court, as composed at that time, refused to overrule it.  Of course the rule of stare decisis is not and should not be an inexorable one.  This is particularly true with reference to constitutional decisions involving determinations beyond the power of Congress to change, but Congress can and does change statutory interpretations.  It *234 is perfectly proper and right that it should do so when it believes that this Court’s interpretation of a statute embodies a policy that Congress is against.  But Congress has not taken favorable action on bills introduced to overturn our Wilcox holding even after we declined the Government’s request to reverse the identical holding in Dix, the latter having occurred three years after the decision in <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> which our Brethren now say may have misled Congress into thinking that we had repudiated the Wilcox holding.  It seems to us that we gave the doctrine of stare decisis its proper scope in our treatment of this Court’s decision in Federal Baseball Club v. National League of Professional Baseball Clubs, 259 U. S. 200 .  In that case this Court had held for reasons given that professional baseball was not covered by the antitrust acts.  Congress was asked through the years to change the law in this respect but declined to do so. In Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., 346 U. S. 356 , we followed the holding of that case without re-examination of the underlying issues “so far as that decision determines that Congress had no intention of including the business of baseball within the scope of the federal antitrust laws.” Later we were asked to extend the Federal Baseball case and to hold that the business of boxing could not without congressional action be brought within the antitrust laws.  We emphatically declined to do so in United States v. International Boxing Club, 348 U. S. 236 , nor did we overrule Toolson in that case, despite strong arguments that the reasoning of the Court in the first baseball case was equally applicable to the business of boxing.  We said about the proposed exemption of boxing from the antitrust laws that “[tlheir remedy, if they are entitled to one, lies in further resort to Congress.” 22 That case and that statement fit this-case precisely.  In fact, as we are about to explain, a *235 far more meaningful distinction can be made between embezzlement and extortion for purposes of this case than it was possible to make between baseball and boxing for purposes of that case, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s dissenting opinion in that case demonstrates.  If the Government wants to prosecute the local crime of embezzlement, ostensibly because of “tax evasion,” it seems clear to us that it should take its request to Congress which has power to pass on it and which has, to date, refused to do what the Government asks us to do in this case. IV. ■ Our Brethren advance as a reason for overruling Wilcox the 1952 decision in <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> v. United States, which was decided three years before we denied certiorari in the Dix case. They say that “the reasoning used in <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> leads us inescapably to the conclusion that Wilcox was thoroughly devitalized.” This follows, to some extent, the statement in the Government’s brief that “Wilcox and <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> cannot be reconciled on the basis of asserted technical differences between the extortionist and the embezzler.  .  .  .  The proper course, we submit, ... is to recognize that the Wilcox rationale was rejected in <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> , is unsound, and can no longer be regarded as having vitality.  Embezzled funds represent taxable gains.” 23 There is no doubt that some of the reasoning in the <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> opinion rejected some of the reasoning in the Wilcox opinion.  But this is true only with respect to the broad general standards formulated in the two cases, and such standards of course cannot be accepted as universal panaceas to be mechanically applied to solve all the concrete problems in cases like these.  Moreover, the <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> opinion expressly purported not to overrule Wilcox and *236 specifically said that Wilcox was still to govern cases fitting its facts, clearly meaning embezzlement cases. 24 And the Government had not asked in Butkin that Wilcox be overruled.  Its argument was that Wilcox was “inapplicable” to the facts in the Butkin record.  The Government’s brief went on to emphasize that the record in Wilcox showed only the bare receipt of money wholly belonging to another, while Rutkin had received the money “as a result of a bilateral agreement” and, as the Court of Appeals had pointed out, “with a 'semblance of a bona fide claim of right’, a conclusion fully substantiated by the testimony of both the petitioner and the Government witness Reinfeld.” 25 The Government went on to distinguish Butkin further by pointing out that there was “not the slightest hint in the record” that Rutkin ever had an obligation to repay the funds he took.  After this Court was persuaded by the Government in Butkin to accept its distinctions between Butkin and Wilcox , it seems rather odd to have the Government now contend that the two cases are irreconcilable.  While we disagreed, we can understand why the majority in But- *237 kin drew the distinctions it did.  Although the victim of either embezzlement or extortion ordinarily has a legal right to restitution, the extortion victim, like a blackmail victim, can in a sense be charged with complicity in bringing about the taxable event in that he knowingly surrendered the funds to the extortionist, sometimes in payment of an actual obligation.  Unlike the victim of an ordinary theft, he generally knows who has taken the property from him and he consents to the taking though under duress; and unlike most victims of embezzlement, he is able to report the taking to law enforcement officers during the taxable year and his failure to do so might be considered a kind of continuing consent to the extortionist’s dominion over the property.  The longer he acquiesces the less likely it becomes that the extortion victim ever will demand restitution; 26 but once the victim of an embezzlement finds out that his property has been stolen, he most likely will immediately make efforts to get it back.  Thus, although we still think <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> was wrongly decided for the reasons expressed in the dissenting opinion in that case, we can understand the argument for application of a sort of caveat emptor rule to persons who submit to blackmail or extortion, since it is far from certain that they will ever expose themselves by seeking repayment of what they paid out.  The distinctions between crimes like embezzlement and crimes like blackmail and extortion, therefore, are not merely *238 technical, legalistic “attenuated subtleties” for purposes of this decision, but are differences based upon practicalities such as often underlie the distinctions that have been developed in our law. In departing from both the Wilcox and <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> decisions today, our Brethren offer no persuasive reasons to prove that their judgment in overruling Wilcox is better than that of the Justices who decided that case. It contributes nothing new to the analysis of this problem to say repeatedly that the dishonest man must be subject to taxation just as the honest.  As already said, Chief Justice Stone and the others sitting with him on the Wilcox Court fully accepted that general principle and we do still.  Applying it here, we would say the embezzler should be treated just like the law-abiding, honest borrower who has obtained the owner’s consent to his use of the money.  27 It *239 would be unthinkable to tax the borrower on his “gain” of the borrowed funds and thereby substantially impair the lender’s chance of ever recovering the debt.  The injury that the Government would inflict on the lender by making the borrower less able to repay the loan surely would not be adequately compensated by telling the lender that he can take a tax deduction for the loss, and it is equally small comfort to the embezzlement victim for the Government, after taking part of his property as a tax on the embezzler, to tell the victim that he can take a deduction for his loss if he has any income against which to offset the deduction.  There is, of course, one outstanding distinction between a borrower and an embezzler, and that is that the embezzler uses the funds without the owner’s consent.  This distinction can be of no importance for purposes of taxability of the funds, however, because as a matter of common sense it suggests that there is, if anything, less reason to tax the embezzler than the borrower.  But if this distinction is to be the reason why the embezzlement must be taxed just as “the gains of the honest laborer,” then the use of this slogan in this case is laid bare as no more than a means of imposing a second punishment for the crime of embezzlement without regard to revenue considerations, the effect on the rightful owner, or the proper role of this Court when asked to overrule a criminal statutory precedent.  The double jeopardy implications would seem obvious, 28 *240 and discussion of the serious inadvisability for other reasons of thus injecting the Federal Government into local law enforcement can be found in the dissenting opinion in <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> .  We regret very much that it seems to be implied that .  the writer of the <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> opinion and those who agreed to it intended to overrule Wilcox when it is manifest that the language the Court used in <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> was meant to leave precisely the opposite impression.  We are sure that our Brethren at that time did not intend to mislead the public, and it would be hard to imagine why they said what they did in the <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> opinion had they not specifically considered and rejected the possibility of overruling Wilcox then and there.  We think it is unjustifiable to say nine years after <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> that it “devitalized” or “repudiated” the Wilcox holding when the <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> opinion said explicitly that Wilcox is still the rule as to embezzlement.  Congress has seen fit to let both decisions stand, and we think the present Court should do the same.  V. Even if we were to join with our Brethren in accepting the Government’s present contention that Wilcox and <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> cannot both stand, we would disagree as to which of the two decisions should now be repudiated.  This is true not only because we would feel less inhibition about narrowing rather than broadening the reach of a previously construed criminal statute.  Regardless of such considerations, our conviction that the <citedDecision>Rutkin</citedDecision> case was wrongly decided in this Court remains undiminished and has been further substantiated by the subsequent events in that controversy, which show all the more clearly the deplorable consequences that can- result when federal courts subject people who violate state criminal laws to *241 a double or treble prosecution for the state crime under the guise of attempted enforcement of federal tax laws.  29 For the foregoing reasons, as well as the reasons stated in Mr. Justice Whittaker’s opinion, we would reaffirm our holding in Commissioner v. Wilcox , reverse this judgment and direct that the case be dismissed.  G. C. M. No. 24945, 1946-2 Cum. Bull. 27, 28.  This was precisely in accord with this Court’s statement of the proper rule in the Wilcox opinion: “Taxable income may arise, to be sure, from the use or in connection with the use of such [embezzled] property.  .  .  .

We limit that case to its facts.  There embezzled funds were held not to constitute taxable income to the embezzler' under § 22 (a).  The issue here is whether money extorted from a victim with his consent induced solely by harassing demands and threats of violence is included in the definition of gross income- under § 22 (a).” <citedDecision>343 U. S., at 138</citedDecision> .  Brief for the United States in Opposition to Petition for Certiorari, Rutkin v. United States, <citedDecision>343 U. S. 130, pp. 13-14</citedDecision> .  The full sentence in the Court of Appeals opinion from which the Government quoted was: “So he [Rutkin] did receive the money with a ‘semblance of a bona fide claim of right’ as the embezzler had not in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Wilcox, supra, 327 U. S. at page 408, 66 S. Ct. at page 549.” United States v. Rutkin, 189 F. 2d 431, 435 .  This factual distinction was clearly emphasized in the Court’s opinion in Rutkin: “[Rutkin] induced Reinfeld to consent to pay the money by creating a fear in Reinfeld that harm otherwise would come to him and to-his family.  Reinfeld thereupon delivered his own money to petitioner.  Petitioner’s control over the cash so received was such that, in the absence of Reinfeld’s unlikely repudiation of the transaction and demand for the money’s return, petitioner could enjoy its use as fully as though his title to it were unassailable.” Rutkin v. United States, <citedDecision>343 U. S. 130, 136-137</citedDecision> .  (Emphasis supplied.) The analogy between the borrower and the embezzler was lucidly analyzed by Judge Sibley in McKnight v. Commissioner, 127 F. 2d 572, 573-574 .  The several cases relied on by the Court do not, in our judgment, justify imposing a tax upon embezzled money.  Corliss v. Bowers, 281 U. S. 376 , involved income accumulating in a trust fund belonging to the taxpayer and over which he retained control.  North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet, 286 U. S. 417 ; United States v. Lewis, 340 U. S. 590 ; and Healy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 , were cases in which the taxpayer had asserted a bona fide, though mistaken, claim of right.  In North American Oil, the taxpayer not only had a bona fide claim to the money taxed, but there had been an adjudication that he was entitled to it, and there was only the tenuous possibility that a competing claimant might later upset that adjudication.
