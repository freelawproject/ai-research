**Combined Opinion**
*525 Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court. In Frank v. Maryland, 359 U. S. 360 , this Court upheld, by a five-to-four vote, a state court conviction of a homeowner who refused to permit a municipal health inspector to enter and inspect his premises without a search warrant.  In Eaton v. Price, 364 U. S. 263 , a similar conviction was affirmed by an equally divided Court. Since those closely divided decisions, more intensive efforts at all levels of government to contain and eliminate urban blight have led to increasing use of such inspection techniques, while numerous decisions of this Court have more fully defined the Fourth Amendment's effect on state and municipal action.  E. g., Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 ; Ker v. California, <citedDecision>374 U. S. 23</citedDecision> .  In view of the growing nationwide importance of the problem, we noted probable jurisdiction in this case and in See v. City of Seattle, post, p. 541, to re-examine whether administrative inspection programs, as presently authorized and conducted, violate Fourth Amendment rights as those rights are enforced against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  385 U. S. 808 .  Appellant brought this action in a California Superior Court alleging that he was awaiting trial on a criminal charge of violating the San Francisco Housing Code by refusing to permit a warrantless inspection of his residence, and that a writ of prohibition should issue to the criminal court because the ordinance authorizing such inspections is unconstitutional on its face.  The Superior Court denied the writ, the District Court of Appeal affirmed, and the Supreme Court of California denied a petition for hearing.  Appellant properly raised and had considered by the California courts the federal constitutional questions he now presents to this Court. Though there were no judicial findings of fact in this prohibition proceeding, we shall set forth the parties’ factual allegations.  On November 6, 1963, an inspector *526 of the Division of Housing Inspection of the San Francisco Department of Public Health entered an apartment building to make a routine annual inspection for possible violations of the city's Housing Code. 1 The building’s manager informed the inspector that appellant, lessee of the ground floor, was using the rear of his leasehold as a personal residence.

 Consequently, appellant contends, he may not be prosecuted under § 507 for refusing to permit an inspection unconstitutionally authorized by § 503.  Relying on Frank v. Maryland, Eaton v. Price , and decisions in other States, 3 the District *528 Court of Appeal held that § 503 does not violate Fourth Amendment rights because it “is part of a regulatory scheme which is essentially civil rather than criminal in nature, inasmuch as that section creates a right of inspection which is limited in scope and may not be exercised under unreasonable conditions.” Having concluded that Frank v. Maryland , to the extent that it sanctioned such warrantless inspections, must be overruled, we reverse.  I.  The Fourth Amendment provides that, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” The basic purpose of this Amendment, as recognized in countless decisions of this Court, is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.  The Fourth Amendment thus gives concrete expression to a right of the people which “is basic to a free society.” Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 27 .  As such, the Fourth Amendment is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Ker v. California, <citedDecision>374 U. S. 23, 30</citedDecision> .  Though there has been general agreement as to the fundamental purpose of the Fourth Amendment, translation of the abstract prohibition against “unreasonable searches and seizures” into workable guidelines for the decision of particular cases is a difficult task which has for many years divided the members of this Court. Nevertheless, one governing principle, justified by history and by current experience, has consistently been followed: except in certain carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without proper con *529 sent is “unreasonable” unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant.  See, e. g., Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483 ; United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48 ; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 ; Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20 .  As the Court explained in Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10 , 14: “The right of officers to thrust themselves into a home is also a grave concern, not only to the individual but to a society which chooses to dwell in reasonable security and freedom from surveillance.  When the right of privacy must reasonably yield to the right of search is, as a rule, to be decided by a judicial officer, not by a policeman or government enforcement agent.” In Frank v. Maryland , this Court upheld the conviction of one who refused to permit a warrantless inspection of private premises for the purposes of locating and abating a suspected public nuisance.  Although Frank can arguably be distinguished from this case on its facts, 4 the Frank opinion has generally been interpreted as carving out an additional exception to the rule that warrantless searches are unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  See Eaton v. Price, supra. The District Court of Appeal so interpreted Frank in this case, and that ruling is the core of appellant’s challenge here.
