 According to appellant, most of the articles were found in a cardboard box in the basement; one in the suitcase beside .her bed.  All of this material, appellant — and a friend of hers — said were odds and ends belonging to a recent boarder, a man who had left suddenly for New York and had been detained there.  As the Supreme Court of Ohio read the statute under which appellant is charged, she is guilty of the crime whichever story is true.  The Ohio Supreme Court sustained the conviction even though it was based on the documents obtained in the lawless search.  For in Ohio evidence obtained by an unlawful search and seizure is admissible in a criminal prosecution at least where it was not taken from the “defendant’s person by the use of brutal or offensive force against defendant.” State v. Mapp, 170 Ohio St. 427 , 166 N. E. 2d, at 388, syllabus 2; State v. Lindway, 131 Ohio St. 166 , 2 N. E. 2d 490 .  This evidence would have been inadmissible in a federal prosecution.  Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 ; Elkins v. United States, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 206</citedDecision> .  For, as stated in the former decision, “The effect of the Fourth Amendment is to put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints .  .  .  .” Id., 391-392.  It was therefore held that evidence obtained (which in that case was documents and correspondence) from a home without any warrant was not admissible in a federal prosecution.  We held in Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 , that the Fourth Amendment was applicable to the States by reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

 338 U. S. 42 -44.  The truth is that trespass actions against officers who make unlawful searches and seizures are mainly illusory remedies.  Without judicial action making the exclusionary rule applicable to the States, Wolf v. Colorado in practical effect reduced the guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures to “a dead letter,” as Mr. Justice Rutledge said in his dissent.  See 338 U. S., at 47 .  Wolf v. Colorado, supra, was decided in 1949.  The immediate result was a storm of constitutional controversy which only today finds its end.  I believe that this is an appropriate case in which to put an end to the asymmetry which Wolf imported into the law. See *671 Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 ; Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 .  It is an appropriate case because the facts it presents show — as would few other cases— the casual arrogance of those who have the untrammelled power to invade one’s home and to seize one’s person.  It is also an appropriate case in the narrower and more technical sense.  The issues of the illegality of the search and the admissibility of the evidence have been presented to the state court and were duly raised here in accordance with the applicable Rule of Practice.  4 The question was raised in the notice of appeal, the jurisdictional statement and in appellant’s brief on the merits.  5 It is true that argument was mostly directed to another issue in the case, but that is often the fact.  See Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 535-540 .  Of course, an earnest advocate of a position always believes that, had he only an additional opportunity for argument, his side would win. But, subject to the sound discretion of a court, all argument must at last come to a halt.  This is especially so as to an issue about which this Court said last year that “The arguments of its antagonists and of its proponents have been so many times marshalled as to require no lengthy elaboration here.” <citedDecision>Elkins</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, 216.  Moreover, continuance of Wolf v. Colorado in its full vigor breeds the unseemly shopping around of the kind revealed in Wilson v. Schnettler, 365 U. S. 381 .  Once evidence, inadmissible in a federal court, is admissible in *672 a state court a “double standard” exists which, as the Court points out, leads to “working arrangements” that undercut federal policy and reduce some aspects of law enforcement to shabby business.  The rule that supports that practice does not have the force of reason behind it.  Memorandum of Me. Justice Stewart.  Agreeing fully with Part I of Me. Justice Harlan’s dissenting opinion, I express no view as to the merits of the constitutional issue which the Court today decides.  I would, however, reverse the judgment in this case, because I am persuaded that the provision of § 2905.34 of the Ohio Revised Code, upon which the petitioner’s conviction was based, is, in the words of Mr. Justice Harlan, not “consistent with the rights of free thought and expression assured against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment.” This “confidential source” told the police, in the same breath, that “there was a large amount of policy paraphernalia being hidden in the home.” The purported warrant has disappeared from the case. The State made no attempt to prove its existence, issuance or contents, either at the trial or on the hearing of a preliminary motion to suppress.
