 , although the two are often not easily separable.” Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S. 369 , 383 n. 19 (1969).  Each of these distinct aspects of labor law pre-emption has had its own history in our decisions, to which we now turn.  We consider first pre-emption based predominantly on the primary jurisdiction of the Board.  This line of preemption analysis was developed in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra, and its history was recently summarized in Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 290-291 (1971): “ [Y] arying approaches were taken by the Court in initially grappling i with this pre-emption problem.  Thus, for example, some early cases suggested the true distinction lay between judicial application of general common law, which was permissible, as opposed to state rules specifically designed to regulate *139 labor relations, which were pre-empted.  See, e. g., Automobile Workers v. Russell, 356 U. S. 634, 645 (1958).  Others made pre-emption turn on whether the States purported to apply a remedy not provided for by the federal scheme, e. g., Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc., 348 U. S. 468, 479-480 (1955), while in still others the Court undertook a thorough scrutiny of the federal Act to ascertain whether the state courts had, in fact, arrived at conclusions inconsistent with its provisions, e. g., Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd., <citedDecision>336 U. S. 245</citedDecision> (1949).  .  .  .  [N]one of these approaches proved satisfactory, however, and each was ultimately abandoned.  It was, in short, experience — not pure logic — which initially taught that each of these methods sacrificed important federal interests in a uniform law of labor relations centrally administered by an expert agency without yielding anything in return by way of predictability or ease of judicial application.  “The failure of alternative analyses and the interplay of the foregoing policy considerations, then, led this Court to hold in Garmon, 359 U. S., at 244 : “ 'When it is clear or may fairly be assumed that the activities which a State purports to regulate are protected by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, or constitute an unfair labor practice under § 8, due regard for the federal enactment requires that state jurisdiction must yield.  To leave the States free to regulate conduct so plainly within the central aim of federal regulation involves too great a danger of conflict between power asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law.’ ” See also San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S., at 244-247 ; Lockridge, supra, at 286-290 .  *140 However, a second line of pre-emption analysis has been developed in cases focusing upon the crucial inquiry whether Congress intended that the conduct involved be unregulated because left “to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.” NLRB v. Nash-Finch Co., 404 U. S. 138, 144 (1971).  4 Concededly this inquiry was not made in 1949 in the so-called Briggs-Stratton case, Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, <citedDecision>336 U. S. 245</citedDecision> (1949), the decision of this Court heavily relied upon by the court below in reaching its decision that state regulation of the conduct at issue is not pre-empted by national labor law. In Briggs-Stratton, the union, in order to bring pressure on the employer during, negotia *141 tions, adopted a plan whereby union meetings were called at irregular times during working hours without advance notice to the employer or any notice as to whether or when the workers would return.  In a proceeding under the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act, the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board issued an order forbidding the union and its members to engage in concerted efforts to interfere with production by those methods.  This Court did not inquire whether Congress meant that such methods should be reserved to the union “to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.” Rather, because these methods were “neither made a right under federal law nor a violation of it” the Court held that there “was no basis for denying to Wisconsin the power, in governing her internal affairs, to regulate” such conduct.  <citedDecision>Id., at 265</citedDecision> .  However, the Briggs-Stratton holding that state power is not pre-empted as to peaceful conduct neither protected by § 7 nor prohibited by § 8 of the federal Act, a holding premised on the statement that “[t]his conduct is governable by the State or it is entirely ungoverned,” <citedDecision>336 U. S., at 254</citedDecision> , was undercut by subsequent decisions of this Court. For the Court soon recognized that a particular activity might be “protected” by federal law not only when it fell within § 7, but also when it was an activity that Congress intended to be “unrestricted by any governmental power to regulate” because it was among the permissible “economic weapons in reserve, .  .  .  actual exercise [of which] on occasion by the parties, is part and parcel of the system that the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts have recognized.” NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 488-489 (emphasis added).  “[T]he legislative purpose may .  .  .

” Hill v. Florida, 325 U. S. 538, 542 (1945).  IV There remains the question of the continuing vitality of Briggs-Stratton.  San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S., at 245 n. 4, made clear that the Briggs-Stratton approach to pre-emption is “no longer of general application.” See also Insurance Agents, supra, at 493 n. 23.  We hold today that the ruling of Briggs-Stratton, permitting state regulation of partial strike activities such as are involved in this case is likewise “no longer of general application.” 13 *152 Briggs-Stratton assumed “management .  .  .  would be disabled from any kind of self-help to cope with these coercive tactics of the union” and could not “take any steps to resist or combat them without incurring the sanctions of the Act.” <citedDecision>336 U. S., at 264</citedDecision> .  But as Insurance Agents held, where the union activity complained of is “protected,” not because it is within § 7, but only because it is an activity Congress meant to leave unregulated, “the employer could have discharged or taken other appropriate disciplinary action against the employees participating.” 361 U. S., at 493 .  Moreover, even were the activity presented in the instant case “protected” activity within the meaning of § 7, 14 eco *153 nomic weapons were available to counter the Union's refusal to work overtime, e. g., a lockout, American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300 (1965), and the hiring of permanent replacements under NLRB v. Mackay Radio & Tel. Co., 304 U. S. 333 (1938).  See Prince Lithograph Co., 205 N. L. R. B. 110, 115 (1973); Cox, The Right to Engage in Concerted Activities, 26 Ind. L. J. 319, 339 (1951); Getman, The Protection of Economic Pressure by Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, 115 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1195 , 1236 (1967).  Our decisions since Briggs-Stratton have made it abundantly clear that state attempts to influence the substantive terms of collective-bargaining agreements are as inconsistent with the federal regulatory scheme as are such attempts by the NLRB: “Since the federal law operates here, in an area where its authority is paramount, to leave the parties free, the inconsistent application of state law is necessarily outside the power of the State.” Teamsters Union v. Oliver, 358 U. S. 283, 296 (1959).  And indubitably regulation, whether federal or State, of “the choice of economic weapons that may be used as part of collective bargaining [exerts] considerable influence upon the substantive terms on which the parties contract.” NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 490 .  The availability or not of economic weapons that federal law leaves the parties free to use cannot “depend upon the forum in which the [opponent] presses its claims.” Howard Johnson Co. v. Hotel Employees, 417 U. S. 249, 256 (1974).

 Finally, the court rejected the Union’s argument relying on Teamsters Union v. Morton that the refusal to work overtime was affirmatively “permitted” under federal law, stating: “Congress has not 'focused upon’ partial .  .  .  strikes,” and therefore “[p]olicing of such conduct is left wholly to the states.” 67 Wis. 2d, at 26 , 226 N. W. 2d, at 209 .  Since Briggs-Stratton is today overruled, and as we hold further that the Union’s refusal to work overtime is peaceful conduct constituting activity which must be free of regulation by the States if the congressional intent in enacting the comprehensive federal law of labor relations is not to be frustrated, the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is Reversed.  Wisconsin Stat. § 111.06 (2) (1974) provides: “It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employe individually or in concert with others: “(h) To take unauthorized possession of property of the employer or to engage in any concerted effort to interfere with production except by leaving the premises in an orderly manner for the purpose of going on strike.” Thus Automobile Workers v. Russell, 356 U. S. 634 (1958), upheld state-court jurisdiction of a common-law tort action against *137 a union to recover compensatory and punitive damages for malicious interference with the plaintiff's lawful occupation by mass picketing and threats of violence that prevented the plaintiff from entering the plant and engaging in his employment; Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., 355 U. S. 131 (1957), sustained state-court power to enjoin striking employees from threatening or provoking violence or obstructing or attempting to obstruct the free use of the streets adjacent to the struck plant, or free ingress and egress to and from the property; Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 351 U. S. 266 (1956), sustained state authority to vest jurisdiction in a state labor relations board to enjoin violent union conduct; United Constr. Workers v. Laburnum Constr. Corp., 347 U. S. 656 (1954), held a state court not precluded from hearing and determining a common-law tort action based on conduct which, although an unfair labor practice under federal law, constituted threats of violence and intimidation that forced an employer to abandon all of its projects in the area.  In short, a State still may exercise “its historic powers over such traditionally local matters as public safety and order and the use of streets and highways,” Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 315 U. S. 740, 749 (1942), for “[policing of such conduct is left wholly to the states.” Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, <citedDecision>336 U. S. 245, 253</citedDecision> (1949).  Thus Machinists v. Gonzales, 356 U. S. 617 (1958), held that a state court was not precluded from ordering the reinstatement by a union of a wrongfully expelled member and awarding him damages, even though the union’s conduct might also involve an unfair labor practice, since there was only a remote possibility of conflict with enforcement by the National Labor Relations Board of national policy.  And in Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181 (1965), we resolved the “troublesome question of where lies the line between permissible and federally preempted state regulation of [the] union activities” there presented, id., at 183 , by concluding that the Act's amendment expressly to exclude supervisory employees from the critical definition of “employees” eliminated any serious problems of pre-emption since “many provisions of the Act *138 employing that pivotal term would cease to operate where supervisors were the focus of concern.” Id., at 188 .  Further, in Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53 (1966), we held that the availability of a state judicial remedy for malicious libel would not impinge upon the national labor policy.  See Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1337 , 1352 (1972): "An appreciation of the true character of the national labor policy-expressed in the NLRA and the LMRA indicates that in providing a legal framework for union organization, collective bargaining, and the conduct of labor disputes, Congress struck a balance of protection, prohibition, and laissez-faire in respect to union organization, collective bargaining, and labor disputes that would be upset if a state could also enforce statutes or rules of decision resting upon its views concerning accommodation of the same interests.” Cf. Lesnick, Preemption Reconsidered: The Apparent Reaffirmation of Garmon , 72 Col. L. Rev. 469, 478, 480 (1972): “[T]he failure of Congress to prohibit certain conduct warrant [s a] negative inference that it was deemed proper, indeed desirable— at least, desirable to be left for the free play of contending economic forces.  Thus, the state is not merely filling a gap when it outlaws what federal law fails to outlaw; it is denying one party to an economic contest a weapon that Congress meant him to have available.  “The premise is .

 .  .  Doubtless one factor influences the other; there may be less need to apply economic pressure if the areas of controversy have been defined through discussion; and at the same time, negotiation positions are apt to be weak or strong in accordance with the degree of economic power the parties possess.” Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 488-489 .  In this case we need not and do not disturb the holding of Briggs-Stratton, later remarked in Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 494 n. 23, that § 13 of the NLRA, 29 U. S. C. § 163 , which guarantees *151 a qualified right to strike, is not an independent limitation on state power apart from its context in the structure of the Act.  Nor need we determine the vitality of the implication in Briggs-Stratton, also remarked in Insurance Agents, supra, at 494 n. 23, that § 501 (2) of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the NLRA, 29 TJ. S. C. §142(2), is not to be considered in connection with §13, but rather is only an aid to construction of § 8 (b)(4), 29 U. S. C. §158 (b)(4), of the NLRA.  We do note, however, that in determining the sense of the entire structure of the federal law respecting the use of economic pressure and the economic weapons assumed by Congress to be available to the parties, it is not insignificant that § 501 (2) in defining the term “strike” refers to the use of “any concerted slow-down or other concerted interruption of operations by employees.” “It is hardly conceivable that such a word as ‘strike’ could have been defined in these statutes without congressional realization of the obvious scope of its application.” Insurance Agents, supra, at 511 n. 6 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  To the extent, however, that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, was premised on the Court’s concern in that case with “evidence of considerable injury to property and intimidation of other employees by threats,” <citedDecision>336 U. S., at 253</citedDecision> , that decision remains vital as an unexceptional instance of our consistent recognition of the power of the States to regulate conduct physically injuring or threatening injury to persons or property.  See supra, at 136, and n. 2.  The assumption, arguendo, in Insurance Agents that the union activities involved were “unprotected” by § 7 reflected the fact that those activities included some bearing at least a resemblance to the “sit-down” strike held unprotected in NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., 306 U. S. 240 (1939), and the "disloyal” activities held unprotected in NLRB v. Electrical Workers, 346 U. S. 464 (1953).  See Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 492-494 .  The concerted refusal to work overtime presented in this case, however, is wholly free of such overtones.  It may be that case-by-case adjudication by the federal Board will ultimately result in the conclusion that some partial strike activities such as the concerted ban on overtime in the instant case, when unaccompanied by other aspects of conduct such as those present in Insurance Agents or those in Briggs-Stratton (overtones of threats and violence, <citedDecision>336 U. S., at 250</citedDecision> n. 8, and a refusal to specify bargaining demands, <citedDecision>id., at 249</citedDecision> ; see also Insurance Agents, supra, at 487 , and n. 13), are “protected” activities within the meaning of § 7, although not so protected as to preclude the use of available countervailing economic weapons by the employer.  See Prince Lithograph Co., 205 N. L. R. B. 110 (1973).  Compare ibid.; Dow Chemical Co., 152 N. L. R. B. 1150 (1965), with Decision, Inc., 166 N. L. R. B. 464, 479 (1967); John S. Swift Co., 124 N. L. R. B. 394 (1959).  See also Polytech, Inc., 195 N. L. R. B. 695, 696 (1972).  The Board in those cases placed emphasis on whether the decision to work overtime was voluntary with the individual in deciding whether a concerted refusal to work overtime is protected by *153 § 7.  The parties in the instant case dispute the volitional nature of overtime prior to the concerted ban.  In light of our disposition of the case we have no occasion to address the issue.

**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Stevens, with whom Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Rehnquist join, dissenting.  If the partial strike activity in this case were protected, or even arguably protected, by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, the Court’s conclusion would be supported by San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 .  But in Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, <citedDecision>336 U. S. 245</citedDecision> (Briggs-Strait on), the Court rejected the argument that comparable activity was protected by § 7.  And as I understand the Court’s holding today, it as *157 sumes that this activity remains unprotected.  1 Moreover, if such activity were prohibited, or arguably prohibited, by § 8 of the Act, the Court's conclusion would also be supported by Garmon .  But ever since NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , it has been clear that this activity is not even arguably prohibited.  If Congress had focused on the problems presented by partial strike activity, and had enacted special legislation dealing with this subject matter, but left the form of the activity disclosed by this record unregulated, the Court's conclusion would be supported by Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 .  But this is not such a case. Despite the numerous statements in the Court’s opinion about Congress’ intent to leave partial strike activity wholly unregulated, I have found no legislative expression of any such intent nor any evidence that Congress has scrutinized such activity.  2 *158 If this Court had previously held that the no-man’s land in which conduct is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited by federal law is nevertheless preempted by an unexpressed legislative intent, I would follow such a holding.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The concerted refusal to work overtime in this ease does not involve “concerted interference with an employer’s operations conducted by remaining on the employer’s premises.” In NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , the Court held that the partial strike activity in that case did not violate the union’s duty to bargain in good faith; in other words, even though the activity was not protected by § 7, it was not prohibited by § 8.  Contrary to the Court’s implication, ante, at 141, the case did not hold that the States could not prohibit such activity, but only that the NLRB had not been authorized to do so. Congress’ failure to grant power over such activity to the NLRB hardly amounts to withdrawal of the same power from the States.  The Court’s quotation, Ibid., from Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181, 187 , when read in context, is nothing more than a reference to a statement in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 , which poses, but does not answer, the question whether pre-emption extends to activity that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.  See n. 2, supra. I cannot agree with the Court’s conclusion that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, overruled today, numbers among those that have been eroded rather than preserved.  See ante, at 151-154, and n. 12.  The decision in Insurance Agents, supra, is readily distinguishable.  See n. <citedDecision>3, supra. </citedDecision> It is true that Briggs-Stratton has been limited to its facts insofar as it sanctions judicial determination whether conduct arguably protected by § 7 or prohibited by § 8 is actually protected or prohibited.  Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 291 ; San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra, at 245 n. 4; see Insurance Agents, supra, at 492-494 , and nn. 22, 23.  But the rule established in Garmon , and reaffirmed in Lockridge , is fully consistent with the conclusion that the States may regulate conduct that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.
