 *566 Pink , however, concerned a case, United States v. Moscow Fire Ins. Co., 309 U.S. 624 (1940), in which this Court had heard oral argument and apparently considered the merits prior to concluding that affirmance by an equally divided Court was appropriate.  The law of the case doctrine presumes a hearing on the merits.  See, e. g., Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 347, n. 18 (1979).  This ease does not involve a previous consideration of the merits.  Indeed, when this case previously was before us, due to absence of a quorum, we could not consider either the merits or whether to consider those merits through grant of a writ of certiorari.  This fact, along with the obvious difficulty of finding other equivalent substitute forums, convinces us that Pink’s statement does not control the outcome here, that the “law of the case” doctrine does not prevent our considering both issues presented, and that we should now proceed to decide them.  III The Court of Appeals upheld the judges claim of tax immunity upon the authority of Evans v. Gore, <citedDecision>253 U.S. 245</citedDecision> (1920).  That ease arose in 1919 when Judge Walter Evans challenged Congress’ authority to include sitting federal judges within the scope of a federal income tax law that the Sixteenth Amendment had authorized a few years earlier.  See Revenue Act of 1918, §213, 40 Stat. 1065 (defining “gross income” to include judicial salaries).  In <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> itself, the Court held that the Compensation Clause barred application of the tax to Evans, who had been appointed a judge before Congress enacted the tax. <citedDecision>253 U. S., at 264</citedDecision> .  A few years later, the Court extended <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> , making clear that its rationale covered not only judges appointed before Congress enacted a tax but also judges whose appointments took place after the tax had become law. See Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501, 509 (1925).  Fourteen years after deciding Miles , this Court overruled Miles.  O’Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277 (1939).  But, *567 as the Court of Appeals noted, this Court did not expressly overrule <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> itself.  64 F. 3d, at 650 .  The Court of Appeals added that, if “changes in judicial doctrine” had significantly undermined Evans’ holding, this “Court itself would have overruled the case.” Ibid. Noting that this case is like <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> (involving judges appointed before enactment of the tax), not like O’Malley (involving judges appointed after enactment of the tax), the Court of Appeals held that <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> controlled the outcome.  64 F. 3d, at 650 .  Hence application of both Medicare and Social Security taxes to these preenactment judges violated the Compensation Clause.  The Court of Appeals was correct in applying <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> to the instant ease, given that “it is this Court’s prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.” State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3,20 (1997); see also Rodriguez de Quijos v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989).  Nonetheless, the court below, in effect, has invited us to reconsider <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> .  We now overrule <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiseriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before enactment of the tax. The Court’s opinion in <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> began by explaining why the Compensation Clause is constitutionally important, and we begin by reaffirming that explanation.  As <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> points out, <citedDecision>253 U. S., at 251-252</citedDecision> , the Compensation Clause, along with the Clause securing federal judges appointments “during good Behavior,” U. S. Const., Art. Ill, § 1 — the practical equivalent of life tenure — helps to guarantee what Alexander Hamilton called the “complete independence of the courts of justice.” The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Hamilton thought these guarantees necessary because the Judiciary is “beyond comparison the weakest of the three” branches of Government.  Id., at 465-466.  It has “no influence over either the sword or the purse.” Id., at 465.  *568 It has “no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society.” Ibid. It has “neither FORCE nor WILL but merely judgment.” Ibid. Hamilton’s view, and that of many other Founders, was informed by firsthand experience of the harmful consequences brought about when a King of England “made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.” The Declaration of Independence ¶ 11.  And Hamilton knew that “a power over a man’s subsistence amounts to a power over Ms will.” The Federalist No. 79, at 472.  For this reason, he observed, “[n]ext to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support.” Ibid.; see also id., No. 48, at 810 (J. Madison) (“[A]s the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people, and has .  .  .  full discretion .. .  over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former”).  <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> properly added that these guarantees of compensation and life tenure exist, “not to benefit the judges,” but “as a limitation imposed in the public interest.” <citedDecision>253 U. S., at 253</citedDecision> .  They “promote the public weal,” <citedDecision>id., at 248</citedDecision> , in part by helping to induce “learned” men and women “to quit the lucrative pursuits” of the private sector, 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *294, but more importantly by helping to secure an independence of mind and spirit necessary if judges are “to maintain that nice adjustment between individual rights and governmental powers which constitutes political liberty,” W. Wilson, Constitutional Government in the United States 143 (1911).  Chief Justice John Marshall pointed out why this protection is important.  A judge may have to deeide “between the Government and the man whom that Government is prosecuting: between the most powerful individual in the *569 community, and the poorest and most unpopular.” Proceedings and Debates of the Virginia State Convention, of 1829-1830, p. 616 (1830).  A judge’s decision may affect an individual’s “property, his reputation, his life, his all.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> In the “exercise of these duties,” the judge must “observe the utmost fairness.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> The judge must be “perfectly and completely independent, with nothing to influence or con-tro[l] him but God and his conscience.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> The “greatest scourge .  .  .  ever inflicted,” Marshall thought, “was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent Judiciary.” Id., at 619.  Those who founded the Republic recognized the importance of these constitutional principles.  See, e. g., Wilson, Leetures on Law (1791), in 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed. 1896) (stating that judges should be “completely independent” in “their salaries, and in their offices”); McKean, Debate in Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, Dec. 11, 1787, in 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 539 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (the security of undiminished compensation disposes judges to be “more easy and independent”); see also 1 Kent, supra, at *294 (“[P]ermanent support” and the “tenure of their office” “is well calculated... to give [judges] the requisite independence”).  They are no less important today than in earlier times.  And the fact that we overrule <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> does not, in our view, diminish their importance.  We also agree with <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause offers protections that extend beyond a legislative effort directly to diminish a judge’s pay, say, by ordering a lower salary.  <citedDecision>253 U.S., at 254</citedDecision> .  Otherwise a legislature could circumvent even the most basic Compensation Clause protection by enacting a discriminatory tax law, for example, that precisely but indirectly achieved the forbidden effect.  Nonetheless, we disagree with Evans' application of Compensation Clause principles to the matter before it — a non-diseriminatory tax that treated judges the same way it treated other citizens.  Evans’ basic holding was that the *570 Compensation Clause forbids such a tax because the Clause forbids “all diminution,” including “taxation,” “whether for one purpose or another.” <citedDecision>Id., at 255</citedDecision> .  The Federal Circuit relied upon this holding.  64 F. 3d, at 650 .  But, in our view, it is no longer sound law. For one thing, the dissenters in <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> cast the majority’s reasoning into doubt.  Justice Holmes, joined by Justice Brandéis, wrote that the Compensation Clause offers “no reason for exonerating” a judge “from the ordinary duties of a citizen, which he shares with all others.  To require a man to pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot possibly be made an instrument to attack his independence as a judge.” <citedDecision>253 U. S., at 265</citedDecision> .  Holmes analogized the “diminution” that a tax might bring about to the burden that a state law might impose upon interstate commerce.  If “there was no discrimination against such commerce the tax constituted one of the ordinary burdens of government from which parties were not exempted.” <citedDecision>Id., at 267</citedDecision> .  For another thing, this Court’s subsequent law repudiated Evans’ reasoning.  In 1939, 14 years after Miles extended Evans’ tax immunity to judges appointed after enactment of the tax, this Court retreated from that extension.  See O’Malley, 307 U.S., at 283 (overruling Miles).  And in so doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> dissent.  The Court said that the question was whether judges are immune “from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes ... is subjected.” 307 U.S., at 282.  Holding that judges are not “immun[e] from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government,” ibid., the Court pointed out that the legal profession had criticized Evans’ contrary conclusion, and that courts outside the United States had resolved similar matters differently, 307 U.S., at 281.  And the Court concluded that “a non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not, when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution *571 of his salary within the prohibition of Article III.” Id., at 282.  The Court conceded that Miles had reached the opposite conclusion, but it said that Miles “cannot survive.” 307 U. S., at 283.  Still later, this Court noted that “[b]ecause Miles relied on <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> v. Gore, O’Malley must also be read to undermine the reasoning of Evans.” United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 227, n. 31 (1980).  Finally, and most importantly, we believe that the reasoning of Justices Holmes and Brandéis, and of this Court in O’Malley , is correct.  There is no good reason why a judge should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens.  We concede that this Court has held that the Legislature cannot directly reduce judicial salaries even as part of an equitable effort to reduce all Government salaries.  See 449 U. S., at 226 .  But a tax law, unlike a law mandating a salary reduction, affects compensation indirectly, not directly.  See ibid. (distinguishing between measures that directly and those that indirectly diminish judicial compensation).  And those prophylactic considerations that may justify an absolute rule forbidding direct salary reductions are absent here, where indirect taxation is at issue.  In practice, the likelihood that a nondiscriminatory tax represents a disguised legislative effort to influence the judicial will is virtually nonexistent.  Hence, the potential threats to judicial independence that underlie the Constitution’s compensation guarantee cannot justify a special judicial exemption from a commonly shared tax, not even as a preventive measure to counter those threats.  For these reasons, we hold that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax (including an increase in rates or a change in conditions) upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect.  Insofar as <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> holds to the contrary, that case, in O’Malley’s words, “cannot survive.” 307 U.S., at 283.  *572 The Government points out that the Medicare tax is just such a nondiseriminatory tax. Neither the courts below, nor the federal judges here, argue to the contrary.  Hence, insofar as the Court of Appeals found that application of the Medicare tax law to federal judges is unconstitutional, we reverse its decision.  IV The Social Security tax is a different matter.  Respondents argue that the 1983 law imposing that tax upon then-sitting judges violates the Compensation Clause, for it discriminates against judges in a manner forbidden by the Clause, even as interpreted in O’Malley , not <citedDecision>Evans</citedDecision> .  Cf. O’Malley, supra, at 282 (stating question as whether judges are immune "from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes ... is subjected” (emphasis added)).  After examining the statute’s details, we agree with the judges that it does discriminate in a manner that the Clause forbids.  Four features of the law, taken together, lead us to this conclusion.  First, federal employees had remained outside the Social Security system for nearly 50 years prior to the passage of the 1983 law. Congress enacted the law pursuant to the Social Security Commission’s recommendation to bring those employees within the law. See supra, at 562.  And the law itself deals primarily with that subject.  Thus, history, context, statutory purpose, and statutory language, taken together, indicate that the category of “federal employees” is the appropriate class against which we must measure the asserted discrimination.
