§ 4 (b). Its funds are deposited in the Treasury of the United States, and the compensation of its employees is paid by drafts upon the Treasury. *477 For the purposes of this case we may assume that the creation of the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation was,a constitutional exercise of the powers of the federal government. Cf. Kay v. United States, 303 U. S. 1. As that government derives its authority wholly from powers delegated to it by the Constitution, its every action within its constitiitional power is governmental action, and since Congress is made the sole judge of what powers within the constitutional grant are to be, exercised, all' activities of government constitutionally authorized by Congress must stand on a parity with respect to their constitutional immunity from taxation. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 432; Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, 117 U. S. 151, 158-159; South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 451—452; Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 412—415. And when the national government lawfully acts through a corporation which it owns and controls, those activities are governmental functions entitled to whatever tax immunity attaches to those functions when carried on by the government itself through its departments. See McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 421- 422; Smith v. Kansas City Title Co., 255 U. S. 180, 208; Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, 261 U. S. 374; New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra. The single question with which we are now concerned is whether the tax laid by the state upon the salary of respondent, employed by a corporate instrumentality of the federal government, imposes an unconstitutional burden upon that government. The theory of the tax immunity of either government, state or national, and its instrumentalities, from taxation by the other, has been rested Upon an implied liniitation on the taxing power of each, such as to forestall undue interference, through the exercise of that power, with the govern *478 mental activities of the other. That the two types of immunity may not, in all respects, stand on a parity has been recognized from the beginning, McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 435-436, and possible differences in application, deriving from differences in the source, nature and extent of the immunity of the governments and their agencies, were pointed out and discussed by this Court in detail during the last term. Helvering v. Gerhardt, supra, 412-413, 416. So far as now relevant, those differences have been thought to be traceable to the fact that the federal government, is one of delegated powers in the exercise of which Congress is supreme; so that every agency which Congress can constitutionally create is a governmental agency. And since the power to create the -agency includes the implied power to do whatever is needful or appropriate, if not expressly prohibited, to protect the agency, there has been attributed to Congress some scope, the limits of which it is not now necessary to define, for granting or withholding immunity of federal agencies from state taxation. See Van Allen v. The Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 583, 585; Bank v. Supervisors, 7 Wall. 26, 30, 31; Thomson v. Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall.

2 Congress, on the Other hand, to lay taxes in order “to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defense and general Welfare, of the United States,” Art. I, § 8, can reach every person and every dollar in the land with due regard to Constitutional limitations as to the method of laying taxes. But, as is true of other great activities'of thé state and national governments, the fact that we are a "federalism rais.es problems regarding.these vital powers of taxation. Since tw.o governments have authority within the same territory, neither through its power to’ tax can be allowed to cripple the operations of the other. Therefore state and federal governments must avoid exactions which discriminate against each other or obviously interfere with one another’s operations. These were the'-determining considerations that led the great Chief Justice to strike down the Maryland statute as an unambiguous measure of discrimination against the use by the United States of the Bank of the United States as one of its instruments of government. The arguments upon which McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, rested had their roots in actuality. But they have been distorted by sterile refinements unrelated *489 to affairs. These refinements derived authority from ah unfortunate remark in the opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland. Partly as a flourish of rhetoric and partly because the intellectual fashion of the times indulged a free use of absolutes,. Chief Justice Marshall gave currency to the phrase that “the power to tax involves, the power to destroy.” Id., at p. 431. •' This dictum was treated as though it were a constitutional mandate: Blit not without protest. One of the most trenchant minds on the Marshall court, Justice William Johnson, early analyzed the dangerous inroads upon the political freedom of the States and- the Union within their respective orbits resulting from a doctrinaire application of the generalities uttered in the course of the opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland. 3 The seductive cliché that the power to tax involves the power to destroy waslfused with another assumption, likewise not to be found in the Constitution itself, namely the doctrine that'the immunities are correlative — because the existence of the national government implies immunities from state taxation, the existence- of state governments implies equivalent immunities from federal taxation. When this doctrine was first applied Mr. Justice Bradley registered a powerful dissent, 4 the force of whiph gathered rather than lost strength with time. Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, 128. *490 All these doctrines of intergovernmental immunity have until recently been moving in the realm of what Lincoln called “pernicious abstractions.”1 The web of unreality spun from Marshall’s famous dictum was brushed away by one stroke of Mr. Justice Holmes’s pen: “The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.” Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi, 277 U. S. 218, 223 (dissent). Failure to exempt public functionaries from the universal duties of citizenship to pay for the costs of government was hypothetically transmuted into hostile action of one government against the other.
