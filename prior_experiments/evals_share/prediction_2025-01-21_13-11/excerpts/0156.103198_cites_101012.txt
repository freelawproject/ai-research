Case of interest: United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad (1927)
-----------------------
challenge to its jurisdiction,[5] or rendering a tentative[6] or final valuation[7] under the Valuation Act, although claimed to be inaccurate, or holding that a carrier is within the Railway Labor Act and therefore amenable to the National Mediation Board, are not reviewable.[8]
The governing considerations which keep such orders without the area of judicial review were thus summarized for the Court by Mr. Justice Brandeis in denying reviewability of a "final valuation" under the Valuations Act: "The so-called order here complained of is one which does not command the carrier to do, or to refrain from *131 doing, anything; which does not grant or withhold any authority, privilege or license; which does not extend or abridge any power or facility; which does not subject the carrier to any liability, civil or criminal; which does not change the carrier's existing or future status or condition; which does not determine any right or obligation." United States v. Los Angeles & S.L.R. Co., <caseOfInterest>273 U.S. 299</caseOfInterest>, 309-310.
Plainly the denial of judicial review in these cases does not derive from a regard for the special functions of administrative agencies. Judicial abstention here is merely an application of the traditional criteria for bringing judicial action into play. Partly these have been written into Article III of the Constitution by what is implied from the grant of "judicial power" to determine "Cases" and "Controversies," Art. III, § 2, U.S. Constitution.[9] Partly they are an aspect of the procedural philosophy pertaining to the federal courts whereby, ever since the first Judiciary Act, Congress has been loath to authorize review of interim steps in a proceeding.[10]
*132 Group (2) is composed of instances of statutory regulations which place restrictions upon the free conduct of the complainant. To rid himself of these restrictions the complainant either asks the Interstate Commerce Commission to place him outside the statute, or, being concededly within it, he invokes the Commi

MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion.
NOTES
[1]  On November 13, 1935, the order was amended in matters not here relevant.
[2]  The hearing before the examiner lasted two days; 221 pages of testimony were taken and 34 exhibits were introduced.
[3]  Under United States v. Corrick, 298 U.S. 435, 440, and United States v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 226, 229, the doctrine of "negative orders" implies a jurisdictional defect which courts must consider sua sponte.
[4]  All except one of the prior decisions of this Court on the "negative order" doctrine involved review of action by the Interstate Commerce Commission. United States v. Corrick, supra, note 3, involved review of action by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act.

[9]  Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409, is the symbol for considerations which limit the constitutional power of the federal courts, though that case itself never reached adjudication. See, also, United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40; Muskrat v. United States, 219 U.S. 346.
[10]  Prior to § 7 of the Act of March 3, 1891, authorizing an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals from a decree granting a preliminary injunction, review in a case not involving a final judgment was unknown in the federal judicial system, except insofar as it was present in the practice of certification introduced by § 6 of the Act of April 29, 1802. See United States v. Bailey, 9 Pet. 267. For state court decisions the requirements for finality of the original Judiciary Act have been adhered to. § 237, Judicial Code as amended, 28 U.S.C. § 344.
