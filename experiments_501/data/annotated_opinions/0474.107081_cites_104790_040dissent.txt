 The legislature may focus on a particular group or class only when the group designation is a “shorthand phrase” for the feared characteristic — i.  e., when it is common knowledge that all, not just some, members of the group possess the feared characteristic and thus such legislative designation would require no legislative fact-finding about individuals.  1 In the Court’s view, therefore, § 504 is too narrow in specifying the particular class; but it is also too broad in treating all members of the class alike.  On both counts— underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness — § 504 is invalid as a bill of attainder because Congress has engaged in forbidden fact-finding about individuals and groups and has thus strayed into the area reserved to the judiciary by the Constitution.  I.  It is not difficult to find some of the cases and statutes which the necessary implications of the Court’s approach will overrule or invalidate.  American Communications Assn. v. Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 382</citedDecision> , which upheld the predecessor statute to § 504 is ob *465 viously overruled.  In that case the Court accepted the congressional findings about the Communist Party and about the propensity of Party members “to subordinate legitimate trade union objectives to obstructive strikes when dictated by Party leaders, often in support of the policies of a foreign government.” <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 388</citedDecision> .  Moreover, Congress was permitted to infer from a person’s “political affiliations and beliefs” that such a person would be likely to instigate political strikes.  <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 391-392</citedDecision> .  Like § 504, the statute there under consideration did not cover all persons who might be likely to call political strikes.  Nevertheless, legislative findings that some Communists would engage in illegal activities were sufficient to sustain the exercise of legislative power.  The Bill of Attainder Clause now forbids Congress to do precisely what was validated in <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> .  Similarly invalidated are statutes denying positions of public importance to groups of persons identified by their business affiliations, commonly known as conflict-of-interest statutes.  In the <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> case the Court found in such statutes support for its conclusion that Congress could rationally draw inferences about probable conduct on the basis of political affiliations and beliefs, which it considered comparable to business affiliations.  The majority in the case now before us likewise recognizes the pertinency of such statutes and, in its discussion of Board of Governors v. Agnew, 329 U. S. 441 , strenuously — and unsuccessfully — attempts to distinguish them.  The statute involved in Agnew , § 32 of the Banking Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 194 , as amended, 12 U. S. C. § 78 (1964 ed.), forbade any partner or employee of a firm primarily engaged in underwriting securities from being a director of a national bank. The Court expressly recognized that the statute was directed to the “probability or likelihood” that a bank director who was also a partner or employee of an underwriting firm “may use his influence in the bank *466 to involve it or its customers in securities which his underwriting house has in its portfolio or has committed itself to take.” 329 U. S., at 447 .  (Emphasis added.) And, as we noted in Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 392</citedDecision> , “[t]here was no showing, nor was one required, that all employees of underwriting firms would engage in such conduct.” See also Agnew, 329 U. S., at 449 .  In terms of the Court’s analysis of the Bill of Attainder Clause, no meaningful distinction may be drawn between § 32 of the Banking Act and § 504.  Both sections disqualify a specifically described group, officers and employees of underwriting firms in the one case and members of the Communist Party in the other.  Both sections may be said to be underinclusive: others besides underwriters may have business interests conflicting with the duties of a bank director and others than Communists may call political strikes.  Equally, both sections may be deemed overinclusive: neither section finds that all members of the group affected would violate their obligations to the office from which they are disqualified; some members would and perhaps others would not.  Both sections are based on a probability or likelihood that this would occur.  Both sections leave to the courts the task of determining whether particular persons are members of the designated groups and occupy the specified positions.

 But § 32 disqualifies only partners and employees of underwriting firms, not other *467 businessmen with conflicting interests.  And § 504 applies to any man who occupies the two positions of labor union leader and member of the Communist Party.  If based upon “its general knowledge of human psychology” Congress may make findings about a group including members and employees of underwriting firms which disqualify such persons from a certain office, why may not Congress on a similar basis make such a finding about members of the Communist Party?  “Because of their business connections, carrying as they do certain loyalties, interests and disciplines,” § 32 disqualifies members and employees of underwriting firms as posing “a continuing threat of participation in the harmful activities .  .  .  .” Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 392</citedDecision> .  The same might be said about § 504, as was said about its predecessor: “Political affiliations of the kind here involved, no less than business affiliations, provide rational ground for the legislative judgment that those persons proscribed by § 9 (h) would be subject to ‘tempting opportunities’ to commit acts deemed harmful to the national economy.  In this respect, § 9 (h) is not unlike a host of other statutes which prohibit specified groups of persons from holding positions of power and public interest because, in the legislative judgment, they threaten to abuse the trust that is a necessary concomitant of the power of office.” Id., at 392.  Conflict-of-interest statutes are an accepted type of legislation.  2 Indeed, our Constitution contains a con *468 flict-of-interest provision in Art. I, § 6, cl. 2, which prohibits any Congressman from simultaneously holding office under the United States.  If the Court would save the conflict-of-interest statutes, which apparently it would, it is difficult to understand why § 504 is stricken down as a bill of attainder.  Other legislative enactments relevant here are those statutes disqualifying felons fropi occupying certain positions.

 Similarly a punitive purpose has been found when such a purpose clearly appeared in the legislative history.  Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martines, 372 U. S. 144, 169 ; United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 308-314 .  In other cases the analysis is more difficult.  We summarized the relevant considerations in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, supra: “Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment— retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose u) which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions.” 372 TJ. S., at 168-169.  An application of these criteria to § 504 compels the conclusion that it is regulatory rather than punitive.  Congress’ concern with the possibility of political strikes is not simply a fictional concern advanced to mask a puni *477 tive purpose.  Congress has sought to forestall political strikes since 1947, when it adopted § 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, which was sustained as a reasonable regulation in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 382</citedDecision> .  Section 504 was adopted as a fairer and more effective method of dealing with the same evil.  H. R. Rep. No. 741, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), p. 33; 1 Leg. Hist. LMRDA 791.  Section 9 (h) had proved ineffective because many Communists would take the prescribed oath, which meant the only sanction available was a perjury prosecution that presented serious difficulties of proof.  See Hearings before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, Communist Infiltration of Vital Industries and Current Communist Techniques in the Chicago, Illinois, Area, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), pp. 519, 576; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Communist Domination of Unions and Nationál Security, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. (1952), p. 54.  Moreover, the oath requirement created inequities both because the disqualification imposed was visited on the whole union membership and because the taking of an oath was exacted of all union leaders, many of whom resented the requirement.  See American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S., at 434-435 (Jackson, J., concurring and dissenting); S. Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), pp. 7, 9; 1 Leg. Hist. LMRDA 403, 405.
