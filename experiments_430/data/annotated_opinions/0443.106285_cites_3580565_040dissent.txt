 The action of the Court finds no support in the rule that decision of Constitutional issues should be avoided wherever possible.  For in overruling Wolf the Court, instead of passing upon the validity of Ohio’s § 2905.34, has simply chosen between two Constitutional questions.  Moreover, I submit that it has chosen the more difficult and less appropriate of the two questions.  The Ohio statute which, as construed by the State Supreme Court, punishes knowing possession or control of obscene material, irrespective of the purposes of such possession or control (with exceptions not here applicable) 7 and irrespective of whether the accused had any reasonable opportunity to rid himself of the material after discovering that it was obscene, 8 surely presents a Constitutional *676 question which is both simpler and less far-reaching than the question which the Court decides today.  It seems to me that justice might well have been done in this case without overturning a decision on which the administration of criminal law in many of the States has long justifiably relied.  Since the demands of the case before us do not require us to reach the question of the validity of Wolf, I think this case furnishes a singularly inappropriate occasion for reconsideration of that decision, if reconsideration is indeed warranted.  Even the most cursory examination will reveal that the doctrine of the Wolf case has been of continuing importance in the administration of state criminal law. Indeed, certainly as regards its “non-exclusionary” aspect, Wolf did no more than articulate the then existing assumption among the States that the federal cases enforcing the exclusionary rule “do not bind [the States], for they construe provisions of the Federal Constitution, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments, not applicable to the States.” People v. Defore, <citedDecision>242 N. Y. 13, 20</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>150 N. E. 585, 587</citedDecision> .  Though, of course, not reflecting the full measure of this continuing reliance, I find that during the last three Terms,'for instance, the issue of the inadmissibility of illegally state-obtained evidence appears on an average of about fifteen times per Term just in the m forma pauperis cases summarily disposed of by us.  This would indicate both that the issue which is now being decided may well have untoward practical ramifications respecting state cases long since disposed of in reliance on Wolf, and that were we determined to re-examine that doctrine we would not lack future opportunity.  The occasion which the Court has taken here is in the context of a case where the question was briefed not at all and argued only extremely tangentially.  The unwisdom of overruling Wolf without full-dress argu *677 ment is aggravated by the circumstance that that decision is a comparatively recent one (1949) to which three members of the present majority have at one time or other expressly subscribed, one to be sure with explicit misgivings.  9 I would think that our obligation to the States, on whom we impose this new rule, as well as the obligation of orderly adherence to our own processes would demand that we seek that aid which adequate briefing and argument lends to the determination of an important issue.  It certainly has never been a postulate of judicial power that mere altered disposition, or subsequent membership on the Court, is sufficient warrant for overturning a deliberately decided rule of Constitutional law. Thus, if the Court were bent on reconsidering Wolf, I think that there would soon have presented itself an appropriate opportunity in which we could have had the benefit of full briefing and argument.

 Problems of criminal law enforcement vary *681 widely from State to State.  One State, in considering the totality of its legal picture, may conclude that the need for embracing the Weeks rule is pressing because other remedies are unavailable or inadequate to secure compliance with the substantive Constitutional principle involved.  Another, though equally solicitous of Constitutional rights, may choose to pursue one purpose at a time, allowing all evidence relevant to guilt to be brought into a criminal trial, and dealing with Constitutional infractions by other means.  Still another may consider the exclusionary rule too rough-and-ready a remedy, in that it reaches only unconstitutional intrusions which eventuate in criminal prosecution of the victims.  Further, a State after experimenting with the Weeks rule for a time may, because of unsatisfactory experience with it, decide to revert to a non-exclusionary rule.  And so on.  From the standpoint of Constitutional permissibility in pointing a State in one direction or another, I do not see at all why “time has set its face against” the considerations which led Mr. Justice Cardozo, then chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals, to reject for New York in People v. Defore, <citedDecision>242 N. Y. 13</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>150 N. E. 585</citedDecision> , the Weeks exclusionary rule.  For us the question remains, as it has always been, one of state power, not one of passing judgment on the wisdom of one state course or another.  In my view this Court should continue to forbear from fettering the States with an adamant rule which may embarrass them in coping with their own peculiar problems in criminal law enforcement.  Further, we are told that imposition of the Weeks rule on the States makes “very good sense,” in that it will promote recognition by state and federal officials of their “mutual obligation to respect the same fundamental criteria” in their approach to law enforcement, and will avoid “ ‘needless conflict between state and federal courts.’ ” Indeed the majority now finds an incongruity *682 in Wolfs discriminating perception between the demands of “ordered liberty” as respects the basic right of “privacy” and the means of securing it among the States.  That perception, resting both on a sensitive regard for our federal system and a sound recognition of this Court’s remoteness from particular state problems, is for me the strength of that decision.  An approach which regards the issue as one of achieving procedural symmetry or of serving administrative convenience surely disfigures the boundaries of this Court’s functions in relation to the state and federal courts.  Our role in promulgating the Weeks rule and its extensions in such cases as Rea, Elkins, and Rios 11 was quite a different one than it is here.
