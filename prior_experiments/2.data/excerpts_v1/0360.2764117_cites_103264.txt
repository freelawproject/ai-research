14 To permit such States to bind all others to their decrees would endow with constitutional sanctity a Gresham's Law of domestic relations. 39 Fortunately, today's decision does not go that far. But its practical result will be to offer new inducements for conduct by parties and counsel, which, in any other type of litigation, would be regarded as perjury, but which is not so regarded where divorce is involved because ladies and gentlemen indulge in it. But if the doctrine of res judicata as to jurisdictional facts in controversies involving exclusively private interests as infused into the Full Faith and Credit Clause is applied to divorce decrees so as to foreclose subsequent inquiry into jurisdiction, there is neither logic nor reason nor practical desirability in not taking the entire doctrine over. Res judicata forecloses relitigation if there has been an opportunity to litigate once, whether or not it has been availed of, or carried as far as possible. Cromwell v.

Baxter State Bank, 308 U.S. 371 , 60 S.Ct. 317 , 84 L.Ed. 329 . 15 And it applies to questions of jurisdiction of subject matter as well as to that of persons. Stol v.
