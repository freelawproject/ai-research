  The issue presented is whether the Fifth Amendment’s grand jury guarantee

<p id="b201-9">
  A grand jury in the Northern District of California returned an indictment charging respondent Miller with three counts of mail fraud in violation of <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 1341</span>. After the Government moved to dismiss the third count, Miller was tried before a jury and convicted of the remaining two. He appealed asserting that there had been a fatal variance between the “scheme and artifice” to defraud charged in the indictment and that which the Government proved at trial. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and vacated the judgment of conviction. <span class="citation" data-id="423986"><a href="/opinion/423986/united-states-v-james-rual-miller/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

  The indictment had charged Miller with various fraudulent acts in connection with a burglary at his place of business.
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="132">

  Miller allegedly had defrauded his insurer both by consenting to the burglary in advance and by lying to the insurer about the value of his loss.
  <a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">

  </a>
  The trial proof, however, concerned only the latter allegation, focusing on whether, prior to the burglary, Miller actually had possessed all the property that he later claimed was taken. This proof was clearly sufficient
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="133">

  to support a jury finding that Miller’s claim to his insurer had grossly inflated the value of any actual loss.

<p id="b203-5">
  The Government moved to strike the part of the indictment that alleged prior knowledge of the burglary, and it correctly argued that even without that allegation the indictment still made out a violation of §1341.

  Respondent’s counsel opposed the change, and at his urging the entire indictment was sent to the jury. The jury found Miller
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="134">

  guilty, and respondent appealed on the basis that the trial proof had fatally varied from the scheme alleged in the indictment.

  Agreeing that Miller’s Fifth Amendment right to be tried only on a grand jury indictment had been violated, the Court of Appeals vacated the conviction. It succinctly stated its rationale:
 </p>
<blockquote id="b204-6">
  “The grand jury may well have declined to indict Miller simply on the basis of his exaggeration of the amount of his claimed loss. ... In fact it is quite possible that the grand jury would have been unwilling or unable to return an indictment based solely on Miller’s exaggeration of the amount of his claimed loss even though it had concluded that an indictment could be returned based on the overall scheme involving a use of the mail caused by Miller’s knowing consent to the burglary.” <span class="citation" data-id="423986"><a href="/opinion/423986/united-states-v-james-rual-miller/#1362" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

  Miller’s indictment properly alleged violations of <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 1341</span>, and it fully and clearly set forth a number of ways in which the acts alleged constituted violations. The facts proved at trial clearly conformed to one of the theories of the offense contained within that indictment, for the indictment gave Miller clear notice that he would have to defend against an allegation that he “‘well knew that the amount of copper claimed to have been taken during the alleged burglary was grossly inflated for the purpose of fraudulently obtaining $150,000 from Aetna Insurance Company.’” <span class="citation" data-id="423986"><a href="/opinion/423986/united-states-v-james-rual-miller/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. James Rual Miller">715 F. 2d, at 1361</a></span>-1362 (quoting indictment). Competent defense counsel certainly should have been on notice that that offense was charged and would need to be defended against. Accordingly, there can be no showing here that Miller was prejudicially surprised at trial by the absence of proof concerning his alleged complicity in the burglary;
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="135">

  The Court of Appeals did not disagree, but instead argued that Miller had been prejudiced in his right to be free from a trial for any offense other than that alleged in the grand jury’s indictment. <span class="citation" data-id="431942"><a href="/opinion/431942/united-states-v-james-rual-miller/#1270" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

Relying on the Fifth Amendment’s grand jury guarantee, the Court of Appeals concluded that a conviction could not stand where the trial proof corresponded to a fraudulent scheme much narrower than, though included within, the scheme that the grand jury had alleged. The Court of Appeals cited two prior decisions of this Court that emphasized the right of an accused to be tried only on charges that had in fact been passed on by a grand jury;

 </p>
<p id="b206-5">
  A review of prior cases allowing convictions to stand in the face of variances between the indictment and proof makes the Court of Appeals’ error clear. Convictions generally have been sustained as long as the proof upon which they are based corresponds to an offense that was clearly set out in the indictment. A part of the indictment unnecessary to and independent of the allegations of the offense proved may normally be treated as “a useless averment” that “may be ignored.”

  <em>
   Ford,
  </em>
  for example, an indictment charged a defendant with
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="137">

   </span>
  conspiring to import liquor in violation of various federal laws and in violation of a treaty. “The validity of the indictment [was] attacked . . . because it charge[d] that the conspiracy was to violate the treaty, although the treaty create[d] no offense against the law of the United States.”

  Although the grand jury had included the treaty allegation as part of the indictment, this Court upheld the conviction because “that part of the indictment [was] merely surplusage and may be rejected.”

  This treatment of allegations independent of and unnecessary to the offense on which a conviction ultimately rests has not been confined to allegations that, like those in

  would have had no legal relevance if proved. In

  for example, the Court was presented with facts quite similar to the instant case. A grand jury charged Salinger with mail fraud in an indictment containing several counts, “[a]ll relating] to the same scheme to defraud, but each charging] a distinct use of the mail for the purpose of executing the scheme.”
  <em>
   Id.,
  </em>
  at 546. As was the case with Miller, Salinger’s “scheme to defraud as set forth in the indictment. . . comprehended several relatively distinct plans for fleecing intended victims.”
  <em>
   Id.,
  </em>
  at 548. Because the evidence only sustained the charge as to one of the plans, the trial judge withdrew from the jury those portions of the indictment that related to all other plans. Salinger argued then, just as Miller argues now, that the variance between the broad allegations in the indictment and the narrower proof at trial violated his right to have had a grand jury screen any alleged offenses upon which he might be convicted at trial.
 </p>
<p id="b207-5">
  This Court unanimously rejected Salinger’s argument on the ground that the offense proved was fully contained within the indictment. Nothing had been added to the indictment which, in the Court’s view, “remained just as it was returned by the grand jury.”

  Stirone, a union official, was indicted for and convicted of unlawfully interfering with interstate commerce in violation of the Hobbs Act. <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 1951</span>. More specifically, the indictment charged that he had engaged in extortion that obstructed shipments of sand from outside Pennsylvania into that State, where it was to be used in the construction of a steel mill. At trial, however, the prosecution’s proof of the required interference with interstate commerce went beyond the allegation of obstructed sand shipments. The prosecutor also attempted to prove that Stirone had obstructed the steel mill’s eventual export of steel to surrounding States. Because the conviction might have been based on the evidence of obstructed steel exports, an element of an offense not alleged in the indictment, a unanimous Court held that the indictment had been unconstitutionally “broadened.”

  Bain was a bank cashier who had been indicted for including false statements in a report required to be made to the Comptroller of the Currency. The indictment charged that when Bain filed these required reports, he “did then and there well know and believe the said report and statement to be false to the extent and in the mode and manner above set forth; and [he] made said false statement and report in manner and form as above set forth with intent to deceive
  <em>

  This Court granted a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that Bain’s Fifth Amendment right to stand trial only on an indictment returned by a grand jury had been violated. The opinion reasoned that a court could not, consistent with the Fifth Amendment, assume that the narrower indictment would have been returned by the grand jury that returned the broader one.

   <span class="citation" data-id="91894"><a href="/opinion/91894/ex-parte-bain/" aria-description="Citation for case: Ex Parte Bain">Bain</a></span>
  </em>
  can support the proposition that the striking out of parts of an indictment invalidates the whole of the indictment, for a court cannot speculate as to whether the grand jury had meant for any remaining offense to stand independently, even if that remaining offense clearly was included in the original text. Under this latter proposition, the narrowing of an indictment is no different from the adding of a new allegation that had never been considered by the grand jury; both are treated as “amendments” that alter the nature of the offense charged. In evaluating the relevance of

   The facts, as stipulated to by the parties, included the following: The respondent, James Rual Miller, was the owner of San Francisco Scrap Metals, Inc., a company that regularly purchased scrap wire, and stripped, baled, and resold it. On the morning of July 15, 1981, Miller reported that his business had been burglarized the previous evening and that two trucks and 201,000 pounds of copper wire had been stolen. On July 20, 1981, Miller reported to the insurance adjuster that the missing copper had been purchased from L. K. Comstock, Inc., and Kingston Electric. Kingston Electric had indeed sold a quantity of copper to San Francisco Scrap Metals, but San Francisco Scrap Metals had resold a similar quantity to Battery Salvage Company. Miller claimed that the copper sold to Battery Salvage had been purchased from another company. But in fact, neither that other company nor L. K. Comstock had sold San Francisco Scrap Metals the copper claimed to have been purchased. Miller sent his proof of loss through the United States mail and received $100,000. Aetna sent one $50,000 check to Miller through the mail.

   “The learned judge who presided ... at the time the change was made in this indictment. . . rests the validity of the court’s action in permitting the change in the indictment, upon the ground that the words stricken out were surplusage, and were not at all material to it, and that no injury was done to the prisoner by allowing such change to be made. He goes on to argue that the grand jury would have found the indictment without this language. But it is not for the court to say whether they would or not. The party can only be tried upon the indictment as found by such grand jury, and especially upon all its language found in the charging part of that instrument. While it may seem to the court, with its better instructed mind in regard to what the statute requires to be found as to the intent to deceive, that it was neither necessary nor reasonable that the grand jury

    </span>
   should attach importance to the fact that it was the Comptroller who was to be deceived, yet it is not impossible nor very improbable that the grand jury looked mainly to that officer as the party whom the prisoner intended to deceive by a report which was made upon his requisition and returned directly to him. . . . How can the court say there may not have been more than one of the jurors who found this indictment, who was satisfied that the false report was made to deceive the Comptroller, but was not convinced that it was made to deceive anybody else? And how can it be said that, with these words stricken out, it is the indictment which was found by the grand jury?” <span class="citation" data-id="91894"><a href="/opinion/91894/ex-parte-bain/#9" aria-description="Citation for case: Ex Parte Bain">121 U.
