 In 1965, Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 79 Stat. 27 (1965 Act).  Under Title I, Congress provided monetary grants to States to address the needs of educationally deprived children of low-income families.  Under Title II, Congress provided further monetary *837 grants to States for the acquisition of library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials for use by children and teachers in public and private elementary and secondary schools.  Since 1965, Congress has reauthorized the Title I and Title II programs several times.  Three Terms ago, we held in Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997), that Title I, as applied in New York City, did not violate the Establishment Clause.  I believe that Agostini likewise controls the constitutional inquiry respecting Title II presented here, and requires the reversal of the Court of Appeals’ judgment that the program is unconstitutional as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.  To the extent our decisions in Meek v. Pittenger, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 349</citedDecision> (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229 (1977), are inconsistent with the Court’s judgment today, I agree that those decisions should be overruled.  I therefore concur in the judgment.  I — I I write separately because, in my view, the plurality announces a rule of unprecedented breadth for the evaluation of Establishment Clause challenges to government school aid programs.  Reduced to its essentials, the plurality's rule states that government aid to religious schools does not have the effect of advancing religion so long as the aid is offered on a neutral basis and the aid is secular in content.  The plurality also rejects the distinction between direct and indirect aid, and holds that the actual diversion of secular aid by a religious school to the advancement of its religious mission is permissible.  Although the expansive scope of the plurality's rule is troubling, two specific aspects of the opinion compel me to write separately.  First, the plurality’s treatment of neutrality comes close to assigning that faetor singular importance in the future adjudication of Establishment Clause challenges to government school aid programs.

 As a result, it creates no financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination.  Agostini next requires us to ask whether Chapter 2 “result[s] in governmental indoctrination.” 521 U. S., at 234 .  Because this is a more complex inquiry under our case law, it is useful first to review briefly the basis for our decision in Agostini that New York City’s Title I program did not result in governmental indoctrination.  Under that program, public-school teachers provided Title I instruction to eligible *847 students on private school premises during regular school hours.  Twelve years earlier, in Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), we had held the same New York City program unconstitutional.  In Ball , a companion case to Aguilar , we also held that a similar program in Grand Rapids, Michigan, violated the Constitution.  Our decisions in Aguilar and Ball were both based on a presumption, drawn in large part from <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , see <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 367-373</citedDecision> , that public-school instructors who teach secular classes on the campuses of religious schools will inevitably inculcate religion in their students.  In Agostini , we recognized that “[o]ur more recent eases [had] undermined the assumptions upon which Ball and Aguilar relied.” 521 U. S., at 222 .  First, we explained that the Court had since abandoned “the presumption erected in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Ball that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion.” Id., at 223.  Rather, relying on Zobrest , we explained that in the absence of evidence showing that teachers were actually using the Title I aid to inculcate religion, we would presume that the instructors would comply with the program’s secular restrictions.  See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-227 .  The Title I services were required by statute to be “ 'secular, neutral, and nonideological.’ ” Id., at 210 (quoting 20U.S.C.  § 6321(a)(2)).  Second, we noted that the Court had “departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.” Agostini, supra, at 225 .  Relying on Witters and Zobrest , we noted that our cases had taken a more forgiving view of neutral government programs that make aid available generally without regard to the religious or nonreligious character of the recipient school.

 Although respondents claim that Chapter 2 aid has been diverted to religious instruction, that evidence is de minimis, as I explain at greater length below.  See infra, at 864-867.  Respondents contend that Agostini is distinguishable, pointing to the distinct character of the aid program considered there.  See Brief for Respondents 44-47.  In Agostini , federal funds paid for public-school teachers to provide secular instruction to eligible children on the premises of their religious schools.  Here, in contrast, federal funds pay for instructional materials and equipment that LEA’s lend to religious schools for use by those schools’ own teachers in their classes.  Because we held similar programs unconstitutional in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman , respondents contend that those decisions, and not Agostini , are controlling.  See, e. g., Brief for Respondents 11,22-25.  Like respondents, Justice Souter also relies on <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman in finding the character of the Chapter 2 aid constitutionally problematic.  See post, at 893, 903.  At the time they were decided, <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman created an inexplicable rift within our Establishment Clause jurisprudence concerning government aid to schools.  Seven years before our decision in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , we held in Allen that a New York statute that authorized the lending of textbooks to students attending religious schools did not violate the *850 Establishment Clause.  392 U. S., at 238 .  We explained that the statute “merely [made] available to all children the benefits of a general program to lend school boohs free of charge,” that the State retained ownership of the textbooks, and that religious schools received no financial benefit from the program.  Id., at 243-244 .  We specifically rejected the contrary argument that the statute violated the Establishment Clause because textbooks are critical to the teaching process, which in a religious school is employed to inculcate religion.  Id., at 245-248 .  In <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman , we adhered to Allen, holding that the textbook lending programs at issue in each case did not violate the Establishment Clause.  See Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 359-362</citedDecision> (plurality opinion); Wolman, 433 U. S., at 236-238 (plurality opinion).  At the same time, however, we held in both eases that the lending of instructional materials and equipment to religious schools was unconstitutional.  See <citedDecision>Meek, supra, at 362-366</citedDecision> ; Wolman, supra, at 248-251 .  We reasoned that, because the religious schools receiving the materials and equipment were pervasively sectarian, any assistance in support of the schools’ educational missions would inevitably have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  For example, in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> we explained: “[I]t would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania’s church-related elementary and secondary schools and to then characterize [the statute] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.  Even though earmarked for secular purposes, 'when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission,’ state aid has the impermissible primary effect of advancing religion.” <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 365</citedDecision> -366 (quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 743 (1973)).  *851 Thus, we held that the aid program “necessarily results in aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole,” and “inescapably results in the direct and substantial advancement of religious activity.” <citedDecision>Meek, supra, at 366</citedDecision> (emphases added).  Similarly, in Wolman , we concluded that, “[i]n view of the impossibility of separating the secular education function from the sectarian, the state aid inevitably flows in part in support of the religious role of the schools.” 433 U. S., at 250 (emphasis added).  For whatever reason, the Court was not willing to extend this presumption of inevitable religious indoctrination to school aid when it instead consisted of textbooks lent free of charge.  For example, in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , despite identifying the religious schools’ secular educational functions and religious missions as inextricably intertwined, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 366</citedDecision> , the Court upheld the textbook lending program because “the record in the case ..., like the record in Allen, contains no suggestion that religious textbooks will be lent or that the books provided will be used for anything other than purely secular purposes,” id., at 361-362 (citation omitted).  Accordingly, while the Court was willing to apply an irrebutta-ble presumption that secular instructional materials and equipment would be diverted to use for religious indoctrination, it required evidence that religious schools were diverting secular textbooks to religious instruction.  The inconsistency between the two strands of the Court’s jurisprudence did not go unnoticed, as Justices on both sides of the <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman decisions relied on the contradiction to support their respective arguments.  See, e. g., Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 384</citedDecision> (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“[W]hat the Court says of the instructional materials and equipment may be said perhaps even more accurately of the textbooks” (citation omitted)); <citedDecision>id., at 390</citedDecision> (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (“The failure of the majority to justify the differing approaches to textbooks and instructional materials and *852 equipment in the above respect is symptomatic of its failure even to attempt to distinguish the... textbook loan program, which the plurality upholds, from the... instructional materials and equipment loan program, which the majority finds unconstitutional”).  The irrationality of this distinction is patent.  As one Member of our Court has noted, it has meant that “a State may lend to parochial school children geography textbooks that contain maps of the United States, but the State may not lend maps of the United States for use in geography class.” Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 110 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (footnotes omitted).  Indeed, technology’s advance since the Allen, Meek, and Wolman decisions has only made the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment more suspect.  In this case, for example, we are asked to draw a constitutional line between lending textbooks and lending computers.  Because computers constitute instructional equipment, adherence to <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman would require the exclusion of computers from any government school aid program that includes religious schools.  Yet, computers are now as necessary as were schoolbooks 30 years ago, and they play a somewhat similar role in the educational process.  That Allen, Meek, and Wolman would permit the constitutionality of a school aid program to turn on whether the aid took the form of a computer rather than a book further reveals the inconsistency inherent in their logic.  Respondents insist that there is a reasoned basis under the Establishment Clause for the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment.  They claim that the presumption that religious schools will use instructional materials and equipment to inculcate religion is sound because such materials and equipment, unlike textbooks, are reasonably divertible to religious uses.  For example, no matter what secular criteria the government employs in selecting a film projector to lend to a religious school, school officials can always divert that projector to re *853 ligious instruction.  Respondents therefore claim that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from giving or lending aid to religious schools when that aid is reasonably divertible to religious uses.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 See post, at 885, 890-895.  I would reject respondents’ proposed divertibility rule.  First, respondents cite no precedent of this Court that would require it.  The only possible direct precedential support for such a rule is a single sentence contained in a footnote from our Wolman decision.  There, the Court described Allen as having been “premised on the view that the educational content of textbooks is something that can be ascertained in advance and cannot be diverted to sectarian uses.” Wol-man, supra, at 251, n. 18.  To the extent this simple description of Allen is even correct, it certainly does not constitute an actual holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from lending any divertible aid to religious schools.  Rather, as explained above, the Wolman Court based its holding invalidating the lending of instructional materials and equipment to religious schools on the rationale adopted in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> — that the secular educational function of a religious school is inseparable from its religious mission.  See Wolman, 433 U. S., at 250 .  Indeed, if anything, the Wol-man footnote confirms the irrationality of the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment.  After the Wolman Court acknowledged that its holding with respect to instructional materials and equipment was in tension with Allen, the Court explained the continuing validity of Allen solely on the basis of stare decisis: “Board of Education v. Allen has remained law, and we now follow as a matter of stare decisis the principle that restriction of textbooks to those provided the public schools is sufficient to ensure *854 that the books will not be used for religious purposes.” Wolman, supra, at 252, n. 18 .  Thus, the Wolman Court never justified the inconsistent treatment it accorded the lending of textbooks and the lending of instructional materials and equipment based on the items’ reasonable divertibility.  Justice Souter’s attempt to defend the divertibility rationale as a viable distinction in our Establishment Clause jurisprudence fares no better.  For Justice Souter, secular school aid presents constitutional problems not only when it is actually diverted to religious ends, but also when it simply has the capacity for, or presents the possibility of, such diversion.  See, e. g., post, at 893 (discussing “susceptibility [of secular supplies] to the service of religious ends”).  Thus, he explains the Allen, Meek, and Wolman decisions as follows: “While the textbooks had a known and fixed secular content not readily divertible to religious teaching purposes, the adaptable materials did not.” Post, at 893-894.  This view would have come as a surprise to the Court in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , which expressly conceded that “the material and equipment that are the subjects of the loan .  .  .  are ‘self-poliefing], in that starting as secular, nonideological and neutral, they will not change in use.’” <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 365</citedDecision> (quoting Meek v. Pit-tenger, 374 F. Supp. 639, 660 (ED Pa. 1974)).  Indeed, given the nature of the instructional materials considered in Meek and Wolman , it is difficult to comprehend how a divertibility rationale could have explained the decisions.  The statutes at issue in those cases authorized the lending of “periodicals, photographs, maps, charts, sound recordings, [and] films,” Meek, supra, at 355, and “maps and globes,” Wolman, supra, at 249 .  There is no plausible basis for saying that these items are somehow more divertible than a textbook given that each of the above items, like a textbook, has a fixed and ascertainable content.  In any event, even if Meek and Wolman had articulated the divertibility rationale urged by respondents and Justice *855 Souter, I would still reject it for a more fundamental reason.  Stated simply, the theory does not provide a logical distinction between the lending of textbooks and the lending of instructional materials and equipment.  An educator can use virtually any instructional tool, whether it has ascertainable content or not, to teach a religious message.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 In any event, Chapter 2 contains both a secular content restriction, 20 U. S. C. § 7372 (a)(1), and a prohibition on the use of aid for religious worship or instruction, §8897, so Tilton provides no basis for upholding respondents’ challenge.  Finally, our decision in Bowen proves only that actual diversion, as opposed to mere divertibility, is constitutionally impermissible.  See, e. g., 487 U. S., at 621 .  Had we believed that the divertibility of secular aid was sufficient to call the aid program into question, there would have been no need for the remand we ordered and no basis for the reversal.  IV Because divertibility fails to explain the distinction our cases have drawn between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment, there remains the question of which of the two irreconcilable strands of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence we should now follow.  Between the two, I would adhere to the rule that we have applied in the context of textbook lending programs: To establish a First Amendment violation, plaintiffs must prove that the aid in question actually is, or has been, used for religious purposes.  See Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 361-362</citedDecision> ; Allen, 392 U. S., at 248 .  Just as we held in Agostini that our more recent cases had undermined the assumptions underlying Ball and Aguilar , I would now hold that Agostini and the eases on which it relied have undermined the assumptions underlying Meek and Wolman .  To be sure, Agostini only addressed the specific presumption that public-school employees teaching on the premises of religious schools would inevitably inculcate religion.  Nevertheless, I believe that our definitive rejection of that presumption also stood for — or at least strongly *858 pointed to — the broader proposition that such presumptions of religious indoctrination are normally inappropriate when evaluating neutral school aid programs under the Establishment Clause.  In Agostini , we repeatedly emphasized that it would be inappropriate to presume inculcation of religion; rather, plaintiffs raising an Establishment Clause challenge must present evidence that the government aid in question has resulted in religious indoctrination.  See 521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-227 .  We specifically relied on our statement in Zobrest that a presumption of indoctrination, because it constitutes an absolute bar to the aid in question regardless of the religious school’s ability to separate that aid from its religious mission, constitutes a "flat rule, smacking of antiquated notions of ‘taint,’ [that] would indeed exalt form over substance.” 509 U. S., at 13 .
