17 How. 477 . While disagreeing over what sorts of agency contracts fall within Minturn 's ambit, lower courts have uniformly agreed that Minturn states a per se rule barring at least some classes of agency contracts from admiralty. See n. 4, supra. [5] Minturn appears to have rested on two rationales: (1) that the agent's claim was nothing more than a "demand for a balance of accounts" which could be remedied at common law through an action of assumpsit; and (2) that the agent had no contractual or legal right to advance monies "on the credit, pledge, or security of the vessel." The first rationale appears to be an application of the then-accepted rule that "the *610 admiralty has no jurisdiction at all in matters of account between part owners," The Steamboat Orleans v. Phoebus, 11 Pet. 175 , 182 (1837), or in actions in assumpsit for the wrongful withholding of money, see Archawski v. Hanioti, <targetCase>350 U.S. 532</targetCase> , 534 (1956) ("A line of authorities emerged to the effect that admiralty had no jurisdiction to grant relief in such cases"). The second rationale appears to be premised on the then-accepted rule that a contract would not be deemed maritime absent a "hypothecation" or a pledge by the vessel's owner of the vessel as security for debts created pursuant to the contract. In other words, to sue in admiralty on a contract, the claimant had to have some form of a lien interest in the vessel, even if the action was one in personam. See e. g., Gardner v. The New Jersey, 9 F. Cas. 1192 , 1195 (No. 5233) (D. Pa. 1806); see generally, Note, 17 Conn. L . Rev.
