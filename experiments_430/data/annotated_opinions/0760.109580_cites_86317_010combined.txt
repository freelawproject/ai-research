**Combined Opinion**
 That court went on to hold that under state law the re-emergence of the land was an avulsive change, which did not divest the State of its title to the exposed land.  This Court granted certiorari and reversed the Supreme Court of Arizona.  We phrased the critical inquiry in Bonelli in these words: "The issue before us is not what rights the State has accorded private [land] owners in lands which the State holds as sovereign; but, rather, how far the State's sovereign right extends under the equal-footing doctrine and the Submerged Lands ActÂ—whether the State retains title to the lands formerly beneath the stream of the Colorado River or whether that title is defeasible by the withdrawal of those waters.  " 414 U. S., at 319-320 .  (Emphasis added.) We held that federal common law should govern in deciding whether a State retained title to lands which had re-emerged from the bed of a navigable stream, relying in part on Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296 U. S. 10 (1935).  That case held that the extent and validity of a federal grant was a question to be resolved by federal law, and in Bonelli *370 we decided that the nature of the title conferred by the equal-footing doctrine set forth in Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, <citedDecision>3 How. 212</citedDecision> (1845), should likewise be governed by federal common law. Under the equal-footing doctrine "the new States since admitted have the same rights, sovereignty and jurisdiction .  .  .  as the original States possess within their respective borders." Mumford v. Wardwell, 6 Wall. 423, 436 (1867).  <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> held that under the equal-footing doctrine new States, upon their admission to the Union acquire title to the lands underlying navigable waters within their boundaries.  We went on to discuss the nature of the sovereign's interest in the riverbed, which we found to lie in the protection of navigation, fisheries, and similar purposes.  We held that under federal common law, as we construed it in that case, Arizona's sovereign interest in the re-emerged land was not sufficient to enable it to retain title.  We found the principle governing title to lands which have been formed by accretion, rather than that which governs title where there has been an avulsive change in the channel of the river, to be applicable.  We chose the former because it would both ensure the riparian owner access to the water's edge and prevent the State from receiving a windfall.  We therefore decided that Bonelli, as riparian owner, was entitled to the land in question.  Our analysis today leads us to conclude that our decision to apply federal common law in Bonelli was incorrect.  We first summarize the basis for this conclusion, and then elaborate in greater detail in Parts III and IV, infra.  The title to the land underlying the Colorado River at the time Arizona was admitted to the Union vested in the State as of that date under the rule of <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> v. Hagan, supra .  Although federal law may fix the initial boundary line between fast lands and the riverbeds at the time of a State's admission to the Union, the State's title *371 to the riverbed vests absolutely as of the time of its admission and is not subject to later defeasance by operation of any doctrine of federal common law. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498 (1839); Weber v. Harbor Comm'rs, 18 Wall. 57 (1873).  Bonelli 's thesis that the equal-footing doctrine would require the effect of a movement of the river upon title to the riverbed to be resolved under federal common law was in error.  Once the equal-footing doctrine had vested title to the riverbed in Arizona as of the time of its admission to the Union, the force of that doctrine was spent; it did not operate after that date to determine what effect on titles the movement of the river might have.  Our error, as we now see it, was to view the equal-footing doctrine enunciated in <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Hagan</citedDecision> as a basis upon which federal common law could supersede state law in the determination of land titles.  Precisely the contrary is true; in <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> itself the equal-footing doctrine resulted in the State's acquisition of title notwithstanding the efforts of the Federal Government to dispose of the lands in question in another way.  The equal-footing doctrine did not, therefore, provide a basis for federal law to supersede the State's application of its own law in deciding title to the Bonelli land, and state law should have been applied unless there were present some other principle of federal law requiring state law to be displaced.  The only other basis [4] for a colorable claim *372 of federal right in Bonelli was that the Bonelli land had originally been patented to its predecessor by the United States, just as had most other land in the Western States.  But that land had long been in private ownership and, hence, under the great weight of precedent from this Court, subject to the general body of state property law. Wilcox v. Jackson, supra, at 517 .  Since the application of federal common law is required neither by the equal-footing doctrine nor by any other claim of federal right, we now believe that title to the Bonelli land should have been governed by Arizona law, and that the disputed ownership of the lands in the bed of the Willamette River in this case should be decided solely as a matter of Oregon law. III Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, supra , holds that the State receives absolute title to the beds of navigable waterways within its boundaries upon admission to the Union, and contains not the slightest suggestion that such title is "defeasible" in the technical sense of that term. The issue there was whether a federal patent, issued after the admission of Alabama to the Union, could validly convey lands that had underlain navigable waters upon Alabama's admission.  The Court had before it the following jury charge, given in the ejectment action below: "[T]hat if [the jury] believed the premises sued for were below usual high water-mark, at the time *373 Alabama was admitted into the union, then the act of Congress, and the patent in pursuance thereof, could give the plaintiffs no title, whether the waters had receded by the labour of man only, or by alluvion .  .  .  ." <citedDecision>3 How., at 220</citedDecision> .  The Court regarded the case as one of signal importance, and it observed that the decision was approached "with a just sense of its great importance to all the states of the union, and particularly to the new ones." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Mr. Justice Catron, in his dissenting opinion, commented that he deemed the case "the most important controversy ever brought before this court, either as it respects the amount of property involved, or the principles on which the present judgment proceeds .  .  .  ." <citedDecision>Id., at 235</citedDecision> .  The Court gave careful consideration to the role of the United States in holding the lands in question in trust for the new States, and to the recognition that the new States would be admitted "upon an equal footing, in all respects whatever .  .  ." with the original States.  <citedDecision>Id., at 224</citedDecision> .  Citing Martin v. Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410 (1842), the Court noted that the original States held the " `absolute right to all their navigable waters, and the soils under them for their own common use, subject only to the rights since surrendered by the Constitution.' " <citedDecision>3 How., at 229</citedDecision> .  The Court then concluded: "First, The shores of navigable waters, and the soils under them, were not granted by the Constitution to the United States, but were reserved to the states respectively.  Secondly, The new states have the same rights, sovereignty, and jurisdiction over this subject as the original states.  Thirdly, The right of the United States to the public lands, and the power of Congress to make all needful rules and regulations for the sale and disposition thereof, conferred no power to grant to the plaintiffs the land in controversy .  .  .  ." <citedDecision>Id., at 230</citedDecision> .  *374 In so holding, the Court established the absolute title of the States to the beds of navigable waters, a title which neither a provision in the Act admitting the State to the Union [5] nor a grant from Congress to a third party was capable of defeating.  Thus under <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> the State's title to lands underlying navigable waters within its boundaries is conferred not by Congress but by the Constitution itself.  The rule laid down in <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> has been followed in an unbroken line of cases which make it clear that the title thus acquired by the State is absolute so far as any federal principle of land titles is concerned.  For example, in Weber v. Harbor Comm'rs, 18 Wall., at 65-66 , the Court reaffirmed the doctrine of <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> : "Upon the admission of California into the Union upon equal footing with the original States, absolute property in, and dominion and sovereignty over, all soils under the tidewaters within her limits passed to the State, with the consequent right to dispose of the title to any part of said soils in such manner as she might deem proper, subject only to the paramount right of navigation over the waters .  .  .  ." (Emphasis added.) In Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 338 (1877), the Court extended the doctrine to waters which were nontidal but nonetheless navigable, consistent with its earlier extension of admiralty jurisdiction to such waters in The Propeller *375 Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443 (1852).  And in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1 (1894), the Court recounted in extenso the many cases which had followed the doctrine of <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> .  In summarizing its holding, 152 U. S., at 57-58 , the Court stated: "The new States admitted into the Union since the adoption of the Constitution have the same rights as the original States in the tide waters, and in the lands under them, within their respective jurisdictions.  The title and rights of riparian or littoral proprietors in the soil below [the] high water mark, therefore, are governed by the laws of the several States, subject to the rights granted to the United States by the Constitution." At the time of our decision in Bonelli, this line of authority stood side by side with, and was wholly consistent with, other cases requiring the application of federal law to questions of land titles or boundaries.  Where Mexico had patented tidal lands to a private owner before ceding to the United States the territory which ultimately became the State of California, California did not succeed to the ownership of such lands upon her admission to the Union.  Knight v. United States Land Assn., 142 U. S. 161 (1891).  If a navigable stream is an interstate boundary, this Court, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction over suits between States, has necessarily developed a body of federal common law to determine the effect of a change in the bed of the stream on the boundary.
**Combined Opinion**
 The federal patent had purported to convey a specified quantity of land, 18.88 acres, according to a survey by the General Land Office.  This Court recognized that if the patent purported to convey lands which were part of the tidelands, the patent would be invalid to that extent since the Federal Government has no power to convey lands which are rightfully the State's under the equal-footing doctrine.  Id., at 17-19 .  The Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals to remand for a new trial to allow the city to attempt to prove that some portion of the lands described in the federal patent was in fact tideland.  The Court went on to hold that the boundary between the upland and tideland was to be determined by federal law. Id., at 22 .  This same principle would require that determination of the initial boundary between a riverbed, which the State acquired under the equal-footing doctrine, and riparian fast lands likewise be decided as a matter of federal law rather than state law. But that determination is solely for the purpose of fixing the boundaries of the riverbed acquired by the State at the time of its admission to the Union; thereafter the role of the equal-footing doctrine is ended, and the land is subject to the laws of the State.  The expressions in Bonelli suggesting a more expansive *377 role for the equal-footing doctrine are contrary to the line of cases following <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> .  [6] For example, this Court has held that subsequent changes in the contour of the land, as well as subsequent transfers of the land, are governed by the state law. Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 343 (1906).  Indeed, the rule that lands once having passed from the Federal Government are subject to the laws of the State in which they lie antedates <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> .  As long ago as 1839, the Court said: "We hold the true principle to be this, that whenever the question in any Court, state or federal, is, whether a title to land which had once been the property of the United States has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws of the United States; but that whenever, according to those laws, the title shall have passed, then that property, like all other property in the state, is subject to state legislation; so far as that legislation is consistent with the admission that the title passed and vested according to the laws of the United States." Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet., at 517 .  (Emphasis added.) *378 The contrary approach would result in a perverse application of the equal-footing doctrine.  An original State would be free to choose its own legal principles to resolve property disputes relating to land under its riverbeds; a subsequently admitted State would be constrained by the equal-footing doctrine to apply the federal common-law rule, which may result in property law determinations antithetical to the desires of that State.  See Bonelli, 414 U. S., at 332-333 (STEWART, J., dissenting).

 Id., at 18 .  See United States v. Little Lake Misere Land Co., 412 U. S. 580, 591 (1973).  This principle applies to the banks and shores of water-ways, and we have consistently so held.  Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324 (1877), involved an ejectment action by the plaintiff against the city involving certain land along the banks of the Mississippi River.  After noting that the early state doctrines regarding the ownership of the soil of nontidal waters were based upon the then-discarded English view that nontidal waters were presumed nonnavigable, the Court clearly articulated the rule that the States could formulate, and modify, rules of riparian ownership as they saw fit: "Whether, as rules of property, it would now be safe to change these doctrines [arising out of the confusion of the original classification of nontidal waters as nonnavigable] where they have been applied, as before remarked, is for the several States themselves to determine.  If they choose to resign to the riparian proprietor rights which properly belong to them in their sovereign capacity, it is not for others to raise objections.  In our view of the subject the correct principles were laid down in Martin v. Waddell, 16 Pet. 367 , Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, <citedDecision>3 How. 212</citedDecision> , and Goodtitle v. Kibbe, 9 id. 471.  These cases related to tide-water, it is true; but they enunciate principles which are equally applicable to all navigable waters." Id., at 338.  In Shively v. Bowlby , the Court canvassed its previous decisions and emphasized that state law controls riparian ownership.  The Court concluded that grants by Congress of land bordering navigable waters "leave the question of the use of the shores by the owners of uplands to the sovereign control of each State, subject only to the rights *380 vested by the Constitution in the United States." 152 U. S., at 58 .  As the Court again emphasized in Packer v. Bird, 137 U. S. 661, 669 (1891): "[W]hatever incidents or rights attach to the ownership of property conveyed by the government will be determined by the States, subject to the condition that their rules do not impair the efficacy of the grants or the use and enjoyment of the property by the grantee."
**Combined Opinion**
 Here, however, we are not dealing with substantive property law as such, but rather with an issue substantially related to the constitutional sovereignty of the States.  In cases such as this, considerations of stare decisis play a less important role than they do in cases involving substantive property law. Cf. The Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283 , *382 470 (1849) (Taney, C. J., dissenting); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 405-411 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649 (1944).  Even if we were to focus on the effect of our decision upon rules of substantive property law, our concern for unsettling titles would lead us to overrule Bonelli, rather than to retain it.  See Minnesota Co. v. National Co., 3 Wall. 332, 334 (1866).  Since one system of resolution of property disputes has been adhered to from 1845 until 1973, and the other only for the past three years, a return to the former would more closely conform to the expectations of property owners than would adherence to the latter.  We are also persuaded that, in large part because of the positions taken in the briefs presented to the Court in Bonelli, the Bonelli decision was not a deliberate repudiation of all the cases which had gone before.  We there proceeded on the view, which we now think to have been mistaken, that Borax, supra, should be read so expansively as to in effect overrule sub silentio the line of cases following <citedDecision>Pollard's Lessee</citedDecision> .  For all of these reasons, we have now decided that Bonelli 's application of federal common law to cases such as this must be overruled.  The judgment under review is vacated, and the case remanded to the Supreme Court of Oregon for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN, dissenting.  I would not overrule Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 414 U. S. 313 (1973), and would therefore affirm the judgment of the Oregon Supreme Court. MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE WHITE joins, dissenting.  The Court today overrules a three-year-old decision, Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, 414 U. S. 313 (1973), in which *383 seven of the eight participating Justices joined.
**Combined Opinion**
 As merely a declaration of the States' pre-existing rights in the riverbeds, nothing in the Act in any way mandates, or even indicates, that federal common law should be used to resolve ownership of lands which, by the very terms of the Act, reside in the States.  We recognized as much in Bonelli, see 414 U. S., at 318 , and our references to the Act in Bonelli in no way indicate that it was the Act, rather than the scope of the equal-footing doctrine, which resulted in our application of federal common law: "Since the Act does not extend to the States any interest beyond those afforded by the equal-footing doctrine, the State can no more base its claim to lands unnecessary to a navigational purpose on the Submerged Lands Act than on that doctrine." Id., at 324-325.  [5]  The compact entered into when Alabama was admitted to the Union contained the following language: " `[A]ll navigable waters within the said state shall for ever remain public highways, free to the citizens of said state, and of the United States, without any tax, duty, impost, or toll therefor, imposed by the said state.'.  .  ." <citedDecision>3 How., at 229</citedDecision> .  The Court found that this language merely enunciated Congress' right to regulate commerce upon the navigable waters, similarly reserved to it with respect to the original States, and thus the language did not detract from the State's absolute title in the bed.  <citedDecision>Id., at 229-230</citedDecision> .  [6] Amici Utah and New Mexico also urge us to reconsider our decision in Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290 (1967).  They advance the same reasons for such reconsideration as they do with respect to Bonelli.  But Hughes was not cited by the Oregon courts below, and in Bonelli we expressly declined to rely upon it as a basis for our decision there, see 414 U. S., at 321 n. 11.  We therefore have no occasion to address the issue.  We are aware of the fact that Hughes gave to Borax the same sort of expansive construction as did Bonelli, but we are likewise aware that Hughes dealt with oceanfront property, a fact which the Court thought sufficiently different from the usual situation so as to justify a "federal common law" rule of riparian proprietorship: "The rule deals with waters that lap both the lands of the State and the boundaries of the international sea.  This relationship, at this particular point of the marginal sea, is too close to the vital interest of the Nation in its own boundaries to allow it to be governed by any law but the `supreme Law of the Land.'
**Combined Opinion**
 A sudden, or avulsive, change does not effect a shift in boundaries.  These doctrines form a coherent system.  It would make no sense to hold that the federal doctrine of accretion must be applied to the benefit of a federal riparian grantee but that the federal doctrine of avulsion need not be applied.  [8]  Cited ante, at 371, 372, 377.  [9]  Cited ante, at 380.  [10]  Cited ante, at 374, 379.  [11]  The language in Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan, <citedDecision>3 How. 212</citedDecision> (1845), on which the majority heavily relies to prove that Congress had no such power, see ante, at 372-374, was dismissed as dictum by the Shively Court. See 152 U. S., at 28 .  [12]  The majority also quotes the Shively Court's statement that federal grants " `leave the question of the use of the shores by the owners of uplands to the sovereign control of each State.' " Ante, at 379, quoting 152 U. S., at 58 .  It is clear from the context that by "shores" the Shively Court meant the land below the high-water mark.  The State, as owner of that land, controls it.  The Court did not suggest that the State was free to diminish the title of the upland owner by denying his right to an ambulatory boundary if the "shores" recede or the uplands grow.  [13]  The majority's assertion that the rule of New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 (1836), and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46 (1874), is merely a description of the English common law, ante, at 380-381, n. 8, is belied by the Shively Court's affirmation of the independence of the riparian holder's rights from the law governing the lands beneath the water.
