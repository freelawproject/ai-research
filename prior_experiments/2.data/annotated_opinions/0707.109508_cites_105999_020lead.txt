. actual exercise [of which] on occasion by the parties, is part and parcel of the system that the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts have recognized.” NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 488-489 (emphasis added). “[T]he legislative purpose may . . . dictate that certain activity 'neither protected nor prohibited’ be deemed privileged against state regulation.” Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181, 187 (1965). *142 II Insurance <targetCase>Agents, supra</targetCase>, involved a charge of a refusal by the union to bargain in good faith in violation of § 8 (b) (3) of the Act. The charge was based on union activities that occurred during good-faith bargaining over the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement. During the negotiations, the union directed concerted on-the-job activities by its members of a harassing nature designed to interfere with the conduct of the employer’s business, for the avowed purpose of putting economic pressure on the employer to accede to the union’s bargaining demands. The harassing activities, all peaceful, by the member insurance agents included refusal for a time to solicit new business, and refusal (after the writing of new business was resumed) to comply with the employer insurance company’s reporting procedures; refusal to participate in a company campaign to solicit new business; reporting late at district offices the days the agents were scheduled to attend them; refusing to perform customary duties at the office, instead engaging there in “sit-in-mornings,” “doing what comes naturally,” and leaving at noon as a group; absenting themselves from special business conferences arranged by the company; picketing and distributing leaflets outside the various offices of the company on specified days and hours as directed by the union; distributing leaflets each day to policyholders and others and soliciting policyholders’ signatures on petitions directed to the company; and presenting the signed policyholders’ petitions to the company at its home office while simultaneously engaging in mass demonstrations there. 361 U. S., at 480-481. We held that such tactics would not support a finding by the NLRB that the union had failed to bargain in good faith as required by § 8 (b) (3) and rejected the per se rule applied by the Board that use of “economically harassing activities” alone sufficed to prove a vio *143 lation of that section. The Court assumed “that the activities in question here were not 'protected’ under § 7 of the Act,” 361 U. S., at 483 n. 6, but held that the per se rule was beyond the authority of the NLRB to apply.

For the policy of the national Labor Management Relations Act is not to condemn all picketing but only that ascertained by its prescribed processes to fall within its prohibitions. Otherwise, it is implicit in the Act that the public interest is served by freedom of labor to use the weapon of picketing. For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act prohibits.” 346 U. S., at 499-500. 5 Moreover, San Diego Unions v. Garmon expressly recognized that “the Board may decide that an activity is neither protected nor prohibited, and thereby raise the *145 question whether such activity may be regulated by the States.” 359 U. S., at 245. 6 It is true, however, that many decisions fleshing out the concept of activities “protected” because Congress meant them to be “unrestricted by any governmental power to regulate,” Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 488, involved review of per se NLRB rules applied in the regulation of the bargaining process. E. g., NLRB v. American National Ins. Co., 343 U. S. 395 (1952); NLRB v. Insurance <targetCase>Agents, supra</targetCase>; NLRB v. Drivers Local Union, 362 U. S. 274 (1960); NLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S. 278 (1965); American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300 (1965); cf. NLRB v. Truck Drivers Union, 353 U. S. 87 (1957); H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S. 99 (1970); Florida Power & Light v. Electrical Workers, 417 U. S. 790, 805 n. 16 (1974). But the analysis of Garner and Insurance Agents came full bloom in the pre-emption area in Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 (1964), which held pre-empted the application *146 of state law to award damages for peaceful union secondary picketing. Although Morton involved conduct neither “protected nor prohibited” by § 7 or § 8 of the NLRA, we recognized the necessity of an inquiry whether “ ‘Congress occupied this field and closed it to state regulation.’ ” 377 U. S., at 258. Central to Morton’s analysis was the observation that “ [i] n selecting which forms of economic pressure should be prohibited . .

9 Although it did employ economic weapons putting pressure on the Union when it terminated the pre *149 vious agreement, supra, at 134, it apparently lacked sufficient economic strength to secure its bargaining demands under “the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy,” Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S., at 260. 10 But the economic weakness of the affected party cannot justify state aid contrary to federal law for, as we have developed, “the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is not a grudging exception [under] . . . the [federal] Act; it is part and parcel of the process of collective bargaining.” Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 495. The state action in this case is not filling “a regulatory void which Congress plainly assumed would not exist,” Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S., at 196 (Brennan, J., concurring). Rather, it is clear beyond question that Wisconsin “[entered] into the substantive aspects of the bargaining process to an extent Congress has not countenanced.” NLRB v. Insurance <targetCase>Agents, supra</targetCase>, at 498. Our decisions hold that Congress meant that these activities, whether of employer or employees, were not to be regulable by States any more than by the NLRB, for neither States nor the Board is “afforded flexibility in picking and choosing which economic devices of labor and management shall be branded as unlawful.” Ibid. Rather, both are without authority to attempt to “intro- *150 cluce some standard of properly ‘balanced’ bargaining power,” id., at 497 (footnote omitted), or to define “what economic sanctions might be permitted negotiating parties in an ‘ideal’ or ‘balanced’ state of collective bargaining.” Id., at 500. 11 To sanction state regulation of such economic pressure deemed by the federal Act “desir-abl[y] . . . left for the free play of contending economic forces, ... is not merely [to fill] a gap [by] outlawing] what federal law fails to outlaw; it is denying one party to an economic contest a weapon that Congress meant him to have available.” Lesnick, Preemption Reconsidered : The Apparent Reaffirmation of Garmon, 72 Col. L. Rev. 469, 478 (1972). 12 Accordingly, such regulation by *151 the State is impermissible because it “ 'stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.' ” Hill v. Florida, 325 U. S. 538, 542 (1945). IV There remains the question of the continuing vitality of Briggs-Stratton. San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S., at 245 n. 4, made clear that the Briggs-Stratton approach to pre-emption is “no longer of general application.” See also Insurance <targetCase>Agents, supra</targetCase>, at 493 n. 23. We hold today that the ruling of Briggs-Stratton, permitting state regulation of partial strike activities such as are involved in this case is likewise “no longer of general application.” 13 *152 Briggs-Stratton assumed “management . . . would be disabled from any kind of self-help to cope with these coercive tactics of the union” and could not “take any steps to resist or combat them without incurring the sanctions of the Act.” 336 U. S., at 264. But as Insurance Agents held, where the union activity complained of is “protected,” not because it is within § 7, but only because it is an activity Congress meant to leave unregulated, “the employer could have discharged or taken other appropriate disciplinary action against the employees participating.” 361 U. S., at 493. Moreover, even were the activity presented in the instant case “protected” activity within the meaning of § 7, 14 eco *153 nomic weapons were available to counter the Union's refusal to work overtime, e. g., a lockout, American Ship Bldg.

[T]he truth of the matter is that at the present statutory stage of our national labor relations policy, the two factors — -necessity for good-faith bargaining between parties, and the availability of economic pressure devices to each to make the other party incline to agree on one’s terms — exist side by side. . . . Doubtless one factor influences the other; there may be less need to apply economic pressure if the areas of controversy have been defined through discussion; and at the same time, negotiation positions are apt to be weak or strong in accordance with the degree of economic power the parties possess.” Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 488-489. In this case we need not and do not disturb the holding of Briggs-Stratton, later remarked in Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 494 n. 23, that § 13 of the NLRA, 29 U. S. C. § 163, which guarantees *151 a qualified right to strike, is not an independent limitation on state power apart from its context in the structure of the Act. Nor need we determine the vitality of the implication in Briggs-Stratton, also remarked in Insurance <targetCase>Agents, supra</targetCase>, at 494 n. 23, that § 501 (2) of the Taft-Hartley amendments to the NLRA, 29 TJ. S. C. §142(2), is not to be considered in connection with §13, but rather is only an aid to construction of § 8 (b)(4), 29 U. S. C. §158 (b)(4), of the NLRA. We do note, however, that in determining the sense of the entire structure of the federal law respecting the use of economic pressure and the economic weapons assumed by Congress to be available to the parties, it is not insignificant that § 501 (2) in defining the term “strike” refers to the use of “any concerted slow-down or other concerted interruption of operations by employees.” “It is hardly conceivable that such a word as ‘strike’ could have been defined in these statutes without congressional realization of the obvious scope of its application.” Insurance <targetCase>Agents, supra</targetCase>, at 511 n. 6 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.). To the extent, however, that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, was premised on the Court’s concern in that case with “evidence of considerable injury to property and intimidation of other employees by threats,” 336 U. S., at 253, that decision remains vital as an unexceptional instance of our consistent recognition of the power of the States to regulate conduct physically injuring or threatening injury to persons or property. See supra, at 136, and n. 2. The assumption, arguendo, in Insurance Agents that the union activities involved were “unprotected” by § 7 reflected the fact that those activities included some bearing at least a resemblance to the “sit-down” strike held unprotected in NLRB v. Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., 306 U. S. 240 (1939), and the "disloyal” activities held unprotected in NLRB v. Electrical Workers, 346 U. S. 464 (1953). See Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 492-494. The concerted refusal to work overtime presented in this case, however, is wholly free of such overtones. It may be that case-by-case adjudication by the federal Board will ultimately result in the conclusion that some partial strike activities such as the concerted ban on overtime in the instant case, when unaccompanied by other aspects of conduct such as those present in Insurance Agents or those in Briggs-Stratton (overtones of threats and violence, 336 U. S., at 250 n. 8, and a refusal to specify bargaining demands, id., at 249; see also Insurance <targetCase>Agents, supra</targetCase>, at 487, and n. 13), are “protected” activities within the meaning of § 7, although not so protected as to preclude the use of available countervailing economic weapons by the employer.
