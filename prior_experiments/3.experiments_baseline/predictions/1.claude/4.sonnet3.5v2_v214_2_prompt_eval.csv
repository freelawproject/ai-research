```

The passages extensively discuss United States v. Ross and its relationship to other Fourth Amendment cases. Rather than being overruled, Ross is consistently treated as controlling precedent and its principles are reaffirmed and extended. The Court uses Ross as the foundation for its ruling about automobile searches and container searches, indicating it remains valid law. Multiple passages cite Ross approvingly and build upon its reasoning rather than undermining or overruling it."

}
```

The key points supporting this conclusion are:

1. The Court explicitly states it is not deciding whether Fullilove's holding would survive under the new strict scrutiny standard.

2. While the Court questions aspects of Fullilove and changes the level of scrutiny to be applied, it does not take the step of explicitly overruling the case.

3. In contrast, the Court explicitly overrules Metro Broadcasting, showing that when the Court intends to overrule a case, it does so clearly and directly.

4. The dissenting opinions treat Fullilove as still valid precedent, though subject to a different standard of review.

Therefore, while Fullilove's reasoning is somewhat undermined, its core holding remains intact, making this a case of modification rather than overruling."

The key points supporting this conclusion:

1. While there is extensive criticism of Hans in dissenting opinions, dissents do not constitute overruling.

2. The majority opinion continues to treat Hans as valid precedent and builds upon it rather than overruling it.

3. The passages show disagreement about Hans's scope and reasoning, but disagreement alone does not constitute overruling.

4. There are no explicit statements from the majority overruling Hans - in fact, the majority appears to reinforce and expand Hans's principles.

5. The criticism of Hans appears primarily in dissenting opinions, which by definition do not represent the Court's official position or ruling."
