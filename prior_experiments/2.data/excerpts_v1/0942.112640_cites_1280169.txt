Rule 5:17(a)(1). By contrast, the notice of appeal is a document filed with the trial court that notifies that court and the Virginia Supreme Court, as well as the parties, that there will be an appeal; it is a purely ministerial document. Rule 5:9. The notice of the appeal must be filed within 30 *743 days of the final judgment of the trial court. Ibid. Coleman has cited no authority indicating that the Virginia Supreme Court has recognized an exception to the time requirement for filing a notice of appeal. Coleman cites also O’Brien v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., 207 Va. 707, 152 S. E. 2d 278 (1967). In that case, O’Brien, a civil litigant making a constitutional property rights claim, filed her notice of appeal several years late. She relied on three recent Virginia Supreme Court cases for the proposition that the court would waive the time requirement for notice of appeal where constitutional rights were at stake. See Cabaniss, supra; Thacker, supra; Stokes, supra. As noted, those were state habeas eases in which the Virginia Supreme Court determined that the petitioner had been denied direct appeal because of a constitutional error in failure to appoint counsel. In O’Brien, the Virginia Supreme Court. expressly reserved the “question whether the precedent of the Cabaniss, Thacker and Stokes cases should be followed in cases involving denial of constitutional property rights.” 207 Va., at 715, 152 S. E. 2d, at 284. The court then addressed O’Brien’s constitutional claim on the merits and ruled against her. As a result, there was no need to decide if she should be allowed an exception to the “mandatory” time requirement, id., at 709, 152 S. E. 2d, at 280, and her appeal was dismissed as untimely. Coleman argues that O’Brien demonstrates that the Virginia Supreme Court will review the merits of constitutional claims before deciding whether to dismiss an appeal as untimely. The court in O’Brien did conduct such a review, but the court also explicitly declined to announce a rule that there is a constitutional exception to the time requirement for filing a notice of appeal. There is no evidence other than O’Brien that the Virginia Supreme Court has ever conducted such a review, and O’Brien explicitly declined to announce such a *744 practice. We decline Coleman’s invitation to announce such a practice for that court. Finally, Coleman argues that the Virginia Supreme Court’s dismissal order in this case is at least ambiguous because it was issued “[u]pon consideration” of all the filed papers, including Coleman’s petition for appeal and the Commonwealth’s brief in opposition, both of which discussed the merits of Coleman’s federal claims. There is no doubt that the Virginia Supreme Court’s “consideration” of all filed papers adds some ambiguity, but we simply cannot read it as overriding the court’s explicit grant of a dismissal motion based solely on procedural grounds. Those grounds are independent of federal law. Coleman contends also that the procedural bar was not adequate to support the judgment. Coleman did not petition for certiorari on this question, and we therefore accept the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the bar was adequate.
