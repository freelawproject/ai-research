As more particularly described in the Statement of Claims \\nsection of this Complaint, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \\n(hereafter referred to as \\\"the Commission\\\") alleges that David Thompson, an African American, \\nwas unlawfully discharged by the Defendant in retaliation for having filed a charge of \\nemployment discrimination based on his race with the Commission. \\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \\n1.  Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 451, 1331, 1337, \\n1343 and 1345.  This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Section 706(f)(l) and (3)  of \\n\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 2 of 7 \\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) and (3) (\\\"Title \\nVll\\\") and Section 102 oftbe Civil Rights Act of 1991,42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 198la. \\n2.  The employment practice alleged to be unlawful in this Complaint was committed \\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for Western District of Louisiana, \\nShreveport Division. \\nPARTIES \\n3.  Plaintiff, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \\\"Commission\\\"), is \\nthe agency of the United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and \\nenforcement of Title VII, and is expressly authorized to bring this action by Section 706(f)(l) and \\n(3) ofTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) and (3). \\n4.  At all relevant times, the Defendant, Tasa, Inc. d/b/a Orr Minden Country \\nChevrolet (the \\\"Employer. ), has continuously been a Louisiana corporation doing business in the \\nState of Louisiana and the City of Minden, and has continuously had at least 15 employees. \\n5.  At all relevant times, Defendant Employer has continuously been an employer \\nengaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of Sections 701(b) , (g) and (h) of \\nTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e(b), (g) and (h). \\nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \\n6.  More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, David Thompson \\nfiled a charge with the Commission alleging vioiations ofTitle VII by Defendant Employer.  All \\nconditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled. \\n2 \\n\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 3 of 7 \\n.. \\n7.  Since at least 2003, Defendant Employer engaged in an unlawful employment \\nOrr \\npractice at its automobile dealership known as  Minden Country Chevrolet in Minden, \\nLouisiana, in violation of Section 704 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-3. On October 17, 2003, \\nDefendant Employer discharged David Thompson as a result of a charge of employment \\ndiscrimination based on race that he filed against the Defendant Employer with the Commission. \\nThe Defendant Employer's owner Larry Coker, while aware of David Thompson's Commission \\ncharge filing, personally discharged Mr. Thompson purportedly for performance, attendance \\nand/or attitude issues.  At the time of his discharge, Mr. Thompson had not received any \\nemployment-related discipline or warnings by the Defendant Employer. The Defendant \\nEmployer's discharge of David Thompson was motivated by the retaliatory animus of its owner \\nLarry Coker. \\n8.  The effect of the unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 \\nabove has been to deprive David Thompson of equal employment opportunities and to otherwise \\nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of discriminatory retaliation. \\n9.  The unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 above was \\nintentional. \\n10.  The unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 above was done \\nwith malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of David Thompson. \\n3 \\n\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 4 of 7 \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court:. \\nA.  Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant Employer, its officers, \\nsuccessors, assigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in \\ndiscriminatory retaliation. \\nB.  Order Defendant Employer to institute and carry out policies, practices, and \\nprograms which protect its employees from discriminatory retaliation, and which eradicate the \\neffects of its past unlawful employment practice. \\nC.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\nappropriate backpay with prejudgment interest, in amounts to be detennined at trial, and other \\naffirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effeCts of its unlawful employment practice, \\nincluding but not limited to appropriate frontpay. \\nD.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\ncompensation for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful employment \\npractice described in paragraph 7 above, including job-search expenses and medical-related \\nexpenses, in amounts to be determined at trial. \\nE.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\ncompensation for past and future nonpecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful practice \\ncomplained of in paragraph 7 above, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss of \\nenjoyment of life, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at trial. \\n4 \\n\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 5 of 7 \\n.. \\nF.  Order Defendant Employer to pay David Thompson punitive damages for its \\nmalicious and reckless conduct described in paragraph 7 above, in amounts to be determined at \\ntrial. \\nG.  Grant such further relief as the Court deems necessary and proper in the public \\ninterest. \\nH.  Award the Commission its costs ofthis action. \\nJURY TRIAL DEMAND \\nThe Commission requests a jury trial on all questions of fact raised by its complaint. \\nERIC S.

Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, inmates at the North Dakota State Penitentiary  appeal from summary\\n1181 judgment *1181 granted in favor of defendants. The decision of the district court is affirmed in part and reversed\\nin part for the reasons stated below.\\nJensen and Hagle initiated this pro se action under section 1983 against Edward J. Klecker, Director of the North\\nDakota Department of Institutions and various other prison officials. Originally, five separate actions were filed but\\nthese were later consolidated into one comprehensive complaint. That complaint alleges that Hagle's and\\nJensen's civil rights were violated in the following ways:\\n(1) that prison officials regularly open all of plaintiff Jensen's incoming nonlegal mail without his consent and,\\nfurther, that all prisoners are required to deliver all outgoing mail to the prison mail box so that it may be\\ninspected prior to sealing;\\n(2) that inmates are routinely required to deliver all outgoing legal mail to a prison official who inspects it in the\\npresence of the inmate then orders the inmate to seal it and then initials it;\\n(3) that from April, 1976, to February, 1980, prison officials, on nine different occasions, willfully and deliberately\\nopened clearly marked legal mail addressed to Jensen and that the practice is a continuing one;\\n(4) that prison policy permits prison officials to deduct money from inmate financial accounts without vouchers\\nsigned by individual inmates to show accountability;\\n(5) that on or about December 22, 1978, a package of food mailed to Jensen by his brother was intercepted by\\nprison officials and returned, via mail, to the sender;\\n(6) that both Jensen and Hagle were deprived of property without due process in that prison officials refused to\\nredeem certain inmate scrip held by them; and\\n(7) that prison officials are currently in possession of certain items and funds belonging to the Wallstreet Jaycees,\\nan inmate organization that was suspended from operation by prison officials and prison officials have not\\nreturned the property nor made an accounting to members of that organization remaining in the inmate\\npopulation.\\n\\nAfter reviewing exhibits and affidavits submitted by the parties the district court granted defendant's motion for\\n[2]\\nsummary judgment  from which plaintiffs Jensen and Hagle appeal.\\nPlaintiffs challenge the district court's decision to grant summary judgment on two grounds:\\n(1) that they received no notice of the court's intention to rule on the request for summary judgment; and\\n(2) that summary judgment was improperly granted in that there exist genuine issues of fact and that defendants\\n[3]\\nwere not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\nI. Notice.\\nPlaintiff's contention that they were not given notice in accord with Jensen v. Klecker, 599 F.2d 243 (8th Cir. 1979)\\nis without merit. Jensen v. Klecker involved an earlier dismissal of this case by the district court through granting\\nof a motion to dismiss. This court held that where the trial court considered affidavits outside of the pleadings in\\n1182 ruling on the motion plaintiffs were entitled to notice that the motion to dismiss had been converted to one for \\n*1182 summary judgment as well as an opportunity to file opposing materials. Jensen v. Klecker is inapplicable\\nhere since the court in this case ruled upon defendant's motion for summary judgment. Not only did plaintiffs\\nreceive notice through the filing of the motion itself but had ample opportunity to file materials in opposition to it\\nas evidenced by their motion and brief filed in response.\\nII. Summary Judgment.\\nSummary judgment is granted only where the record clearly demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact\\nexists and that the movant is entitled, as a matter of law, to judgment in his favor. Glover v. National Broadcasting\\nCo., Inc., 594 F.2d 715, 717 (8th Cir. 1979). It should not be entered unless the movant has established his right\\nto judgment \\\"with such clarity as to leave no room for controversy and that the other party is not entitled to\\nrecover under any discernible circumstances.\\\" Robert Johnson Co. v. Chemical Interchange Co., 541 F.2d 207,\\n209 (8th Cir. 1976). It is, however, up to the party opposing the motion to set forth specific facts showing a\\ngenuine issue for trial. Glover v. National Broadcasting Co., 594 F.2d at 717.\\nA. Inspection of Inmate Mail.\\n1. Non-privileged mail.\\nPlaintiffs contend that the routine inspection of incoming and outgoing nonlegal mail constitutes a violation of their\\ncivil rights. Defendants concede that all nonlegal mail, both incoming and outgoing, is routinely inspected for\\ncontraband. In Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) the Supreme Court set\\ndown guidelines for determining when the censorships of inmate mail was proper. In doing so the court stated:\\n[T]he legitimate governmental interest in the order and security of penal institutions justifies the\\nimposition of certain restraints on inmate correspondence.... [I]t is not our purpose to survey the\\nrange of circumstances in which particular restrictions on prisoner mail might be warranted by the\\nlegitimate demands of prison administration as they exist from time to time in the various kinds of\\npenal institutions found in this country.\\nProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. at 412-13, 94 S.Ct. at 1810-11.\\nThe Supreme Court implicitly approved the opening of non-privileged mail to inspect for contraband in Wolff v.\\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), decided shortly after Martinez. There the Court\\npointed out \\\"freedom from censorship is not equivalent to freedom from inspection or perusal.\\\" Id. at 576, 94\\nS.Ct. at 2984. Non-privileged inmate mail is clearly not immune to inspection, thus such inspections cannot give\\n\\nrise to civil rights violations. Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F.2d 748 (5th Cir. 1978); Laaman v. Helgemoe, 437 F.Supp.\\n269 (D.N.H.1977); Stover v. Carlson, 413 F.Supp. 718 (D.Conn.1976); United States Ex Rel. Dean v. Johnson,\\n381 F.Supp. 495 (E.D.Pa.1974). It seems clear under these cases that the mere inspection of nonlegal incoming\\nand outgoing mail poses no threat to plaintiffs' civil rights. Summary judgment on this point was proper.\\n2. Privileged mail.\\nPrivileged prisoner mail, that is mail to or from an inmate's attorney and identified as such, may not be opened for\\ninspections for contraband except in the presence of the prisoner. Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 576-77, 94\\nS.Ct. 2963, 2984-85, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Many of the exhibits introduced by plaintiffs as examples of legal\\nmail simply do not appear to come within the parameters of the attorney-client mail privilege. See Wolff v.\\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. at 576, 94 S.Ct. at 2984. For example, a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union\\naddressed to President, Wallstreet Jaycees, and bearing no other markings, obviously does not fall within the\\nscope of that privilege. Wolff requires that all such mail be specially marked as originating from an attorney, with\\n1183 that attorneys *1183 name and address.[4] However, one exhibit, a copy of a letter from the National Prison\\nProject, bearing the name of an attorney and which was stamped \\\"Lawyer Client Mail 00 Do Not Open Except In\\n97\\nPresence of Prisoner\\\" and which was addressed to plaintiff Jensen appears to come well within the definition of\\nattorney-client mail. This would tend to rebut defendants' claim that the mail opened was not clearly marked.\\nCoupled with plaintiffs' assertions that the opening of such mail was done deliberately and on a continuing basis,\\nand contrasted with the defendants' vague claim that in the case of clearly marked mail some mistakes were\\nmade, this indicates that some factual issues remain to be resolved on this point. Accordingly, summary judgment\\nis vacated as to this issue and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\\nB. Interception of food parcel.\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that a food package sent by his brother was not given to him but was returned, via\\nmail, to sender by prison officials. Defendants do not deny plaintiffs allegations. Affidavits and exhibits indicate\\nthat inmates were informed approximately six weeks prior to arrival of package that no more food parcels would\\nbe allowed. Institutions may impose restrictions on the receipt of packages from outside the penitentiaries. Bell v.\\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 555, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1882, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F.2d 748 (5th\\nCir. 1978). The district court properly granted summary judgment on this issue.\\nC. Deductions from inmate accounts.\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that deducting postage costs above the two free letters per week allowed each\\nprisoner without a signed voucher to show accountability by prison officials deprives him of his property without\\ndue process. The deprivation of property without due process is cognizable under section 1983. Lynch v.\\nHousehold Finance, 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972). However, it appears that no basis for\\nrecovery exists in this case. Both parties concede that the deductions made from the inmates account are done\\nso in accordance with prison regulations. Exhibits indicate that a log was kept indicating the amount deducted,\\nthe date and the destination of each letter or parcel mailed and that inmates are regularly furnished with monthly\\nstatements of their account and may obtain copies of the postal log on request.\\nInmates have no established right to be provided with unlimited free access to the mails. See Tate v. Kassulke,\\n409 F.Supp. 651 (W.D.Ken.1975). It is important to note that this issue does not involve a forfeiture of property or\\na penalty. Rather, it is in the nature of an assessment for value received. Plaintiffs do not contend that they did\\nnot receive the services for which they are charged. Nor do they cite any precedent relating to accountability\\nrequirements as they pertain to inmate accounts. Clearly, as the warden indicates in his affidavit, requiring a\\nsigned voucher for each postage charge incurred by each inmate would be unfeasible. Not only are there no\\nfactual issues remaining to be resolved but there appears no basis for a claim under section 1983. While plaintiffs\\nobviously have a property interest in the funds on deposit in their inmate accounts, they have failed to show that\\n\\nthey were unlawfully deprived of their property or that they have been deprived of their property without due\\nprocess. Summary judgment in favor of defendants on this issue was proper.\\nD. Matters pertaining to the Wallstreet Jaycees.\\n1184 The two remaining claims of plaintiffs deal with matters relating to the Wallstreet *1184 Jaycees. The Wallstreet\\nJaycees was an inmate organization which, as part of its fundraising activities, was permitted to operate the\\ninmate commissary concession stand. To purchase items from the concession stand inmates were permitted to\\npurchase Jaycee scrip since inmates are not permitted to have currency in their possession. Each book of scrip\\nissued bears the prisoner's name, identification number and date of issue. Each ticket is stamped with the\\nprisoner's penitentiary identification number. Tickets are non-negotiable if detached from the ticket book and the\\nscrip is non-transferable. All legitimate transfers of scrip were logged at the time of purchase at the concession\\nstand. The Wallstreet Jaycees were suspended from operation by the prison administration for activities in\\nviolation of prison regulations, e. g., depletion of funds. The organization's charter was subsequently revoked by\\nthe state and local Jaycee organizations. Affidavits introduced by defendants indicate that a new Jaycee\\norganization is in the process of being formed.\\n1. Unauthorized scrip.\\nThis claim arose when prison officials determined that all unused, authorized scrip held by inmates would be\\nredeemed. The term \\\"authorized\\\" refers to scrip bearing the identification number of inmate holding it. Plaintiffs\\ndemand to be reimbursed for all scrip held by them. They do not contend that it is authorized. Instead, they\\nmaintain that, apparently by virtue of possession, they are entitled to redemption. Refusal to redeem the scrip,\\naccording to plaintiffs, amounts to a deprivation of property without due process. In Sell v. Parratt, 548 F.2d 753\\n(8th Cir. 1977),cert. denied,434 U.S. 873, 98 S.Ct. 220, 54 L.Ed.2d 152, this court found a cognizable claim\\nunder section 1983 where money held by inmates in violation of prison regulations was confiscated and\\ndeposited in the Inmate's Welfare Fund. We found that while the regulations prohibited inmates from possessing\\ncurrency, they did not authorize the forfeiture of currency illegally possessed and upheld the district court order\\nrequiring the money credited to the account of the incarcerated plaintiff. This case differs in that here plaintiffs\\nassert a property right in the redemption of unauthorized scrip which is by prison regulation void if held by anyone\\nother than the inmate to which the scrip was issued. It appears that plaintiffs failed to show a valid property right,\\nmuch less a deprivation. Holder v. Claar, 459 F.Supp. 850, 852 (D.Colo.1978). The district court was correct in\\ngranting summary judgment.\\n2. Finally, plaintiffs theorize a violation of their civil rights in that prison officials at the time of the administrative\\nsuspension of the Wallstreet Jaycees confiscated concession stand equipment belonging to the organization and\\nthe organization's treasury. Plaintiffs seek an accounting. Defendants in their motion for summary judgment\\nassert that prior to bringing this action plaintiffs failed to request a formal accounting, but that in any event one\\nhas since been provided through interrogatories. Affidavits and exhibits submitted by defendants show that\\n$765.82 is on deposit in the Wallstreet Jaycee savings account in the Bank of North Dakota and $86.27 in a\\nbusiness account at the North Dakota State Penitentiary and that the concession equipment is in storage at the\\npenitentiary. Defendants maintain and introduce supporting affidavits to show that the charter of the Wallstreet\\nJaycees has been terminated by both the state and national organizations and that a new Jaycee organization is\\nbeing formed. Defendants state that once a new Jaycee organization has been formed all assets of the now\\ndefunct Wallstreet Jaycees will be transferred to the new organization. It is difficult to see how plaintiffs have\\nbeen harmed. There appears to be no actual deprivation of property here and in any event it would seem that\\nplaintiffs have already gotten the accounting they requested. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on\\nthis issue.\\nAccordingly, summary judgment with regard to the issue of attorney-client mail is hereby vacated and the issue\\n1185 remanded for further proceedings.

Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, pro se.\\nRobert P. Brady, Asst. Atty. Gen., Bismarck, N. D., on brief, for appellees.\\nBefore LAY, ROSS and HENLEY, Circuit Judges.\\nPER CURIAM.\\nHerbert O. Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, inmates of the North Dakota State Penitentiary, sued North Dakota state\\nofficials, including the Director of Institutions, the penitentiary warden and the penitentiary accountant, for\\ndamages and declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983. Their complaint was dismissed pursuant\\nto Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court considered\\nand relied upon matters outside the pleadings without treating the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary\\njudgment and without giving Jensen and Hagle notice of its intent to do so, as he was required to do by\\nFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) and 56(c). We therefore reverse and remand.\\nJensen and Hagle alleged that certain prison officials allowed inmates to form the Wallstreet Jaycees, a group\\noperating a concession stand in the penitentiary at which prison scrip was the medium of exchange. Funds in the\\ninmates' personal financial accounts were exchanged for scrip through the penitentiary business office on a dollar\\nfor dollar basis. When discharged, inmates received up to $25 reimbursement for unused scrip.\\nThe complaint alleged that in August 1977 prison officials suspended the Jaycee chapter, closed the stand and\\ncollected all unused scrip, providing inmates with receipts. Thereafter, the general membership of the Jaycee\\nchapter voted that funds in the business office Jaycee account be transferred in appropriate amounts to the\\nindividual accounts of all inmates who held receipts. Jensen held a receipt for $6.45 and Hagle held receipts\\ntotaling $142.25. They allege that they have not been reimbursed, and claim that defendants' refusal to transfer\\nfunds to their accounts violates the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.\\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, with a supporting brief and affidavit.\\nThey asserted they were not the real parties in interest and that no constitutionally protected right had been\\ninfringed by the actions alleged. The district court granted the motion. The court stated that it had considered\\ndefendants' motion to dismiss, the pleadings and defendants' affidavit and brief. Facts not alleged in the\\ncomplaint, but set forth in the affidavit of prison warden Havener were recited and relied upon in the court's\\n245 opinion.[1] The court held that the dispute was between plaintiffs and a group of other inmates, the Wallstreet \\n*245 Jaycees, and not with the prison officials. The court also held that plaintiffs' allegation that scrip had not\\nbeen redeemed did not state a claim of constitutional dimensions.\\nWhen the district court considered defendants' affidavit in deciding the motion to dismiss, it was required to treat\\nthe motion as one for summary judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b); Carter v. Stanton, 405 U.S. 669, 671, 92 S.Ct.\\n1232, 31 L.Ed.2d 569 (1972); Goodman v. Parwatikar, 570 F.2d 801, 803 (8th Cir. 1978); Ailshire v. Darnell, 508\\n\\nF.2d 526, 527 (8th Cir. 1974). However, there is no indication in the record that the court notified Jensen and\\nHagle of its intent or that it gave them an opportunity to file opposing materials, as is required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56\\n(c). We require strict compliance with the provisions of Rule 56, Ailshire v. Darnell, supra, 508 F.2d at 528, and\\nwe have held that notice may not be omitted even when more than 10 days have elapsed between filing of the\\nmotion and dismissal. See Winfrey v. Brewer, 570 F.2d 761, 764 (8th Cir. 1978).\\nAlthough Jensen and Hagle submitted exhibits and affidavits with their pro se trial brief, they did so a month\\nbefore defendants' motion to dismiss and supporting affidavit were filed. There is no indication they received\\nnotice that the warden's affidavit would be considered and the motion to dismiss thereby converted to one for\\nsummary judgment, so that failure to file an opposing affidavit could result in an adverse judgment.\\nDefendants argue that the district court's failure to comply with the Rule 56(c) notice requirement was not\\nprejudicial, because Jensen and Hagle were notified by a local rule to submit briefs in opposition to the motion\\nwithin 10 days. However, Rules 12(b) and 56(c) contemplate an opportunity to file more than briefs. A pro se brief\\nwas held not to constitute \\\"the type of meaningful opposition contemplated by Rule 56\\\" in Winfrey v. Brewer,\\nsupra, 570 F.2d at 764. Plaintiffs' attempt to refute the affidavit by \\\"exhibits,\\\" materials not presented to the trial\\ncourt but filed on appeal, indicates that they might well have taken advantage of a meaningful opportunity to\\noppose the affidavit.\\nWhen the complaint is given the liberal construction ordinarily accorded pro se civil rights complaints, we are not\\nconvinced to a certainty that Jensen and Hagle would not be entitled to relief under any state of facts which they\\ncould prove in support of their claim.

Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).\\nClaims of intentional deprivation of a prisoner's property under color of state law are actionable under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\n1983.

We suggest to the district court that it consider\\nappointing counsel to assist the plaintiffs in this case.\\n[1] These facts were: The stand was closed for good and sufficient reasons.

Jensen appeals from the district court's  denial of his motion for relief from judgment under\\nFed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).\\nThis action was brought by Jensen against various state authorities alleging that legal mail was being opened\\nand not delivered to him at the North Dakota state prison. To \\\"protect his rights,\\\" he filed liens on the personal\\nand real property of all the defendants with the Registrars of Deeds in several North Dakota counties.\\nIn response, the defendants filed a \\\"Motion For An Order to Give Notice of All Liens Filed and to Remove All\\nLiens Filed\\\" with the district court. The \\\"motion\\\" also requested the court to assess damages. The district court\\nordered Jensen to give the defendants a list of all the liens he had filed and to file releases of all the liens with the\\nappropriate county officers, and prohibited Jensen from filing further liens without court approval. Jensen\\ncomplied with this order and the defendants repeated their \\\"motion\\\" for damages. On February 3, 1982 the\\ndistrict court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the mail issue, and denied the defendants'\\nmotion for damages.\\nOn July 15, 1982 the district court sua sponte amended its order dismissing the damages claim by adding the\\nphrase \\\"for lack of jurisdiction.\\\" Formal notice was not given to the defendants or to Jensen prior to entry of the\\norder. Jensen claims that he did not receive a copy of the order after entry. While the district court file does not\\nindicate that a copy was sent to him, it does show that a copy was sent to his attorney of record. Jensen,\\nhowever, claims that he did not receive a copy of the order until September 7, when he was given a copy in\\nconnection with another lawsuit. On September 10 he filed a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) requesting the\\ndistrict court to reconsider the amended judgment on the grounds that (1) he never received notice of the\\namended judgment, and (2) the district court had jurisdiction over the damages claim. The district court denied\\nthe motion, and Jensen appealed.\\nThe standard of review for denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is whether the district court abused its discretion. \\nBrowder v. Director, 434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 560 n. 7, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); Knox v. Lichtenstein,\\n654 F.2d 19, 21 (8th Cir.1981). Further, this court cannot use review of a 60(b) motion to review an underlying\\ndecision which was not appealed. E.g., Clark v. Wyrick, 538 F.2d 1327 (8th Cir.1976),cert. denied, 429 U.S.\\n1062, 97 S.Ct. 788, 50 L.Ed.2d 778 (1977). Thus, the district court's order amending the judgment, even if\\n[2]\\nquestionable,  is not reviewable. Only the denial of Jensen's motion may be considered.\\n\\nJensen should have challenged the order by a timely Rule 52(b) motion seeking further amendment or by a\\ntimely appeal. The time limits for these actions had passed by the time Jensen filed his Rule 60(b) motion with\\nthe court. If no notice of the amending order had been served or received, perhaps relief might be merited. See \\nCoclin Tobacco Co. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 353 F.2d 727, 728 (2d Cir.1965). However, the record\\nshows Jensen's attorney received a copy of the order. See Bennett v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 396 F.2d 909,\\n911 (9th Cir.1968). There is no reason to consider under Rule 60(b) a motion which could have been made under\\nanother rule if the litigant had acted in a timely manner. See Lester v. Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 653 F.2d\\n353 (8th Cir.1981).\\nBecause we find no abuse of discretion, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\\n[1] The Honorable Bruce M.

Jobs in the bakery and deli departments fall into one classification, jobs in the produce\\ndepartment another. Two facts give rise to this litigation: pay in the produce department is higher, and workers\\nare not distributed uniformly by sex. Most bakery and deli workers are women, while most produce workers are\\nmen. Plaintiffs, a class of women who work in the deli and bakery departments, contend that the difference\\nviolates both the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 206(d), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Kohl's replies\\nthat plaintiffs are short-sighted: employees in the produce department are included within a pay category called\\n\\\"regular clerks,\\\" most of whom are female. That most regular clerks in the produce department are men does not\\nundercut the fact that most regular clerks store-wide are women, Kohl's insists. The employer adds that women\\nwho want to be regular clerks in or out of the produce department do not face any discrimination in hiring or\\ntransfer. None of the class representatives applied for transfer to the produce department or another regular-clerk\\nposition; instead they want higher pay for their existing work. The ratio of wages between \\\"department clerks\\\"\\n(the jobs plaintiffs occupy) and \\\"regular clerks,\\\" Kohl's insists, is a subject for collective bargaining rather than for\\nlitigation.\\nAfter allowing the parties to conduct extensive discovery, the district court granted summary judgment for Kohl's\\non the Title VII claim. The judge exhaustively analyzed the duties of bakery, deli, and produce workers and\\nconcluded that plaintiffs could not demonstrate that Kohl's explanation for placing produce positions in the\\n\\\"regular clerk\\\" classification was a pretext for sex discrimination. (The class includes supervisors and argues that\\nbakery and deli managers do the same work as produce managers. Because the supervisors' arguments track\\nthose of the clerks, we use \\\"clerks\\\" as a generic term to simplify exposition.) Kohl's insisted that produce workers\\nexercise greater discretion in displaying and culling produce and that produce jobs also are physically harder\\nthan bakery or deli jobs. The district judge concluded: \\\"Plaintiffs have produced no persuasive evidence\\nsuggesting that defendants did not honestly believe this justification or that it is a cover for discrimination.\\\"\\nHonest belief is not enough under the Equal Pay Act, however, because that statute (unlike Title VII) does not\\nrequire intent to discriminate. Section 206(d)(1) provides:\\nNo employer.. shall discriminate.. between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to\\nemployees.. at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite\\nsex for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and\\nresponsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such\\npayment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which\\n\\nmeasures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other\\nfactor other than sex[.]\\nThe district judge concluded that two questions under this statute could be resolved only by trial: whether the\\npositions in question are \\\"jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which\\nare performed under similar working conditions\\\" and, if so, whether the pay differential nonetheless is \\\"based on\\nany other factor other than sex\\\". A trial culminated in a special verdict that answered the equal-work question in\\nthe negative; the jury then did not address the \\\"factor other than sex\\\" defense.\\nA substantial portion of plaintiffs' appellate brief is devoted to contending that the district judge should not have\\n923 granted summary judgment on the Title *923 VII theory. Yet it is hard to see how this can matter, given the jury's\\nverdict on the Equal Pay Act theory. If (as the jury determined) the bakery, deli, and produce jobs are not\\nsubstantially equal, then plaintiffs can't show sex discrimination. Title VII does not require equal wages for\\ncomparable work, see American Nurses' Association v. Illinois, 783 F.2d 716 (7th Cir. 1986), or even for identical\\nwork. Identical jobs with different wages do not violate Title VII, provided that all employees may freely select\\nwhich job to perform. Plaintiffs' Title VII claim thus is untenable00no matter the validity of the jury's special verdict,\\n97\\nwhich we address below00 unless Kohl's discriminated when hiring for the different classifications.\\n97\\nPlaintiffs make much of evidence that until the late 1960s Kohl's not only discouraged women from applying for\\ncertain positions but also had sex-segregated wage classifications. This practice is long gone, and no vestige of\\nthe discrimination survives. Wage schedules were merged 31 years ago, and, unlike the situation in Bazemore v.\\nFriday, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986), women hired during the discriminatory period today\\nreceive the same wages as men hired at the same time. What remains is the possibility that Kohl's steered\\napplicants by sex or selectively offered them transfer opportunities. Loyd v. Phillips Brothers, Inc., 25 F.3d 518,\\n524-25 (7th Cir. 1994). Neither the plaintiffs' charge of discrimination filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity\\nCommission nor their arguments to the district court contended that Kohl's today steers women to bakery and\\ndeli jobs, or did so at any time within the period of limitations. Plaintiffs disavow a steering claim but contend that\\nKohl's history is informative on the wage-discrimination claim. The district judge did not see how; neither do we.\\nClaims under the Equal Pay Act differ from comparable-worth arguments because proof that the two jobs are of\\nthe same (or comparable) value to the employer or society as a whole, or depend on similar effort or education,\\ngets the plaintiff nowhere. To succeed under the Equal Pay Act the plaintiff must establish that the positions entail\\nsubstantially equal tasks, performed under similar conditions. (The Act just says \\\"equal,\\\" but it is common ground\\nthat \\\"equal\\\" does not mean \\\"identical\\\"; otherwise the employer could defeat an Equal Pay Act suit by adding an\\ninconsequential and pointless chore to one of the jobs. Opinions commonly use the formula \\\"substantially equal\\\"\\nto express the idea that trivial differences do not matter. See Fallon v. Illinois, 882 F.2d 1206, 1208 (7th Cir. 1989)\\n; Epstein v. Secretary of the Treasury, 739 F.2d 274, 277 (7th Cir. 1984). We follow that convention.) Kohl's\\nprovided the jury with plenty of evidence that tasks in the produce department differ substantially from those\\nperformed by bakery and deli workers. Produce workers do more heavy lifting and must exercise judgment about\\n(for example) which fruit is ripe, which should be marked down, and how the produce should be displayed to\\nmaximize sales. Bakery and deli workers, by contrast, stock displays according to more mechanical\\nspecifications and use printed expiration dates rather than judgment to determine when inventory should be\\nrotated or removed. Although a rational jury might have disbelieved this evidence or concluded that the\\ndifferences are too slight to matter, and thus returned a verdict in plaintiffs' favor, a verdict for Kohl's is\\ninvulnerable unless spoiled by trial error.\\nPlaintiffs contend that the exclusion of their expert witness is such an error. Howard Risher, a self-employed\\nconsultant with a Ph.D. in labor relations and economics, who teaches an undergraduate course on human\\nresources as an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania, prepared a report reaching conclusions\\nfavorable to plaintiffs. Stripped of self-congratulatory dross, this report is three pages long and consists of a list of\\n924 clerks' duties and an unreasoned *924 assertion that all three departments' positions are \\\"virtually identical in\\nterms of their basic function and are substantially equal in terms of skill, effort, responsibility and working\\nconditions.\\\" The only support for this conclusion, however, is the list, with entries such as \\\"[p]reparing products\\nfor display\\\" and \\\"[m]aintaining equipment\\\". Risher did not analyze what the clerks do to achieve these objectives,\\nand the district court concluded that a list plus a bald assertion would not assist the trier of fact. Fed.R.Evid. 702.\\n\\nRisher's deposition was as skeletal as his report; asked how employees at Kohl's carry out their duties, Risher\\nreplied only with variants on \\\"I couldn't tell you\\\" and \\\"I have no idea\\\". Apparently Risher thinks that job\\ndescriptions trump actual tasks, a sorry misunderstanding of the Equal Pay Act. See Soto v. Adams Elevator\\nEquipment Co., 941 F.2d 543, 548 (7th Cir. 1991); Fallon, 882 F.2d at 1208. The district judge's decision to\\nprevent Risher from testifying, far from being an abuse of discretion, see General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S.\\n136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997), was absolutely correct. Many times we have emphasized that\\nexperts' work is admissible only to the extent it is reasoned, uses the methods of the discipline, and is founded on\\ndata. Talking off the cuff00 deploying neither data nor analysis00is not an acceptable methodology. See, e.g., \\n97 97\\nMcMahon v. Bunn-O-Matic Corp., 150 F.3d 651, 657-58 (7th Cir. 1998); Mid-State Fertilizer Co. v. Exchange\\nNational Bank, 877 F.2d 1333, 1339 (7th Cir. 1989).\\nRisher also prepared a supplemental report, based on his discussion with eight bakery or deli workers in a \\\"focus\\ngroup.\\\" This report did little more than parrot these women's belief that bakery and deli duties require as much\\nskill as produce duties. Relaying the plaintiffs' likely testimony is not an example of expertise. Huey v. United\\nParcel Service, Inc., 165 F.3d 1084, 1086-87 (7th Cir. 1999). The report's final paragraph, however, says that\\nRisher \\\"used the Willis job evaluation system to confirm that the jobs would be evaluated the same in each\\ndepartment\\\" and concluded that \\\"the jobs would be evaluated exactly the same\\\". Risher does not explain how the\\n\\\"Willis job evaluation system\\\" works (or cite published literature providing that background), what data he used as\\ninputs, or what outputs were obtained. Charts attached to the report are unintelligible without explanation, and\\nRisher provided none. Readers must take everything on faith, and that alone would be good reason to exclude\\nRisher's conclusion. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999).\\nThe few references to the Willis system in the legal literature suggest that it is designed to identify comparable\\nworth, rather than substantially equal tasks. See AFSCME v. Washington, 770 F.2d 1401, 1403, 1406, 1408 (9th\\nCir. 1985) (Kennedy, J.) (holding, on this ground, that Willis evaluations are unavailing). All plaintiffs do in\\nresponse is assert that the Willis system is \\\"a recognized job evaluation system\\\" that is \\\"widely used by\\nbusinesses\\\"00which does nothing to fill in the blanks of Risher's report or demonstrate that the Willis inquiry was\\n97\\nrelevant to this litigation.\\nPlaintiffs challenge a second evidentiary decision, which the parties call the \\\"outlier ruling.\\\" Kohl's operates stores\\nthroughout Wisconsin. Some are much larger than others, and size affects not only the number of employees in\\neach department but also the tasks to be done. Plaintiffs sought to compare the busiest bakery and deli jobs with\\nthe lightest produce jobs; Kohl's naturally would have preferred the converse. But the judge instructed both sides\\nto compare the tasks of median jobs rather than the outliers at the largest and smallest stores. Plaintiffs contend\\nthat this ruling prevented them from showing that some bakery and deli jobs are substantially equal (in lifting,\\nresponsibility, and so on) to some produce jobs, indeed are more taxing than some produce jobs. As plaintiffs see\\n925 things, the *925 Equal Pay Act requires a person-by-person comparison rather than a categorical one.\\nTo the extent plaintiffs rely on the proposition that employers cannot make up arbitrary categories and insist that\\nthese be the basis of comparison, they get no quarrel from us (or from the district judge). See Thompson v.\\nSawyer, 678 F.2d 257, 274-75 (D.C.Cir. 1982). But Kohl's did not make up the \\\"department clerk\\\" and \\\"regular\\nclerk\\\" categories for this litigation, nor did it unilaterally decide to use the same wage scale throughout the state;\\nthe classifications and wages are the result of collective bargaining. Labor agreements frequently apply to all of\\nan employer's sites, and these agreements are \\\"factor[s] other than sex\\\" that explain why the pay is identical at\\nlarge and small stores even though the tasks differ. If all plaintiffs have to go on is the difference across stores,\\nthen they have nothing, for this variation in the ratio between pay and the difficulty of employees' tasks is so\\nobviously unrelated to sex that Kohl's would have been entitled to summary judgment under \\u00a7 206(d)(1)(iv). To\\nget anywhere, plaintiffs had to make a categorical comparison between \\\"department clerk\\\" positions and \\\"regular\\nclerk\\\" positions. Class treatment is appropriate only if there are common issues of fact00that is, only if it is\\n97\\npossible to compare all \\\"department clerk\\\" positions in bakery and deli departments with all \\\"regular clerk\\\"\\npositions in produce departments. The district court's outlier ruling ensured that the premise of class certification\\n(granted at plaintiffs' behest) would not be subverted. It was not an abuse of discretion.\\nTwo challenges to the jury instructions require only brief mention.\\n\\nFirst, the instructions told the jury that it must determine whether the positions are \\\"substantially the same\\\" rather\\nthan \\\"substantially equal.\\\" Plaintiffs express concern that the jury would treat \\\"same\\\" as equivalent to \\\"identical,\\\"\\nwhich these positions concededly were not. But using the word \\\"equal\\\" could lead to the same (an equal?)\\nmisunderstanding. Modifying either word with \\\"substantially\\\" overcomes the problem. The phrases \\\"substantially\\nthe same\\\" and \\\"substantially equal\\\" are substantially identical. The special interrogatory forms told the jury to\\ndetermine whether the positions were \\\"substantially the same,\\\" and the district judge sensibly tracked that\\nlanguage in the instructions; otherwise the jury could have been confused by a difference between the\\ninstructions and the verdict forms.\\nSecond, plaintiffs contend that the judge erred by telling the jury that documentary evidence such as position\\ndescriptions and training manuals00evidence that plaintiffs contend shows that bakery, deli, and produce positions\\n97\\nhave the same tasks00\\\"could not be considered.\\\" An instruction saying this would indeed be erroneous, for an\\n97\\nemployer's manuals and descriptions are relevant to the question what the positions actually entail. But plaintiffs\\ndo not identify the supposedly erroneous instruction, and we could not find one that tells the jury not to \\\"consider\\\"\\npaper evidence. What the judge actually told the jury is that a decision should not be \\\"based upon job titles or job\\ndescriptions\\\" but instead depends on \\\"actual job duties and performance requirements.\\\" That instruction was\\nabsolutely correct. Training manuals and the like were relevant only to the extent they accurately described the\\nactual job duties.\\nLast but not least is plaintiffs' contention that the district judge erred in informing the jury that the EEOC had\\nfound in Kohl's favor on plaintiffs' charge of discrimination under the Equal Pay Act. Before trial the district judge\\ngranted a motion in limine barring Kohl's from informing the jury about the EEOC'S decision, but the judge\\nchanged her mind after plaintiffs' counsel told the jury that Kohl's agreed \\\"under pressure of this lawsuit\\\" to\\n926 reduce the pay differential among the departments. *926 Kohl's replied that the \\\"pressure\\\" came from its unions\\nin collective bargaining, not from the suit; to add oomph to this assertion Kohl's wanted to inform the jury that the\\nEEOC took a dim view of plaintiffs' chances. If even the EEOC did not support plaintiffs, Kohl's sought to argue,\\nthen the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" could not have made a difference. This led the district judge to inform the jury\\nabout the EEOC'S conclusion, in this language:\\nAt the time of the 1998 collective bargaining negotiations Kohl's had a determination from the\\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission that it had not discriminated against bakery and deli\\nmanagers and clerks on the basis of their pay. At plaintiffs' request that the determination by the\\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission be reconsidered, the EEOC rescinded its\\ndetermination. Before any redetermination had issued, plaintiffs' attorney decided to proceed with\\nthis lawsuit and therefore no determination was ever issued thereafter by the Equal Employment\\nOpportunity Commission.\\nBy asserting that the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" led to a change, plaintiffs' counsel implied that the suit had merit00\\n97\\nand that Kohl's knew that it had merit. Kohl's was entitled to counteract this implication, the district judge thought,\\nby showing that what Kohl's knew implied that it would prevail on the merits.\\nMany decisions by the EEOC are superficial, little more than precursors to right-to-sue letters. But this one was\\nmore thorough. Here is the Commission's own description:\\nOur equal payment investigation considered whether or not the actual job duties of the deli and\\nbakery manager positions and the deli and bakery clerk positions were substantially equal with\\nrespect to skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions as those of the produce manager and\\nproduce clerk positions. To that end, detailed equal pay interviews were conducted with various\\nincumbents of the produce manager and produce clerk positions. These interviews reflected that\\nthe produce jobs were dirtier, required more physical lifting of greater weight, more items with\\ngreater frequency than the deli and bakery jobs. Moreover, the produce areas are significantly\\nlarger than the deli and bakery areas in terms of physical square footage. There are far more\\nitems in produce than in deli and bakery and produce accounts for a greater percentage of store\\nsales, i.e., higher sales volume. Produce employees are frequently called upon to help out in other\\nareas of the store stocking the dairy case, retrieving the carts, et cetera. As a result, our\\n\\ninvestigation concluded that the jobs in question did not meet the required equal pay test and that\\nthey are not substantially equal with respect to effort, responsibility, skill or working conditions.\\nIt is understandable that plaintiffs wanted to keep this damning passage from the jury's eyes, and they\\nsucceeded. The jury never learned the reasoning behind the EEOC'S decision. Why plaintiffs' counsel, having\\nsecured a ruling excluding even a mention of the EEOC'S bottom line, then opened the door is a mystery. Still,\\nplaintiffs say, the jury should not have been told about the EEOC'S conclusion because, by the time Kohl's\\nagreed to reduce the pay differential to 5\\u00a2 per hour, the EEOC had rescinded its conclusion, so that the report did\\nnot counteract the inference for which counsel argued.\\nAfter receiving the EEOC'S report (and the accompanying right-to-sue letter) in September 1997, plaintiffs asked\\nthe EEOC to reconsider. In December 1997 the EEOC'S District Director withdrew both the conclusion and the\\nright-to-sue letter pending further review. See 29 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1601.19(b). Before the EEOC could do any further\\n927 investigation, plaintiffs asked for a new right-to-sue letter, which the EEOC was obliged to issue forthwith. 29 *927\\nC.F.R. \\u00a7 1601.28. Once it sent the right-to-sue letter, the EEOC called off its investigation and neither reissued\\nthe original report nor prepared a new one. The upshot was that, when plaintiffs filed their suit, there was no\\noutstanding adverse decision by the EEOC. When she told the jury about the EEOC'S conclusion, the district\\njudge was under the impression that the negotiations to which plaintiffs' counsel referred took place before the\\nDistrict Director's order in December 1997. On learning that this was not so, the judge did not instruct the jurors\\nto disregard the report (a direction that would have been futile in any event, sort of like telling the jurors that for\\nthe remainder of the trial none of them was allowed to say the word \\\"rhinoceros\\\" to himself).\\nWas there a significant chance that the jury would misunderstand the significance of the EEOC'S decision, and\\nthe purpose for which it had been used00a chance so large that it requires reversal even under the deferential\\n97\\nstandard used to review a district judge's application of Fed.R.Evid. 403? We think not. Confusion over timing is\\nregrettable, but the judge can't be blamed for the error in the opening passage of the instruction (\\\"At the time of\\nthe 1998 collective bargaining negotiations Kohl's had a determination\\\"..). That language had been drafted by\\nthe parties; the judge used it because the parties agreed on it. Plaintiffs deny that they \\\"stipulated\\\" to the\\nlanguage, but no matter; they did not object to it, and that is that. Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.\\nBecause plaintiffs sought to persuade the jury that Kohl's recognized its culpability, Kohl's was entitled to rebut\\nthis contention using the best available evidence: a decision by the EEOC that the positions were not\\nsubstantially equal. See Paolitto v. John Brown E. & C., Inc., 151 F.3d 60, 65-66 (2d Cir. 1998). Decisions by\\npublic bodies do not vanish into thin air or become un-documents when parties ask for reconsideration or settle\\ntheir differences. See U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.S. 18, 115 S.Ct. 386, 130\\nL.Ed.2d 233 (1994); In re Memorial Hospital of Iowa County, Inc., 862 F.2d 1299 (7th Cir. 1988). When\\nnegotiating with the unions, Kohl's knew the EEOC'S view, which had been withdrawn as a result of plaintiffs'\\nstrategy but had not been disclaimed as erroneous. The 1998 negotiations occurred against a background that\\nincluded the EEOC'S support of Kohl's position, and this was relevant to the strength of the inference that Kohl's\\nand the unions acted under the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" as plaintiffs asserted.\\nDoubtless there was a risk that the jury would overestimate the significance of the EEOC'S ruling; this is why\\nsuch conclusions generally are not admitted (on behalf of either side) in jury trials. See Lathem v. Department of\\nChildren and Youth Services, 172 F.3d 786, 791 (11th Cir. 1999). Plaintiffs note that the jury asked a question\\nabout the report during deliberations, implying that the EEOC'S view assumed unusual significance. By opening\\nthe door to disclosure, however, plaintiffs took that risk; they could not argue as they did and then defang the best\\nresponse. See United States v. McAnderson, 914 F.2d 934, 946 (7th Cir. 1990). Nor can they avoid the\\nconsequence of their opening statement by contending on appeal (as they do) that \\\"[w]hy Kohl's narrowed the\\ngap in late 1998 is entirely peripheral\\\" (emphasis in original). That may be, but it was plaintiffs who injected this\\nsubject into the case and entitled Kohl's to supply an answer. Plaintiffs did not argue to the district judge that the\\nscope of the answer was too prejudicial and never suggested any possible response that was less prejudicial.\\nThe district judge protected plaintiffs' substantial rights by excluding the EEOC'S actual language and reminding\\nthe jury that the conclusion had been rescinded. In response to the jury's question, the judge reread the\\n928 instruction and added that the only issue properly under consideration was \\\"whether the jobs are equal\\\" rather \\n\\n*928 than why Kohl's and the union changed the pay scales in 1998. The evidence and the instructions as a\\nwhole ensured that the jury focused on, and answered, the right questions. Plaintiffs had a fair trial.\\nAFFIRMED\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 240,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['The case \\\"EEOC v.

As more particularly described in the Statement of Claims \\\\nsection of this Complaint, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \\\\n(hereafter referred to as \\\"the Commission\\\") alleges that David Thompson, an African American, \\\\nwas unlawfully discharged by the Defendant in retaliation for having filed a charge of \\\\nemployment discrimination based on his race with the Commission.  \\\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \\\\n1.   Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 451, 1331, 1337, \\\\n1343 and 1345.   This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Section 706(f)(l) and (3)  of \\\\n\\\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 2 of 7 \\\\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) and (3) (\\\"Title \\\\nVll\\\") and Section 102 oftbe Civil Rights Act of 1991,42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 198la.  \\\\n2.   The employment practice alleged to be unlawful in this Complaint was committed \\\\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for Western District of Louisiana, \\\\nShreveport Division.  \\\\nPARTIES \\\\n3.   Plaintiff, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \\\"Commission\\\"), is \\\\nthe agency of the United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and \\\\nenforcement of Title VII, and is expressly authorized to bring this action by Section 706(f)(l) and \\\\n(3) ofTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) and (3).  \\\\n4.   At all relevant times, the Defendant, Tasa, Inc. d/b/a Orr Minden Country \\\\nChevrolet (the \\\"Employer.  ), has continuously been a Louisiana corporation doing business in the \\\\nState of Louisiana and the City of Minden, and has continuously had at least 15 employees.  \\\\n5.   At all relevant times, Defendant Employer has continuously been an employer \\\\nengaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of Sections 701(b), (g) and (h) of \\\\nTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e(b), (g) and (h).  \\\\nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \\\\n6.   More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, David Thompson \\\\nfiled a charge with the Commission alleging vioiations ofTitle VII by Defendant Employer.   All \\\\nconditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.  \\\\n2 \\\\n\\\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 3 of 7 \\\\n.. \\\\n7.   Since at least 2003, Defendant Employer engaged in an unlawful employment \\\\nOrr \\\\npractice at its automobile dealership known as  Minden Country Chevrolet in Minden, \\\\nLouisiana, in violation of Section 704 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-3.  On October 17, 2003, \\\\nDefendant Employer discharged David Thompson as a result of a charge of employment \\\\ndiscrimination based on race that he filed against the Defendant Employer with the Commission.  \\\\nThe Defendant Employer\\\\'s owner Larry Coker, while aware of David Thompson\\\\'s Commission \\\\ncharge filing, personally discharged Mr. Thompson purportedly for performance, attendance \\\\nand/or attitude issues.   At the time of his discharge, Mr. Thompson had not received any \\\\nemployment-related discipline or warnings by the Defendant Employer.  The Defendant \\\\nEmployer\\\\'s discharge of David Thompson was motivated by the retaliatory animus of its owner \\\\nLarry Coker.  \\\\n8.   The effect of the unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 \\\\nabove has been to deprive David Thompson of equal employment opportunities and to otherwise \\\\nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of discriminatory retaliation.  \\\\n9.   The unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 above was \\\\nintentional.  \\\\n10.   The unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 above was done \\\\nwith malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of David Thompson.  \\\\n3 \\\\n\\\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 4 of 7 \\\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\\\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court:.  \\\\nA.  Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant Employer, its officers, \\\\nsuccessors, assigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in \\\\ndiscriminatory retaliation.  \\\\nB.  Order Defendant Employer to institute and carry out policies, practices, and \\\\nprograms which protect its employees from discriminatory retaliation, and which eradicate the \\\\neffects of its past unlawful employment practice.  \\\\nC.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\\\nappropriate backpay with prejudgment interest, in amounts to be detennined at trial, and other \\\\naffirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effeCts of its unlawful employment practice, \\\\nincluding but not limited to appropriate frontpay.  \\\\nD.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\\\ncompensation for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful employment \\\\npractice described in paragraph 7 above, including job-search expenses and medical-related \\\\nexpenses, in amounts to be determined at trial. \\\\nE.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\\\ncompensation for past and future nonpecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful practice \\\\ncomplained of in paragraph 7 above, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss of \\\\nenjoyment of life, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at trial. \\\\n4 \\\\n\\\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 5 of 7 \\\\n.. \\\\nF.

D., for appellees. \\\\nBefore LAY, Chief Judge, and STEPHENSON and McMILLIAN, Circuit Judges. \\\\nPER CURIAM. \\\\n[1]\\\\nHerbert O. Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, inmates at the North Dakota State Penitentiary  appeal from summary\\\\n1181 judgment *1181 granted in favor of defendants.  The decision of the district court is affirmed in part and reversed\\\\nin part for the reasons stated below. \\\\nJensen and Hagle initiated this pro se action under section 1983 against Edward J. Klecker, Director of the North\\\\nDakota Department of Institutions and various other prison officials.  Originally, five separate actions were filed but\\\\nthese were later consolidated into one comprehensive complaint.  That complaint alleges that Hagle\\\\'s and\\\\nJensen\\\\'s civil rights were violated in the following ways:\\\\n(1) that prison officials regularly open all of plaintiff Jensen\\\\'s incoming nonlegal mail without his consent and,\\\\nfurther, that all prisoners are required to deliver all outgoing mail to the prison mail box so that it may be\\\\ninspected prior to sealing;\\\\n(2) that inmates are routinely required to deliver all outgoing legal mail to a prison official who inspects it in the\\\\npresence of the inmate then orders the inmate to seal it and then initials it;\\\\n(3) that from April, 1976, to February, 1980, prison officials, on nine different occasions, willfully and deliberately\\\\nopened clearly marked legal mail addressed to Jensen and that the practice is a continuing one;\\\\n(4) that prison policy permits prison officials to deduct money from inmate financial accounts without vouchers\\\\nsigned by individual inmates to show accountability;\\\\n(5) that on or about December 22, 1978, a package of food mailed to Jensen by his brother was intercepted by\\\\nprison officials and returned, via mail, to the sender;\\\\n(6) that both Jensen and Hagle were deprived of property without due process in that prison officials refused to\\\\nredeem certain inmate scrip held by them; and\\\\n(7) that prison officials are currently in possession of certain items and funds belonging to the Wallstreet Jaycees,\\\\nan inmate organization that was suspended from operation by prison officials and prison officials have not\\\\nreturned the property nor made an accounting to members of that organization remaining in the inmate\\\\npopulation. \\\\n\\\\nAfter reviewing exhibits and affidavits submitted by the parties the district court granted defendant\\\\'s motion for\\\\n[2]\\\\nsummary judgment  from which plaintiffs Jensen and Hagle appeal. \\\\nPlaintiffs challenge the district court\\\\'s decision to grant summary judgment on two grounds:\\\\n(1) that they received no notice of the court\\\\'s intention to rule on the request for summary judgment; and\\\\n(2) that summary judgment was improperly granted in that there exist genuine issues of fact and that defendants\\\\n[3]\\\\nwere not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\\\nI.  Notice. \\\\nPlaintiff\\\\'s contention that they were not given notice in accord with Jensen v. Klecker, 599 F.2d 243 (8th Cir. 1979)\\\\nis without merit.  Jensen v. Klecker involved an earlier dismissal of this case by the district court through granting\\\\nof a motion to dismiss.  This court held that where the trial court considered affidavits outside of the pleadings in\\\\n1182 ruling on the motion plaintiffs were entitled to notice that the motion to dismiss had been converted to one for \\\\n*1182 summary judgment as well as an opportunity to file opposing materials.  Jensen v. Klecker is inapplicable\\\\nhere since the court in this case ruled upon defendant\\\\'s motion for summary judgment.  Not only did plaintiffs\\\\nreceive notice through the filing of the motion itself but had ample opportunity to file materials in opposition to it\\\\nas evidenced by their motion and brief filed in response. \\\\nII.  Summary Judgment. \\\\nSummary judgment is granted only where the record clearly demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact\\\\nexists and that the movant is entitled, as a matter of law, to judgment in his favor.  Glover v. National Broadcasting\\\\nCo., Inc., 594 F.2d 715, 717 (8th Cir. 1979).  It should not be entered unless the movant has established his right\\\\nto judgment \\\"with such clarity as to leave no room for controversy and that the other party is not entitled to\\\\nrecover under any discernible circumstances.\\\" Robert Johnson Co. v. Chemical Interchange Co., 541 F.2d 207,\\\\n209 (8th Cir. 1976).  It is, however, up to the party opposing the motion to set forth specific facts showing a\\\\ngenuine issue for trial. Glover v. National Broadcasting Co., 594 F.2d at 717. \\\\nA. Inspection of Inmate Mail. \\\\n1.  Non-privileged mail. \\\\nPlaintiffs contend that the routine inspection of incoming and outgoing nonlegal mail constitutes a violation of their\\\\ncivil rights.  Defendants concede that all nonlegal mail, both incoming and outgoing, is routinely inspected for\\\\ncontraband.  In Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) the Supreme Court set\\\\ndown guidelines for determining when the censorships of inmate mail was proper.  In doing so the court stated:\\\\n[T]he legitimate governmental interest in the order and security of penal institutions justifies the\\\\nimposition of certain restraints on inmate correspondence.... [I]t is not our purpose to survey the\\\\nrange of circumstances in which particular restrictions on prisoner mail might be warranted by the\\\\nlegitimate demands of prison administration as they exist from time to time in the various kinds of\\\\npenal institutions found in this country. \\\\nProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. at 412-13, 94 S.Ct. at 1810-11. \\\\nThe Supreme Court implicitly approved the opening of non-privileged mail to inspect for contraband in Wolff v.\\\\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), decided shortly after Martinez.  There the Court\\\\npointed out \\\"freedom from censorship is not equivalent to freedom from inspection or perusal.\\\" Id. at 576, 94\\\\nS.Ct. at 2984.  Non-privileged inmate mail is clearly not immune to inspection, thus such inspections cannot give\\\\n\\\\nrise to civil rights violations.  Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F.2d 748 (5th Cir. 1978); Laaman v. Helgemoe, 437 F.Supp.\\\\n269 (D.N.H.1977); Stover v. Carlson, 413 F.Supp. 718 (D.Conn.1976); United States Ex Rel. Dean v. Johnson,\\\\n381 F.Supp. 495 (E.D.Pa.1974).  It seems clear under these cases that the mere inspection of nonlegal incoming\\\\nand outgoing mail poses no threat to plaintiffs\\\\' civil rights.  Summary judgment on this point was proper. \\\\n2.  Privileged mail. \\\\nPrivileged prisoner mail, that is mail to or from an inmate\\\\'s attorney and identified as such, may not be opened for\\\\ninspections for contraband except in the presence of the prisoner.  Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 576-77, 94\\\\nS.Ct. 2963, 2984-85, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).  Many of the exhibits introduced by plaintiffs as examples of legal\\\\nmail simply do not appear to come within the parameters of the attorney-client mail privilege.  See Wolff v.\\\\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. at 576, 94 S.Ct. at 2984.  For example, a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union\\\\naddressed to President, Wallstreet Jaycees, and bearing no other markings, obviously does not fall within the\\\\nscope of that privilege.  Wolff requires that all such mail be specially marked as originating from an attorney, with\\\\n1183 that attorneys *1183 name and address. [4] However, one exhibit, a copy of a letter from the National Prison\\\\nProject, bearing the name of an attorney and which was stamped \\\"Lawyer Client Mail 00 Do Not Open Except In\\\\n97\\\\nPresence of Prisoner\\\" and which was addressed to plaintiff Jensen appears to come well within the definition of\\\\nattorney-client mail.  This would tend to rebut defendants\\\\' claim that the mail opened was not clearly marked. \\\\nCoupled with plaintiffs\\\\' assertions that the opening of such mail was done deliberately and on a continuing basis,\\\\nand contrasted with the defendants\\\\' vague claim that in the case of clearly marked mail some mistakes were\\\\nmade, this indicates that some factual issues remain to be resolved on this point.  Accordingly, summary judgment\\\\nis vacated as to this issue and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings. \\\\nB. Interception of food parcel. \\\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that a food package sent by his brother was not given to him but was returned, via\\\\nmail, to sender by prison officials.  Defendants do not deny plaintiffs allegations.  Affidavits and exhibits indicate\\\\nthat inmates were informed approximately six weeks prior to arrival of package that no more food parcels would\\\\nbe allowed.  Institutions may impose restrictions on the receipt of packages from outside the penitentiaries.  Bell v.\\\\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 555, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1882, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).  Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F.2d 748 (5th\\\\nCir. 1978).  The district court properly granted summary judgment on this issue. \\\\nC. Deductions from inmate accounts. \\\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that deducting postage costs above the two free letters per week allowed each\\\\nprisoner without a signed voucher to show accountability by prison officials deprives him of his property without\\\\ndue process.  The deprivation of property without due process is cognizable under section 1983.  Lynch v.\\\\nHousehold Finance, 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972).  However, it appears that no basis for\\\\nrecovery exists in this case. Both parties concede that the deductions made from the inmates account are done\\\\nso in accordance with prison regulations.  Exhibits indicate that a log was kept indicating the amount deducted,\\\\nthe date and the destination of each letter or parcel mailed and that inmates are regularly furnished with monthly\\\\nstatements of their account and may obtain copies of the postal log on request.', '\\\\nCoupled with plaintiffs\\\\' assertions that the opening of such mail was done deliberately and on a continuing basis,\\\\nand contrasted with the defendants\\\\' vague claim that in the case of clearly marked mail some mistakes were\\\\nmade, this indicates that some factual issues remain to be resolved on this point.  Accordingly, summary judgment\\\\nis vacated as to this issue and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings. \\\\nB. Interception of food parcel. \\\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that a food package sent by his brother was not given to him but was returned, via\\\\nmail, to sender by prison officials.  Defendants do not deny plaintiffs allegations.  Affidavits and exhibits indicate\\\\nthat inmates were informed approximately six weeks prior to arrival of package that no more food parcels would\\\\nbe allowed.  Institutions may impose restrictions on the receipt of packages from outside the penitentiaries.  Bell v.\\\\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 555, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1882, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).  Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F.2d 748 (5th\\\\nCir. 1978).  The district court properly granted summary judgment on this issue. \\\\nC. Deductions from inmate accounts. \\\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that deducting postage costs above the two free letters per week allowed each\\\\nprisoner without a signed voucher to show accountability by prison officials deprives him of his property without\\\\ndue process.  The deprivation of property without due process is cognizable under section 1983.  Lynch v.\\\\nHousehold Finance, 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972).  However, it appears that no basis for\\\\nrecovery exists in this case. Both parties concede that the deductions made from the inmates account are done\\\\nso in accordance with prison regulations.  Exhibits indicate that a log was kept indicating the amount deducted,\\\\nthe date and the destination of each letter or parcel mailed and that inmates are regularly furnished with monthly\\\\nstatements of their account and may obtain copies of the postal log on request. \\\\nInmates have no established right to be provided with unlimited free access to the mails.  See Tate v. Kassulke,\\\\n409 F.Supp. 651 (W.D.Ken.1975).  It is important to note that this issue does not involve a forfeiture of property or\\\\na penalty.  Rather, it is in the nature of an assessment for value received.  Plaintiffs do not contend that they did\\\\nnot receive the services for which they are charged.  Nor do they cite any precedent relating to accountability\\\\nrequirements as they pertain to inmate accounts.  Clearly, as the warden indicates in his affidavit, requiring a\\\\nsigned voucher for each postage charge incurred by each inmate would be unfeasible.  Not only are there no\\\\nfactual issues remaining to be resolved but there appears no basis for a claim under section 1983.  While plaintiffs\\\\nobviously have a property interest in the funds on deposit in their inmate accounts, they have failed to show that\\\\n\\\\nthey were unlawfully deprived of their property or that they have been deprived of their property without due\\\\nprocess.  Summary judgment in favor of defendants on this issue was proper. \\\\nD. Matters pertaining to the Wallstreet Jaycees. \\\\n1184 The two remaining claims of plaintiffs deal with matters relating to the Wallstreet *1184 Jaycees.  The Wallstreet\\\\nJaycees was an inmate organization which, as part of its fundraising activities, was permitted to operate the\\\\ninmate commissary concession stand.  To purchase items from the concession stand inmates were permitted to\\\\npurchase Jaycee scrip since inmates are not permitted to have currency in their possession.  Each book of scrip\\\\nissued bears the prisoner\\\\'s name, identification number and date of issue.  Each ticket is stamped with the\\\\nprisoner\\\\'s penitentiary identification number.  Tickets are non-negotiable if detached from the ticket book and the\\\\nscrip is non-transferable.  All legitimate transfers of scrip were logged at the time of purchase at the concession\\\\nstand.  The Wallstreet Jaycees were suspended from operation by the prison administration for activities in\\\\nviolation of prison regulations, e. g., depletion of funds.  The organization\\\\'s charter was subsequently revoked by\\\\nthe state and local Jaycee organizations.  Affidavits introduced by defendants indicate that a new Jaycee\\\\norganization is in the process of being formed. \\\\n1.  Unauthorized scrip. \\\\nThis claim arose when prison officials determined that all unused, authorized scrip held by inmates would be\\\\nredeemed.  The term \\\"authorized\\\" refers to scrip bearing the identification number of inmate holding it.  Plaintiffs\\\\ndemand to be reimbursed for all scrip held by them.  They do not contend that it is authorized.  Instead, they\\\\nmaintain that, apparently by virtue of possession, they are entitled to redemption.  Refusal to redeem the scrip,\\\\naccording to plaintiffs, amounts to a deprivation of property without due process.  In Sell v. Parratt, 548 F.2d 753\\\\n(8th Cir. 1977),cert. denied,434 U.S. 873, 98 S.Ct. 220, 54 L.Ed.2d 152, this court found a cognizable claim\\\\nunder section 1983 where money held by inmates in violation of prison regulations was confiscated and\\\\ndeposited in the Inmate\\\\'s Welfare Fund.  We found that while the regulations prohibited inmates from possessing\\\\ncurrency, they did not authorize the forfeiture of currency illegally possessed and upheld the district court order\\\\nrequiring the money credited to the account of the incarcerated plaintiff.  This case differs in that here plaintiffs\\\\nassert a property right in the redemption of unauthorized scrip which is by prison regulation void if held by anyone\\\\nother than the inmate to which the scrip was issued.  It appears that plaintiffs failed to show a valid property right,\\\\nmuch less a deprivation.  Holder v. Claar, 459 F.Supp. 850, 852 (D.Colo.1978).  The district court was correct in\\\\ngranting summary judgment. \\\\n2.  Finally, plaintiffs theorize a violation of their civil rights in that prison officials at the time of the administrative\\\\nsuspension of the Wallstreet Jaycees confiscated concession stand equipment belonging to the organization and\\\\nthe organization\\\\'s treasury.  Plaintiffs seek an accounting.  Defendants in their motion for summary judgment\\\\nassert that prior to bringing this action plaintiffs failed to request a formal accounting, but that in any event one\\\\nhas since been provided through interrogatories.  Affidavits and exhibits submitted by defendants show that\\\\n$765.82 is on deposit in the Wallstreet Jaycee savings account in the Bank of North Dakota and $86.27 in a\\\\nbusiness account at the North Dakota State Penitentiary and that the concession equipment is in storage at the\\\\npenitentiary.  Defendants maintain and introduce supporting affidavits to show that the charter of the Wallstreet\\\\nJaycees has been terminated by both the state and national organizations and that a new Jaycee organization is\\\\nbeing formed.  Defendants state that once a new Jaycee organization has been formed all assets of the now\\\\ndefunct Wallstreet Jaycees will be transferred to the new organization.  It is difficult to see how plaintiffs have\\\\nbeen harmed.  There appears to be no actual deprivation of property here and in any event it would seem that\\\\nplaintiffs have already gotten the accounting they requested.  Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on\\\\nthis issue. \\\\nAccordingly, summary judgment with regard to the issue of attorney-client mail is hereby vacated and the issue\\\\n1185 remanded for further proceedings.

Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, pro se.\\\\nRobert P. Brady, Asst. Atty. Gen., Bismarck, N. D., on brief, for appellees. \\\\nBefore LAY, ROSS and HENLEY, Circuit Judges. \\\\nPER CURIAM. \\\\nHerbert O. Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, inmates of the North Dakota State Penitentiary, sued North Dakota state\\\\nofficials, including the Director of Institutions, the penitentiary warden and the penitentiary accountant, for\\\\ndamages and declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983.  Their complaint was dismissed pursuant\\\\nto Fed.R.Civ.P.  12(b) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The district court considered\\\\nand relied upon matters outside the pleadings without treating the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary\\\\njudgment and without giving Jensen and Hagle notice of its intent to do so, as he was required to do by\\\\nFed.R.Civ.P.  12(b) and 56(c).  We therefore reverse and remand. \\\\nJensen and Hagle alleged that certain prison officials allowed inmates to form the Wallstreet Jaycees, a group\\\\noperating a concession stand in the penitentiary at which prison scrip was the medium of exchange.  Funds in the\\\\ninmates\\\\' personal financial accounts were exchanged for scrip through the penitentiary business office on a dollar\\\\nfor dollar basis.  When discharged, inmates received up to $25 reimbursement for unused scrip. \\\\nThe complaint alleged that in August 1977 prison officials suspended the Jaycee chapter, closed the stand and\\\\ncollected all unused scrip, providing inmates with receipts.  Thereafter, the general membership of the Jaycee\\\\nchapter voted that funds in the business office Jaycee account be transferred in appropriate amounts to the\\\\nindividual accounts of all inmates who held receipts.  Jensen held a receipt for $6.45 and Hagle held receipts\\\\ntotaling $142.25.  They allege that they have not been reimbursed, and claim that defendants\\\\' refusal to transfer\\\\nfunds to their accounts violates the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments. \\\\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, with a supporting brief and affidavit. \\\\nThey asserted they were not the real parties in interest and that no constitutionally protected right had been\\\\ninfringed by the actions alleged.  The district court granted the motion.  The court stated that it had considered\\\\ndefendants\\\\' motion to dismiss, the pleadings and defendants\\\\' affidavit and brief.  Facts not alleged in the\\\\ncomplaint, but set forth in the affidavit of prison warden Havener were recited and relied upon in the court\\\\'s\\\\n245 opinion. [1] The court held that the dispute was between plaintiffs and a group of other inmates, the Wallstreet \\\\n*245 Jaycees, and not with the prison officials.  The court also held that plaintiffs\\\\' allegation that scrip had not\\\\nbeen redeemed did not state a claim of constitutional dimensions. \\\\nWhen the district court considered defendants\\\\' affidavit in deciding the motion to dismiss, it was required to treat\\\\nthe motion as one for summary judgment.  Fed.R.Civ.P.  12(b); Carter v. Stanton, 405 U.S. 669, 671, 92 S.Ct.\\\\n1232, 31 L.Ed.2d 569 (1972); Goodman v. Parwatikar, 570 F.2d 801, 803 (8th Cir. 1978); Ailshire v. Darnell, 508\\\\n\\\\nF.2d 526, 527 (8th Cir. 1974).  However, there is no indication in the record that the court notified Jensen and\\\\nHagle of its intent or that it gave them an opportunity to file opposing materials, as is required by Fed.R.Civ.P.  56\\\\n(c).  We require strict compliance with the provisions of Rule 56, Ailshire v. Darnell, supra, 508 F.2d at 528, and\\\\nwe have held that notice may not be omitted even when more than 10 days have elapsed between filing of the\\\\nmotion and dismissal.  See Winfrey v. Brewer, 570 F.2d 761, 764 (8th Cir. 1978). \\\\nAlthough Jensen and Hagle submitted exhibits and affidavits with their pro se trial brief, they did so a month\\\\nbefore defendants\\\\' motion to dismiss and supporting affidavit were filed.  There is no indication they received\\\\nnotice that the warden\\\\'s affidavit would be considered and the motion to dismiss thereby converted to one for\\\\nsummary judgment, so that failure to file an opposing affidavit could result in an adverse judgment. \\\\nDefendants argue that the district court\\\\'s failure to comply with the Rule 56(c) notice requirement was not\\\\nprejudicial, because Jensen and Hagle were notified by a local rule to submit briefs in opposition to the motion\\\\nwithin 10 days.  However, Rules 12(b) and 56(c) contemplate an opportunity to file more than briefs.  A pro se brief\\\\nwas held not to constitute \\\"the type of meaningful opposition contemplated by Rule 56\\\" in Winfrey v. Brewer,\\\\nsupra, 570 F.2d at 764.  Plaintiffs\\\\' attempt to refute the affidavit by \\\"exhibits,\\\" materials not presented to the trial\\\\ncourt but filed on appeal, indicates that they might well have taken advantage of a meaningful opportunity to\\\\noppose the affidavit. \\\\nWhen the complaint is given the liberal construction ordinarily accorded pro se civil rights complaints, we are not\\\\nconvinced to a certainty that Jensen and Hagle would not be entitled to relief under any state of facts which they\\\\ncould prove in support of their claim.  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). \\\\nClaims of intentional deprivation of a prisoner\\\\'s property under color of state law are actionable under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\\\n1983.

We suggest to the district court that it consider\\\\nappointing counsel to assist the plaintiffs in this case.\\\\n[1] These facts were: The stand was closed for good and sufficient reasons.  An inmate group formed to audit the\\\\nbooks recommended that only scrip which could be shown to have been purchased by the inmate holding it be\\\\nredeemed, which recommendation the Jaycees\\\\' general membership rejected.  No scrip has been redeemed\\\\nbecause the Jaycee group has not \\\"formally\\\" requested transfer of the funds to individual inmate accounts. \\\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar. \\\\n\\\\nDocument Title: Reported Opinion\\\\nDocument Content: \\\\n702 F.2d 131 (1983)\\\\nHerbert O.

Jensen, pro se.\\\\nEdwin F. Zuern, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., Bismarck, N.D., for appellees. \\\\nBefore LAY, Chief Judge, HENLEY, Senior Circuit Judge, and FAGG, Circuit Judge.\\\\n132 *132 PER CURIAM. \\\\n[1]\\\\nAppellant Herbert O. Jensen appeals from the district court\\\\'s  denial of his motion for relief from judgment under\\\\nFed.R.Civ.P.  60(b). \\\\nThis action was brought by Jensen against various state authorities alleging that legal mail was being opened\\\\nand not delivered to him at the North Dakota state prison.  To \\\"protect his rights,\\\" he filed liens on the personal\\\\nand real property of all the defendants with the Registrars of Deeds in several North Dakota counties. \\\\nIn response, the defendants filed a \\\"Motion For An Order to Give Notice of All Liens Filed and to Remove All\\\\nLiens Filed\\\" with the district court. The \\\"motion\\\" also requested the court to assess damages.  The district court\\\\nordered Jensen to give the defendants a list of all the liens he had filed and to file releases of all the liens with the\\\\nappropriate county officers, and prohibited Jensen from filing further liens without court approval.  Jensen\\\\ncomplied with this order and the defendants repeated their \\\"motion\\\" for damages.  On February 3, 1982 the\\\\ndistrict court granted the defendants\\\\' motion for summary judgment on the mail issue, and denied the defendants\\\\'\\\\nmotion for damages. \\\\nOn July 15, 1982 the district court sua sponte amended its order dismissing the damages claim by adding the\\\\nphrase \\\"for lack of jurisdiction.\\\" Formal notice was not given to the defendants or to Jensen prior to entry of the\\\\norder.  Jensen claims that he did not receive a copy of the order after entry.  While the district court file does not\\\\nindicate that a copy was sent to him, it does show that a copy was sent to his attorney of record.  Jensen,\\\\nhowever, claims that he did not receive a copy of the order until September 7, when he was given a copy in\\\\nconnection with another lawsuit.  On September 10 he filed a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P.  60(b) requesting the\\\\ndistrict court to reconsider the amended judgment on the grounds that (1) he never received notice of the\\\\namended judgment, and (2) the district court had jurisdiction over the damages claim.  The district court denied\\\\nthe motion, and Jensen appealed. \\\\nThe standard of review for denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is whether the district court abused its discretion.  \\\\nBrowder v. Director, 434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 560 n. 7, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); Knox v. Lichtenstein,\\\\n654 F.2d 19, 21 (8th Cir.1981).  Further, this court cannot use review of a 60(b) motion to review an underlying\\\\ndecision which was not appealed.  E.g., Clark v. Wyrick, 538 F.2d 1327 (8th Cir.1976),cert. denied, 429 U.S.\\\\n1062, 97 S.Ct. 788, 50 L.Ed.2d 778 (1977).  Thus, the district court\\\\'s order amending the judgment, even if\\\\n[2]\\\\nquestionable,  is not reviewable.  Only the denial of Jensen\\\\'s motion may be considered. \\\\n\\\\nJensen should have challenged the order by a timely Rule 52(b) motion seeking further amendment or by a\\\\ntimely appeal.  The time limits for these actions had passed by the time Jensen filed his Rule 60(b) motion with\\\\nthe court. If no notice of the amending order had been served or received, perhaps relief might be merited.  See \\\\nCoclin Tobacco Co. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 353 F.2d 727, 728 (2d Cir.1965).  However, the record\\\\nshows Jensen\\\\'s attorney received a copy of the order.  See Bennett v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 396 F.2d 909,\\\\n911 (9th Cir.1968).  There is no reason to consider under Rule 60(b) a motion which could have been made under\\\\nanother rule if the litigant had acted in a timely manner.  See Lester v. Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 653 F.2d\\\\n353 (8th Cir.1981). \\\\nBecause we find no abuse of discretion, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. \\\\n[1] The Honorable Bruce M. Van Sickle, United States District Judge, District of North Dakota. \\\\n[2]Cf. McLearn v.

Jobs in the bakery and deli departments fall into one classification, jobs in the produce\\\\ndepartment another.  Two facts give rise to this litigation: pay in the produce department is higher, and workers\\\\nare not distributed uniformly by sex.  Most bakery and deli workers are women, while most produce workers are\\\\nmen.  Plaintiffs, a class of women who work in the deli and bakery departments, contend that the difference\\\\nviolates both the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 206(d), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Kohl\\\\'s replies\\\\nthat plaintiffs are short-sighted: employees in the produce department are included within a pay category called\\\\n\\\"regular clerks,\\\" most of whom are female.  That most regular clerks in the produce department are men does not\\\\nundercut the fact that most regular clerks store-wide are women, Kohl\\\\'s insists.  The employer adds that women\\\\nwho want to be regular clerks in or out of the produce department do not face any discrimination in hiring or\\\\ntransfer.  None of the class representatives applied for transfer to the produce department or another regular-clerk\\\\nposition; instead they want higher pay for their existing work.  The ratio of wages between \\\"department clerks\\\"\\\\n(the jobs plaintiffs occupy) and \\\"regular clerks,\\\" Kohl\\\\'s insists, is a subject for collective bargaining rather than for\\\\nlitigation. \\\\nAfter allowing the parties to conduct extensive discovery, the district court granted summary judgment for Kohl\\\\'s\\\\non the Title VII claim.  The judge exhaustively analyzed the duties of bakery, deli, and produce workers and\\\\nconcluded that plaintiffs could not demonstrate that Kohl\\\\'s explanation for placing produce positions in the\\\\n\\\"regular clerk\\\" classification was a pretext for sex discrimination.  (The class includes supervisors and argues that\\\\nbakery and deli managers do the same work as produce managers.  Because the supervisors\\\\' arguments track\\\\nthose of the clerks, we use \\\"clerks\\\" as a generic term to simplify exposition.) Kohl\\\\'s insisted that produce workers\\\\nexercise greater discretion in displaying and culling produce and that produce jobs also are physically harder\\\\nthan bakery or deli jobs.  The district judge concluded: \\\"Plaintiffs have produced no persuasive evidence\\\\nsuggesting that defendants did not honestly believe this justification or that it is a cover for discrimination.\\\" Honest belief is not enough under the Equal Pay Act, however, because that statute (unlike Title VII) does not\\\\nrequire intent to discriminate.  Section 206(d)(1) provides:\\\\nNo employer.. shall discriminate.. between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to\\\\nemployees.. at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite\\\\nsex for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and\\\\nresponsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such\\\\npayment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which\\\\n\\\\nmeasures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other\\\\nfactor other than sex[.] The district judge concluded that two questions under this statute could be resolved only by trial: whether the\\\\npositions in question are \\\"jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which\\\\nare performed under similar working conditions\\\" and, if so, whether the pay differential nonetheless is \\\"based on\\\\nany other factor other than sex\\\".  A trial culminated in a special verdict that answered the equal-work question in\\\\nthe negative; the jury then did not address the \\\"factor other than sex\\\" defense. \\\\nA substantial portion of plaintiffs\\\\' appellate brief is devoted to contending that the district judge should not have\\\\n923 granted summary judgment on the Title *923 VII theory.  Yet it is hard to see how this can matter, given the jury\\\\'s\\\\nverdict on the Equal Pay Act theory.  If (as the jury determined) the bakery, deli, and produce jobs are not\\\\nsubstantially equal, then plaintiffs can\\\\'t show sex discrimination.  Title VII does not require equal wages for\\\\ncomparable work, see American Nurses\\\\' Association v. Illinois, 783 F.2d 716 (7th Cir. 1986), or even for identical\\\\nwork.  Identical jobs with different wages do not violate Title VII, provided that all employees may freely select\\\\nwhich job to perform.  Plaintiffs\\\\' Title VII claim thus is untenable00no matter the validity of the jury\\\\'s special verdict,\\\\n97\\\\nwhich we address below00 unless Kohl\\\\'s discriminated when hiring for the different classifications. \\\\n97\\\\nPlaintiffs make much of evidence that until the late 1960s Kohl\\\\'s not only discouraged women from applying for\\\\ncertain positions but also had sex-segregated wage classifications.  This practice is long gone, and no vestige of\\\\nthe discrimination survives.  Wage schedules were merged 31 years ago, and, unlike the situation in Bazemore v.\\\\nFriday, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986), women hired during the discriminatory period today\\\\nreceive the same wages as men hired at the same time.  What remains is the possibility that Kohl\\\\'s steered\\\\napplicants by sex or selectively offered them transfer opportunities.  Loyd v. Phillips Brothers, Inc., 25 F.3d 518,\\\\n524-25 (7th Cir. 1994).  Neither the plaintiffs\\\\' charge of discrimination filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity\\\\nCommission nor their arguments to the district court contended that Kohl\\\\'s today steers women to bakery and\\\\ndeli jobs, or did so at any time within the period of limitations.  Plaintiffs disavow a steering claim but contend that\\\\nKohl\\\\'s history is informative on the wage-discrimination claim.  The district judge did not see how; neither do we. \\\\nClaims under the Equal Pay Act differ from comparable-worth arguments because proof that the two jobs are of\\\\nthe same (or comparable) value to the employer or society as a whole, or depend on similar effort or education,\\\\ngets the plaintiff nowhere.  To succeed under the Equal Pay Act the plaintiff must establish that the positions entail\\\\nsubstantially equal tasks, performed under similar conditions.  (The Act just says \\\"equal,\\\" but it is common ground\\\\nthat \\\"equal\\\" does not mean \\\"identical\\\"; otherwise the employer could defeat an Equal Pay Act suit by adding an\\\\ninconsequential and pointless chore to one of the jobs.  Opinions commonly use the formula \\\"substantially equal\\\"\\\\nto express the idea that trivial differences do not matter.  See Fallon v. Illinois, 882 F.2d 1206, 1208 (7th Cir. 1989)\\\\n; Epstein v. Secretary of the Treasury, 739 F.2d 274, 277 (7th Cir. 1984).  We follow that convention.) Kohl\\\\'s\\\\nprovided the jury with plenty of evidence that tasks in the produce department differ substantially from those\\\\nperformed by bakery and deli workers.  Produce workers do more heavy lifting and must exercise judgment about\\\\n(for example) which fruit is ripe, which should be marked down, and how the produce should be displayed to\\\\nmaximize sales.  Bakery and deli workers, by contrast, stock displays according to more mechanical\\\\nspecifications and use printed expiration dates rather than judgment to determine when inventory should be\\\\nrotated or removed.  Although a rational jury might have disbelieved this evidence or concluded that the\\\\ndifferences are too slight to matter, and thus returned a verdict in plaintiffs\\\\' favor, a verdict for Kohl\\\\'s is\\\\ninvulnerable unless spoiled by trial error. \\\\nPlaintiffs contend that the exclusion of their expert witness is such an error.  Howard Risher, a self-employed\\\\nconsultant with a Ph.D. in labor relations and economics, who teaches an undergraduate course on human\\\\nresources as an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania, prepared a report reaching conclusions\\\\nfavorable to plaintiffs.  Stripped of self-congratulatory dross, this report is three pages long and consists of a list of\\\\n924 clerks\\\\' duties and an unreasoned *924 assertion that all three departments\\\\' positions are \\\"virtually identical in\\\\nterms of their basic function and are substantially equal in terms of skill, effort, responsibility and working\\\\nconditions.\\\" The only support for this conclusion, however, is the list, with entries such as \\\"[p]reparing products\\\\nfor display\\\" and \\\"[m]aintaining equipment\\\".  Risher did not analyze what the clerks do to achieve these objectives,\\\\nand the district court concluded that a list plus a bald assertion would not assist the trier of fact.  Fed.R.Evid.  702. \\\\n\\\\nRisher\\\\'s deposition was as skeletal as his report; asked how employees at Kohl\\\\'s carry out their duties, Risher\\\\nreplied only with variants on \\\"I couldn\\\\'t tell you\\\" and \\\"I have no idea\\\".  Apparently Risher thinks that job\\\\ndescriptions trump actual tasks, a sorry misunderstanding of the Equal Pay Act.  See Soto v. Adams Elevator\\\\nEquipment Co., 941 F.2d 543, 548 (7th Cir. 1991); Fallon, 882 F.2d at 1208.  The district judge\\\\'s decision to\\\\nprevent Risher from testifying, far from being an abuse of discretion, see General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S.\\\\n136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997), was absolutely correct.  Many times we have emphasized that\\\\nexperts\\\\' work is admissible only to the extent it is reasoned, uses the methods of the discipline, and is founded on\\\\ndata.  Talking off the cuff00 deploying neither data nor analysis00is not an acceptable methodology.  See, e.g., \\\\n97 97\\\\nMcMahon v. Bunn-O-Matic Corp., 150 F.3d 651, 657-58 (7th Cir. 1998); Mid-State Fertilizer Co. v. Exchange\\\\nNational Bank, 877 F.2d 1333, 1339 (7th Cir. 1989). \\\\nRisher also prepared a supplemental report, based on his discussion with eight bakery or deli workers in a \\\"focus\\\\ngroup.\\\" This report did little more than parrot these women\\\\'s belief that bakery and deli duties require as much\\\\nskill as produce duties.  Relaying the plaintiffs\\\\' likely testimony is not an example of expertise.  Huey v. United\\\\nParcel Service, Inc., 165 F.3d 1084, 1086-87 (7th Cir. 1999).  The report\\\\'s final paragraph, however, says that\\\\nRisher \\\"used the Willis job evaluation system to confirm that the jobs would be evaluated the same in each\\\\ndepartment\\\" and concluded that \\\"the jobs would be evaluated exactly the same\\\".  Risher does not explain how the\\\\n\\\"Willis job evaluation system\\\" works (or cite published literature providing that background), what data he used as\\\\ninputs, or what outputs were obtained.  Charts attached to the report are unintelligible without explanation, and\\\\nRisher provided none.  Readers must take everything on faith, and that alone would be good reason to exclude\\\\nRisher\\\\'s conclusion.  See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). \\\\nThe few references to the Willis system in the legal literature suggest that it is designed to identify comparable\\\\nworth, rather than substantially equal tasks.  See AFSCME v. Washington, 770 F.2d 1401, 1403, 1406, 1408 (9th\\\\nCir. 1985) (Kennedy, J.) (holding, on this ground, that Willis evaluations are unavailing).  All plaintiffs do in\\\\nresponse is assert that the Willis system is \\\"a recognized job evaluation system\\\" that is \\\"widely used by\\\\nbusinesses\\\"00which does nothing to fill in the blanks of Risher\\\\'s report or demonstrate that the Willis inquiry was\\\\n97\\\\nrelevant to this litigation. \\\\nPlaintiffs challenge a second evidentiary decision, which the parties call the \\\"outlier ruling.\\\" Kohl\\\\'s operates stores\\\\nthroughout Wisconsin.  Some are much larger than others, and size affects not only the number of employees in\\\\neach department but also the tasks to be done.  Plaintiffs sought to compare the busiest bakery and deli jobs with\\\\nthe lightest produce jobs; Kohl\\\\'s naturally would have preferred the converse.  But the judge instructed both sides\\\\nto compare the tasks of median jobs rather than the outliers at the largest and smallest stores.  Plaintiffs contend\\\\nthat this ruling prevented them from showing that some bakery and deli jobs are substantially equal (in lifting,\\\\nresponsibility, and so on) to some produce jobs, indeed are more taxing than some produce jobs.  As plaintiffs see\\\\n925 things, the *925 Equal Pay Act requires a person-by-person comparison rather than a categorical one. \\\\nTo the extent plaintiffs rely on the proposition that employers cannot make up arbitrary categories and insist that\\\\nthese be the basis of comparison, they get no quarrel from us (or from the district judge).  See Thompson v.\\\\nSawyer, 678 F.2d 257, 274-75 (D.C.Cir. 1982).  But Kohl\\\\'s did not make up the \\\"department clerk\\\" and \\\"regular\\\\nclerk\\\" categories for this litigation, nor did it unilaterally decide to use the same wage scale throughout the state;\\\\nthe classifications and wages are the result of collective bargaining.  Labor agreements frequently apply to all of\\\\nan employer\\\\'s sites, and these agreements are \\\"factor[s] other than sex\\\" that explain why the pay is identical at\\\\nlarge and small stores even though the tasks differ.  If all plaintiffs have to go on is the difference across stores,\\\\nthen they have nothing, for this variation in the ratio between pay and the difficulty of employees\\\\' tasks is so\\\\nobviously unrelated to sex that Kohl\\\\'s would have been entitled to summary judgment under \\u00a7 206(d)(1)(iv).  To\\\\nget anywhere, plaintiffs had to make a categorical comparison between \\\"department clerk\\\" positions and \\\"regular\\\\nclerk\\\" positions.  Class treatment is appropriate only if there are common issues of fact00that is, only if it is\\\\n97\\\\npossible to compare all \\\"department clerk\\\" positions in bakery and deli departments with all \\\"regular clerk\\\"\\\\npositions in produce departments.  The district court\\\\'s outlier ruling ensured that the premise of class certification\\\\n(granted at plaintiffs\\\\' behest) would not be subverted.  It was not an abuse of discretion. \\\\nTwo challenges to the jury instructions require only brief mention. \\\\n\\\\nFirst, the instructions told the jury that it must determine whether the positions are \\\"substantially the same\\\" rather\\\\nthan \\\"substantially equal.\\\" Plaintiffs express concern that the jury would treat \\\"same\\\" as equivalent to \\\"identical,\\\"\\\\nwhich these positions concededly were not.  But using the word \\\"equal\\\" could lead to the same (an equal?) misunderstanding.  Modifying either word with \\\"substantially\\\" overcomes the problem.  The phrases \\\"substantially\\\\nthe same\\\" and \\\"substantially equal\\\" are substantially identical.  The special interrogatory forms told the jury to\\\\ndetermine whether the positions were \\\"substantially the same,\\\" and the district judge sensibly tracked that\\\\nlanguage in the instructions; otherwise the jury could have been confused by a difference between the\\\\ninstructions and the verdict forms. \\\\nSecond, plaintiffs contend that the judge erred by telling the jury that documentary evidence such as position\\\\ndescriptions and training manuals00evidence that plaintiffs contend shows that bakery, deli, and produce positions\\\\n97\\\\nhave the same tasks00\\\"could not be considered.\\\" An instruction saying this would indeed be erroneous, for an\\\\n97\\\\nemployer\\\\'s manuals and descriptions are relevant to the question what the positions actually entail.  But plaintiffs\\\\ndo not identify the supposedly erroneous instruction, and we could not find one that tells the jury not to \\\"consider\\\"\\\\npaper evidence.  What the judge actually told the jury is that a decision should not be \\\"based upon job titles or job\\\\ndescriptions\\\" but instead depends on \\\"actual job duties and performance requirements.\\\" That instruction was\\\\nabsolutely correct.  Training manuals and the like were relevant only to the extent they accurately described the\\\\nactual job duties. \\\\nLast but not least is plaintiffs\\\\' contention that the district judge erred in informing the jury that the EEOC had\\\\nfound in Kohl\\\\'s favor on plaintiffs\\\\' charge of discrimination under the Equal Pay Act.', ' The district court\\\\'s outlier ruling ensured that the premise of class certification\\\\n(granted at plaintiffs\\\\' behest) would not be subverted.

Training manuals and the like were relevant only to the extent they accurately described the\\\\nactual job duties. \\\\nLast but not least is plaintiffs\\\\' contention that the district judge erred in informing the jury that the EEOC had\\\\nfound in Kohl\\\\'s favor on plaintiffs\\\\' charge of discrimination under the Equal Pay Act.  Before trial the district judge\\\\ngranted a motion in limine barring Kohl\\\\'s from informing the jury about the EEOC\\\\'S decision, but the judge\\\\nchanged her mind after plaintiffs\\\\' counsel told the jury that Kohl\\\\'s agreed \\\"under pressure of this lawsuit\\\" to\\\\n926 reduce the pay differential among the departments.  *926 Kohl\\\\'s replied that the \\\"pressure\\\" came from its unions\\\\nin collective bargaining, not from the suit; to add oomph to this assertion Kohl\\\\'s wanted to inform the jury that the\\\\nEEOC took a dim view of plaintiffs\\\\' chances.  If even the EEOC did not support plaintiffs, Kohl\\\\'s sought to argue,\\\\nthen the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" could not have made a difference.  This led the district judge to inform the jury\\\\nabout the EEOC\\\\'S conclusion, in this language:\\\\nAt the time of the 1998 collective bargaining negotiations Kohl\\\\'s had a determination from the\\\\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission that it had not discriminated against bakery and deli\\\\nmanagers and clerks on the basis of their pay.  At plaintiffs\\\\' request that the determination by the\\\\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission be reconsidered, the EEOC rescinded its\\\\ndetermination.  Before any redetermination had issued, plaintiffs\\\\' attorney decided to proceed with\\\\nthis lawsuit and therefore no determination was ever issued thereafter by the Equal Employment\\\\nOpportunity Commission. \\\\nBy asserting that the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" led to a change, plaintiffs\\\\' counsel implied that the suit had merit00\\\\n97\\\\nand that Kohl\\\\'s knew that it had merit.  Kohl\\\\'s was entitled to counteract this implication, the district judge thought,\\\\nby showing that what Kohl\\\\'s knew implied that it would prevail on the merits. \\\\nMany decisions by the EEOC are superficial, little more than precursors to right-to-sue letters.  But this one was\\\\nmore thorough.  Here is the Commission\\\\'s own description:\\\\nOur equal payment investigation considered whether or not the actual job duties of the deli and\\\\nbakery manager positions and the deli and bakery clerk positions were substantially equal with\\\\nrespect to skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions as those of the produce manager and\\\\nproduce clerk positions.  To that end, detailed equal pay interviews were conducted with various\\\\nincumbents of the produce manager and produce clerk positions.  These interviews reflected that\\\\nthe produce jobs were dirtier, required more physical lifting of greater weight, more items with\\\\ngreater frequency than the deli and bakery jobs.  Moreover, the produce areas are significantly\\\\nlarger than the deli and bakery areas in terms of physical square footage.  There are far more\\\\nitems in produce than in deli and bakery and produce accounts for a greater percentage of store\\\\nsales, i.e., higher sales volume.  Produce employees are frequently called upon to help out in other\\\\nareas of the store stocking the dairy case, retrieving the carts, et cetera.  As a result, our\\\\n\\\\ninvestigation concluded that the jobs in question did not meet the required equal pay test and that\\\\nthey are not substantially equal with respect to effort, responsibility, skill or working conditions. \\\\nIt is understandable that plaintiffs wanted to keep this damning passage from the jury\\\\'s eyes, and they\\\\nsucceeded.  The jury never learned the reasoning behind the EEOC\\\\'S decision.  Why plaintiffs\\\\' counsel, having\\\\nsecured a ruling excluding even a mention of the EEOC\\\\'S bottom line, then opened the door is a mystery.  Still,\\\\nplaintiffs say, the jury should not have been told about the EEOC\\\\'S conclusion because, by the time Kohl\\\\'s\\\\nagreed to reduce the pay differential to 5\\u00a2 per hour, the EEOC had rescinded its conclusion, so that the report did\\\\nnot counteract the inference for which counsel argued. \\\\nAfter receiving the EEOC\\\\'S report (and the accompanying right-to-sue letter) in September 1997, plaintiffs asked\\\\nthe EEOC to reconsider.  In December 1997 the EEOC\\\\'S District Director withdrew both the conclusion and the\\\\nright-to-sue letter pending further review.  See 29 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1601.19(b).  Before the EEOC could do any further\\\\n927 investigation, plaintiffs asked for a new right-to-sue letter, which the EEOC was obliged to issue forthwith.  29 *927\\\\nC.F.R. \\u00a7 1601.28.  Once it sent the right-to-sue letter, the EEOC called off its investigation and neither reissued\\\\nthe original report nor prepared a new one.  The upshot was that, when plaintiffs filed their suit, there was no\\\\noutstanding adverse decision by the EEOC.  When she told the jury about the EEOC\\\\'S conclusion, the district\\\\njudge was under the impression that the negotiations to which plaintiffs\\\\' counsel referred took place before the\\\\nDistrict Director\\\\'s order in December 1997.  On learning that this was not so, the judge did not instruct the jurors\\\\nto disregard the report (a direction that would have been futile in any event, sort of like telling the jurors that for\\\\nthe remainder of the trial none of them was allowed to say the word \\\"rhinoceros\\\" to himself). \\\\nWas there a significant chance that the jury would misunderstand the significance of the EEOC\\\\'S decision, and\\\\nthe purpose for which it had been used00a chance so large that it requires reversal even under the deferential\\\\n97\\\\nstandard used to review a district judge\\\\'s application of Fed.R.Evid.  403?  We think not.  Confusion over timing is\\\\nregrettable, but the judge can\\\\'t be blamed for the error in the opening passage of the instruction (\\\"At the time of\\\\nthe 1998 collective bargaining negotiations Kohl\\\\'s had a determination\\\"..).  That language had been drafted by\\\\nthe parties; the judge used it because the parties agreed on it.  Plaintiffs deny that they \\\"stipulated\\\" to the\\\\nlanguage, but no matter; they did not object to it, and that is that.  Fed.R.Civ.P.  51. \\\\nBecause plaintiffs sought to persuade the jury that Kohl\\\\'s recognized its culpability, Kohl\\\\'s was entitled to rebut\\\\nthis contention using the best available evidence: a decision by the EEOC that the positions were not\\\\nsubstantially equal. See Paolitto v. John Brown E. & C., Inc., 151 F.3d 60, 65-66 (2d Cir. 1998).  Decisions by\\\\npublic bodies do not vanish into thin air or become un-documents when parties ask for reconsideration or settle\\\\ntheir differences.  See U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.S. 18, 115 S.Ct. 386, 130\\\\nL.Ed.2d 233 (1994); In re Memorial Hospital of Iowa County, Inc., 862 F.2d 1299 (7th Cir. 1988).  When\\\\nnegotiating with the unions, Kohl\\\\'s knew the EEOC\\\\'S view, which had been withdrawn as a result of plaintiffs\\\\'\\\\nstrategy but had not been disclaimed as erroneous.  The 1998 negotiations occurred against a background that\\\\nincluded the EEOC\\\\'S support of Kohl\\\\'s position, and this was relevant to the strength of the inference that Kohl\\\\'s\\\\nand the unions acted under the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" as plaintiffs asserted. \\\\nDoubtless there was a risk that the jury would overestimate the significance of the EEOC\\\\'S ruling; this is why\\\\nsuch conclusions generally are not admitted (on behalf of either side) in jury trials.  See Lathem v. Department of\\\\nChildren and Youth Services, 172 F.3d 786, 791 (11th Cir. 1999).  Plaintiffs note that the jury asked a question\\\\nabout the report during deliberations, implying that the EEOC\\\\'S view assumed unusual significance.  By opening\\\\nthe door to disclosure, however, plaintiffs took that risk; they could not argue as they did and then defang the best\\\\nresponse.  See United States v. McAnderson, 914 F.2d 934, 946 (7th Cir. 1990).  Nor can they avoid the\\\\nconsequence of their opening statement by contending on appeal (as they do) that \\\"[w]hy Kohl\\\\'s narrowed the\\\\ngap in late 1998 is entirely peripheral\\\" (emphasis in original).  That may be, but it was plaintiffs who injected this\\\\nsubject into the case and entitled Kohl\\\\'s to supply an answer.  Plaintiffs did not argue to the district judge that the\\\\nscope of the answer was too prejudicial and never suggested any possible response that was less prejudicial. \\\\nThe district judge protected plaintiffs\\\\' substantial rights by excluding the EEOC\\\\'S actual language and reminding\\\\nthe jury that the conclusion had been rescinded.  In response to the jury\\\\'s question, the judge reread the\\\\n928 instruction and added that the only issue properly under consideration was \\\"whether the jobs are equal\\\" rather \\\\n\\\\n*928 than why Kohl\\\\'s and the union changed the pay scales in 1998.  The evidence and the instructions as a\\\\nwhole ensured that the jury focused on, and answered, the right questions.  Plaintiffs had a fair trial.\\\\nAFFIRMED\\\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 92,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 33,\n        \"samples\": [\n          20,\n          21,\n          35\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["len(df)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Dqu0mTuf9ovK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747171697514,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Jiayi Gao","userId":"10756354987170970544"}},"outputId":"d3450e66-9a3b-41f9-942c-49f4b630ecfc"},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["240"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["MODEL.to('cuda')\n","\n","BATCH_SIZE = 8\n","\n","for index, row in tqdm(df.iterrows(), total=len(df)):\n","    case_id = row[\"case_id\"]\n","    #print(f\"Processing: \", index)\n","\n","    chunks = ast.literal_eval(row[\"chunks\"])\n","\n","    all_embeddings = []\n","\n","    for i in range(0, len(chunks), BATCH_SIZE):\n","        batch = chunks[i:i + BATCH_SIZE]\n","\n","        # Tokenize and move inputs to GPU\n","        inputs = TOKENIZER(batch, max_length=8192, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors='pt')\n","        inputs = {k: v.to('cuda') for k, v in inputs.items()}\n","\n","        # Run model on batch\n","        with torch.no_grad():\n","            outputs = MODEL(**inputs)\n","            last_hidden_state = outputs.last_hidden_state  # shape: [batch, seq_len, hidden_dim]\n","            #print(\"lhs: \", last_hidden_state.shape)\n","\n","            mean_embeddings = last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)  # shape: [batch, hidden_dim]\n","            all_embeddings.append(mean_embeddings.cpu())\n","\n","        torch.cuda.empty_cache()\n","\n","    # Combine all embeddings: [n_chunks, hidden_dim]\n","    all_embeddings_tensor = torch.cat(all_embeddings, dim=0)\n","    final_embedding = all_embeddings_tensor.mean(dim=0).numpy()\n","    #print(\"embed: \", final_embedding.shape)\n","\n","    df.at[index, 'mean_embedding'] = final_embedding.astype(object)\n","\n","    torch.cuda.empty_cache()"],"metadata":{"id":"YGJgZfMpgrPJ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"b839c744-1865-4a2c-eb98-8dccd038702f","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747176297821,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":4600306,"user":{"displayName":"Jiayi Gao","userId":"10756354987170970544"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["  0%|          | 0/240 [00:00<?, ?it/s]W0513 21:28:28.940000 586 torch/_inductor/utils.py:1137] [1/0] Not enough SMs to use max_autotune_gemm mode\n","100%|██████████| 240/240 [1:16:40<00:00, 19.17s/it]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#df[\"max_embedding\"] = df[\"max_embedding\"].apply(lambda x: x.tolist() if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) else x)\n","df[\"mean_embedding\"] = df[\"mean_embedding\"].apply(lambda x: x.tolist() if isinstance(x, np.ndarray) else x)\n","\n","df.to_json('/content/drive/MyDrive/metadata/embeddings/RACE_embeddings.json')"],"metadata":{"id":"3sBYm3sR3b8L","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747176298314,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":207,"user":{"displayName":"Jiayi Gao","userId":"10756354987170970544"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"ZQcgupWJWNzl","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":206},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1747176299201,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":889,"user":{"displayName":"Jiayi Gao","userId":"10756354987170970544"}},"outputId":"3fd06308-986d-411a-f1d5-27634c628e47"},"execution_count":8,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   case_id                                      clean_content  \\\n","0      531  The case \"Nichols v.

As more particularly described in the Statement of Claims \\nsection of this Complaint, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \\n(hereafter referred to as \\\"the Commission\\\") alleges that David Thompson, an African American, \\nwas unlawfully discharged by the Defendant in retaliation for having filed a charge of \\nemployment discrimination based on his race with the Commission. \\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \\n1.  Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 451, 1331, 1337, \\n1343 and 1345.  This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Section 706(f)(l) and (3)  of \\n\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 2 of 7 \\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) and (3) (\\\"Title \\nVll\\\") and Section 102 oftbe Civil Rights Act of 1991,42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 198la. \\n2.  The employment practice alleged to be unlawful in this Complaint was committed \\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for Western District of Louisiana, \\nShreveport Division. \\nPARTIES \\n3.  Plaintiff, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \\\"Commission\\\"), is \\nthe agency of the United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and \\nenforcement of Title VII, and is expressly authorized to bring this action by Section 706(f)(l) and \\n(3) ofTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) and (3). \\n4.  At all relevant times, the Defendant, Tasa, Inc. d/b/a Orr Minden Country \\nChevrolet (the \\\"Employer. ), has continuously been a Louisiana corporation doing business in the \\nState of Louisiana and the City of Minden, and has continuously had at least 15 employees. \\n5.  At all relevant times, Defendant Employer has continuously been an employer \\nengaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of Sections 701(b) , (g) and (h) of \\nTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e(b), (g) and (h). \\nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \\n6.  More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, David Thompson \\nfiled a charge with the Commission alleging vioiations ofTitle VII by Defendant Employer.  All \\nconditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled. \\n2 \\n\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 3 of 7 \\n.. \\n7.  Since at least 2003, Defendant Employer engaged in an unlawful employment \\nOrr \\npractice at its automobile dealership known as  Minden Country Chevrolet in Minden, \\nLouisiana, in violation of Section 704 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-3. On October 17, 2003, \\nDefendant Employer discharged David Thompson as a result of a charge of employment \\ndiscrimination based on race that he filed against the Defendant Employer with the Commission. \\nThe Defendant Employer's owner Larry Coker, while aware of David Thompson's Commission \\ncharge filing, personally discharged Mr. Thompson purportedly for performance, attendance \\nand/or attitude issues.  At the time of his discharge, Mr. Thompson had not received any \\nemployment-related discipline or warnings by the Defendant Employer. The Defendant \\nEmployer's discharge of David Thompson was motivated by the retaliatory animus of its owner \\nLarry Coker. \\n8.  The effect of the unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 \\nabove has been to deprive David Thompson of equal employment opportunities and to otherwise \\nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of discriminatory retaliation. \\n9.  The unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 above was \\nintentional. \\n10.  The unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 above was done \\nwith malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of David Thompson. \\n3 \\n\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 4 of 7 \\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court:. \\nA.

Order Defendant Employer to institute and carry out policies, practices, and \\nprograms which protect its employees from discriminatory retaliation, and which eradicate the \\neffects of its past unlawful employment practice. \\nC.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\nappropriate backpay with prejudgment interest, in amounts to be detennined at trial, and other \\naffirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effeCts of its unlawful employment practice, \\nincluding but not limited to appropriate frontpay. \\nD.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\ncompensation for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful employment \\npractice described in paragraph 7 above, including job-search expenses and medical-related \\nexpenses, in amounts to be determined at trial. \\nE.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\ncompensation for past and future nonpecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful practice \\ncomplained of in paragraph 7 above, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss of \\nenjoyment of life, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at trial. \\n4 \\n\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 5 of 7 \\n.. \\nF.  Order Defendant Employer to pay David Thompson punitive damages for its \\nmalicious and reckless conduct described in paragraph 7 above, in amounts to be determined at \\ntrial. \\nG.

Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, inmates at the North Dakota State Penitentiary  appeal from summary\\n1181 judgment *1181 granted in favor of defendants. The decision of the district court is affirmed in part and reversed\\nin part for the reasons stated below.\\nJensen and Hagle initiated this pro se action under section 1983 against Edward J. Klecker, Director of the North\\nDakota Department of Institutions and various other prison officials. Originally, five separate actions were filed but\\nthese were later consolidated into one comprehensive complaint. That complaint alleges that Hagle's and\\nJensen's civil rights were violated in the following ways:\\n(1) that prison officials regularly open all of plaintiff Jensen's incoming nonlegal mail without his consent and,\\nfurther, that all prisoners are required to deliver all outgoing mail to the prison mail box so that it may be\\ninspected prior to sealing;\\n(2) that inmates are routinely required to deliver all outgoing legal mail to a prison official who inspects it in the\\npresence of the inmate then orders the inmate to seal it and then initials it;\\n(3) that from April, 1976, to February, 1980, prison officials, on nine different occasions, willfully and deliberately\\nopened clearly marked legal mail addressed to Jensen and that the practice is a continuing one;\\n(4) that prison policy permits prison officials to deduct money from inmate financial accounts without vouchers\\nsigned by individual inmates to show accountability;\\n(5) that on or about December 22, 1978, a package of food mailed to Jensen by his brother was intercepted by\\nprison officials and returned, via mail, to the sender;\\n(6) that both Jensen and Hagle were deprived of property without due process in that prison officials refused to\\nredeem certain inmate scrip held by them; and\\n(7) that prison officials are currently in possession of certain items and funds belonging to the Wallstreet Jaycees,\\nan inmate organization that was suspended from operation by prison officials and prison officials have not\\nreturned the property nor made an accounting to members of that organization remaining in the inmate\\npopulation.\\n\\nAfter reviewing exhibits and affidavits submitted by the parties the district court granted defendant's motion for\\n[2]\\nsummary judgment  from which plaintiffs Jensen and Hagle appeal.\\nPlaintiffs challenge the district court's decision to grant summary judgment on two grounds:\\n(1) that they received no notice of the court's intention to rule on the request for summary judgment; and\\n(2) that summary judgment was improperly granted in that there exist genuine issues of fact and that defendants\\n[3]\\nwere not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\nI. Notice.\\nPlaintiff's contention that they were not given notice in accord with Jensen v. Klecker, 599 F.2d 243 (8th Cir. 1979)\\nis without merit. Jensen v. Klecker involved an earlier dismissal of this case by the district court through granting\\nof a motion to dismiss. This court held that where the trial court considered affidavits outside of the pleadings in\\n1182 ruling on the motion plaintiffs were entitled to notice that the motion to dismiss had been converted to one for \\n*1182 summary judgment as well as an opportunity to file opposing materials. Jensen v. Klecker is inapplicable\\nhere since the court in this case ruled upon defendant's motion for summary judgment. Not only did plaintiffs\\nreceive notice through the filing of the motion itself but had ample opportunity to file materials in opposition to it\\nas evidenced by their motion and brief filed in response.\\nII. Summary Judgment.\\nSummary judgment is granted only where the record clearly demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact\\nexists and that the movant is entitled, as a matter of law, to judgment in his favor. Glover v. National Broadcasting\\nCo., Inc., 594 F.2d 715, 717 (8th Cir. 1979). It should not be entered unless the movant has established his right\\nto judgment \\\"with such clarity as to leave no room for controversy and that the other party is not entitled to\\nrecover under any discernible circumstances.\\\" Robert Johnson Co. v. Chemical Interchange Co., 541 F.2d 207,\\n209 (8th Cir. 1976). It is, however, up to the party opposing the motion to set forth specific facts showing a\\ngenuine issue for trial. Glover v. National Broadcasting Co., 594 F.2d at 717.\\nA. Inspection of Inmate Mail.\\n1. Non-privileged mail.\\nPlaintiffs contend that the routine inspection of incoming and outgoing nonlegal mail constitutes a violation of their\\ncivil rights. Defendants concede that all nonlegal mail, both incoming and outgoing, is routinely inspected for\\ncontraband. In Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) the Supreme Court set\\ndown guidelines for determining when the censorships of inmate mail was proper. In doing so the court stated:\\n[T]he legitimate governmental interest in the order and security of penal institutions justifies the\\nimposition of certain restraints on inmate correspondence.... [I]t is not our purpose to survey the\\nrange of circumstances in which particular restrictions on prisoner mail might be warranted by the\\nlegitimate demands of prison administration as they exist from time to time in the various kinds of\\npenal institutions found in this country.\\nProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. at 412-13, 94 S.Ct. at 1810-11.\\nThe Supreme Court implicitly approved the opening of non-privileged mail to inspect for contraband in Wolff v.\\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), decided shortly after Martinez. There the Court\\npointed out \\\"freedom from censorship is not equivalent to freedom from inspection or perusal.\\\" Id. at 576, 94\\nS.Ct. at 2984. Non-privileged inmate mail is clearly not immune to inspection, thus such inspections cannot give\\n\\nrise to civil rights violations. Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F.2d 748 (5th Cir. 1978); Laaman v. Helgemoe, 437 F.Supp.\\n269 (D.N.H.1977); Stover v. Carlson, 413 F.Supp. 718 (D.Conn.1976); United States Ex Rel. Dean v. Johnson,\\n381 F.Supp. 495 (E.D.Pa.1974). It seems clear under these cases that the mere inspection of nonlegal incoming\\nand outgoing mail poses no threat to plaintiffs' civil rights. Summary judgment on this point was proper.\\n2. Privileged mail.\\nPrivileged prisoner mail, that is mail to or from an inmate's attorney and identified as such, may not be opened for\\ninspections for contraband except in the presence of the prisoner. Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 576-77, 94\\nS.Ct. 2963, 2984-85, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Many of the exhibits introduced by plaintiffs as examples of legal\\nmail simply do not appear to come within the parameters of the attorney-client mail privilege. See Wolff v.\\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. at 576, 94 S.Ct. at 2984. For example, a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union\\naddressed to President, Wallstreet Jaycees, and bearing no other markings, obviously does not fall within the\\nscope of that privilege. Wolff requires that all such mail be specially marked as originating from an attorney, with\\n1183 that attorneys *1183 name and address.[4] However, one exhibit, a copy of a letter from the National Prison\\nProject, bearing the name of an attorney and which was stamped \\\"Lawyer Client Mail 00 Do Not Open Except In\\n97\\nPresence of Prisoner\\\" and which was addressed to plaintiff Jensen appears to come well within the definition of\\nattorney-client mail. This would tend to rebut defendants' claim that the mail opened was not clearly marked.\\nCoupled with plaintiffs' assertions that the opening of such mail was done deliberately and on a continuing basis,\\nand contrasted with the defendants' vague claim that in the case of clearly marked mail some mistakes were\\nmade, this indicates that some factual issues remain to be resolved on this point. Accordingly, summary judgment\\nis vacated as to this issue and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings.\\nB. Interception of food parcel.\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that a food package sent by his brother was not given to him but was returned, via\\nmail, to sender by prison officials. Defendants do not deny plaintiffs allegations. Affidavits and exhibits indicate\\nthat inmates were informed approximately six weeks prior to arrival of package that no more food parcels would\\nbe allowed. Institutions may impose restrictions on the receipt of packages from outside the penitentiaries. Bell v.\\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 555, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1882, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F.2d 748 (5th\\nCir. 1978). The district court properly granted summary judgment on this issue.\\nC. Deductions from inmate accounts.\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that deducting postage costs above the two free letters per week allowed each\\nprisoner without a signed voucher to show accountability by prison officials deprives him of his property without\\ndue process. The deprivation of property without due process is cognizable under section 1983. Lynch v.\\nHousehold Finance, 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972). However, it appears that no basis for\\nrecovery exists in this case. Both parties concede that the deductions made from the inmates account are done\\nso in accordance with prison regulations. Exhibits indicate that a log was kept indicating the amount deducted,\\nthe date and the destination of each letter or parcel mailed and that inmates are regularly furnished with monthly\\nstatements of their account and may obtain copies of the postal log on request.\\nInmates have no established right to be provided with unlimited free access to the mails. See Tate v. Kassulke,\\n409 F.Supp. 651 (W.D.Ken.1975). It is important to note that this issue does not involve a forfeiture of property or\\na penalty. Rather, it is in the nature of an assessment for value received. Plaintiffs do not contend that they did\\nnot receive the services for which they are charged. Nor do they cite any precedent relating to accountability\\nrequirements as they pertain to inmate accounts. Clearly, as the warden indicates in his affidavit, requiring a\\nsigned voucher for each postage charge incurred by each inmate would be unfeasible. Not only are there no\\nfactual issues remaining to be resolved but there appears no basis for a claim under section 1983. While plaintiffs\\nobviously have a property interest in the funds on deposit in their inmate accounts, they have failed to show that\\n\\nthey were unlawfully deprived of their property or that they have been deprived of their property without due\\nprocess. Summary judgment in favor of defendants on this issue was proper.\\nD. Matters pertaining to the Wallstreet Jaycees.\\n1184 The two remaining claims of plaintiffs deal with matters relating to the Wallstreet *1184 Jaycees. The Wallstreet\\nJaycees was an inmate organization which, as part of its fundraising activities, was permitted to operate the\\ninmate commissary concession stand. To purchase items from the concession stand inmates were permitted to\\npurchase Jaycee scrip since inmates are not permitted to have currency in their possession. Each book of scrip\\nissued bears the prisoner's name, identification number and date of issue. Each ticket is stamped with the\\nprisoner's penitentiary identification number. Tickets are non-negotiable if detached from the ticket book and the\\nscrip is non-transferable. All legitimate transfers of scrip were logged at the time of purchase at the concession\\nstand. The Wallstreet Jaycees were suspended from operation by the prison administration for activities in\\nviolation of prison regulations, e. g., depletion of funds. The organization's charter was subsequently revoked by\\nthe state and local Jaycee organizations. Affidavits introduced by defendants indicate that a new Jaycee\\norganization is in the process of being formed.\\n1. Unauthorized scrip.\\nThis claim arose when prison officials determined that all unused, authorized scrip held by inmates would be\\nredeemed. The term \\\"authorized\\\" refers to scrip bearing the identification number of inmate holding it. Plaintiffs\\ndemand to be reimbursed for all scrip held by them. They do not contend that it is authorized. Instead, they\\nmaintain that, apparently by virtue of possession, they are entitled to redemption. Refusal to redeem the scrip,\\naccording to plaintiffs, amounts to a deprivation of property without due process. In Sell v. Parratt, 548 F.2d 753\\n(8th Cir. 1977),cert. denied,434 U.S. 873, 98 S.Ct. 220, 54 L.Ed.2d 152, this court found a cognizable claim\\nunder section 1983 where money held by inmates in violation of prison regulations was confiscated and\\ndeposited in the Inmate's Welfare Fund. We found that while the regulations prohibited inmates from possessing\\ncurrency, they did not authorize the forfeiture of currency illegally possessed and upheld the district court order\\nrequiring the money credited to the account of the incarcerated plaintiff. This case differs in that here plaintiffs\\nassert a property right in the redemption of unauthorized scrip which is by prison regulation void if held by anyone\\nother than the inmate to which the scrip was issued. It appears that plaintiffs failed to show a valid property right,\\nmuch less a deprivation. Holder v. Claar, 459 F.Supp. 850, 852 (D.Colo.1978). The district court was correct in\\ngranting summary judgment.\\n2. Finally, plaintiffs theorize a violation of their civil rights in that prison officials at the time of the administrative\\nsuspension of the Wallstreet Jaycees confiscated concession stand equipment belonging to the organization and\\nthe organization's treasury. Plaintiffs seek an accounting. Defendants in their motion for summary judgment\\nassert that prior to bringing this action plaintiffs failed to request a formal accounting, but that in any event one\\nhas since been provided through interrogatories. Affidavits and exhibits submitted by defendants show that\\n$765.82 is on deposit in the Wallstreet Jaycee savings account in the Bank of North Dakota and $86.27 in a\\nbusiness account at the North Dakota State Penitentiary and that the concession equipment is in storage at the\\npenitentiary. Defendants maintain and introduce supporting affidavits to show that the charter of the Wallstreet\\nJaycees has been terminated by both the state and national organizations and that a new Jaycee organization is\\nbeing formed. Defendants state that once a new Jaycee organization has been formed all assets of the now\\ndefunct Wallstreet Jaycees will be transferred to the new organization. It is difficult to see how plaintiffs have\\nbeen harmed. There appears to be no actual deprivation of property here and in any event it would seem that\\nplaintiffs have already gotten the accounting they requested. Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on\\nthis issue.\\nAccordingly, summary judgment with regard to the issue of attorney-client mail is hereby vacated and the issue\\n1185 remanded for further proceedings. The district court's *1185 granting of summary judgment as to the other issues\\ndiscussed above is hereby affirmed.\\n\\n[1] Kenneth Hagle was recently released from NDSP on parole.\\n[2] The district court had previously dismissed the action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) for failure to state a claim\\nbut in doing so had considered and relied upon matters outside the pleadings without treating the motion to\\ndismiss as a motion for summary judgment and without giving plaintiffs notice of the courts intent to do so as\\nrequired by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).

Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, pro se.\\nRobert P. Brady, Asst. Atty. Gen., Bismarck, N. D., on brief, for appellees.\\nBefore LAY, ROSS and HENLEY, Circuit Judges.\\nPER CURIAM.\\nHerbert O. Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, inmates of the North Dakota State Penitentiary, sued North Dakota state\\nofficials, including the Director of Institutions, the penitentiary warden and the penitentiary accountant, for\\ndamages and declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983. Their complaint was dismissed pursuant\\nto Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court considered\\nand relied upon matters outside the pleadings without treating the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary\\njudgment and without giving Jensen and Hagle notice of its intent to do so, as he was required to do by\\nFed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) and 56(c). We therefore reverse and remand.\\nJensen and Hagle alleged that certain prison officials allowed inmates to form the Wallstreet Jaycees, a group\\noperating a concession stand in the penitentiary at which prison scrip was the medium of exchange. Funds in the\\ninmates' personal financial accounts were exchanged for scrip through the penitentiary business office on a dollar\\nfor dollar basis. When discharged, inmates received up to $25 reimbursement for unused scrip.\\nThe complaint alleged that in August 1977 prison officials suspended the Jaycee chapter, closed the stand and\\ncollected all unused scrip, providing inmates with receipts. Thereafter, the general membership of the Jaycee\\nchapter voted that funds in the business office Jaycee account be transferred in appropriate amounts to the\\nindividual accounts of all inmates who held receipts. Jensen held a receipt for $6.45 and Hagle held receipts\\ntotaling $142.25. They allege that they have not been reimbursed, and claim that defendants' refusal to transfer\\nfunds to their accounts violates the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments.\\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, with a supporting brief and affidavit.\\nThey asserted they were not the real parties in interest and that no constitutionally protected right had been\\ninfringed by the actions alleged. The district court granted the motion. The court stated that it had considered\\ndefendants' motion to dismiss, the pleadings and defendants' affidavit and brief. Facts not alleged in the\\ncomplaint, but set forth in the affidavit of prison warden Havener were recited and relied upon in the court's\\n245 opinion.[1] The court held that the dispute was between plaintiffs and a group of other inmates, the Wallstreet \\n*245 Jaycees, and not with the prison officials. The court also held that plaintiffs' allegation that scrip had not\\nbeen redeemed did not state a claim of constitutional dimensions.\\nWhen the district court considered defendants' affidavit in deciding the motion to dismiss, it was required to treat\\nthe motion as one for summary judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b); Carter v. Stanton, 405 U.S. 669, 671, 92 S.Ct.\\n1232, 31 L.Ed.2d 569 (1972); Goodman v. Parwatikar, 570 F.2d 801, 803 (8th Cir. 1978); Ailshire v. Darnell, 508\\n\\nF.2d 526, 527 (8th Cir. 1974). However, there is no indication in the record that the court notified Jensen and\\nHagle of its intent or that it gave them an opportunity to file opposing materials, as is required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56\\n(c). We require strict compliance with the provisions of Rule 56, Ailshire v. Darnell, supra, 508 F.2d at 528, and\\nwe have held that notice may not be omitted even when more than 10 days have elapsed between filing of the\\nmotion and dismissal. See Winfrey v. Brewer, 570 F.2d 761, 764 (8th Cir. 1978).\\nAlthough Jensen and Hagle submitted exhibits and affidavits with their pro se trial brief, they did so a month\\nbefore defendants' motion to dismiss and supporting affidavit were filed. There is no indication they received\\nnotice that the warden's affidavit would be considered and the motion to dismiss thereby converted to one for\\nsummary judgment, so that failure to file an opposing affidavit could result in an adverse judgment.\\nDefendants argue that the district court's failure to comply with the Rule 56(c) notice requirement was not\\nprejudicial, because Jensen and Hagle were notified by a local rule to submit briefs in opposition to the motion\\nwithin 10 days. However, Rules 12(b) and 56(c) contemplate an opportunity to file more than briefs. A pro se brief\\nwas held not to constitute \\\"the type of meaningful opposition contemplated by Rule 56\\\" in Winfrey v. Brewer,\\nsupra, 570 F.2d at 764. Plaintiffs' attempt to refute the affidavit by \\\"exhibits,\\\" materials not presented to the trial\\ncourt but filed on appeal, indicates that they might well have taken advantage of a meaningful opportunity to\\noppose the affidavit.\\nWhen the complaint is given the liberal construction ordinarily accorded pro se civil rights complaints, we are not\\nconvinced to a certainty that Jensen and Hagle would not be entitled to relief under any state of facts which they\\ncould prove in support of their claim.

Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957).\\nClaims of intentional deprivation of a prisoner's property under color of state law are actionable under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\n1983.

We suggest to the district court that it consider\\nappointing counsel to assist the plaintiffs in this case.\\n[1] These facts were: The stand was closed for good and sufficient reasons.

Jensen appeals from the district court's  denial of his motion for relief from judgment under\\nFed.R.Civ.P. 60(b).\\nThis action was brought by Jensen against various state authorities alleging that legal mail was being opened\\nand not delivered to him at the North Dakota state prison. To \\\"protect his rights,\\\" he filed liens on the personal\\nand real property of all the defendants with the Registrars of Deeds in several North Dakota counties.\\nIn response, the defendants filed a \\\"Motion For An Order to Give Notice of All Liens Filed and to Remove All\\nLiens Filed\\\" with the district court. The \\\"motion\\\" also requested the court to assess damages. The district court\\nordered Jensen to give the defendants a list of all the liens he had filed and to file releases of all the liens with the\\nappropriate county officers, and prohibited Jensen from filing further liens without court approval. Jensen\\ncomplied with this order and the defendants repeated their \\\"motion\\\" for damages. On February 3, 1982 the\\ndistrict court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment on the mail issue, and denied the defendants'\\nmotion for damages.\\nOn July 15, 1982 the district court sua sponte amended its order dismissing the damages claim by adding the\\nphrase \\\"for lack of jurisdiction.\\\" Formal notice was not given to the defendants or to Jensen prior to entry of the\\norder. Jensen claims that he did not receive a copy of the order after entry. While the district court file does not\\nindicate that a copy was sent to him, it does show that a copy was sent to his attorney of record. Jensen,\\nhowever, claims that he did not receive a copy of the order until September 7, when he was given a copy in\\nconnection with another lawsuit. On September 10 he filed a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) requesting the\\ndistrict court to reconsider the amended judgment on the grounds that (1) he never received notice of the\\namended judgment, and (2) the district court had jurisdiction over the damages claim. The district court denied\\nthe motion, and Jensen appealed.\\nThe standard of review for denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is whether the district court abused its discretion. \\nBrowder v. Director, 434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 560 n. 7, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); Knox v. Lichtenstein,\\n654 F.2d 19, 21 (8th Cir.1981). Further, this court cannot use review of a 60(b) motion to review an underlying\\ndecision which was not appealed. E.g., Clark v. Wyrick, 538 F.2d 1327 (8th Cir.1976),cert. denied, 429 U.S.\\n1062, 97 S.Ct. 788, 50 L.Ed.2d 778 (1977). Thus, the district court's order amending the judgment, even if\\n[2]\\nquestionable,  is not reviewable. Only the denial of Jensen's motion may be considered.\\n\\nJensen should have challenged the order by a timely Rule 52(b) motion seeking further amendment or by a\\ntimely appeal. The time limits for these actions had passed by the time Jensen filed his Rule 60(b) motion with\\nthe court. If no notice of the amending order had been served or received, perhaps relief might be merited. See \\nCoclin Tobacco Co. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 353 F.2d 727, 728 (2d Cir.1965). However, the record\\nshows Jensen's attorney received a copy of the order. See Bennett v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 396 F.2d 909,\\n911 (9th Cir.1968). There is no reason to consider under Rule 60(b) a motion which could have been made under\\nanother rule if the litigant had acted in a timely manner. See Lester v. Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 653 F.2d\\n353 (8th Cir.1981).\\nBecause we find no abuse of discretion, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.\\n[1] The Honorable Bruce M.

Jobs in the bakery and deli departments fall into one classification, jobs in the produce\\ndepartment another. Two facts give rise to this litigation: pay in the produce department is higher, and workers\\nare not distributed uniformly by sex. Most bakery and deli workers are women, while most produce workers are\\nmen. Plaintiffs, a class of women who work in the deli and bakery departments, contend that the difference\\nviolates both the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 206(d), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Kohl's replies\\nthat plaintiffs are short-sighted: employees in the produce department are included within a pay category called\\n\\\"regular clerks,\\\" most of whom are female. That most regular clerks in the produce department are men does not\\nundercut the fact that most regular clerks store-wide are women, Kohl's insists. The employer adds that women\\nwho want to be regular clerks in or out of the produce department do not face any discrimination in hiring or\\ntransfer. None of the class representatives applied for transfer to the produce department or another regular-clerk\\nposition; instead they want higher pay for their existing work. The ratio of wages between \\\"department clerks\\\"\\n(the jobs plaintiffs occupy) and \\\"regular clerks,\\\" Kohl's insists, is a subject for collective bargaining rather than for\\nlitigation.\\nAfter allowing the parties to conduct extensive discovery, the district court granted summary judgment for Kohl's\\non the Title VII claim. The judge exhaustively analyzed the duties of bakery, deli, and produce workers and\\nconcluded that plaintiffs could not demonstrate that Kohl's explanation for placing produce positions in the\\n\\\"regular clerk\\\" classification was a pretext for sex discrimination. (The class includes supervisors and argues that\\nbakery and deli managers do the same work as produce managers. Because the supervisors' arguments track\\nthose of the clerks, we use \\\"clerks\\\" as a generic term to simplify exposition.) Kohl's insisted that produce workers\\nexercise greater discretion in displaying and culling produce and that produce jobs also are physically harder\\nthan bakery or deli jobs. The district judge concluded: \\\"Plaintiffs have produced no persuasive evidence\\nsuggesting that defendants did not honestly believe this justification or that it is a cover for discrimination.\\\"\\nHonest belief is not enough under the Equal Pay Act, however, because that statute (unlike Title VII) does not\\nrequire intent to discriminate. Section 206(d)(1) provides:\\nNo employer.. shall discriminate.. between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to\\nemployees.. at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite\\nsex for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and\\nresponsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such\\npayment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which\\n\\nmeasures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other\\nfactor other than sex[.]\\nThe district judge concluded that two questions under this statute could be resolved only by trial: whether the\\npositions in question are \\\"jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which\\nare performed under similar working conditions\\\" and, if so, whether the pay differential nonetheless is \\\"based on\\nany other factor other than sex\\\". A trial culminated in a special verdict that answered the equal-work question in\\nthe negative; the jury then did not address the \\\"factor other than sex\\\" defense.\\nA substantial portion of plaintiffs' appellate brief is devoted to contending that the district judge should not have\\n923 granted summary judgment on the Title *923 VII theory. Yet it is hard to see how this can matter, given the jury's\\nverdict on the Equal Pay Act theory. If (as the jury determined) the bakery, deli, and produce jobs are not\\nsubstantially equal, then plaintiffs can't show sex discrimination. Title VII does not require equal wages for\\ncomparable work, see American Nurses' Association v. Illinois, 783 F.2d 716 (7th Cir. 1986), or even for identical\\nwork. Identical jobs with different wages do not violate Title VII, provided that all employees may freely select\\nwhich job to perform. Plaintiffs' Title VII claim thus is untenable00no matter the validity of the jury's special verdict,\\n97\\nwhich we address below00 unless Kohl's discriminated when hiring for the different classifications.\\n97\\nPlaintiffs make much of evidence that until the late 1960s Kohl's not only discouraged women from applying for\\ncertain positions but also had sex-segregated wage classifications. This practice is long gone, and no vestige of\\nthe discrimination survives. Wage schedules were merged 31 years ago, and, unlike the situation in Bazemore v.\\nFriday, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986), women hired during the discriminatory period today\\nreceive the same wages as men hired at the same time. What remains is the possibility that Kohl's steered\\napplicants by sex or selectively offered them transfer opportunities. Loyd v. Phillips Brothers, Inc., 25 F.3d 518,\\n524-25 (7th Cir. 1994). Neither the plaintiffs' charge of discrimination filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity\\nCommission nor their arguments to the district court contended that Kohl's today steers women to bakery and\\ndeli jobs, or did so at any time within the period of limitations. Plaintiffs disavow a steering claim but contend that\\nKohl's history is informative on the wage-discrimination claim. The district judge did not see how; neither do we.\\nClaims under the Equal Pay Act differ from comparable-worth arguments because proof that the two jobs are of\\nthe same (or comparable) value to the employer or society as a whole, or depend on similar effort or education,\\ngets the plaintiff nowhere. To succeed under the Equal Pay Act the plaintiff must establish that the positions entail\\nsubstantially equal tasks, performed under similar conditions. (The Act just says \\\"equal,\\\" but it is common ground\\nthat \\\"equal\\\" does not mean \\\"identical\\\"; otherwise the employer could defeat an Equal Pay Act suit by adding an\\ninconsequential and pointless chore to one of the jobs. Opinions commonly use the formula \\\"substantially equal\\\"\\nto express the idea that trivial differences do not matter. See Fallon v. Illinois, 882 F.2d 1206, 1208 (7th Cir. 1989)\\n; Epstein v. Secretary of the Treasury, 739 F.2d 274, 277 (7th Cir. 1984). We follow that convention.) Kohl's\\nprovided the jury with plenty of evidence that tasks in the produce department differ substantially from those\\nperformed by bakery and deli workers. Produce workers do more heavy lifting and must exercise judgment about\\n(for example) which fruit is ripe, which should be marked down, and how the produce should be displayed to\\nmaximize sales. Bakery and deli workers, by contrast, stock displays according to more mechanical\\nspecifications and use printed expiration dates rather than judgment to determine when inventory should be\\nrotated or removed. Although a rational jury might have disbelieved this evidence or concluded that the\\ndifferences are too slight to matter, and thus returned a verdict in plaintiffs' favor, a verdict for Kohl's is\\ninvulnerable unless spoiled by trial error.\\nPlaintiffs contend that the exclusion of their expert witness is such an error. Howard Risher, a self-employed\\nconsultant with a Ph.D. in labor relations and economics, who teaches an undergraduate course on human\\nresources as an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania, prepared a report reaching conclusions\\nfavorable to plaintiffs. Stripped of self-congratulatory dross, this report is three pages long and consists of a list of\\n924 clerks' duties and an unreasoned *924 assertion that all three departments' positions are \\\"virtually identical in\\nterms of their basic function and are substantially equal in terms of skill, effort, responsibility and working\\nconditions.\\\" The only support for this conclusion, however, is the list, with entries such as \\\"[p]reparing products\\nfor display\\\" and \\\"[m]aintaining equipment\\\". Risher did not analyze what the clerks do to achieve these objectives,\\nand the district court concluded that a list plus a bald assertion would not assist the trier of fact. Fed.R.Evid. 702.\\n\\nRisher's deposition was as skeletal as his report; asked how employees at Kohl's carry out their duties, Risher\\nreplied only with variants on \\\"I couldn't tell you\\\" and \\\"I have no idea\\\". Apparently Risher thinks that job\\ndescriptions trump actual tasks, a sorry misunderstanding of the Equal Pay Act. See Soto v. Adams Elevator\\nEquipment Co., 941 F.2d 543, 548 (7th Cir. 1991); Fallon, 882 F.2d at 1208. The district judge's decision to\\nprevent Risher from testifying, far from being an abuse of discretion, see General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S.\\n136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997), was absolutely correct. Many times we have emphasized that\\nexperts' work is admissible only to the extent it is reasoned, uses the methods of the discipline, and is founded on\\ndata. Talking off the cuff00 deploying neither data nor analysis00is not an acceptable methodology. See, e.g., \\n97 97\\nMcMahon v. Bunn-O-Matic Corp., 150 F.3d 651, 657-58 (7th Cir. 1998); Mid-State Fertilizer Co. v. Exchange\\nNational Bank, 877 F.2d 1333, 1339 (7th Cir. 1989).\\nRisher also prepared a supplemental report, based on his discussion with eight bakery or deli workers in a \\\"focus\\ngroup.\\\" This report did little more than parrot these women's belief that bakery and deli duties require as much\\nskill as produce duties. Relaying the plaintiffs' likely testimony is not an example of expertise. Huey v. United\\nParcel Service, Inc., 165 F.3d 1084, 1086-87 (7th Cir. 1999). The report's final paragraph, however, says that\\nRisher \\\"used the Willis job evaluation system to confirm that the jobs would be evaluated the same in each\\ndepartment\\\" and concluded that \\\"the jobs would be evaluated exactly the same\\\". Risher does not explain how the\\n\\\"Willis job evaluation system\\\" works (or cite published literature providing that background), what data he used as\\ninputs, or what outputs were obtained. Charts attached to the report are unintelligible without explanation, and\\nRisher provided none. Readers must take everything on faith, and that alone would be good reason to exclude\\nRisher's conclusion. See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999).\\nThe few references to the Willis system in the legal literature suggest that it is designed to identify comparable\\nworth, rather than substantially equal tasks. See AFSCME v. Washington, 770 F.2d 1401, 1403, 1406, 1408 (9th\\nCir. 1985) (Kennedy, J.) (holding, on this ground, that Willis evaluations are unavailing). All plaintiffs do in\\nresponse is assert that the Willis system is \\\"a recognized job evaluation system\\\" that is \\\"widely used by\\nbusinesses\\\"00which does nothing to fill in the blanks of Risher's report or demonstrate that the Willis inquiry was\\n97\\nrelevant to this litigation.\\nPlaintiffs challenge a second evidentiary decision, which the parties call the \\\"outlier ruling.\\\" Kohl's operates stores\\nthroughout Wisconsin. Some are much larger than others, and size affects not only the number of employees in\\neach department but also the tasks to be done. Plaintiffs sought to compare the busiest bakery and deli jobs with\\nthe lightest produce jobs; Kohl's naturally would have preferred the converse. But the judge instructed both sides\\nto compare the tasks of median jobs rather than the outliers at the largest and smallest stores. Plaintiffs contend\\nthat this ruling prevented them from showing that some bakery and deli jobs are substantially equal (in lifting,\\nresponsibility, and so on) to some produce jobs, indeed are more taxing than some produce jobs. As plaintiffs see\\n925 things, the *925 Equal Pay Act requires a person-by-person comparison rather than a categorical one.\\nTo the extent plaintiffs rely on the proposition that employers cannot make up arbitrary categories and insist that\\nthese be the basis of comparison, they get no quarrel from us (or from the district judge). See Thompson v.\\nSawyer, 678 F.2d 257, 274-75 (D.C.Cir. 1982). But Kohl's did not make up the \\\"department clerk\\\" and \\\"regular\\nclerk\\\" categories for this litigation, nor did it unilaterally decide to use the same wage scale throughout the state;\\nthe classifications and wages are the result of collective bargaining. Labor agreements frequently apply to all of\\nan employer's sites, and these agreements are \\\"factor[s] other than sex\\\" that explain why the pay is identical at\\nlarge and small stores even though the tasks differ. If all plaintiffs have to go on is the difference across stores,\\nthen they have nothing, for this variation in the ratio between pay and the difficulty of employees' tasks is so\\nobviously unrelated to sex that Kohl's would have been entitled to summary judgment under \\u00a7 206(d)(1)(iv). To\\nget anywhere, plaintiffs had to make a categorical comparison between \\\"department clerk\\\" positions and \\\"regular\\nclerk\\\" positions. Class treatment is appropriate only if there are common issues of fact00that is, only if it is\\n97\\npossible to compare all \\\"department clerk\\\" positions in bakery and deli departments with all \\\"regular clerk\\\"\\npositions in produce departments. The district court's outlier ruling ensured that the premise of class certification\\n(granted at plaintiffs' behest) would not be subverted. It was not an abuse of discretion.\\nTwo challenges to the jury instructions require only brief mention.\\n\\nFirst, the instructions told the jury that it must determine whether the positions are \\\"substantially the same\\\" rather\\nthan \\\"substantially equal.\\\" Plaintiffs express concern that the jury would treat \\\"same\\\" as equivalent to \\\"identical,\\\"\\nwhich these positions concededly were not. But using the word \\\"equal\\\" could lead to the same (an equal?)\\nmisunderstanding. Modifying either word with \\\"substantially\\\" overcomes the problem. The phrases \\\"substantially\\nthe same\\\" and \\\"substantially equal\\\" are substantially identical. The special interrogatory forms told the jury to\\ndetermine whether the positions were \\\"substantially the same,\\\" and the district judge sensibly tracked that\\nlanguage in the instructions; otherwise the jury could have been confused by a difference between the\\ninstructions and the verdict forms.\\nSecond, plaintiffs contend that the judge erred by telling the jury that documentary evidence such as position\\ndescriptions and training manuals00evidence that plaintiffs contend shows that bakery, deli, and produce positions\\n97\\nhave the same tasks00\\\"could not be considered.\\\" An instruction saying this would indeed be erroneous, for an\\n97\\nemployer's manuals and descriptions are relevant to the question what the positions actually entail. But plaintiffs\\ndo not identify the supposedly erroneous instruction, and we could not find one that tells the jury not to \\\"consider\\\"\\npaper evidence. What the judge actually told the jury is that a decision should not be \\\"based upon job titles or job\\ndescriptions\\\" but instead depends on \\\"actual job duties and performance requirements.\\\" That instruction was\\nabsolutely correct. Training manuals and the like were relevant only to the extent they accurately described the\\nactual job duties.\\nLast but not least is plaintiffs' contention that the district judge erred in informing the jury that the EEOC had\\nfound in Kohl's favor on plaintiffs' charge of discrimination under the Equal Pay Act. Before trial the district judge\\ngranted a motion in limine barring Kohl's from informing the jury about the EEOC'S decision, but the judge\\nchanged her mind after plaintiffs' counsel told the jury that Kohl's agreed \\\"under pressure of this lawsuit\\\" to\\n926 reduce the pay differential among the departments. *926 Kohl's replied that the \\\"pressure\\\" came from its unions\\nin collective bargaining, not from the suit; to add oomph to this assertion Kohl's wanted to inform the jury that the\\nEEOC took a dim view of plaintiffs' chances. If even the EEOC did not support plaintiffs, Kohl's sought to argue,\\nthen the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" could not have made a difference. This led the district judge to inform the jury\\nabout the EEOC'S conclusion, in this language:\\nAt the time of the 1998 collective bargaining negotiations Kohl's had a determination from the\\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission that it had not discriminated against bakery and deli\\nmanagers and clerks on the basis of their pay. At plaintiffs' request that the determination by the\\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission be reconsidered, the EEOC rescinded its\\ndetermination. Before any redetermination had issued, plaintiffs' attorney decided to proceed with\\nthis lawsuit and therefore no determination was ever issued thereafter by the Equal Employment\\nOpportunity Commission.\\nBy asserting that the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" led to a change, plaintiffs' counsel implied that the suit had merit00\\n97\\nand that Kohl's knew that it had merit. Kohl's was entitled to counteract this implication, the district judge thought,\\nby showing that what Kohl's knew implied that it would prevail on the merits.\\nMany decisions by the EEOC are superficial, little more than precursors to right-to-sue letters. But this one was\\nmore thorough. Here is the Commission's own description:\\nOur equal payment investigation considered whether or not the actual job duties of the deli and\\nbakery manager positions and the deli and bakery clerk positions were substantially equal with\\nrespect to skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions as those of the produce manager and\\nproduce clerk positions. To that end, detailed equal pay interviews were conducted with various\\nincumbents of the produce manager and produce clerk positions. These interviews reflected that\\nthe produce jobs were dirtier, required more physical lifting of greater weight, more items with\\ngreater frequency than the deli and bakery jobs. Moreover, the produce areas are significantly\\nlarger than the deli and bakery areas in terms of physical square footage. There are far more\\nitems in produce than in deli and bakery and produce accounts for a greater percentage of store\\nsales, i.e., higher sales volume. Produce employees are frequently called upon to help out in other\\nareas of the store stocking the dairy case, retrieving the carts, et cetera. As a result, our\\n\\ninvestigation concluded that the jobs in question did not meet the required equal pay test and that\\nthey are not substantially equal with respect to effort, responsibility, skill or working conditions.\\nIt is understandable that plaintiffs wanted to keep this damning passage from the jury's eyes, and they\\nsucceeded. The jury never learned the reasoning behind the EEOC'S decision. Why plaintiffs' counsel, having\\nsecured a ruling excluding even a mention of the EEOC'S bottom line, then opened the door is a mystery. Still,\\nplaintiffs say, the jury should not have been told about the EEOC'S conclusion because, by the time Kohl's\\nagreed to reduce the pay differential to 5\\u00a2 per hour, the EEOC had rescinded its conclusion, so that the report did\\nnot counteract the inference for which counsel argued.\\nAfter receiving the EEOC'S report (and the accompanying right-to-sue letter) in September 1997, plaintiffs asked\\nthe EEOC to reconsider. In December 1997 the EEOC'S District Director withdrew both the conclusion and the\\nright-to-sue letter pending further review. See 29 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1601.19(b). Before the EEOC could do any further\\n927 investigation, plaintiffs asked for a new right-to-sue letter, which the EEOC was obliged to issue forthwith. 29 *927\\nC.F.R. \\u00a7 1601.28. Once it sent the right-to-sue letter, the EEOC called off its investigation and neither reissued\\nthe original report nor prepared a new one. The upshot was that, when plaintiffs filed their suit, there was no\\noutstanding adverse decision by the EEOC. When she told the jury about the EEOC'S conclusion, the district\\njudge was under the impression that the negotiations to which plaintiffs' counsel referred took place before the\\nDistrict Director's order in December 1997. On learning that this was not so, the judge did not instruct the jurors\\nto disregard the report (a direction that would have been futile in any event, sort of like telling the jurors that for\\nthe remainder of the trial none of them was allowed to say the word \\\"rhinoceros\\\" to himself).\\nWas there a significant chance that the jury would misunderstand the significance of the EEOC'S decision, and\\nthe purpose for which it had been used00a chance so large that it requires reversal even under the deferential\\n97\\nstandard used to review a district judge's application of Fed.R.Evid. 403? We think not. Confusion over timing is\\nregrettable, but the judge can't be blamed for the error in the opening passage of the instruction (\\\"At the time of\\nthe 1998 collective bargaining negotiations Kohl's had a determination\\\"..). That language had been drafted by\\nthe parties; the judge used it because the parties agreed on it. Plaintiffs deny that they \\\"stipulated\\\" to the\\nlanguage, but no matter; they did not object to it, and that is that. Fed.R.Civ.P. 51.\\nBecause plaintiffs sought to persuade the jury that Kohl's recognized its culpability, Kohl's was entitled to rebut\\nthis contention using the best available evidence: a decision by the EEOC that the positions were not\\nsubstantially equal. See Paolitto v. John Brown E. & C., Inc., 151 F.3d 60, 65-66 (2d Cir. 1998). Decisions by\\npublic bodies do not vanish into thin air or become un-documents when parties ask for reconsideration or settle\\ntheir differences. See U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.S. 18, 115 S.Ct. 386, 130\\nL.Ed.2d 233 (1994); In re Memorial Hospital of Iowa County, Inc., 862 F.2d 1299 (7th Cir. 1988). When\\nnegotiating with the unions, Kohl's knew the EEOC'S view, which had been withdrawn as a result of plaintiffs'\\nstrategy but had not been disclaimed as erroneous. The 1998 negotiations occurred against a background that\\nincluded the EEOC'S support of Kohl's position, and this was relevant to the strength of the inference that Kohl's\\nand the unions acted under the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" as plaintiffs asserted.\\nDoubtless there was a risk that the jury would overestimate the significance of the EEOC'S ruling; this is why\\nsuch conclusions generally are not admitted (on behalf of either side) in jury trials. See Lathem v. Department of\\nChildren and Youth Services, 172 F.3d 786, 791 (11th Cir. 1999). Plaintiffs note that the jury asked a question\\nabout the report during deliberations, implying that the EEOC'S view assumed unusual significance. By opening\\nthe door to disclosure, however, plaintiffs took that risk; they could not argue as they did and then defang the best\\nresponse. See United States v. McAnderson, 914 F.2d 934, 946 (7th Cir. 1990). Nor can they avoid the\\nconsequence of their opening statement by contending on appeal (as they do) that \\\"[w]hy Kohl's narrowed the\\ngap in late 1998 is entirely peripheral\\\" (emphasis in original). That may be, but it was plaintiffs who injected this\\nsubject into the case and entitled Kohl's to supply an answer. Plaintiffs did not argue to the district judge that the\\nscope of the answer was too prejudicial and never suggested any possible response that was less prejudicial.\\nThe district judge protected plaintiffs' substantial rights by excluding the EEOC'S actual language and reminding\\nthe jury that the conclusion had been rescinded. In response to the jury's question, the judge reread the\\n928 instruction and added that the only issue properly under consideration was \\\"whether the jobs are equal\\\" rather \\n\\n*928 than why Kohl's and the union changed the pay scales in 1998. The evidence and the instructions as a\\nwhole ensured that the jury focused on, and answered, the right questions. Plaintiffs had a fair trial.\\nAFFIRMED\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 240,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"['The case \\\"EEOC v.

As more particularly described in the Statement of Claims \\\\nsection of this Complaint, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission \\\\n(hereafter referred to as \\\"the Commission\\\") alleges that David Thompson, an African American, \\\\nwas unlawfully discharged by the Defendant in retaliation for having filed a charge of \\\\nemployment discrimination based on his race with the Commission.  \\\\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \\\\n1.   Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 451, 1331, 1337, \\\\n1343 and 1345.   This action is authorized and instituted pursuant to Section 706(f)(l) and (3)  of \\\\n\\\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 2 of 7 \\\\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) and (3) (\\\"Title \\\\nVll\\\") and Section 102 oftbe Civil Rights Act of 1991,42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 198la.  \\\\n2.   The employment practice alleged to be unlawful in this Complaint was committed \\\\nwithin the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for Western District of Louisiana, \\\\nShreveport Division.  \\\\nPARTIES \\\\n3.   Plaintiff, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (the \\\"Commission\\\"), is \\\\nthe agency of the United States of America charged with the administration, interpretation and \\\\nenforcement of Title VII, and is expressly authorized to bring this action by Section 706(f)(l) and \\\\n(3) ofTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l) and (3).  \\\\n4.   At all relevant times, the Defendant, Tasa, Inc. d/b/a Orr Minden Country \\\\nChevrolet (the \\\"Employer.  ), has continuously been a Louisiana corporation doing business in the \\\\nState of Louisiana and the City of Minden, and has continuously had at least 15 employees.  \\\\n5.   At all relevant times, Defendant Employer has continuously been an employer \\\\nengaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of Sections 701(b), (g) and (h) of \\\\nTitle VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\u00a7 2000e(b), (g) and (h).  \\\\nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS \\\\n6.   More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, David Thompson \\\\nfiled a charge with the Commission alleging vioiations ofTitle VII by Defendant Employer.   All \\\\nconditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled.  \\\\n2 \\\\n\\\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 3 of 7 \\\\n.. \\\\n7.   Since at least 2003, Defendant Employer engaged in an unlawful employment \\\\nOrr \\\\npractice at its automobile dealership known as  Minden Country Chevrolet in Minden, \\\\nLouisiana, in violation of Section 704 of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 2000e-3.  On October 17, 2003, \\\\nDefendant Employer discharged David Thompson as a result of a charge of employment \\\\ndiscrimination based on race that he filed against the Defendant Employer with the Commission.  \\\\nThe Defendant Employer\\\\'s owner Larry Coker, while aware of David Thompson\\\\'s Commission \\\\ncharge filing, personally discharged Mr. Thompson purportedly for performance, attendance \\\\nand/or attitude issues.   At the time of his discharge, Mr. Thompson had not received any \\\\nemployment-related discipline or warnings by the Defendant Employer.  The Defendant \\\\nEmployer\\\\'s discharge of David Thompson was motivated by the retaliatory animus of its owner \\\\nLarry Coker.  \\\\n8.   The effect of the unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 \\\\nabove has been to deprive David Thompson of equal employment opportunities and to otherwise \\\\nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of discriminatory retaliation.  \\\\n9.   The unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 above was \\\\nintentional.  \\\\n10.   The unlawful employment practice complained of in paragraph 7 above was done \\\\nwith malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of David Thompson.  \\\\n3 \\\\n\\\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 4 of 7 \\\\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \\\\nWherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court:.  \\\\nA.  Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant Employer, its officers, \\\\nsuccessors, assigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in \\\\ndiscriminatory retaliation.  \\\\nB.  Order Defendant Employer to institute and carry out policies, practices, and \\\\nprograms which protect its employees from discriminatory retaliation, and which eradicate the \\\\neffects of its past unlawful employment practice.  \\\\nC.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\\\nappropriate backpay with prejudgment interest, in amounts to be detennined at trial, and other \\\\naffirmative relief necessary to eradicate the effeCts of its unlawful employment practice, \\\\nincluding but not limited to appropriate frontpay.  \\\\nD.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\\\ncompensation for past and future pecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful employment \\\\npractice described in paragraph 7 above, including job-search expenses and medical-related \\\\nexpenses, in amounts to be determined at trial. \\\\nE.  Order Defendant Employer to make whole David Thompson by providing \\\\ncompensation for past and future nonpecuniary losses resulting from the unlawful practice \\\\ncomplained of in paragraph 7 above, including emotional pain, suffering, inconvenience, loss of \\\\nenjoyment of life, and humiliation, in amounts to be determined at trial. \\\\n4 \\\\n\\\\nCase 5:05-cv-01515-DEW-KLH  Document 1-1  Filed 08/22/2005  Page 5 of 7 \\\\n.. \\\\nF.

Jensen, Bismarck, N. D., pro se.\\\\nEdwin F. Zuern, Sp. Asst. Atty. Gen., Bismarck, N. D., for appellees. \\\\nBefore LAY, Chief Judge, and STEPHENSON and McMILLIAN, Circuit Judges. \\\\nPER CURIAM. \\\\n[1]\\\\nHerbert O. Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, inmates at the North Dakota State Penitentiary  appeal from summary\\\\n1181 judgment *1181 granted in favor of defendants.  The decision of the district court is affirmed in part and reversed\\\\nin part for the reasons stated below. \\\\nJensen and Hagle initiated this pro se action under section 1983 against Edward J. Klecker, Director of the North\\\\nDakota Department of Institutions and various other prison officials.  Originally, five separate actions were filed but\\\\nthese were later consolidated into one comprehensive complaint.  That complaint alleges that Hagle\\\\'s and\\\\nJensen\\\\'s civil rights were violated in the following ways:\\\\n(1) that prison officials regularly open all of plaintiff Jensen\\\\'s incoming nonlegal mail without his consent and,\\\\nfurther, that all prisoners are required to deliver all outgoing mail to the prison mail box so that it may be\\\\ninspected prior to sealing;\\\\n(2) that inmates are routinely required to deliver all outgoing legal mail to a prison official who inspects it in the\\\\npresence of the inmate then orders the inmate to seal it and then initials it;\\\\n(3) that from April, 1976, to February, 1980, prison officials, on nine different occasions, willfully and deliberately\\\\nopened clearly marked legal mail addressed to Jensen and that the practice is a continuing one;\\\\n(4) that prison policy permits prison officials to deduct money from inmate financial accounts without vouchers\\\\nsigned by individual inmates to show accountability;\\\\n(5) that on or about December 22, 1978, a package of food mailed to Jensen by his brother was intercepted by\\\\nprison officials and returned, via mail, to the sender;\\\\n(6) that both Jensen and Hagle were deprived of property without due process in that prison officials refused to\\\\nredeem certain inmate scrip held by them; and\\\\n(7) that prison officials are currently in possession of certain items and funds belonging to the Wallstreet Jaycees,\\\\nan inmate organization that was suspended from operation by prison officials and prison officials have not\\\\nreturned the property nor made an accounting to members of that organization remaining in the inmate\\\\npopulation. \\\\n\\\\nAfter reviewing exhibits and affidavits submitted by the parties the district court granted defendant\\\\'s motion for\\\\n[2]\\\\nsummary judgment  from which plaintiffs Jensen and Hagle appeal. \\\\nPlaintiffs challenge the district court\\\\'s decision to grant summary judgment on two grounds:\\\\n(1) that they received no notice of the court\\\\'s intention to rule on the request for summary judgment; and\\\\n(2) that summary judgment was improperly granted in that there exist genuine issues of fact and that defendants\\\\n[3]\\\\nwere not entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\\\nI.  Notice. \\\\nPlaintiff\\\\'s contention that they were not given notice in accord with Jensen v. Klecker, 599 F.2d 243 (8th Cir. 1979)\\\\nis without merit.  Jensen v. Klecker involved an earlier dismissal of this case by the district court through granting\\\\nof a motion to dismiss.  This court held that where the trial court considered affidavits outside of the pleadings in\\\\n1182 ruling on the motion plaintiffs were entitled to notice that the motion to dismiss had been converted to one for \\\\n*1182 summary judgment as well as an opportunity to file opposing materials.  Jensen v. Klecker is inapplicable\\\\nhere since the court in this case ruled upon defendant\\\\'s motion for summary judgment.  Not only did plaintiffs\\\\nreceive notice through the filing of the motion itself but had ample opportunity to file materials in opposition to it\\\\nas evidenced by their motion and brief filed in response. \\\\nII.  Summary Judgment. \\\\nSummary judgment is granted only where the record clearly demonstrates that no genuine issue of material fact\\\\nexists and that the movant is entitled, as a matter of law, to judgment in his favor.  Glover v. National Broadcasting\\\\nCo., Inc., 594 F.2d 715, 717 (8th Cir. 1979).  It should not be entered unless the movant has established his right\\\\nto judgment \\\"with such clarity as to leave no room for controversy and that the other party is not entitled to\\\\nrecover under any discernible circumstances.\\\" Robert Johnson Co. v. Chemical Interchange Co., 541 F.2d 207,\\\\n209 (8th Cir. 1976).  It is, however, up to the party opposing the motion to set forth specific facts showing a\\\\ngenuine issue for trial. Glover v. National Broadcasting Co., 594 F.2d at 717. \\\\nA. Inspection of Inmate Mail. \\\\n1.  Non-privileged mail. \\\\nPlaintiffs contend that the routine inspection of incoming and outgoing nonlegal mail constitutes a violation of their\\\\ncivil rights.  Defendants concede that all nonlegal mail, both incoming and outgoing, is routinely inspected for\\\\ncontraband.  In Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. 396, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) the Supreme Court set\\\\ndown guidelines for determining when the censorships of inmate mail was proper.  In doing so the court stated:\\\\n[T]he legitimate governmental interest in the order and security of penal institutions justifies the\\\\nimposition of certain restraints on inmate correspondence.... [I]t is not our purpose to survey the\\\\nrange of circumstances in which particular restrictions on prisoner mail might be warranted by the\\\\nlegitimate demands of prison administration as they exist from time to time in the various kinds of\\\\npenal institutions found in this country. \\\\nProcunier v. Martinez, 416 U.S. at 412-13, 94 S.Ct. at 1810-11. \\\\nThe Supreme Court implicitly approved the opening of non-privileged mail to inspect for contraband in Wolff v.\\\\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), decided shortly after Martinez.  There the Court\\\\npointed out \\\"freedom from censorship is not equivalent to freedom from inspection or perusal.\\\" Id. at 576, 94\\\\nS.Ct. at 2984.  Non-privileged inmate mail is clearly not immune to inspection, thus such inspections cannot give\\\\n\\\\nrise to civil rights violations.  Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F.2d 748 (5th Cir. 1978); Laaman v. Helgemoe, 437 F.Supp.\\\\n269 (D.N.H.1977); Stover v. Carlson, 413 F.Supp. 718 (D.Conn.1976); United States Ex Rel. Dean v. Johnson,\\\\n381 F.Supp. 495 (E.D.Pa.1974).  It seems clear under these cases that the mere inspection of nonlegal incoming\\\\nand outgoing mail poses no threat to plaintiffs\\\\' civil rights.  Summary judgment on this point was proper. \\\\n2.  Privileged mail. \\\\nPrivileged prisoner mail, that is mail to or from an inmate\\\\'s attorney and identified as such, may not be opened for\\\\ninspections for contraband except in the presence of the prisoner.  Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 576-77, 94\\\\nS.Ct. 2963, 2984-85, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974).  Many of the exhibits introduced by plaintiffs as examples of legal\\\\nmail simply do not appear to come within the parameters of the attorney-client mail privilege.  See Wolff v.\\\\nMcDonnell, 418 U.S. at 576, 94 S.Ct. at 2984.  For example, a letter from the American Civil Liberties Union\\\\naddressed to President, Wallstreet Jaycees, and bearing no other markings, obviously does not fall within the\\\\nscope of that privilege.  Wolff requires that all such mail be specially marked as originating from an attorney, with\\\\n1183 that attorneys *1183 name and address. [4] However, one exhibit, a copy of a letter from the National Prison\\\\nProject, bearing the name of an attorney and which was stamped \\\"Lawyer Client Mail 00 Do Not Open Except In\\\\n97\\\\nPresence of Prisoner\\\" and which was addressed to plaintiff Jensen appears to come well within the definition of\\\\nattorney-client mail.  This would tend to rebut defendants\\\\' claim that the mail opened was not clearly marked. \\\\nCoupled with plaintiffs\\\\' assertions that the opening of such mail was done deliberately and on a continuing basis,\\\\nand contrasted with the defendants\\\\' vague claim that in the case of clearly marked mail some mistakes were\\\\nmade, this indicates that some factual issues remain to be resolved on this point.  Accordingly, summary judgment\\\\nis vacated as to this issue and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings. \\\\nB. Interception of food parcel. \\\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that a food package sent by his brother was not given to him but was returned, via\\\\nmail, to sender by prison officials.  Defendants do not deny plaintiffs allegations.  Affidavits and exhibits indicate\\\\nthat inmates were informed approximately six weeks prior to arrival of package that no more food parcels would\\\\nbe allowed.  Institutions may impose restrictions on the receipt of packages from outside the penitentiaries.  Bell v.\\\\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 555, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1882, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).  Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F.2d 748 (5th\\\\nCir. 1978).  The district court properly granted summary judgment on this issue. \\\\nC. Deductions from inmate accounts. \\\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that deducting postage costs above the two free letters per week allowed each\\\\nprisoner without a signed voucher to show accountability by prison officials deprives him of his property without\\\\ndue process.  The deprivation of property without due process is cognizable under section 1983.  Lynch v.\\\\nHousehold Finance, 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972).  However, it appears that no basis for\\\\nrecovery exists in this case. Both parties concede that the deductions made from the inmates account are done\\\\nso in accordance with prison regulations.  Exhibits indicate that a log was kept indicating the amount deducted,\\\\nthe date and the destination of each letter or parcel mailed and that inmates are regularly furnished with monthly\\\\nstatements of their account and may obtain copies of the postal log on request.', '\\\\nCoupled with plaintiffs\\\\' assertions that the opening of such mail was done deliberately and on a continuing basis,\\\\nand contrasted with the defendants\\\\' vague claim that in the case of clearly marked mail some mistakes were\\\\nmade, this indicates that some factual issues remain to be resolved on this point.  Accordingly, summary judgment\\\\nis vacated as to this issue and the case remanded to the district court for further proceedings. \\\\nB. Interception of food parcel. \\\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that a food package sent by his brother was not given to him but was returned, via\\\\nmail, to sender by prison officials.  Defendants do not deny plaintiffs allegations.  Affidavits and exhibits indicate\\\\nthat inmates were informed approximately six weeks prior to arrival of package that no more food parcels would\\\\nbe allowed.  Institutions may impose restrictions on the receipt of packages from outside the penitentiaries.  Bell v.\\\\nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 555, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1882, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979).  Guajardo v. Estelle, 580 F.2d 748 (5th\\\\nCir. 1978).  The district court properly granted summary judgment on this issue. \\\\nC. Deductions from inmate accounts. \\\\nPlaintiff Jensen complains that deducting postage costs above the two free letters per week allowed each\\\\nprisoner without a signed voucher to show accountability by prison officials deprives him of his property without\\\\ndue process.  The deprivation of property without due process is cognizable under section 1983.  Lynch v.\\\\nHousehold Finance, 405 U.S. 538, 92 S.Ct. 1113, 31 L.Ed.2d 424 (1972).  However, it appears that no basis for\\\\nrecovery exists in this case. Both parties concede that the deductions made from the inmates account are done\\\\nso in accordance with prison regulations.  Exhibits indicate that a log was kept indicating the amount deducted,\\\\nthe date and the destination of each letter or parcel mailed and that inmates are regularly furnished with monthly\\\\nstatements of their account and may obtain copies of the postal log on request. \\\\nInmates have no established right to be provided with unlimited free access to the mails.  See Tate v. Kassulke,\\\\n409 F.Supp. 651 (W.D.Ken.1975).  It is important to note that this issue does not involve a forfeiture of property or\\\\na penalty.  Rather, it is in the nature of an assessment for value received.  Plaintiffs do not contend that they did\\\\nnot receive the services for which they are charged.  Nor do they cite any precedent relating to accountability\\\\nrequirements as they pertain to inmate accounts.  Clearly, as the warden indicates in his affidavit, requiring a\\\\nsigned voucher for each postage charge incurred by each inmate would be unfeasible.  Not only are there no\\\\nfactual issues remaining to be resolved but there appears no basis for a claim under section 1983.  While plaintiffs\\\\nobviously have a property interest in the funds on deposit in their inmate accounts, they have failed to show that\\\\n\\\\nthey were unlawfully deprived of their property or that they have been deprived of their property without due\\\\nprocess.  Summary judgment in favor of defendants on this issue was proper. \\\\nD. Matters pertaining to the Wallstreet Jaycees. \\\\n1184 The two remaining claims of plaintiffs deal with matters relating to the Wallstreet *1184 Jaycees.  The Wallstreet\\\\nJaycees was an inmate organization which, as part of its fundraising activities, was permitted to operate the\\\\ninmate commissary concession stand.  To purchase items from the concession stand inmates were permitted to\\\\npurchase Jaycee scrip since inmates are not permitted to have currency in their possession.  Each book of scrip\\\\nissued bears the prisoner\\\\'s name, identification number and date of issue.  Each ticket is stamped with the\\\\nprisoner\\\\'s penitentiary identification number.  Tickets are non-negotiable if detached from the ticket book and the\\\\nscrip is non-transferable.  All legitimate transfers of scrip were logged at the time of purchase at the concession\\\\nstand.  The Wallstreet Jaycees were suspended from operation by the prison administration for activities in\\\\nviolation of prison regulations, e. g., depletion of funds.  The organization\\\\'s charter was subsequently revoked by\\\\nthe state and local Jaycee organizations.  Affidavits introduced by defendants indicate that a new Jaycee\\\\norganization is in the process of being formed. \\\\n1.  Unauthorized scrip. \\\\nThis claim arose when prison officials determined that all unused, authorized scrip held by inmates would be\\\\nredeemed.  The term \\\"authorized\\\" refers to scrip bearing the identification number of inmate holding it.  Plaintiffs\\\\ndemand to be reimbursed for all scrip held by them.  They do not contend that it is authorized.  Instead, they\\\\nmaintain that, apparently by virtue of possession, they are entitled to redemption.  Refusal to redeem the scrip,\\\\naccording to plaintiffs, amounts to a deprivation of property without due process.  In Sell v. Parratt, 548 F.2d 753\\\\n(8th Cir. 1977),cert. denied,434 U.S. 873, 98 S.Ct. 220, 54 L.Ed.2d 152, this court found a cognizable claim\\\\nunder section 1983 where money held by inmates in violation of prison regulations was confiscated and\\\\ndeposited in the Inmate\\\\'s Welfare Fund.  We found that while the regulations prohibited inmates from possessing\\\\ncurrency, they did not authorize the forfeiture of currency illegally possessed and upheld the district court order\\\\nrequiring the money credited to the account of the incarcerated plaintiff.  This case differs in that here plaintiffs\\\\nassert a property right in the redemption of unauthorized scrip which is by prison regulation void if held by anyone\\\\nother than the inmate to which the scrip was issued.  It appears that plaintiffs failed to show a valid property right,\\\\nmuch less a deprivation.  Holder v. Claar, 459 F.Supp. 850, 852 (D.Colo.1978).  The district court was correct in\\\\ngranting summary judgment. \\\\n2.  Finally, plaintiffs theorize a violation of their civil rights in that prison officials at the time of the administrative\\\\nsuspension of the Wallstreet Jaycees confiscated concession stand equipment belonging to the organization and\\\\nthe organization\\\\'s treasury.  Plaintiffs seek an accounting.  Defendants in their motion for summary judgment\\\\nassert that prior to bringing this action plaintiffs failed to request a formal accounting, but that in any event one\\\\nhas since been provided through interrogatories.  Affidavits and exhibits submitted by defendants show that\\\\n$765.82 is on deposit in the Wallstreet Jaycee savings account in the Bank of North Dakota and $86.27 in a\\\\nbusiness account at the North Dakota State Penitentiary and that the concession equipment is in storage at the\\\\npenitentiary.  Defendants maintain and introduce supporting affidavits to show that the charter of the Wallstreet\\\\nJaycees has been terminated by both the state and national organizations and that a new Jaycee organization is\\\\nbeing formed.  Defendants state that once a new Jaycee organization has been formed all assets of the now\\\\ndefunct Wallstreet Jaycees will be transferred to the new organization.  It is difficult to see how plaintiffs have\\\\nbeen harmed.  There appears to be no actual deprivation of property here and in any event it would seem that\\\\nplaintiffs have already gotten the accounting they requested.  Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on\\\\nthis issue. \\\\nAccordingly, summary judgment with regard to the issue of attorney-client mail is hereby vacated and the issue\\\\n1185 remanded for further proceedings.  The district court\\\\'s *1185 granting of summary judgment as to the other issues\\\\ndiscussed above is hereby affirmed. \\\\n\\\\n[1] Kenneth Hagle was recently released from NDSP on parole. \\\\n[2] The district court had previously dismissed the action pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P.  12(b) for failure to state a claim\\\\nbut in doing so had considered and relied upon matters outside the pleadings without treating the motion to\\\\ndismiss as a motion for summary judgment and without giving plaintiffs notice of the courts intent to do so as\\\\nrequired by Fed.R.Civ.P.  56(c).  This court reversed and remanded with instructions to allow plaintiffs an\\\\nopportunity to file materials in opposition to defendant\\\\'s motion and to amend their complaint.  Jensen v.

Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, pro se.\\\\nRobert P. Brady, Asst. Atty. Gen., Bismarck, N. D., on brief, for appellees. \\\\nBefore LAY, ROSS and HENLEY, Circuit Judges. \\\\nPER CURIAM. \\\\nHerbert O. Jensen and Kenneth Hagle, inmates of the North Dakota State Penitentiary, sued North Dakota state\\\\nofficials, including the Director of Institutions, the penitentiary warden and the penitentiary accountant, for\\\\ndamages and declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7 1983.  Their complaint was dismissed pursuant\\\\nto Fed.R.Civ.P.  12(b) for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The district court considered\\\\nand relied upon matters outside the pleadings without treating the motion to dismiss as a motion for summary\\\\njudgment and without giving Jensen and Hagle notice of its intent to do so, as he was required to do by\\\\nFed.R.Civ.P.  12(b) and 56(c).  We therefore reverse and remand. \\\\nJensen and Hagle alleged that certain prison officials allowed inmates to form the Wallstreet Jaycees, a group\\\\noperating a concession stand in the penitentiary at which prison scrip was the medium of exchange.  Funds in the\\\\ninmates\\\\' personal financial accounts were exchanged for scrip through the penitentiary business office on a dollar\\\\nfor dollar basis.  When discharged, inmates received up to $25 reimbursement for unused scrip. \\\\nThe complaint alleged that in August 1977 prison officials suspended the Jaycee chapter, closed the stand and\\\\ncollected all unused scrip, providing inmates with receipts.  Thereafter, the general membership of the Jaycee\\\\nchapter voted that funds in the business office Jaycee account be transferred in appropriate amounts to the\\\\nindividual accounts of all inmates who held receipts.  Jensen held a receipt for $6.45 and Hagle held receipts\\\\ntotaling $142.25.  They allege that they have not been reimbursed, and claim that defendants\\\\' refusal to transfer\\\\nfunds to their accounts violates the due process clause of the fifth and fourteenth amendments. \\\\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, with a supporting brief and affidavit. \\\\nThey asserted they were not the real parties in interest and that no constitutionally protected right had been\\\\ninfringed by the actions alleged.  The district court granted the motion.  The court stated that it had considered\\\\ndefendants\\\\' motion to dismiss, the pleadings and defendants\\\\' affidavit and brief.  Facts not alleged in the\\\\ncomplaint, but set forth in the affidavit of prison warden Havener were recited and relied upon in the court\\\\'s\\\\n245 opinion. [1] The court held that the dispute was between plaintiffs and a group of other inmates, the Wallstreet \\\\n*245 Jaycees, and not with the prison officials.  The court also held that plaintiffs\\\\' allegation that scrip had not\\\\nbeen redeemed did not state a claim of constitutional dimensions. \\\\nWhen the district court considered defendants\\\\' affidavit in deciding the motion to dismiss, it was required to treat\\\\nthe motion as one for summary judgment.  Fed.R.Civ.P.  12(b); Carter v. Stanton, 405 U.S. 669, 671, 92 S.Ct.\\\\n1232, 31 L.Ed.2d 569 (1972); Goodman v. Parwatikar, 570 F.2d 801, 803 (8th Cir. 1978); Ailshire v. Darnell, 508\\\\n\\\\nF.2d 526, 527 (8th Cir. 1974).  However, there is no indication in the record that the court notified Jensen and\\\\nHagle of its intent or that it gave them an opportunity to file opposing materials, as is required by Fed.R.Civ.P.  56\\\\n(c).  We require strict compliance with the provisions of Rule 56, Ailshire v. Darnell, supra, 508 F.2d at 528, and\\\\nwe have held that notice may not be omitted even when more than 10 days have elapsed between filing of the\\\\nmotion and dismissal.  See Winfrey v. Brewer, 570 F.2d 761, 764 (8th Cir. 1978). \\\\nAlthough Jensen and Hagle submitted exhibits and affidavits with their pro se trial brief, they did so a month\\\\nbefore defendants\\\\' motion to dismiss and supporting affidavit were filed.  There is no indication they received\\\\nnotice that the warden\\\\'s affidavit would be considered and the motion to dismiss thereby converted to one for\\\\nsummary judgment, so that failure to file an opposing affidavit could result in an adverse judgment. \\\\nDefendants argue that the district court\\\\'s failure to comply with the Rule 56(c) notice requirement was not\\\\nprejudicial, because Jensen and Hagle were notified by a local rule to submit briefs in opposition to the motion\\\\nwithin 10 days.  However, Rules 12(b) and 56(c) contemplate an opportunity to file more than briefs.  A pro se brief\\\\nwas held not to constitute \\\"the type of meaningful opposition contemplated by Rule 56\\\" in Winfrey v. Brewer,\\\\nsupra, 570 F.2d at 764.  Plaintiffs\\\\' attempt to refute the affidavit by \\\"exhibits,\\\" materials not presented to the trial\\\\ncourt but filed on appeal, indicates that they might well have taken advantage of a meaningful opportunity to\\\\noppose the affidavit. \\\\nWhen the complaint is given the liberal construction ordinarily accorded pro se civil rights complaints, we are not\\\\nconvinced to a certainty that Jensen and Hagle would not be entitled to relief under any state of facts which they\\\\ncould prove in support of their claim.  Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). \\\\nClaims of intentional deprivation of a prisoner\\\\'s property under color of state law are actionable under 42 U.S.C. \\u00a7\\\\n1983.

Failure to return a prisoner\\\\'s confiscated property\\\\nwhen requested to do so, Alexanian v. N.Y. State Urban Dev. Corp., 554 F.2d 15 (2d Cir. 1977); Cruz v.

We suggest to the district court that it consider\\\\nappointing counsel to assist the plaintiffs in this case.\\\\n[1] These facts were: The stand was closed for good and sufficient reasons.  An inmate group formed to audit the\\\\nbooks recommended that only scrip which could be shown to have been purchased by the inmate holding it be\\\\nredeemed, which recommendation the Jaycees\\\\' general membership rejected.  No scrip has been redeemed\\\\nbecause the Jaycee group has not \\\"formally\\\" requested transfer of the funds to individual inmate accounts. \\\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar. \\\\n\\\\nDocument Title: Reported Opinion\\\\nDocument Content: \\\\n702 F.2d 131 (1983)\\\\nHerbert O.

Gen., Bismarck, N.D., for appellees. \\\\nBefore LAY, Chief Judge, HENLEY, Senior Circuit Judge, and FAGG, Circuit Judge.\\\\n132 *132 PER CURIAM. \\\\n[1]\\\\nAppellant Herbert O. Jensen appeals from the district court\\\\'s  denial of his motion for relief from judgment under\\\\nFed.R.Civ.P.  60(b). \\\\nThis action was brought by Jensen against various state authorities alleging that legal mail was being opened\\\\nand not delivered to him at the North Dakota state prison.  To \\\"protect his rights,\\\" he filed liens on the personal\\\\nand real property of all the defendants with the Registrars of Deeds in several North Dakota counties. \\\\nIn response, the defendants filed a \\\"Motion For An Order to Give Notice of All Liens Filed and to Remove All\\\\nLiens Filed\\\" with the district court. The \\\"motion\\\" also requested the court to assess damages.  The district court\\\\nordered Jensen to give the defendants a list of all the liens he had filed and to file releases of all the liens with the\\\\nappropriate county officers, and prohibited Jensen from filing further liens without court approval.  Jensen\\\\ncomplied with this order and the defendants repeated their \\\"motion\\\" for damages.  On February 3, 1982 the\\\\ndistrict court granted the defendants\\\\' motion for summary judgment on the mail issue, and denied the defendants\\\\'\\\\nmotion for damages. \\\\nOn July 15, 1982 the district court sua sponte amended its order dismissing the damages claim by adding the\\\\nphrase \\\"for lack of jurisdiction.\\\" Formal notice was not given to the defendants or to Jensen prior to entry of the\\\\norder.  Jensen claims that he did not receive a copy of the order after entry.  While the district court file does not\\\\nindicate that a copy was sent to him, it does show that a copy was sent to his attorney of record.  Jensen,\\\\nhowever, claims that he did not receive a copy of the order until September 7, when he was given a copy in\\\\nconnection with another lawsuit.  On September 10 he filed a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P.  60(b) requesting the\\\\ndistrict court to reconsider the amended judgment on the grounds that (1) he never received notice of the\\\\namended judgment, and (2) the district court had jurisdiction over the damages claim.  The district court denied\\\\nthe motion, and Jensen appealed. \\\\nThe standard of review for denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is whether the district court abused its discretion.  \\\\nBrowder v. Director, 434 U.S. 257, 263 n. 7, 98 S.Ct. 556, 560 n. 7, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); Knox v. Lichtenstein,\\\\n654 F.2d 19, 21 (8th Cir.1981).  Further, this court cannot use review of a 60(b) motion to review an underlying\\\\ndecision which was not appealed.  E.g., Clark v. Wyrick, 538 F.2d 1327 (8th Cir.1976),cert. denied, 429 U.S.\\\\n1062, 97 S.Ct. 788, 50 L.Ed.2d 778 (1977).  Thus, the district court\\\\'s order amending the judgment, even if\\\\n[2]\\\\nquestionable,  is not reviewable.  Only the denial of Jensen\\\\'s motion may be considered. \\\\n\\\\nJensen should have challenged the order by a timely Rule 52(b) motion seeking further amendment or by a\\\\ntimely appeal.  The time limits for these actions had passed by the time Jensen filed his Rule 60(b) motion with\\\\nthe court. If no notice of the amending order had been served or received, perhaps relief might be merited.  See \\\\nCoclin Tobacco Co. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 353 F.2d 727, 728 (2d Cir.1965).  However, the record\\\\nshows Jensen\\\\'s attorney received a copy of the order.  See Bennett v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., 396 F.2d 909,\\\\n911 (9th Cir.1968).  There is no reason to consider under Rule 60(b) a motion which could have been made under\\\\nanother rule if the litigant had acted in a timely manner.  See Lester v. Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co., 653 F.2d\\\\n353 (8th Cir.1981). \\\\nBecause we find no abuse of discretion, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. \\\\n[1] The Honorable Bruce M.

Jobs in the bakery and deli departments fall into one classification, jobs in the produce\\\\ndepartment another.  Two facts give rise to this litigation: pay in the produce department is higher, and workers\\\\nare not distributed uniformly by sex.  Most bakery and deli workers are women, while most produce workers are\\\\nmen.  Plaintiffs, a class of women who work in the deli and bakery departments, contend that the difference\\\\nviolates both the Equal Pay Act, 29 U.S.C. \\u00a7 206(d), and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Kohl\\\\'s replies\\\\nthat plaintiffs are short-sighted: employees in the produce department are included within a pay category called\\\\n\\\"regular clerks,\\\" most of whom are female.  That most regular clerks in the produce department are men does not\\\\nundercut the fact that most regular clerks store-wide are women, Kohl\\\\'s insists.  The employer adds that women\\\\nwho want to be regular clerks in or out of the produce department do not face any discrimination in hiring or\\\\ntransfer.  None of the class representatives applied for transfer to the produce department or another regular-clerk\\\\nposition; instead they want higher pay for their existing work.  The ratio of wages between \\\"department clerks\\\"\\\\n(the jobs plaintiffs occupy) and \\\"regular clerks,\\\" Kohl\\\\'s insists, is a subject for collective bargaining rather than for\\\\nlitigation. \\\\nAfter allowing the parties to conduct extensive discovery, the district court granted summary judgment for Kohl\\\\'s\\\\non the Title VII claim.  The judge exhaustively analyzed the duties of bakery, deli, and produce workers and\\\\nconcluded that plaintiffs could not demonstrate that Kohl\\\\'s explanation for placing produce positions in the\\\\n\\\"regular clerk\\\" classification was a pretext for sex discrimination.  (The class includes supervisors and argues that\\\\nbakery and deli managers do the same work as produce managers.  Because the supervisors\\\\' arguments track\\\\nthose of the clerks, we use \\\"clerks\\\" as a generic term to simplify exposition.) Kohl\\\\'s insisted that produce workers\\\\nexercise greater discretion in displaying and culling produce and that produce jobs also are physically harder\\\\nthan bakery or deli jobs.  The district judge concluded: \\\"Plaintiffs have produced no persuasive evidence\\\\nsuggesting that defendants did not honestly believe this justification or that it is a cover for discrimination.\\\" Honest belief is not enough under the Equal Pay Act, however, because that statute (unlike Title VII) does not\\\\nrequire intent to discriminate.  Section 206(d)(1) provides:\\\\nNo employer.. shall discriminate.. between employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to\\\\nemployees.. at a rate less than the rate at which he pays wages to employees of the opposite\\\\nsex for equal work on jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and\\\\nresponsibility, and which are performed under similar working conditions, except where such\\\\npayment is made pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which\\\\n\\\\nmeasures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) a differential based on any other\\\\nfactor other than sex[.] The district judge concluded that two questions under this statute could be resolved only by trial: whether the\\\\npositions in question are \\\"jobs the performance of which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and which\\\\nare performed under similar working conditions\\\" and, if so, whether the pay differential nonetheless is \\\"based on\\\\nany other factor other than sex\\\".  A trial culminated in a special verdict that answered the equal-work question in\\\\nthe negative; the jury then did not address the \\\"factor other than sex\\\" defense. \\\\nA substantial portion of plaintiffs\\\\' appellate brief is devoted to contending that the district judge should not have\\\\n923 granted summary judgment on the Title *923 VII theory.  Yet it is hard to see how this can matter, given the jury\\\\'s\\\\nverdict on the Equal Pay Act theory.  If (as the jury determined) the bakery, deli, and produce jobs are not\\\\nsubstantially equal, then plaintiffs can\\\\'t show sex discrimination.  Title VII does not require equal wages for\\\\ncomparable work, see American Nurses\\\\' Association v. Illinois, 783 F.2d 716 (7th Cir. 1986), or even for identical\\\\nwork.  Identical jobs with different wages do not violate Title VII, provided that all employees may freely select\\\\nwhich job to perform.  Plaintiffs\\\\' Title VII claim thus is untenable00no matter the validity of the jury\\\\'s special verdict,\\\\n97\\\\nwhich we address below00 unless Kohl\\\\'s discriminated when hiring for the different classifications. \\\\n97\\\\nPlaintiffs make much of evidence that until the late 1960s Kohl\\\\'s not only discouraged women from applying for\\\\ncertain positions but also had sex-segregated wage classifications.  This practice is long gone, and no vestige of\\\\nthe discrimination survives.  Wage schedules were merged 31 years ago, and, unlike the situation in Bazemore v.\\\\nFriday, 478 U.S. 385, 106 S.Ct. 3000, 92 L.Ed.2d 315 (1986), women hired during the discriminatory period today\\\\nreceive the same wages as men hired at the same time.  What remains is the possibility that Kohl\\\\'s steered\\\\napplicants by sex or selectively offered them transfer opportunities.  Loyd v. Phillips Brothers, Inc., 25 F.3d 518,\\\\n524-25 (7th Cir. 1994).  Neither the plaintiffs\\\\' charge of discrimination filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity\\\\nCommission nor their arguments to the district court contended that Kohl\\\\'s today steers women to bakery and\\\\ndeli jobs, or did so at any time within the period of limitations.  Plaintiffs disavow a steering claim but contend that\\\\nKohl\\\\'s history is informative on the wage-discrimination claim.  The district judge did not see how; neither do we. \\\\nClaims under the Equal Pay Act differ from comparable-worth arguments because proof that the two jobs are of\\\\nthe same (or comparable) value to the employer or society as a whole, or depend on similar effort or education,\\\\ngets the plaintiff nowhere.  To succeed under the Equal Pay Act the plaintiff must establish that the positions entail\\\\nsubstantially equal tasks, performed under similar conditions.  (The Act just says \\\"equal,\\\" but it is common ground\\\\nthat \\\"equal\\\" does not mean \\\"identical\\\"; otherwise the employer could defeat an Equal Pay Act suit by adding an\\\\ninconsequential and pointless chore to one of the jobs.  Opinions commonly use the formula \\\"substantially equal\\\"\\\\nto express the idea that trivial differences do not matter.  See Fallon v. Illinois, 882 F.2d 1206, 1208 (7th Cir. 1989)\\\\n; Epstein v. Secretary of the Treasury, 739 F.2d 274, 277 (7th Cir. 1984).  We follow that convention.) Kohl\\\\'s\\\\nprovided the jury with plenty of evidence that tasks in the produce department differ substantially from those\\\\nperformed by bakery and deli workers.  Produce workers do more heavy lifting and must exercise judgment about\\\\n(for example) which fruit is ripe, which should be marked down, and how the produce should be displayed to\\\\nmaximize sales.  Bakery and deli workers, by contrast, stock displays according to more mechanical\\\\nspecifications and use printed expiration dates rather than judgment to determine when inventory should be\\\\nrotated or removed.  Although a rational jury might have disbelieved this evidence or concluded that the\\\\ndifferences are too slight to matter, and thus returned a verdict in plaintiffs\\\\' favor, a verdict for Kohl\\\\'s is\\\\ninvulnerable unless spoiled by trial error. \\\\nPlaintiffs contend that the exclusion of their expert witness is such an error.  Howard Risher, a self-employed\\\\nconsultant with a Ph.D. in labor relations and economics, who teaches an undergraduate course on human\\\\nresources as an adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania, prepared a report reaching conclusions\\\\nfavorable to plaintiffs.  Stripped of self-congratulatory dross, this report is three pages long and consists of a list of\\\\n924 clerks\\\\' duties and an unreasoned *924 assertion that all three departments\\\\' positions are \\\"virtually identical in\\\\nterms of their basic function and are substantially equal in terms of skill, effort, responsibility and working\\\\nconditions.\\\" The only support for this conclusion, however, is the list, with entries such as \\\"[p]reparing products\\\\nfor display\\\" and \\\"[m]aintaining equipment\\\".  Risher did not analyze what the clerks do to achieve these objectives,\\\\nand the district court concluded that a list plus a bald assertion would not assist the trier of fact.  Fed.R.Evid.  702. \\\\n\\\\nRisher\\\\'s deposition was as skeletal as his report; asked how employees at Kohl\\\\'s carry out their duties, Risher\\\\nreplied only with variants on \\\"I couldn\\\\'t tell you\\\" and \\\"I have no idea\\\".  Apparently Risher thinks that job\\\\ndescriptions trump actual tasks, a sorry misunderstanding of the Equal Pay Act.  See Soto v. Adams Elevator\\\\nEquipment Co., 941 F.2d 543, 548 (7th Cir. 1991); Fallon, 882 F.2d at 1208.  The district judge\\\\'s decision to\\\\nprevent Risher from testifying, far from being an abuse of discretion, see General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S.\\\\n136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508 (1997), was absolutely correct.  Many times we have emphasized that\\\\nexperts\\\\' work is admissible only to the extent it is reasoned, uses the methods of the discipline, and is founded on\\\\ndata.  Talking off the cuff00 deploying neither data nor analysis00is not an acceptable methodology.  See, e.g., \\\\n97 97\\\\nMcMahon v. Bunn-O-Matic Corp., 150 F.3d 651, 657-58 (7th Cir. 1998); Mid-State Fertilizer Co. v. Exchange\\\\nNational Bank, 877 F.2d 1333, 1339 (7th Cir. 1989). \\\\nRisher also prepared a supplemental report, based on his discussion with eight bakery or deli workers in a \\\"focus\\\\ngroup.\\\" This report did little more than parrot these women\\\\'s belief that bakery and deli duties require as much\\\\nskill as produce duties.  Relaying the plaintiffs\\\\' likely testimony is not an example of expertise.  Huey v. United\\\\nParcel Service, Inc., 165 F.3d 1084, 1086-87 (7th Cir. 1999).  The report\\\\'s final paragraph, however, says that\\\\nRisher \\\"used the Willis job evaluation system to confirm that the jobs would be evaluated the same in each\\\\ndepartment\\\" and concluded that \\\"the jobs would be evaluated exactly the same\\\".  Risher does not explain how the\\\\n\\\"Willis job evaluation system\\\" works (or cite published literature providing that background), what data he used as\\\\ninputs, or what outputs were obtained.  Charts attached to the report are unintelligible without explanation, and\\\\nRisher provided none.  Readers must take everything on faith, and that alone would be good reason to exclude\\\\nRisher\\\\'s conclusion.  See Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999). \\\\nThe few references to the Willis system in the legal literature suggest that it is designed to identify comparable\\\\nworth, rather than substantially equal tasks.  See AFSCME v. Washington, 770 F.2d 1401, 1403, 1406, 1408 (9th\\\\nCir. 1985) (Kennedy, J.) (holding, on this ground, that Willis evaluations are unavailing).  All plaintiffs do in\\\\nresponse is assert that the Willis system is \\\"a recognized job evaluation system\\\" that is \\\"widely used by\\\\nbusinesses\\\"00which does nothing to fill in the blanks of Risher\\\\'s report or demonstrate that the Willis inquiry was\\\\n97\\\\nrelevant to this litigation. \\\\nPlaintiffs challenge a second evidentiary decision, which the parties call the \\\"outlier ruling.\\\" Kohl\\\\'s operates stores\\\\nthroughout Wisconsin.  Some are much larger than others, and size affects not only the number of employees in\\\\neach department but also the tasks to be done.  Plaintiffs sought to compare the busiest bakery and deli jobs with\\\\nthe lightest produce jobs; Kohl\\\\'s naturally would have preferred the converse.  But the judge instructed both sides\\\\nto compare the tasks of median jobs rather than the outliers at the largest and smallest stores.  Plaintiffs contend\\\\nthat this ruling prevented them from showing that some bakery and deli jobs are substantially equal (in lifting,\\\\nresponsibility, and so on) to some produce jobs, indeed are more taxing than some produce jobs.  As plaintiffs see\\\\n925 things, the *925 Equal Pay Act requires a person-by-person comparison rather than a categorical one. \\\\nTo the extent plaintiffs rely on the proposition that employers cannot make up arbitrary categories and insist that\\\\nthese be the basis of comparison, they get no quarrel from us (or from the district judge).  See Thompson v.\\\\nSawyer, 678 F.2d 257, 274-75 (D.C.Cir. 1982).  But Kohl\\\\'s did not make up the \\\"department clerk\\\" and \\\"regular\\\\nclerk\\\" categories for this litigation, nor did it unilaterally decide to use the same wage scale throughout the state;\\\\nthe classifications and wages are the result of collective bargaining.  Labor agreements frequently apply to all of\\\\nan employer\\\\'s sites, and these agreements are \\\"factor[s] other than sex\\\" that explain why the pay is identical at\\\\nlarge and small stores even though the tasks differ.  If all plaintiffs have to go on is the difference across stores,\\\\nthen they have nothing, for this variation in the ratio between pay and the difficulty of employees\\\\' tasks is so\\\\nobviously unrelated to sex that Kohl\\\\'s would have been entitled to summary judgment under \\u00a7 206(d)(1)(iv).  To\\\\nget anywhere, plaintiffs had to make a categorical comparison between \\\"department clerk\\\" positions and \\\"regular\\\\nclerk\\\" positions.  Class treatment is appropriate only if there are common issues of fact00that is, only if it is\\\\n97\\\\npossible to compare all \\\"department clerk\\\" positions in bakery and deli departments with all \\\"regular clerk\\\"\\\\npositions in produce departments.  The district court\\\\'s outlier ruling ensured that the premise of class certification\\\\n(granted at plaintiffs\\\\' behest) would not be subverted.  It was not an abuse of discretion. \\\\nTwo challenges to the jury instructions require only brief mention. \\\\n\\\\nFirst, the instructions told the jury that it must determine whether the positions are \\\"substantially the same\\\" rather\\\\nthan \\\"substantially equal.\\\" Plaintiffs express concern that the jury would treat \\\"same\\\" as equivalent to \\\"identical,\\\"\\\\nwhich these positions concededly were not.  But using the word \\\"equal\\\" could lead to the same (an equal?) misunderstanding.  Modifying either word with \\\"substantially\\\" overcomes the problem.  The phrases \\\"substantially\\\\nthe same\\\" and \\\"substantially equal\\\" are substantially identical.  The special interrogatory forms told the jury to\\\\ndetermine whether the positions were \\\"substantially the same,\\\" and the district judge sensibly tracked that\\\\nlanguage in the instructions; otherwise the jury could have been confused by a difference between the\\\\ninstructions and the verdict forms. \\\\nSecond, plaintiffs contend that the judge erred by telling the jury that documentary evidence such as position\\\\ndescriptions and training manuals00evidence that plaintiffs contend shows that bakery, deli, and produce positions\\\\n97\\\\nhave the same tasks00\\\"could not be considered.\\\" An instruction saying this would indeed be erroneous, for an\\\\n97\\\\nemployer\\\\'s manuals and descriptions are relevant to the question what the positions actually entail.  But plaintiffs\\\\ndo not identify the supposedly erroneous instruction, and we could not find one that tells the jury not to \\\"consider\\\"\\\\npaper evidence.  What the judge actually told the jury is that a decision should not be \\\"based upon job titles or job\\\\ndescriptions\\\" but instead depends on \\\"actual job duties and performance requirements.\\\" That instruction was\\\\nabsolutely correct.  Training manuals and the like were relevant only to the extent they accurately described the\\\\nactual job duties. \\\\nLast but not least is plaintiffs\\\\' contention that the district judge erred in informing the jury that the EEOC had\\\\nfound in Kohl\\\\'s favor on plaintiffs\\\\' charge of discrimination under the Equal Pay Act.', ' The district court\\\\'s outlier ruling ensured that the premise of class certification\\\\n(granted at plaintiffs\\\\' behest) would not be subverted.

Training manuals and the like were relevant only to the extent they accurately described the\\\\nactual job duties. \\\\nLast but not least is plaintiffs\\\\' contention that the district judge erred in informing the jury that the EEOC had\\\\nfound in Kohl\\\\'s favor on plaintiffs\\\\' charge of discrimination under the Equal Pay Act.  Before trial the district judge\\\\ngranted a motion in limine barring Kohl\\\\'s from informing the jury about the EEOC\\\\'S decision, but the judge\\\\nchanged her mind after plaintiffs\\\\' counsel told the jury that Kohl\\\\'s agreed \\\"under pressure of this lawsuit\\\" to\\\\n926 reduce the pay differential among the departments.  *926 Kohl\\\\'s replied that the \\\"pressure\\\" came from its unions\\\\nin collective bargaining, not from the suit; to add oomph to this assertion Kohl\\\\'s wanted to inform the jury that the\\\\nEEOC took a dim view of plaintiffs\\\\' chances.  If even the EEOC did not support plaintiffs, Kohl\\\\'s sought to argue,\\\\nthen the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" could not have made a difference.  This led the district judge to inform the jury\\\\nabout the EEOC\\\\'S conclusion, in this language:\\\\nAt the time of the 1998 collective bargaining negotiations Kohl\\\\'s had a determination from the\\\\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission that it had not discriminated against bakery and deli\\\\nmanagers and clerks on the basis of their pay.  At plaintiffs\\\\' request that the determination by the\\\\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission be reconsidered, the EEOC rescinded its\\\\ndetermination.  Before any redetermination had issued, plaintiffs\\\\' attorney decided to proceed with\\\\nthis lawsuit and therefore no determination was ever issued thereafter by the Equal Employment\\\\nOpportunity Commission. \\\\nBy asserting that the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" led to a change, plaintiffs\\\\' counsel implied that the suit had merit00\\\\n97\\\\nand that Kohl\\\\'s knew that it had merit.  Kohl\\\\'s was entitled to counteract this implication, the district judge thought,\\\\nby showing that what Kohl\\\\'s knew implied that it would prevail on the merits. \\\\nMany decisions by the EEOC are superficial, little more than precursors to right-to-sue letters.  But this one was\\\\nmore thorough.  Here is the Commission\\\\'s own description:\\\\nOur equal payment investigation considered whether or not the actual job duties of the deli and\\\\nbakery manager positions and the deli and bakery clerk positions were substantially equal with\\\\nrespect to skill, effort, responsibility, and working conditions as those of the produce manager and\\\\nproduce clerk positions.  To that end, detailed equal pay interviews were conducted with various\\\\nincumbents of the produce manager and produce clerk positions.  These interviews reflected that\\\\nthe produce jobs were dirtier, required more physical lifting of greater weight, more items with\\\\ngreater frequency than the deli and bakery jobs.  Moreover, the produce areas are significantly\\\\nlarger than the deli and bakery areas in terms of physical square footage.  There are far more\\\\nitems in produce than in deli and bakery and produce accounts for a greater percentage of store\\\\nsales, i.e., higher sales volume.  Produce employees are frequently called upon to help out in other\\\\nareas of the store stocking the dairy case, retrieving the carts, et cetera.  As a result, our\\\\n\\\\ninvestigation concluded that the jobs in question did not meet the required equal pay test and that\\\\nthey are not substantially equal with respect to effort, responsibility, skill or working conditions. \\\\nIt is understandable that plaintiffs wanted to keep this damning passage from the jury\\\\'s eyes, and they\\\\nsucceeded.  The jury never learned the reasoning behind the EEOC\\\\'S decision.  Why plaintiffs\\\\' counsel, having\\\\nsecured a ruling excluding even a mention of the EEOC\\\\'S bottom line, then opened the door is a mystery.  Still,\\\\nplaintiffs say, the jury should not have been told about the EEOC\\\\'S conclusion because, by the time Kohl\\\\'s\\\\nagreed to reduce the pay differential to 5\\u00a2 per hour, the EEOC had rescinded its conclusion, so that the report did\\\\nnot counteract the inference for which counsel argued. \\\\nAfter receiving the EEOC\\\\'S report (and the accompanying right-to-sue letter) in September 1997, plaintiffs asked\\\\nthe EEOC to reconsider.  In December 1997 the EEOC\\\\'S District Director withdrew both the conclusion and the\\\\nright-to-sue letter pending further review.  See 29 C.F.R. \\u00a7 1601.19(b).  Before the EEOC could do any further\\\\n927 investigation, plaintiffs asked for a new right-to-sue letter, which the EEOC was obliged to issue forthwith.  29 *927\\\\nC.F.R. \\u00a7 1601.28.  Once it sent the right-to-sue letter, the EEOC called off its investigation and neither reissued\\\\nthe original report nor prepared a new one.  The upshot was that, when plaintiffs filed their suit, there was no\\\\noutstanding adverse decision by the EEOC.  When she told the jury about the EEOC\\\\'S conclusion, the district\\\\njudge was under the impression that the negotiations to which plaintiffs\\\\' counsel referred took place before the\\\\nDistrict Director\\\\'s order in December 1997.  On learning that this was not so, the judge did not instruct the jurors\\\\nto disregard the report (a direction that would have been futile in any event, sort of like telling the jurors that for\\\\nthe remainder of the trial none of them was allowed to say the word \\\"rhinoceros\\\" to himself). \\\\nWas there a significant chance that the jury would misunderstand the significance of the EEOC\\\\'S decision, and\\\\nthe purpose for which it had been used00a chance so large that it requires reversal even under the deferential\\\\n97\\\\nstandard used to review a district judge\\\\'s application of Fed.R.Evid.  403?  We think not.  Confusion over timing is\\\\nregrettable, but the judge can\\\\'t be blamed for the error in the opening passage of the instruction (\\\"At the time of\\\\nthe 1998 collective bargaining negotiations Kohl\\\\'s had a determination\\\"..).  That language had been drafted by\\\\nthe parties; the judge used it because the parties agreed on it.  Plaintiffs deny that they \\\"stipulated\\\" to the\\\\nlanguage, but no matter; they did not object to it, and that is that.  Fed.R.Civ.P.  51. \\\\nBecause plaintiffs sought to persuade the jury that Kohl\\\\'s recognized its culpability, Kohl\\\\'s was entitled to rebut\\\\nthis contention using the best available evidence: a decision by the EEOC that the positions were not\\\\nsubstantially equal. See Paolitto v. John Brown E. & C., Inc., 151 F.3d 60, 65-66 (2d Cir. 1998).  Decisions by\\\\npublic bodies do not vanish into thin air or become un-documents when parties ask for reconsideration or settle\\\\ntheir differences.  See U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall Partnership, 513 U.S. 18, 115 S.Ct. 386, 130\\\\nL.Ed.2d 233 (1994); In re Memorial Hospital of Iowa County, Inc., 862 F.2d 1299 (7th Cir. 1988).  When\\\\nnegotiating with the unions, Kohl\\\\'s knew the EEOC\\\\'S view, which had been withdrawn as a result of plaintiffs\\\\'\\\\nstrategy but had not been disclaimed as erroneous.  The 1998 negotiations occurred against a background that\\\\nincluded the EEOC\\\\'S support of Kohl\\\\'s position, and this was relevant to the strength of the inference that Kohl\\\\'s\\\\nand the unions acted under the \\\"pressure of this lawsuit\\\" as plaintiffs asserted. \\\\nDoubtless there was a risk that the jury would overestimate the significance of the EEOC\\\\'S ruling; this is why\\\\nsuch conclusions generally are not admitted (on behalf of either side) in jury trials.  See Lathem v. Department of\\\\nChildren and Youth Services, 172 F.3d 786, 791 (11th Cir. 1999).  Plaintiffs note that the jury asked a question\\\\nabout the report during deliberations, implying that the EEOC\\\\'S view assumed unusual significance.  By opening\\\\nthe door to disclosure, however, plaintiffs took that risk; they could not argue as they did and then defang the best\\\\nresponse.  See United States v. McAnderson, 914 F.2d 934, 946 (7th Cir. 1990).  Nor can they avoid the\\\\nconsequence of their opening statement by contending on appeal (as they do) that \\\"[w]hy Kohl\\\\'s narrowed the\\\\ngap in late 1998 is entirely peripheral\\\" (emphasis in original).  That may be, but it was plaintiffs who injected this\\\\nsubject into the case and entitled Kohl\\\\'s to supply an answer.  Plaintiffs did not argue to the district judge that the\\\\nscope of the answer was too prejudicial and never suggested any possible response that was less prejudicial. \\\\nThe district judge protected plaintiffs\\\\' substantial rights by excluding the EEOC\\\\'S actual language and reminding\\\\nthe jury that the conclusion had been rescinded.  In response to the jury\\\\'s question, the judge reread the\\\\n928 instruction and added that the only issue properly under consideration was \\\"whether the jobs are equal\\\" rather \\\\n\\\\n*928 than why Kohl\\\\'s and the union changed the pay scales in 1998.  The evidence and the instructions as a\\\\nwhole ensured that the jury focused on, and answered, the right questions.  Plaintiffs had a fair trial.\\\\nAFFIRMED\\\\nSave treesread court opinions online on Google Scholar.']\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"num_chunks\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 10,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 92,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 33,\n        \"samples\": [\n          20,\n          21,\n          35\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"mean_embedding\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]}]}
