**Combined Opinion**
 Correspondingly, the Court has rejected the notion that state taxes levied on interstate commerce are per se invalid.  See, e. g., Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734 (1978); Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra .  In reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes, our goal has instead been to "establish a consistent and rational method of inquiry" focusing on "the practical effect of a challenged tax." Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S. 425, 443 (1980).  See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 276-281 (1978); Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring *616 Cos., supra, at 743-751; Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra, at 277-279 .  We conclude that the same "practical" analysis should apply in reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state severance taxes.  In the first place, there is no real distinctionin terms of economic effectsbetween severance taxes and other types of state taxes that have been subjected to Commerce Clause scrutiny.  [5] See, e. g., Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, <citedDecision>347 U. S. 157</citedDecision> (1954); Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., 330 U. S. 422 (1947), Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n, 302 U. S. 90 (1937), both overruled in Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., supra. [6] State taxes levied on a "local" activity preceding entry of the goods into interstate commerce may substantially affect interstate commerce, and this effect is the proper focus of Commerce Clause inquiry.  See Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, supra, at 443.  Second, this Court has acknowledged that "a State has a significant interest in exacting from interstate commerce its fair share of the cost of state government," Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., supra, at 748.  As the Court has stated, "`[e]ven interstate business must pay its way.'" Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938), quoting Postal Telegraph-Cable *617 Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252, 259 (1919).  Consequently, the Heisler Court's concern that a loss of state taxing authority would be an inevitable result of subjecting taxes on "local" activities to Commerce Clause scrutiny is no longer tenable.  We therefore hold that a state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce.

 Rather, when the measure of a tax is reasonably related to the taxpayer's activities or presence in the Statefrom which it derives some benefit such as the *629 substantial privilege of mining coalthe taxpayer will realize, in proper proportion to the taxes it pays, "[t]he only benefit to which the taxpayer is constitutionally entitled .  .  .  [:] that derived from his enjoyment of the privileges of living in an organized society, established and safeguarded by the devotion of taxes to public purposes." Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co., 301 U. S., at 522 .  Correspondingly, when the measure of a tax bears no relationship to the taxpayers' presence or activities in a State, a court may properly conclude under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test that the State is imposing an undue burden on interstate commerce.  See Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S., at 427 ; cf. Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, <citedDecision>347 U. S. 157</citedDecision> (1954).  We are satisfied that the Montana tax, assessed under a formula that relates the tax liability to the value of appellant coal producers' activities within the State, comports with the requirements of the Complete Auto Transit test.  We therefore turn to appellants' contention that the tax is invalid under the Supremacy Clause.  III A Appellants contend that the Montana tax, as applied to mining of federally owned coal, is invalid under the Supremacy Clause because it "substantially frustrates" the purposes of the Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, ch. 85, 41 Stat. 437 , 30 U. S. C. § 181 et seq. (1976 ed. and Supp. III) (1920 Act), as amended by the Federal Coal Leasing Amendments Act of 1975, Pub. L. 94-377, 90 Stat. 1083 (1975 Amendments).  Appellants argue that under the 1920 Act, the "economic rents" attributable to the mining of coal on federal land i.  e., the difference between the cost of production (including a reasonable profit) and the market price of the coal are to be captured by the Federal Government in the form of royalty payments from federal lessees.  The payments thus *630 received are then to be divided between the States and the Federal Government according to a formula prescribed by the Act.

 See, e. g., Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S. 416, 433 (1946).  Moreover, interstate commerce can be required to "pay its own way" in a narrower sense as well: the State may tax interstate commerce for the purpose of recovering those costs attributable to the activity itself.  See, e. g., Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252 (1919).  [13] *648 The Court has never suggested, however, that interstate commerce may be required to pay more than its own way.  The Court today fails to recognize that the Commerce Clause does impose limits upon the State's power to impose even facially neutral and properly apportioned taxes.  See ante, at 622-623.  In Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, <citedDecision>347 U. S. 157, 163</citedDecision> (1954), Texas argued that no inquiry into the constitutionality of a facially neutral tax on the "taking" of gas was necessary because the State "has afforded great benefits and protection to pipeline companies." The <citedDecision>Calvert</citedDecision> Court rejected this argument, holding that "these benefits are relevant here only to show that the essential requirements of due process have been met sufficiently to justify the imposition of any tax on the interstate activity." <citedDecision>Id., at 163-164</citedDecision> .  The Court held, <citedDecision>id., at 164</citedDecision> , that when a tax is challenged on Commerce Clause grounds its validity "`depends upon other considerations of constitutional policy having reference to the substantial effects, actual or potential, of the particular tax in suppressing or burdening unduly the commerce,'" quoting Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S., at 424 .  Accordingly, while *649 the Commerce Clause does not require that interstate commerce be placed in a privileged position, it does require that it not be unduly burdened.  In framing its taxing measures to reach interstate commerce, the State must be "at pains to do so in a manner which avoids the evils forbidden by the commerce clause and puts that commerce actually on a plane of equality with local trade in local taxation." Nippert, 327 U. S., at 434 (emphasis added).  Thus, the Court has been particularly vigilant to review taxes that "single out interstate business," since "[a]ny tailored tax of this sort creates an increased danger of error in apportionment, of discrimination against interstate commerce, and of a lack of relationship to the services provided by the State." Complete Auto Transit, 430 U. S., at 288-289, n. 15 .  [14] Moreover, the Court's vigilance has not been limited to taxes that discriminate upon their face: "Not the tax in a vacuum of words, but its practical consequences for the doing of interstate commerce in applications to concrete facts are our concern."
