The Target Case (Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203) appears multiple times throughout the passages and is consistently treated as valid, controlling precedent. The passages show that:

1. Courts continue to actively apply Agostini's tests and principles
2. Agostini is cited as part of ""our more recent cases"" that help determine constitutional questions
3. Other cases are analyzed under the framework established by Agostini
4. No passage indicates that Agostini has been overruled or reversed
5. Instead, Agostini itself is described as overruling older precedents

Therefore, based on these passages, Agostini has not been overruled and remains valid law."
