**Dissenting Opinion**
 After all, what justifies the warrantless search is not probable cause alone, but probable cause coupled with the mobility of the automobile.  Because the scope of a warrantless search should depend on the scope of the justification for dispensing with a warrant, the entire premise of the majority’s opinion fails to support its conclusion.  The majority’s rule masks the startling assumption that a policeman’s determination of probable cause is the functional equivalent of the determination of a neutral and detached magistrate.  This assumption ignores a major premise of the warrant requirement — the importance of having a neutral and detached magistrate determine whether probable cause exists.  See supra, at 828-829.  The majority’s explanation that the scope of the warrantless automobile search will be “limited” to what a magistrate could authorize is thus inconsistent with our cases, which firmly establish that an on- *834 the-spot determination of probable cause is never the same as a decision by a neutral and detached magistrate.  C Our recent decisions in United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977), Arkansas v. Sanders, supra, and Robbins v. California, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 420</citedDecision> (1981), clearly affirm that movable containers are different from automobiles for Fourth Amendment purposes.  In Chadwick , the Court drew a constitutional distinction between luggage and automobiles in terms of substantial differences in expectations of privacy.  433 U. S., at 12 .  Moreover, the Court held that the mobility of such containers does not justify dispensing with a warrant, since federal agents had seized the luggage and safely transferred it to their custody under their exclusive control.  Sanders explicitly held that “the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment applies to personal luggage taken from an automobile to the same degree it applies to such luggage in other locations.” 442 U. S., at 766 .  And <citedDecision>Robbins</citedDecision> reaffirmed the Sanders rationale as applied to wrapped packages found in the unlocked luggage compartment of a vehicle.  <citedDecision>453 U. S., at 425</citedDecision> .  3 In light of these considerations, I conclude that any movable container found within an automobile deserves precisely the same degree of Fourth Amendment warrant protection that it would deserve if found at a location outside the automobile.  See Sanders, 442 U. S., at 763-765 , and n. 13; Chadwick, supra, at 17, n. 1 (Brennan, J., concurring).  Chadwick , as the majority notes, “reaffirmed the general principle that closed packages and containers may not be *835 searched without a warrant.” Ante, at 812.  Although there is no need to describe the exact contours of that protection in this dissenting opinion, it is clear enough that closed, opaque containers — regardless of whether they are “worthy” or are always used to store personal items — are ordinarily fully protected.  Cf. Sanders, supra, at 764, n. 13 .  4 Here, because respondent Ross had placed the evidence in question in a closed paper bag, the container could be seized, but not searched, without a warrant.

 Alternatively, the majority may be suggesting that Chadwick and Sanders may be explained because the connection of the container to the vehicle was incidental in these two cases. That is, because police had pre-existing probable cause to seize and search the containers, they were not entitled to wait until the item was placed in a vehicle to take advantage of the automobile exception.  Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971); 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 519-525 (1978).  I wholeheartedly agree that police cannot employ a pretext to escape Fourth Amendment prohibitions and cannot rely on an exigency that they could easily have avoided.  This interpretation, however, might well be an exception that swallows up the majority’s rule.  In neither Chadwick nor Sanders did the Court suggest that the delay of the police was a pretext for taking advantage of the automobile exception.  For all that appears, the Government may have had legitimate reasons for not searching as soon as they had probable cause.  In any event, asking police to rely *841 on such an uncertain line in distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate searches for containers in automobiles hardly indicates that the majority’s approach has brought clarification to this area of the law. Ante, at 804; see Robbins, <citedDecision>453 U. S., at 435</citedDecision> (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  11 I — I I — J HH The Court today ignores the clear distinction that Chadwick established between movable containers and automobiles.  It also rejects all of the relevant reasoning of Sanders 12 and offers a substitute rationale that appears inconsistent with the result.  See supra, at 832.  Sanders is therefore effectively overruled.  And the Court unambiguously overrules “the disposition” of Robbins, ante, at 824, though it gingerly avoids stating that it is overruling the case itself.  The only convincing explanation I discern for the majority’s broad rule is expediency: it assists police in conducting *842 automobile searches, ensuring that the private containers into which criminal suspects often place goods will no longer be a Fourth Amendment shield.

 The Court confines its holding today to automobiles stopped on the highway which police have probable cause to believe contain contraband.  I do not understand the Court to address the applicability of the automobile exception rule announced today to parked cars.  Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971).  The fact that the police are able initially to remove the occupants from the car does not remove the justification for an immediate search.  If police could not conduct an immediate search of a stopped automobile, they would often be left with the difficult task of deciding what to do with the occupants while a warrant is obtained.  In the case of a parked automobile, by contrast, if the automobile is unoccupied, this problem is not presented.  See, e. g., Coolidge v. New Hampshire, supra. The plurality stated: “[Chadwick and Sanders] made clear, if it was not clear before, that a closed piece of luggage found in a lawfully searched car is constitutionally protected to the same extent as are closed pieces of luggage found anywhere else.” <citedDecision>Robbins</citedDecision> v. California, <citedDecision>453 U. S., at 425</citedDecision> .  This rule may present some line-drawing problems, but no greater than those presented when a movable container is in the arms of a citizen walking down the street.  There is no justification for relying on marginal difficulties of definition to reject a warrant requirement in one situation but not the other.  The Government argues that less secure containers such as paper bags can easily spill their contents; thus, no privacy interest of the defendant is protected if police are required to seize the container and bring it to the station.  Whatever the force of this argument in other contexts, here police succeeded in reclosing the bag after the initial search and transporting it to the station without incident.  The Court in Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 182 (1925), seems to have assumed that the police could not arrest the occupants of the automobile, since the offense was a misdemeanor and was not deemed to have been committed in the officers’ presence.  See 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 511 (1978).
