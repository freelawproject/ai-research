**Lead Opinion**
 And so, if other rights are assailed by the States which properly and necessarily fall within the protection of these articles, that protection will apply though the party interested may not be of African descent.  But what we do say, and what we wish to be *92 understood is, that in any fair and just construction of any section or phrase of these amendments, it is necessary to look to the purpose which we have said was the pervading spirit of them all, the evil which they were designed to remedy, and the process of continued addition to the Constitution until that purpose was supposed to be accomplished, as far as constitutional law can accomplish it.” Idem, 78-79.

**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Chief Justice Hughes concurs in the result upon the ground, as stated by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, that the classification adopted by the legislature rested upon a reasonable basis.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Robeets: I think that the judgment should be reversed.. Four years ago in Colgate v. Harvey, 296 U. S. 404 , this court held that the equal protection clause and the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibit such a discrimination as results from the statute now under review. I adhere to the views expressed in *94 the opinion of the court in that case, and think it should be followed in this. Mr. Justice McReynolds joins in this opinion.
