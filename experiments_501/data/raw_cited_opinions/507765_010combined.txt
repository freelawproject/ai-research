      <p class="indent">Plaintiffs-appellants The Beer Institute (formerly United States Brewers Association), an industry association of beer brewers and importers, et al., commenced an action in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Dorsey, J.) against defendants-appellees John F. Healy and David L. Snyder, as Commissioners of the Connecticut Department of Liquor Control, and Charles Kasmer, as Secretary of the Department.  The complaint asserted that the amended beer price affirmation provisions of the Connecticut Liquor Control Act, 1984 Conn.Acts 332, 432, and Sec. 30-63a(b) of that Act violate the commerce clause, U.S. Const. art.  I, Sec. 8, cl. 3, and the supremacy clause, <span class="citation no-link">id.</span> art.  VI, cl. 2.

The Act, now as then, requires "posting" of prices, whereby brewers and out-of-state beer importers "file a schedule stating the per-unit price that [they] will charge Connecticut wholesalers for [beer] products in the following month," id. at 276 (footnote omitted);  see Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. Sec. 30-63c (West 1975 &amp; Supp.1988).  Posted prices become effective on the first day of the calendar month following the posting.  See Conn.Agencies Regs. Sec. 30-6-B12(b).

      <p class="indent">To encourage Connecticut residents to buy beer in-state rather than in the neighboring states, the legislature added beer price affirmation provisions to the Act.  These provisions required that:  (1) brewers adhere to the posted prices during the one-month period for which they were posted, Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. Sec. 30-63(c);  (2) brewers file a sworn affirmation that their posted per-unit prices would be no higher than their prices in the border states for the same period, <span class="citation" data-id="410387"><a href="/opinion/410387/united-states-brewers-association-inc-v-john-f-healy/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States Brewers Association, Inc. v.

      <span class="num">5</span>
      <p class="indent">In striking down the price affirmation provisions as facially invalid, this court observed that they told "a brewer that for any given month when it sells beer to a wholesaler in Massachusetts, New York, or Rhode Island, it may not do so at a price lower than that it has previously announced it will charge to Connecticut wholesalers," Healy I, <span class="citation" data-id="410387"><a href="/opinion/410387/united-states-brewers-association-inc-v-john-f-healy/#282" aria-description="Citation for case: United States Brewers Association, Inc. v. John F. Healy">692 F.2d at 282</a></span>.  "Thus," we concluded, "the obvious effect of the Connecticut statute is to control the minimum price that may be charged by a non-Connecticut brewer to a non-Connecticut wholesaler in a sale outside of Connecticut," <span class="citation" data-id="410387"><a href="/opinion/410387/united-states-brewers-association-inc-v-john-f-healy/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States Brewers Association, Inc. v.

      <p class="indent">Thereafter, the Connecticut Legislature amended the affirmation provisions with the stated purpose of remedying the constitutional problem.  Section 30-63b(b) was amended to provide that the "lowest" price charged to border-state wholesalers is determined "at the time of posting," 1984 Conn.Acts 332 ("84-332").<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a>   At the same time, section 30-63b(e)<a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">2</a> was added, providing that Sec. 30-63b did not prohibit brewers from changing prices in other states "at any time during the calendar month covered by such posting."    However, Sec. 30-63a(b),<a class="footnote" href="#fn3" id="fn3_ref">3</a> which prevents brewers from charging Connecticut wholesalers more than their lowest border-state price during the posted period, was not amended.  Section 30-63c(b), which establishes how price will be determined under the statute, also was amended by 84-332 to refer to "price ... at the time of posting."    Another amendment applicable to Sec. 30-63c(b) contained a conflicting description of price.  This amendment permits only differentials in state taxes and actual delivery costs to be excluded from the determination of "the lowest price" charged to any border-state wholesaler "during such posted period," 1984 Conn.Acts 432 ("84-432")<a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref">4</a> (emphasis added), despite the "time of posting" amendment made by 84-332.</p>

      <p class="indent">Appellants commenced this action on July 25, 1984.  In their complaint appellants alleged that " 'the interaction of the posting and affirmation provisions' " of 84-332 and Sec. 30-63a(b) " 'not only limits the price at which out-of-state shippers may sell to Connecticut wholesalers, but also sets the lowest price which an out-of-state shipper may charge anywhere in the Border States during the succeeding month,' " <span class="citation" data-id="2370562"><a href="/opinion/2370562/united-states-brewers-assn-v-healy/#547" aria-description="Citation for case: United States Brewers Ass&#x27;n v.

      <p class="indent">The state recognized that Sec. 30-63a(b) " 'standing alone' " seemingly would prevent brewers from lowering the out-of-state prices of products they also sold in Connecticut during the entire month after posting.  The state argued, however, that 84-332 made it clear that the price affirmed as the lowest price in the border states need only be effective at the moment of posting:  Brewers are free both before and after posting to raise or lower their prices outside Connecticut.  (The posted Connecticut price remains in effect for the following calendar month.)    The state submitted a Declaration and Ruling of the Connecticut Liquor Control Commission, made pursuant to the Commission's discretionary authority to "issue declaratory rulings as to the applicability of any statutory provision or of any regulation or order of the agency," Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. Sec. 4-176, providing, inter alia:</p>

Sec. 30-63a(b) mandates only that the brewer in a sale to a Connecticut wholesaler not exceed its previously posted price in Connecticut, but that a sale at a price lower in a border state, during the calendar month covered by such posting, does not contravene this section....  To the extent ... that C.G.S. Sec. 30-63a(b) is inconsistent with [Conn.Pub.Act 84-332], it must be considered impliedly repealed since the latest expression of the legislature controls.  Thus under the new affirmation scheme an out-of-state shipper is free to lower any border state price below the previously affirmed Connecticut price."</p>

      <p class="indent">The district court found that the amended Connecticut beer price affirmation provisions do not regulate interstate commerce because they do not prohibit brewers from raising or lowering beer prices in the border states prior to, or following, the Connecticut posting.  However, the court did not examine whether in fact the interaction of the Connecticut provisions with the beer price regulations of bordering states would allow such pricing flexibility.  Since Connecticut has chosen to regulate beer prices in reference to the regulated prices in the border states, it is particularly appropriate to examine the effect of the Connecticut beer price affirmation provisions resulting from their interaction with the regulatory schemes of the border states.   See Brown-Forman, <span class="citation" data-id="111683"><a href="/opinion/111683/brown-forman-distillers-corp-v-new-york-state-liquor-authority/#580" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v.

      <p class="indent">The Massachusetts beer pricing scheme requires brewers to post prices by the first day of the month to become effective on the first day of the following calendar month.  These posted prices cannot be changed by the brewer.  See Mass.Ann.Laws ch. 138, Sec. 25B(d) (Law.Co-op.1981).  As interpreted by the Liquor Control Commission, the Connecticut law requires brewers to affirm that the beer prices they post, at 10:00 a.m. on the sixth day of each month, see Conn.Agencies Regs. Sec. 30-6-B4a, are no higher than the prices that the brewer is then charging in the border states.</p>

      <span class="num">18</span>
      <p class="indent">Thus, for example, a brewer who posts his February prices for Massachusetts on January 1 must look ahead to the posting and affirmation of his March prices on February 6 in Connecticut.  The February prices that he posts in Massachusetts on January 1 will be effective and unchangeable at the time he must post and affirm his Connecticut prices for March on February 6.  Therefore, the brewer cannot post a price in Massachusetts that is lower than the price he plans to post over a month later in Connecticut.  In this way, a brewer posting his next-month's beer prices in Massachusetts does so under the restriction of Connecticut's affirmation law, which requires that the Connecticut price not be "higher than the lowest price at which such item is then being sold or offered for sale or shipped ... to any wholesaler" in a border state, Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. Sec. 30-63a(b).  Moreover, the price that the brewer posts in Massachusetts, as he looks ahead to the Connecticut affirmation day, will be effective not merely on that day, but for that entire month in Massachusetts.  A brewer can therefore undertake competitive pricing based on the market realities of either Massachusetts or Connecticut, but not both, because the Connecticut statute ties pricing to the regulatory schemes of the border states.</p>

      <p class="indent">In New York, a price that is decreased "per case, draft package or special package of beer sold to beer wholesalers" cannot be raised for at least 180 days.  See N.Y.Alco.Bev.Cont.Law Sec. 55-b(2) (McKinney 1987).  A brewer who plans to decrease his New York prices on a particular beer package, like the brewer posting his prices in Massachusetts, is confronted with the Connecticut posting and affirmation requirements.  Once a price decrease becomes effective in New York, that price will control the price he may offer in Connecticut.  On the sixth day of each month in which the New York price reduction is effective, the Connecticut statute will not allow the brewer to charge a higher price in Connecticut for the following month, no matter what the market realities would otherwise dictate.  Thus, a brewer could not raise his Connecticut price above the New York level for a total of six calendar months, because the Connecticut statute, in effect, makes the New York pricing decision a decision for Connecticut as well.  In addition, the Connecticut affirmation day falling in the last month of the New York price decrease would give Connecticut the benefit of the decreased price for a calendar month beyond the date that it terminates in New York.  Clearly this restricts a brewer's ability to promote a beer in New York that also is sold in Connecticut.  Moreover, a brewer who sells in both markets would be severely hampered in his ability to respond to market forces, particularly to the competitive demands of the New York City market, the most competitive and lowest priced market in the four-state region, see <span class="citation" data-id="2370562"><a href="/opinion/2370562/united-states-brewers-assn-v-healy/#546" aria-description="Citation for case: United States Brewers Ass&#x27;n v.

      <p class="indent">Both the Massachusetts and New York statutes provide for administrative exemptions from the beer pricing laws.  See Mass.Ann.Laws ch. 138, Sec. 25B(d) (exemption only by "written permission of the [Alcoholic Beverages] [C]ommission ... granted for good cause shown and for reasons not inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter");  N.Y.Alco.Bev.Cont.Law Sec. 55-b(3)(c) ("for good cause shown to its satisfaction" Liquor Authority "may grant waivers to licensees adversely affected by this section").  However, the possibility that an administrative agency may in its discretion grant a deviation from regulatory requirements cannot save the Connecticut statute or shift the responsibility for its effects upon the regulatory bodies of other states.  As the Court observed in Brown-Forman, "[w]e would not solve the constitutional problems inherent" in Connecticut's amended affirmation provisions "by indulging the ... assumption that the [Liquor] Authority will be sensitive to [c]ommerce [c]lause concerns....  The protections afforded by the [c]ommerce [c]lause cannot be made to depend on the good grace of a state agency," <span class="citation" data-id="111683"><a href="/opinion/111683/brown-forman-distillers-corp-v-new-york-state-liquor-authority/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v.

      <p class="indent">Connecticut's affirmation provisions also regulate beer prices in another way:  restricting a brewer's ability to offer volume discounts in the border states.  While volume discounting is unlawful in Connecticut, see Conn.Gen.Stat.Ann. Sec. 30-63(b), it is not generally prohibited in the border states.  Brewers complying with the Connecticut affirmation statute must affirm that their prices for the entire state are no higher than any volume-discounted prices offered in competitive border-state markets.  The effect of the Connecticut statute is to restrict a brewer's ability to offer volume discounts in competitive markets of the border states since the brewer could then not charge a higher price in the less competitive Connecticut market.  In this way, as well, the Connecticut statute regulates pricing in other states.</p>

Moreover, the extraterritorial effect of Connecticut's affirmation provisions, particularly as to volume discounting, "may interfere with the ability of other [s]tates to exercise their own authority under the [t]wenty-first [a]mendment" by impinging upon their "regulatory goals" or by "depriv[ing] their citizens of the opportunity to purchase brands of liquor that are sold" in Connecticut, <span class="citation" data-id="111683"><a href="/opinion/111683/brown-forman-distillers-corp-v-new-york-state-liquor-authority/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v.

    <p>CONCLUSION</p>
    <div class="num" id="p26">
      <span class="num">26</span>
      <p class="indent">In light of the foregoing, we hold that the amended Connecticut beer price affirmation provisions directly regulate interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court and remand for entry of judgment in favor of plaintiffs.</p>

        <p> A "retroactive" affirmation statute "require[s] prices to an in-state wholesaler to be at the lowest price at which the product was sold elsewhere during an earlier time period."

"Prospective" affirmation "uses as its reference point the price for out-of-state sales of liquor in the future."    <span class="citation" data-id="2090788"><a href="/opinion/2090788/brown-forman-corp-v-new-mexico-department-of-alcoholic-beverage-control/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown-Forman Corp. v.

See id.;    see also Note, Liquor Price Affirmation Statutes and the Dormant Commerce Clause, 86 Mich.L.Rev. 186, 190 n. 31 (1987) ("Simultaneous statutes ... represent a subdivision of the prospective category," retaining its "future-price orientation" but allowing "freedom to change [out of state] prices after the schedule's effective month has begun.")</p>

        <p> Several courts have found that simultaneous price affirmation statutes directly regulate out-of-state liquor prices in violation of the commerce clause.   See Brown-Forman Corp. v. New Mexico Dep't of Alco.  Bev. Cont., <span class="citation" data-id="2090788"><a href="/opinion/2090788/brown-forman-corp-v-new-mexico-department-of-alcoholic-beverage-control/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown-Forman Corp. v.

South Carolina Alcoholic Beverage...">643 F.Supp. 943</a></span> (D.S.C.1986).  The affirmation required by these statutes, however, was not simultaneous with posting, but rather with each sale:  Brewers were required to affirm that "at the moment of sale " the price to the in-state wholesaler "matches the lowest price at which the product is being sold elsewhere," Brown-Forman, <span class="citation" data-id="2090788"><a href="/opinion/2090788/brown-forman-corp-v-new-mexico-department-of-alcoholic-beverage-control/#1385" aria-description="Citation for case: Brown-Forman Corp. v.
