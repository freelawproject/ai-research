<p id="b771-8">In unsworn papers filed in a bankruptcy proceeding, petitioner made three false statements of fact. Each of those misrepresentations provided the basis for a criminal conviction and prison sentence under the federal false statement statute, <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 1001</span>. The question we address is whether § 1001 applies to false statements made in judicial proceedings.</p>
<p id="b771-9">I</p>
<p id="b771-10">In 1985, petitioner filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In the course of the proceedings, the trustee filed an amended complaint and a motion to compel petitioner to surrender certain business records. Petitioner opposed the relief sought by the trustee in a pair of unsworn, written responses filed with the Bankruptcy Court. Both of his responses contained falsehoods. Petitioner’s answer to the trustee’s complaint falsely denied the trustee’s allegations that a well-drilling machine and parts for the machine were stored at petition<page-number citation-index="1" label="698">*698</page-number>er’s home and in a nearby warehouse. Petitioner’s response to the trustee’s discovery motion incorrectly stated that petitioner had already turned over all of the requested records.</p>
<p id="b772-5">When the misrepresentations came to light, petitioner was charged with three counts of making false statements under <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 1001</span>.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That statute provides:</p>
<blockquote id="b772-6">“Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.”</blockquote>
<p id="b772-7">Relying on our decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bramblett, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">348 U. S. 503</a></span> (1955), the District Court instructed the jury that a bankruptcy court is a “department ... of the United States” within the meaning of §1001. The jury convicted petitioner on all three § 1001 counts, and the District Court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 24 months’ imprisonment.</p>
<p id="b772-8">On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, petitioner argued that his convictions under §1001 were barred by the so-called “judicial function” exception. First suggested over 30 years ago in <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="258536"><a href="/opinion/258536/daniel-jackson-oliver-wendel-holmes-morgan-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Daniel Jackson Oliver Wendel Holmes Morgan v. United States">309 F. 2d 234</a></span> (CADC 1962), cert. denied, <span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./373/917/">373 U. S. 917</a></span> (1963), this doctrine limits the extent to which § 1001 reaches conduct occurring in the federal courts. Under the exception, only those misrepresentations falling within a court’s “administrative” or “housekeeping” functions can give rise to liability <page-number citation-index="1" label="699">*699</page-number>under § 1001; false statements made while a court is performing its adjudicative functions are not covered.</p>
<p id="b773-5">The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner’s convictions under § 1001. Although the judicial function exception has become entrenched over the years in a number of Circuits, the Sixth Circuit concluded, over a dissent, that the exception does not exist. <span class="citation" data-id="663106"><a href="/opinion/663106/united-states-v-john-bruce-hubbard/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. John Bruce Hubbard">16 F. 3d 694</a></span> (1994). That conclusion created a split in the Circuits, prompting us to grant certiorari.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./513/959/">513 U. S. 959</a></span> (1994). We now reverse.</p>
<p id="b773-6">II</p>
<p id="b773-7">Section 1001 criminalizes false statements and similar misconduct occurring “in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.” In ordinary parlance, federal courts are not described as “departments” or “agencies” of the Government. As noted by the Sixth Circuit, it would be strange indeed to refer to a court as an “agency.” See <span class="citation" data-id="663106"><a href="/opinion/663106/united-states-v-john-bruce-hubbard/#698" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. John Bruce Hubbard">16 F. 3d, at 698, n. 4</a></span> (“[T]he U. S. Court of Appeals [is not] the Appellate Adjudication Agency”). And while we have occasionally spoken of the three branches of our Government, including the Judiciary, as “department[s],” <em>e. g., Mississippi </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="87790"><a href="/opinion/87790/mississippi-v-johnson/#500" aria-description="Citation for case: Mississippi v. Johnson">4 Wall. 475, 500</a></span> (1867), that locution is not an ordinary one. Far more common is the use of “department” to refer to a component of the Executive Branch.</p>
<p id="b774-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="700">*700</page-number>As an initial matter, therefore, one might be tempted to conclude that § 1001 does not apply to falsehoods made during federal-court proceedings. This commonsense reading is bolstered by the statutory definitions of “department” and “agency” set forth at <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 6</span>. First adopted in 1948, and applicable to all of Title 18, the definitions create a presumption in favor of the ordinary meaning of the terms at issue:</p>
<blockquote id="b774-5">“The term ‘department’ means one of the executive departments enumerated in section 1 [now §101] of Title 5, unless the context shows that such term was intended to describe the executive, legislative, or judicial branches of the government.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b774-6">“The term ‘agency’ includes any department, independent establishment, commission, administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States or any corporation in which the United States has a proprietary interest, unless the context shows that such term was intended to be used in a more limited sense.”</blockquote>
<p id="b774-7">Under §6, it seems incontrovertible that “agency” does not refer to a court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> “Department,” on the other hand, might be interpreted under §6 to describe the Judicial Branch, but only if the “context” of §1001 “shows” that Congress intended the word to be used in the unusual sense employed in <em>Mississippi </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="87790"><a href="/opinion/87790/mississippi-v-johnson/" aria-description="Citation for case: Mississippi v. Johnson">Johnson</a></span>. </em>We believe that § 6 permits such an interpretation only if the context in § 1001 is fairly powerful. “Shows” is a strong word; among its definitions is “[t]o make apparent or clear by evidence, testimony or reasoning; to prove; demonstrate.” Webster’s New International Dictionary 2324 (2d ed. 1949). Cf. <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>California Men’s Colony, Unit II Men’s Advisory Council, </em>506 U.¥S. 194, 200-201 (1993) (discussing similar provision <page-number citation-index="1" label="701">*701</page-number>requiring adherence to presumptive definition unless context “indicated] ” a different meaning).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b775-5">In <em>Rowland, </em>we explained the proper method of analyzing a statutory term’s “context” to determine when a presumptive definition must yield. Such an analysis, we explained, requires a court to examine “the text of the Act of Congress surrounding the word at issue, or the texts of other related congressional Acts ....” <em>Id., </em>at 199; see also <em>id., </em>at 212-213 (Thomas, J., dissenting); <em>Monell </em>v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Servs., </em><span class="citation" data-id="109881"><a href="/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/#689" aria-description="Citation for case: Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Servs.">436 U. S. 658, 689-690, n. 53</a></span> (1978). Review of other materials is not warranted. “If Congress had meant to point further afield, as to legislative history, for example, it would have been natural to use a more spacious phrase, like ‘evidence of congressional intent,’ in place of ‘context.’” <em>Rowland, </em>506 U. S., at 200.</p>
<p id="b775-6">In the case of § 1001, there is nothing in the text of the statute, or in any related legislation, that even suggests — let alone “shows” — that the normal definition of “department” was not intended. Accordingly, a straightforward interpretation of the text of §1001, with special emphasis on the words “department or agency,” would seem to lead inexorably to the conclusion that there is no need for any judicial function exception because the reach of the statute simply does not extend to courts. Our task, however, is complicated by the fact that the Court interpreted “department” broadly 40 years ago in <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span>. </em>We must, therefore, <page-number citation-index="1" label="702">*702</page-number>turn our attention to that case before deciding the fate of the judicial function exception.</p>
<p id="b776-4">Ill</p>
<p id="b776-5">Defendant Bramblett was a former Member of Congress who had falsely represented to the Disbursing Office of the House of Representatives that a particular person was entitled to compensation as his official clerk. He argued that he could not be convicted under §1001 because his falsehood was directed to an office within the Legislative Branch. <span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/#504" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">348 U. S., at 504</a></span>. The Court rejected this argument, concluding that the word “department,” as used in § 1001, “was meant to describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Government.” <em>Id., </em>at 509. Although <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>involved Congress, not the courts, the text and reasoning in the Court’s opinion amalgamated all three branches of the Government. Thus, <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>is highly relevant here even though its narrow holding only extended § 1001 to false statements made within the Legislative Branch.</p>
<p id="b776-6">We think <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>must be acknowledged as a seriously flawed decision. Significantly, the <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>Court made no attempt to reconcile its interpretation with the usual meaning of “department.” It relied instead on a review of the evolution of § 1001 and its statutory cousin, the false claims statute presently codified at <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 287</span>, as providing a “context” for the conclusion that “Congress could not have intended to leave frauds such as [Bramblett’s] without penalty.” <span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/#509" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">348 U. S., at 509</a></span>. We are convinced that the Court erred by giving insufficient weight to the plain language of §§6 and 1001.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although the historical evolution of a stat<page-number citation-index="1" label="703">*703</page-number>ute — based on decisions by the entire Congress — should not be discounted for the reasons that may undermine confidence in the significance of excerpts from congressional debates and committee reports,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a historical analysis normally provides less guidance to a statute’s meaning than its final text. In the ordinary case, absent any “indication that doing so would frustrate Congress’s clear intention or yield patent absurdity, our obligation is to apply the statute as Congress wrote it.” <em>BFP </em>v. <em>Resolution Trust Corporation, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1087957"><a href="/opinion/1087957/bfp-v-resolution-trust-corporation/#570" aria-description="Citation for case: BFP v. Resolution Trust Corporation">511 U. S. 531, 570</a></span> (1994) (Souter, J., dissenting).</p>
<p id="b777-5">As noted above, a straightforward reading of the statute suggests a meaning of “department” that is fully consistent with the definition set forth in § 6. See <em>supra, </em>at 699-702. Similarly unremarkable is the language of the original Act of Congress adopting what is now § 1001. That piece of legislation — the Act of June 18, 1934, <span class="citation no-link">48 Stat. 996</span> (1934 Act)— <page-number citation-index="1" label="704">*704</page-number>amended what was then § 35 of the Criminal Code to provide, in pertinent part:</p>
<blockquote id="b778-5">“[W]hoever shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations, or make or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious statement or entry, <em>in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States </em>or of any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder... [shall be punished].” (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
<p id="b778-6">This language conveys no different message regarding “department” than the current version of § 1001.</p>
<p id="b778-7">What, then, of the earlier statutory history chronicled in <em>Bramblett? </em>We believe it is at best inconclusive, and that it does not supply a “context” sufficiently clear to warrant departure from the presumptive definition in <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 6</span>.</p>
<p id="b778-8">The earliest statutory progenitor of § 1001 was the original false claims statute, adopted as the Act of Mar. 2,1863, ch. 67, <span class="citation no-link">12 Stat. 696</span> (1863 Act). That enactment made it a criminal offense for any person, whether a civilian or a member of the military services, to</p>
<blockquote id="b778-9">“present or cause to be presented for payment or approval to or by any person or officer in the civil or military service of the United States, any claim upon or against the Government of the United States, or any department or officer thereof, knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent.”<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>
<p id="b779-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="705">*705</page-number>The 1863 Act also proscribed false statements, but the scope of that provision was far narrower than that of modern-day § 1001; the Act prohibited only those false statements made “for the purpose of obtaining, or aiding in obtaining, the approval or payment of [a false] claim.” <span class="citation no-link">12 Stat. 696</span>. The Court explained in <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>that the false claims provision in the 1863 Act “clearly cover[ed] the presentation of false claims against any component of the Government to any officer of the Government,” <span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/#505" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">348 U. S., at 505</a></span>, and it asserted similar breadth for the false statement portion of the Act, <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">ibid.</a></span></em></p>
<p id="b779-5">The false statements provision in the 1863 Act remained essentially unchanged for 55 years.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1918, Congress amended the statute to provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b779-6">“[W]hoever, for the purpose of obtaining or aiding to obtain the payment or approval of [a false] claim, <em>or for the purpose and with the intent of cheating and swindling or defrauding the Government of the United States, or any department thereof, or any corporation in which the United States of America is a stockholder, shall knowingly and willfully falsify or conceal or cover up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or make or cause to be made any false or fraudulent statements or representations, </em>or make or use or cause to be made or used any false bill, receipt, voucher, roll, account, claim, certificate, affidavit, or deposition, knowing the same to contain any fraudulent or fictitious statement or entry [shall be punished].” Act of Oct. 23, <page-number citation-index="1" label="706">*706</page-number>1918, ch. 194, <span class="citation no-link">40 Stat. 1015</span>-1016 (1918 Act) (emphasis added).</blockquote>
<p id="b780-6">The scope of this new provision is unclear. Although it could be read to create criminal liability for government-wide false statements, its principal purpose seems to have been to prohibit false statements made to defraud Government corporations, which flourished during World War I. Cf. <em>Lebron </em>v. <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation, </em><span class="citation" data-id="117895"><a href="/opinion/117895/lebron-v-national-railroad-passenger-corporation/#386" aria-description="Citation for case: Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation">513 U. S. 374, 386-391</a></span> (1995) (tracing history of Government corporations). In one important respect, moreover, the statute remained relatively narrow: It was limited to false statements intended to bilk the Government out of money or property. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em><span class="citation" data-id="100806"><a href="/opinion/100806/united-states-v-cohn/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Cohn">270 U. S. 339</a></span> (1926). Given the continuing focus on financial frauds against the Government, the 1918 Act did not alter the fundamental character of the original false claims statute.</p>
<p id="b780-7">The 1934 Act, which created the statute we now know as § 1001, did work such a change. Congress excised from the statute the references to financial frauds, thereby severing the historical link with the false claims portion of the statute, and inserted the requirement that the false statement be made “in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States.” This addition, critical for present purposes, is subject to two competing inferences. On one hand, it can be read to impose new words of limitation — whose ordinary meaning connotes the Executive Branch — in an altogether reformulated statute. On the other hand, it can be viewed as stripping away the financial fraud requirement while not disturbing the pre-existing breadth the statute had enjoyed from its association with the false claims statute.</p>
<p id="b780-8">The <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>Court embraced the latter inference, finding no indication in any legislative history that the amendment was intended to narrow the scope of the statute. We think this interpretation, though not completely implausible, is nevertheless unsound. The differences between the 1934 <page-number citation-index="1" label="707">*707</page-number>Act and its predecessors are too dramatic to evidence a congressional intent to carry forward any features of the old provision. Moreover, our comments, over the years, regarding the 1934 legislation — including those contained in <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>itself — contradict the notion that such a “carry forward” occurred.</p>
<p id="b781-5">We have repeatedly recognized that the 1934 Act was passed at the behest of “the Secretary of the Interior to aid the enforcement of laws relating to the functions of the Department of the Interior and, in particular, to the enforcement of regulations ... with respect to the transportation of ‘hot oil.’” <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gilliland, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103440"><a href="/opinion/103440/united-states-v-gilliland/#93" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

S. 86, 93-94</a></span> (1941); see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Yermian, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111238"><a href="/opinion/111238/united-states-v-yermian/#72" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Yermian">468 U. S. 63, 72</a></span> (1984) (the 1934 Act was “needed to increase the protection of federal agencies from the variety of deceptive practices plaguing the New Deal administration”); <span class="citation" data-id="111238"><a href="/opinion/111238/united-states-v-yermian/#80" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Yermian"><em>id., </em>at 80</a></span> (Rehn-QUIST, J., dissenting) (the statute was prompted by problems arising from “the advent of the New Deal programs in the 1930’s”). Indeed, the <em>Bmmblett </em>Court itself acknowledged the connection between the 1934 Act and the proliferation of fraud in the newly formed Executive agencies:</p>
<blockquote id="b781-6">“The 1934 revision was largely the product of the urging of the Secretary of the Interior. The Senate Report, S. Rep. No. 1202,73d Cong., 2d Sess., indicates that its purpose was to broaden the statute so as to reach not only false papers presented in connection with a claim against the Government, but also nonmonetary frauds such as those involved in the ‘hot-oil’ shipments.” <span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/#507" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">348 U. S., at 507</a></span>.</blockquote>
<p id="b781-7">None of our opinions refers to any indication that Congress even <em>considered </em>whether the 1934 Act might apply outside the Executive Branch, much less that it affirmatively understood the new enactment to create broad liability for falsehoods in the federal courts. In light of this vacuum, it would be curious indeed if Congress truly intended the 1934 Act to <page-number citation-index="1" label="708">*708</page-number>work a dramatic alteration in the law governing misconduct in the court system or the Legislature. The unlikelihood of such a scenario only strengthens our conclusion that the <em>Bmmblett </em>Court erred in its interpretation of § lOOl’s statutory history.</p>
<p id="b782-5">Putting Bmmblett's historical misapprehensions to one side, however, we believe the <em>Bmmblett </em>Court committed a far more basic error in its underlying approach to statutory construction. Courts should not rely on inconclusive statutory history as a basis for refusing to give effect to the plain language of an Act of Congress, particularly when the Legislature has specifically defined the controverted term. In <em>Bmmblett, </em>the Court’s method of analysis resulted in a decision that is at war with the text of not one, but two different Acts of Congress.</p>
<p id="b782-6">Whether the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>nevertheless requires that we accept Bmmblett’s erroneous interpretation of §1001 is a question best answered after reviewing the body of law directly at issue: the decisions adopting the judicial function exception.</p>
<p id="b782-7">IV</p>
<p id="b782-8">Although other federal courts have refrained from directly criticizing Bmmblett’s approach to statutory construction, it is fair to say that they have greeted the decision with something less than a warm embrace. The judicial function exception, an obvious attempt to impose limits on <em>Brambletfs </em>expansive reading of § 1001, is a prime example. As the following discussion indicates, the judicial function exception is almost as deeply rooted as <em>Bmmblett </em>itself.</p>
<p id="b782-9">The seeds of the exception were planted by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit only seven years after <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

S. 917</a></span> (1963), the defendant, who had falsely held himself out to be a bona fide member of the bar, was prosecuted on three counts of violating § 1001 for concealing from the court his name, identity, <page-number citation-index="1" label="709">*709</page-number>and nonadmission to the bar. After first acknowledging that, but for <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span>, </em>it might well have accepted the argument that Congress did not intend § 1001 to apply to the courts, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction. But the court was clearly troubled by the potential sweep of § 1001. Noting that the statute prohibits “concealment” and “covering up” of material facts, as well as intentional falsehoods, the court wondered whether the statute might be interpreted to criminalize conduct that falls well within the bounds of responsible advocacy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court concluded its opinion with this significant comment:</p>
<blockquote id="b783-5">“We are certain that neither Congress nor the Supreme Court intended the statute to include traditional trial tactics within the statutory terms ‘conceals or covers up.’ We hold only, on the authority of the Supreme Court construction, that the statute does apply to the type of action with which appellant was charged, action which essentially involved the ‘administrative’ or ‘housekeeping’ functions, not the ‘judicial’ machinery of the court.” <span class="citation" data-id="258536"><a href="/opinion/258536/daniel-jackson-oliver-wendel-holmes-morgan-v-united-states/#237" aria-description="Citation for case: Daniel Jackson Oliver Wendel Holmes Morgan v.

<blockquote id="b784-5">“[T]he adjudicative functions exception to section 1001 has been suggested or recognized by appellate decisions since 1962, not long after the Supreme Court decided that section 1001 applies to matters within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch.

<p id="b784-6">The Second Circuit sounded a similar theme in 1991, relying in part on the congressional acquiescence to which the Ninth Circuit had adverted in <em><span class="citation" data-id="460201"><a href="/opinion/460201/united-states-v-lawrence-joseph-mayer/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b785-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="711">*711</page-number>Although not all of the courts of appeals have endorsed the judicial function exception, it is nevertheless clear that the doctrine has a substantial following. See n. 2, <em>supra. </em>Moreover, as both the Ninth and the Second Circuits observed, Congress has not seen fit to repudiate, limit, or refine the exception despite its somewhat murky borders and its obvious tension with the text of the statute as construed in <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b785-4">V</p>
<p id="b785-5">With the foregoing considerations in mind, we now turn to the difficult <em>stare decisis </em>question that this case presents. It is, of course, wise judicial policy to adhere to rules announced in earlier eases. As Justice Cardozo reminded us: “The labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in every case, and one could not lay one’s own course of bricks on the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone before him.” B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921). Adherence to precedent also serves an indispensable institutional role within the Federal Judiciary. <em>Stare decisis </em>is “a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon ‘an arbitrary discretion.’” <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>McLean Credit Union, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112296"><a href="/opinion/112296/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/#172" aria-description="Citation for case: Patterson v. McLean Credit Union">491 U. S. 164, 172</a></span> (1989) (quoting The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton)). See also <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. </em>v. <em>Casey, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112786"><a href="/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/#854" aria-description="Citation for case: Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey">505 U. S. 833, 854-855</a></span> (1992) (joint opinion of O’Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). Respect for precedent is strongest “in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court’s interpretation <page-number citation-index="1" label="712">*712</page-number>of its legislation.” <em>Illinois Brick Co. </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109680"><a href="/opinion/109680/illinois-brick-co-v-illinois/#736" aria-description="Citation for case: Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois">431 U. S. 720, 736</a></span> (1977).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b786-5">In this case, these considerations point in two conflicting directions. On one hand, they counsel adherence to the construction of § 1001 adopted in <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span>; </em>on the other, they argue in favor of retaining the body of law that has cut back on the breadth of <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>in Circuits from coast to coast.</p>
<p id="b786-6">It would be difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously. For if the word “department” encompasses the Judiciary, as <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>stated, <span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/#509" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">348 U. S., at 509</a></span>, the judicial function exception cannot be squared with the text of the statute. A court is a court — and is part of the Judicial Branch— whether it is functioning in a housekeeping or judicial capacity. Conversely, <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>could not stand if we preserved the thrust of the judicial function <em>exception </em>— i. <em>e., </em>if we interpreted <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 1001</span> so that it did not reach conduct occurring in federal-court proceedings. Again, although <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>involved a false representation to an office within the Legislative Branch, the decision lumped all three branches together in one and the same breath. See 384 U. S., at 509 (“department” in § 1001 “was meant to describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Government”).</p>
<p id="b787-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="713">*713</page-number>We think the text of § 1001 forecloses any argument that we should simply ratify the body of cases adopting the judicial function exception. We are, however, persuaded that the clarity of that text justifies a reconsideration of <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span>.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although such a reconsideration is appropriate only in the rarest circumstances, we believe this case permits it because of a highly unusual “intervening development of the law,” see <em>Patterson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112296"><a href="/opinion/112296/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/#173" aria-description="Citation for case: Patterson v. McLean Credit Union">491 U. S., at 173</a></span>, and because of the absence of significant reliance interests in adhering to <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span>.</em></p>
<p id="b787-5">The “intervening development” is, of course, the judicial function exception. In a virtually unbroken line of cases, respected federal judges have interpreted § 1001 so narrowly that it has had only a limited application within the Judicial Branch. See nn. 2 and 10, <em>supra. </em>This interpretation has roots both deep and broad in the lower courts. Although the judicial function exception has not been adopted by this Court, our review of <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>supports the conclusion that the cases endorsing the exception almost certainly reflect the intent of Congress. It is thus fair to characterize the judicial function exception as a “competing legal doctrin[ej,” <em>Patterson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112296"><a href="/opinion/112296/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/#173" aria-description="Citation for case: Patterson v. McLean Credit Union">491 U. S., at 173</a></span>, that can lay a legitimate claim to respect as a settled body of law. Overruling <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>would preserve the essence of this doctrine and would, to that extent, promote stability in the law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b788-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="714">*714</page-number><em>Stare decisis </em>has special force when legislators or citizens “have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.” <em>Hilton </em>v. <em>South Carolina Public Railways Comm’n, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112669"><a href="/opinion/112669/hilton-v-south-carolina-public-railways-commission/#202" aria-description="Citation for case: Hilton v.

Casey">505 U. S., at 854-856</a></span> (joint opinion of O’Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.). Here, however, the reliance interests at stake in adhering to <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">Bramblett</a></span> </em>are notably modest. In view of the extensive array of statutes that already exist to penalize false statements within the Judicial Branch, see, <em>e. g., </em><span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 1621</span> (perjury); § 1623 (false declarations before grand jury or court); §1503 (obstruction of justice); §287 (false claims against the United States), we doubt that prosecutors have relied on § 1001 as an important means of deterring and punishing litigation-related misconduct.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But we need not speculate, for we have direct evidence on this point. The United States Attorneys’ Manual states quite plainly that “[pjrosecutions should not be brought under <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. § 1001</span> for false statements submitted in federal court proceedings”; it instead directs prosecutors to proceed under the perjury or obstruction of justice statutes. U. S. Dept, of <page-number citation-index="1" label="715">*715</page-number>Justice, United States Attorneys’ Manual ¶ 9-69.267 (1992). Clearer evidence of nonreliance can scarcely be imagined.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b789-5">Similarly unimpressive is the notion of congressional reliance on <em>Bmmblett. </em>The longstanding judicial function exception has, to a large extent, negated the actual application of § 1001 within the Judiciary. It is unlikely that Congress has relied on what has, for many years, been an unfulfilled promise.</p>
<p id="b789-6">In sum, although the <em>stare decisis </em>issue in this case is difficult, we conclude that there are sound reasons to correct <em>Bramblett’s </em>erroneous construction of § 1001. Although we could respect prior decisions by endorsing the judicial function exception or by adhering to <em>Bmmblett </em>while repudiating that exception, we believe coherence and stability in the law will best be served in this case by taking a different course. Limiting the coverage of § 1001 to the area plainly marked by its text will, as a practical matter, preserve the interpretation of § 1001 that has prevailed for over 30 years and will best serve the administration of justice in the future.</p>
<p id="b789-7">VI</p>
<p id="b789-8"><em>Bmmblett </em>is hereby overruled. We hold that a federal court is neither a “department” nor an “agency” within the meaning of § 1001. The Court of Appeals’ decision is therefore reversed to the extent that it upheld petitioner’s convictions under § 1001.</p>

<p id="b776-7"> In addition, it is debatable at best whether the Court was correct in asserting that, but for its expansive interpretation of § 1001, Bramblett’s fraud would necessarily have gone unpunished. In discussing the evolution of § 1001, the Court noted that the false claims statute, originally enacted in 1863 and by 1955 codified at <span class="citation no-link">18 U. S. C. §287</span>, “clearly covers the presentation of false claims against any component of the Government <page-number citation-index="1" label="703">*703</page-number>to any officer of the Government.” <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bramblett, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/#505" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Bramblett">348 U. S. 503, 505</a></span> (1955). In an earlier decision, it had interpreted “claim” in the false claims statute broadly, explaining that the word referred to “a claim for money or property to which a right is asserted against the Government, based upon the Government’s own liability to the claimant.” <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cohn, </em><span class="citation" data-id="100806"><a href="/opinion/100806/united-states-v-cohn/#345" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

Bramblett could thus seemingly have been charged with violating § 287, or at least aiding and abetting in a violation of that statute, since his misrepresentation was intended to procure Government compensation. See Supplemental Memorandum for the United States in <em>United States </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b787-6"> Because the fate of the judicial function exception is tied so closely to <em><span class="citation" data-id="105287"><a href="/opinion/105287/united-states-v-bramblett/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

<p id="b787-7"> The dissent criticizes us for according respect to a body of law developed in the lower courts, arguing that our decision will “induce” federal judges on the courts of appeals to “ignore” precedents from this Court and thereby invite chaos in the judicial system. <em>Post, </em>at 721. We would have thought it self-evident that the lower courts must adhere to our precedents. Indeed, the dissent’s dire prediction is at odds with its own observation that “no lower court would deliberately refuse to follow the decision <page-number citation-index="1" label="714">*714</page-number>of a higher court,” see <em>post, </em>at 720. In concluding that the cases adopting the judicial function exception are faithful to the intent of the Legislature that adopted §1001, we have obviously exercised our own independent judgment. Thus, far from “subvert[ing] the very principle on which a hierarchical court system is built,” <em>post, </em>at 719, our decision merely reflects our assessment of the statutory construction issue this case presents, while serving what the dissent acknowledges to be one of the central purposes of <em>stare decisis: promoting </em>“stability and certainty in the law,” post, at 720.</p>

<p id="b789-10"> The absence of significant reliance interests is confirmed by an examination of statistical data regarding actual cases brought under §1001. The Government has secured convictions under § 1001 in 2,247 cases over the last five fiscal years, see <em>post, </em>at 722, but the dissent can identify only five reported § 1001 cases in that time period brought in connection with false statements made to the Judiciary and Legislature. <em>Post, </em>at 723, n. (At least two of the five were unsuccessful, from the Government’s point of view.) This tiny handful of prosecutions does not, in our view, evidence a weighty reliance interest on the part of prosecutors in adhering to the interpretation of § 1001 set forth in <em>Bmmblett.</em></p>
