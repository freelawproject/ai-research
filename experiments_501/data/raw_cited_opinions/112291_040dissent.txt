<p id="b89-7">I agree with Justice Sc alia that a faithful interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment embodies a concept of state sovereignty which limits the power of Congress to abrogate States’ immunity when acting pursuant to the Commerce Clause. But that view does not command a majority of the Court, thus necessitating an inquiry whether Congress intended in CERCLA, 42 U. S. C. §9601 <em>et seq., </em>and SARA, Pub. L. 99-499, 100 Stat. 1613, to abrogate the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity. On that question, I join Part I of Justice White’s opinion. I also join Parts II, III, and IV of Justice Scalia’s opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
