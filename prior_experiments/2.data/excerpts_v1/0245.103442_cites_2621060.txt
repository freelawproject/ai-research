**Combined Opinion**
The requirement for records even of the intrastate transaction is an appropriate means to the legitimate end. See Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, 221 U.S. 612 ; Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Goodrich Transit Co., 224 U.S. 194 ; Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, 262 U.S. 1 , 42. Validity of the wage and hour provisions under the Fifth Amendment. Both provisions are minimum wage requirements compelling the payment of a minimum standard wage with a prescribed increased wage for overtime of "not less than one and one-half times the regular rate" at which the worker is employed. Since our decision in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U.S. 379 , it is no longer open to question that the fixing of a minimum wage is within the legislative power and that the bare fact of its exercise is not a denial of due process under the Fifth more than under the Fourteenth Amendment. Nor is it any longer open to question that it is within the legislative power to fix maximum hours. Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366 ; Muller v. Oregon, 208 U.S. 412 ; Bunting v. Oregon, 243 U.S. 426 ; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n, supra . Similarly the statute is not objectionable because applied alike to both men and women. Cf. Bunting v. Oregon, 243 U.S. 426 . The Act is sufficiently definite to meet constitutional demands. One who employs persons, without conforming to the prescribed wage and hour conditions, to work on goods which he ships or expects to ship across state *126 lines, is warned that he may be subject to the criminal penalties of the Act. No more is required. Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373 , 377. We have considered, but find it unnecessary to discuss other contentions. Reversed.
