 Cf. Arndt v. Griggs, 134 U. S. 316 ; Dewey v. Des Moines, 173 U. S. 193 ; Fall v. Eastin, 215 U. S. 1 ; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U. S. 386 ; Hood v. McGehee, 237 U. S. 611 ; Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U. S. 385 ; Clark v. Williard, 294 U. S. 211 ; Pink v. A. A. A. Highway Express Co., 314 U. S. 201 .  Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, 286 U. S. 276, 279 ; New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, 300 U. S. 308, 313 ; Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463-464 ; Skiriotes v. Florida, 313 U. S. 69 .  Cf. Arndt v. Griggs; Dewey v. Des Moines; Grannis v. Ordean; Clark v. Williard, supra, note 3 .  A spouse who appears and contests the jurisdiction of the court of another state to grant a divorce may not collaterally attack its findings of domicile- and jurisdiction made after such appearance.  Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32 .  So also, a deserter from the matrimonial domicile may be bound by a divorce granted by a court of the state where the matrimonial domicile is situated.  Whether fault on the part of the deserter is an essential seems on the basis of our cases on -jurisdiction *320 for divorce to be an open question; Atherton v. Atherton, <citedDecision>181 U. S. 155</citedDecision> ; Haddock v. Haddock, supra, at 570, 572, 583 ; and Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551 ; but our decisions on analogous problems might be found to afford adequate support for a decision that it is not.  Cf. Washington ex rel. Bond & Goodwin & Tucker v. Superior Court, 289 U. S. 361 ; Doherty & Co. v. Goodman, 294 U. S. 623 .  See, further, Eestatement, Conflict of Laws, §§ 112, 113.  This was the decision in Bell v. Bell, 181 U. S. 175 ; and Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U. S. 14 .  Davis v. Davis, supra, note 6 , in no way indicates that a finding of domicile after appearance of the absent spouse and litigation of the question would be conclusive upon the state of his domicile in litigation involving its interests and not merely those of the parties.  Cf. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 172, n. 13 .  1 Beale, Conflict of Laws (1935) § 10.3.
