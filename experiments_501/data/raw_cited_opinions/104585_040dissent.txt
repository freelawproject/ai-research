<author id="b147-6">Mr. Justice Rutledge,</author>
<p id="AOZ">dissenting.</p>
<p id="b147-7">With reservations to be noted, I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Jackson, and with Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s conclusions concerning the effect of the immunity provision, § 202 (g) of the Emergency Price Control Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b148-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="72">*72</page-number>With them I cannot accept the Court’s construction of that section which reduces the statutory immunity to the scope of that afforded by the Fifth Amendment’s prohibition against compulsory self-incrimination. This Court has not previously so decided.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nor, in my judg<page-number citation-index="1" label="73">*73</page-number>ment, can the present decision be reconciled with the language of the statute or its purpose obvious on its face.</p>
<p id="b149-5">That wording compels testimony and the production of evidence, documentary or otherwise, regardless of any claim of constitutional immunity, whether valid or not.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But to avoid the constitutional prohibition and, it would seem clearly, also any delay in securing the information or evidence required, the Act promises immunity “for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing, concerning which he may testify, or produce evidence ... in obedience to” the subpoena.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b149-6">The statute thus consists of a command and a promise. In explicit terms the promise is made coextensive with the command. It expressly precludes prosecution, forfeiture or penalty “for or on account of <em>any </em>transaction, matter or thing” concerning which evidence is produced in compliance with the subpoena.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Compelling testimony and giving immunity “for or on account of any transaction, matter or thing, concerning which he may testify” are very different from compelling it and promising that, when given, the person complying “shall have only the immunity given by the Fifth Amendment and no more.” To constrict the statute’s wording so drastically is not simply to interpret, it is to rewrite the congressional <page-number citation-index="1" label="74">*74</page-number>language and, in my view, its purpose. If Congress had intended only so narrow a protection, it could easily have said so without adding words to lead witnesses and others to believe more was given.</p>
<p id="b150-6">It may be, however, notwithstanding the breadth of the promissory terms, that the statutory immunity was not intended to be so broad as to cover situations where the claim of constitutional right precluded is only frivolous or insubstantial or not put forward in good faith.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And if, for such a reason, the literal breadth of the wording may be somewhat cut down, restricting the statute’s immunity by excluding those situations would neither restrict the effect of the statutory words to that of the Amendment itself nor give them the misleading connotation of the Court’s construction. Such a construction would not be departing widely from either the statute’s terms or their obvious purpose to give immunity broader than the Amendment’s, and would be well within the bounds of statutory interpretation. On the other hand, the Court’s reduction of the statutory wording to equivalence in effect with the constitutional immunity, nearly if not quite makes that wording redundant or meaningless; in any event, it goes so far in rewriting the statutory language as to amount to invasion of the legislative function.</p>
<p id="b150-7">Whether one or the other of the two broader views of the statute’s effect is accepted, therefore, it is neither necessary nor, I think, reasonable or consistent with the statutory wording and object or with this Court’s function as strictly a judicial body to go so far in reconstructing what Congress has done, as I think results from reducing the statutory immunity to equivalence with the constitutional one.</p>
<p id="b151-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="75">*75</page-number>Since it is not contended that there was not full compliance with the subpoena in this case, that compliance was excessive in the presently material portions of the evidence or information produced, or that the claim of constitutional immunity precluded was frivolous, insubstantial or not made in good faith, I think the judgment should be reversed by applying the statutory immunity, whether in one or the other of the two forms which may be applied.</p>
<p id="b151-5">In this view I am relieved of the necessity of reaching the constitutional issue resulting from the Court’s construction, and I express no opinion upon it except to say that I have substantial doubt of the validity of the Court’s conclusion and indicate some of the reasons for this. I have none that Congress itself may require the keeping and production of specified records, with appropriate limitations, in connection with business matters it is entitled to and does regulate. That is true not only of corporate records, <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>221 U. S. 361, but also of individual business records under appropriate specification and limitations, as the numerous instances cited in Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s opinion illustrate.</p>
<p id="b151-6">But I seriously doubt that, consistently with the Fourth Amendment, as well as the prohibition of the Fifth against compulsory self-incrimination, Congress could enact-a general law requiring all persons, individual or corporate, engaged in business subject to congressional regulation to produce, either in evidence or for an administrative agency’s or official’s examination, any and all records, without other limitation, kept in connection with that business. Such a command would approach too closely in effect the kind of general warrant the Fourth Amendment outlawed. That would be even more obviously true, if there were any difference, in case Congress <page-number citation-index="1" label="76">*76</page-number>should delegate to an administrative or executive official the power to impose so broad a prohibition.</p>
<p id="b152-5">The authority here conferred upon the Administrator by the Emergency Price Control Act, in reference to record-keeping and requiring production of records, closely approaches such a command. Congress neither itself specifies the records to be kept and produced upon the Administrator’s demand nor limits his power to designate them by any restriction other than that he may require such as “he deems necessary or proper to assist him,” § 202 (a), (b), (c), in carrying out his functions of investigation and prescribing regulations under, as well as of administration and enforcement of, the Act. And as the authority to specify records for keeping and production was carried out by the Administrator, the only limitation imposed was that the records should be such as had been “customarily kept.” § 14 (b), M. P. R. 426, 8 Fed. Reg. 9546, 9549. Such a restriction is little, if any, less broad than the one concerning which I have indicated doubt that Congress itself could enact consistently with the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p id="b152-6">The authorization therefore is one which raises serious question whether, by reason of failure to make more definite specification of the records to be kept and produced, the legislation and regulations involved here do not exceed the prohibition of the Fourth Amendment against general warrants and unreasonable searches and seizures. There is a difference, of course, and often a large one, between situations where evidence is searched out and seized without warrant, and others where it is required to be produced under judicial safeguards. But I do not understand that in the latter situation its production can be required under a warrant that amounts to a general one. The Fourth Amendment stands as a barrier to judicial and legislative as well as executive or administrative excesses in this respect.</p>
<p id="b153-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="77">*77</page-number>Although I seriously question whether the sum of the statute, as construed by the Court, the pertinent regulations, and their execution in this case does not go beyond constitutional limitations in the breadth of their inquiry, I express no conclusive opinion concerning this, since for me the statutory immunity applies and is sufficient to require reversal of petitioner’s conviction.</p>

<p id="b148-4"> Neither <em>Heike </em>v. <em>United States, </em>227 U. S. 131, nor <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>221 R. S. 361, principally relied upon by the Court, approached such a ruling.</p>
<p id="b148-5">The <em>Wilson </em>case dealt only with corporate records, and the claim, of a corporate officer having their custody to constitutional immunity against being required to produce them. None were required by law to be kept, in the sense that any federal law required that they be kept and produced for regulatory purposes. The only ruling was that a corporate officer has no personal immunity against producing corporate records, which are of course not his own, and that the corporation has no immunity of its own under the Fifth Amendment’s guaranty. The decision is not pertinent to the presently tendered problem.</p>
<p id="b148-6">The <em>Heike </em>decision is equally not apropos. The exact ruling was that the evidence, from the production of which the claimed right of immunity, constitutional as well as statutory, arose, “did not concern any matter of the present charge. Not only was the general subject of the former investigation wholly different, but the specific things testified to had no connection with the facts now in proof much closer than that they all were dealings of the same sugar company.” 227 U. S. 131, 143. The actual ruling therefore, apart from the fact that a corporate officer claimed immunity in large part for producing corporate records, see <em>id., </em>142-143, was that the petitioner had not brought himself within the scope of the statutory authorization, namely, because the “transaction, matter or thing” concerning which he had testified had no substantial connection with the matters involved in his prosecution. The decision is authority for nothing more than that the immunity at the most does not attach when the constitutional claim precluded, but said to bring the statute into play, is insubstantial. The dictum stressed in the Court’s opinion that the statute “should be construed, <em>so far as its words fairly allow the construction, </em>as coterminous with” (P. 142) the constitutional immunity, not only was unnecessary, but as the clause itself emphasized explicitly negatives exact equivalence. (Emphasis added.)</p>

<p id="b149-7"> The wording of the Compulsory Testimony Act neither requires nor suggests that the right to the immunity given should turn on the validity or invalidity of the constitutional claim which is precluded. But at the least the Act would seem clearly to cover both valid and substantially doubtful ones.</p>

<p id="b149-10"> The express limitation of the immunity to testimony or evidence produced in obedience to the subpoena excludes immunity for volunteered testimony or evidence, <em>i. e., </em>such as is given in excess of the subpoena’s requirement.
