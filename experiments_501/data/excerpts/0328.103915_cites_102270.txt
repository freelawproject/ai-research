 In that connection it will be recalled that Hope contended for a rate base of $66,000,000 computed on reproduction cost new.  The Commission points out that if that rate base were accepted, Hope’s average rate of return for the four-year period from 1937-1940 would amount to 3.27%.  During that period Hope earned an annual average return of about 9%.  on the average investment.  It asked for no rate increases.  Its properties were well maintained and operated.  As the Commission says, such a modest rate of 3.27% suggests an “inflation of the base on which the rate has been computed.” Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 290, 312</citedDecision> .  Cf. Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Tel. Co., supra, p. 164.  The incongruity between the actual operations and the return computed on the basis of reproduction cost suggests that the Commission was wholly justified in rejecting the latter as the measure of the rate base.  In view of this disposition of the controversy we need not stop to inquire whether the failure of the Commission to add the $17,000,000 of well-drilling and other costs to *606 the rate base was consistent with the prudent investment theory as developed and applied in particular cases. Only a word need be added respecting depletion and depreciation.  We held in the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. case that there was no constitutional requirement “that the owner who embarks in a wasting-asset business of limited life shall receive at the end more than he has put into it.” 315 U. S. p. 593.  The Circuit Court of Appeals did not think that that rule was applicable here because Hope was a utility required to continue its service to the public and not scheduled to end its business on a day certain as was stipulated to be true of the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. But that distinction is quite immaterial.  The ultimate exhaustion of the supply is inevitable in the case of all natural gas companies.

 Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, 249 U. S. 236 (1919); Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 252 U. S. 23 (1920).  These questions settled, the Court again was called upon in natural gas cases to consider state rate-making claimed to be invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment.  United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, 278 U. S. 300 (1929); United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, 278 U. S. 322 (1929).  Then, as now, the differences were “due chiefly to the difference in value ascribed by each to the gas rights and leaseholds.” 278 U. S. 300, 311 .  No one seems to have questioned that the rate base method must be pursued and the controversy was as to what rate base must be used.  Later the “value” of gas in the field was questioned in determining the amount a regulated company should be allowed to pay an affiliate therefor — a state determination also reviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 290</citedDecision> (1934); Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 292 U. S. 398 (1934).  In both cases, one of which sustained and one of which struck down a fixed rate, the Court assumed the rate base method as the legal way of testing reasonableness of natural gas prices fixed by public authority, without examining its real relevancy to the inquiry.  Under the weight of such precedents we cannot expect the Commission to initiate economically intelligent methods of fixing gas prices.  But the Court now faces a new plan of federal regulation based on the power to fix the price at which gas shall be allowed to move in interstate commerce.  I should now consider whether these rules devised under the Fourteenth Amendment are the exclusive tests of a just and reasonable rate under the federal statute, inviting reargument directed to that point *652 if necessary.  As I see it now I would be prepared to hold that these rules do not apply to a natural gas case arising under the Natural Gas Act.  Such a holding would leave the Commission to fix the price of gas in the field as one would fix maximum prices •of oil or milk or coal, or any other commodity.

In 1915, so it was reported to the Governor of West Virginia, 87 per cent of the total gas production of that state was under control of eight companies.  Steptoe and Hoffheimer, Legislative Regulation of Natural Gas Supply in West Virginia, 17 West Virginia Law Quarterly 257, 260.  Of these, three were subsidiaries of the Columbia system and others were subsidiaries of larger systems.  In view of inter-system sales and interlocking interests it may be doubted whether there is much real competition among these companies.  This pattern with its effects on local regulatory efforts will be observed in our decisions.  See United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, 278 U. S. 300 ; United Fuel Gas Co. v.
