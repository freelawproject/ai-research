 Since the risk of improper use by publishers and similar sources was low, the jail delivered books from them but not from other outsiders.  Id., at 549 .  The Court found this explanation acceptable and held that the rule did not violate the detainees’ First Amendment rights.  Id., at 550 .  Although the Court did not expressly address the rights of nonprisoners, the fact that softcover publications were delivered without restriction, see id., at 552 , minimized the abridgment of outsiders’ rights.  The approval in Wolfish of greater protection for publishers than for individual citizens reinforces Martinez’s view that the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners must be carefully weighed and undermines the Court’s approach today.  Most recently, Turner v. Safley, <citedDecision>482 U. S. 78</citedDecision> (1987), confirmed the vitality of Martinez for evaluating encroachments on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners.  The Court relied on the three interim “prisoners’ rights” cases to establish a reasonableness standard for reviewing inmate-to-inmate correspondence.  Id., at 89.  But in its unanimous invalidation of a restriction on inmate marriages, the Court acknowledged that “because the regulation may entail a ‘con *427 sequential restriction on the [constitutional] rights of those who are not prisoners,’” Martinez might posit the correct level of review.  <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 97</citedDecision> (quoting Martinez, 416 U. S., at 409 ).  It did not “reach this question, however, because even under the reasonable relationship test, the marriage regulation does not withstand scrutiny.” 10 " <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 97</citedDecision> .  The <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> opinion cited and quoted from Martinez more than 20 times; not once did it disapprove Martinez's holding, its standard, or its recognition of a special interest in protecting the First Amendment rights of those who are not prisoners.  Notwithstanding, today the Court abandons the premise on which Martinez was grounded.  This casual discarding of “ ‘the secure foundation’ ” of considered precedent ill serves the orderly development of the law. See Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 190-191 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring) (quoting B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921)).  II In lieu of Martinez’s rationale, which properly takes into consideration the effects that prison regulations have on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners, the Court applies a manipulable “reasonableness” standard to a set of regulations that too easily may be interpreted to authorize arbitrary rejections of literature addressed to inmates.  As I pointed out in my partial dissent in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> , an “open-ended ‘reasonableness’ standard makes it much too easy to uphold restrictions on prisoners’ First Amendment rights on the basis of administrative concerns and speculation about possible security risks rather than on the basis of evidence that the restrictions *428 are needed to further an important governmental interest.” <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 101, n. 1</citedDecision> .  To be sure, courts must give prison administrators some berth to combat the “Herculean obstacles” blocking their efforts to maintain security and prevent escapes or other criminal conduct, see Martinez, 416 U. S., at 404 , and I do not object to those regulations clearly targeted at such interests.  11 Nevertheless, I agree with the Court of Appeals that provisions allowing prison officials to reject a publication if they find its contents are “detrimental” to “security, good order, or discipline” or “might facilitate criminal activity” are impermissibly ambiguous.  See Abbott v. Meese, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 193, 824 F. 2d 1166, 1173 (1987).  The term “detrimental” invites so many interpretations that it scarcely checks administrators’ actions.  Similarly, “might facilitate” —in contrast with “encourage” or “advocate” — so attenuates the causal connection between expression and proscribed conduct that the warden has virtually free rein to censor incoming publications.  Despite this vagueness, the Court accepts petitioners’ assertion that they need “broad discretion” to prevent internal disorder, and thus holds that all the regulations are facially valid.

 See ante, at 417-418.  No evidence supports the Court’s assumption that, unlike personal letters, these publications will circulate within the prison and cause ripples of disruption.  16 See ante, at 412, 418.  Nor is there any evidence that an incoming publication ever caused a disciplinary or security problem; indeed, some of the rejected publications were delivered to inmates in other prisons without incident.  See App. 60, 99, 116-117.  In sum, the record convinces me that under either the Martinez standard or the more deferential “reasonableness” standard these *431 regulations are an impermissibly exaggerated response to security concerns.  Cf. Turner, <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 89-90</citedDecision> .  m If a prison official deems part of a publication’s content— even just one page of a book — to present an intolerable security risk, the Bureau’s regulations authorize the official to return the entire issue to the publisher.  See 28 CFR § 540.71 (e) (1988).  In their challenge to this all-or-nothing rule, respondents argue that First Amendment interests easily could be accommodated if administrators omitted the objectionable material and forwarded the rest of the publication to the inmate.  The District Court, however, found that “defendants’ fears” that “such censorship would create more discontent than the current practice” were “reasonably founded.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  To the contrary, the Court of Appeals applied the Martinez standard and held that “rejection of the balance is not ‘generally necessary’ to protect the legitimate governmental interest involved in the portion properly rejected.” 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 193-194, 824 F. 2d, at 1173-1174 .  In this Court petitioners argue that on remand the Court of Appeals should conduct “a detailed analysis of the evidence in this case” to determine if the all-or-nothing rule is “reasonable.” Brief for Petitioners 31.

 .” 28 CFR § 540.70 (a) (1988).  “The Warden may reject a publication only if it is determined detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity.” § 540.71(b).  See Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, 422 (1974) (Marshall, J., concurring) (“A prisoner does not shed .  .  .  basic First Amendment rights at the prison gate”).  See also Turner v. Safley, <citedDecision>482 U. S. 78, 84</citedDecision> (1987); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 822 (1974); Coffin v. Reichard, 143 F. 2d 443, 445 (CA6 1944) (per curiam).  Suffice it to say that the problems of prisons in America are complex and intractable, and, more to the point, they are not readily susceptible of resolution by decree.  Most require expertise, comprehensive planning, and the commitment of resources, all of which are peculiarly within the province of the legislative and executive branches of government.  For all of those reasons, courts are ill equipped to deal with the increasingly urgent problems of prison administration and reform." Martinez , 416 11.  S., at 404-405.  It is obvious that Martinez calls for less than strict scrutiny, and the Court today correctly rejects petitioners’ argument to the contrary.  Compare ante, at 409-411, with Brief for Petitioners 18-22; Reply Brief for Petitioners 1-10.  See, e. g., Lawson v. Dugger, 840 F. 2d 781 (CA11 1987), reh’g denied, 840 F. 2d 779 (1988) (per curiam), cert. pending, No. 87-1994; Valiant-Bey v. Morris, 829 F. 2d 1441 (CA8 1987); Murphy v.

Wilson, 814 F. 2d 1093 (CA6 1987); Travis v. Norris, 805 F. 2d 806 (CA8 1986); Meadows v. Hopkins, 713 F. 2d 206, 211 (CA6 1983); Vodicka v. Phelps, 624 F. 2d 569 (CA5 1980); Carpenter v. South. Dakota, 536 F. 2d 759 (CA8 1976), cert. denied, 31 U. S. 931 (1977).  The Court drew support for this proposition from Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U. S. 665, 684 (1972).  That case, like comparable cases decided after Pelt, arose outside the prison context.  E. g., Herbert v. Lando, 441 U. S. 153, 165 (1979); Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U. S. 547, 565-567 (1978).  Petitioners thus are quite wrong when they contend that <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> mandated that First Amendment challenges to prison regulations always be reviewed only for reasonableness.  See Brief for Petitioners 18.  It is undisputed that a warden may exclude an incoming publication if: “(1) It depicts or describes procedures for the construction or use of weapons, ammunition, bombs or incendiary devices; “(2) It .  .  .  contains blueprints, drawings or similar descriptions of Bureau of Prisons institutions; “(3) It depicts or describes procedures for the brewing of alcoholic beverages, or the manufacture of drugs; [or] “(4) It is written in code. .  .  .” 28 CFR 5 540.71(b) (1988).  Cf. Turner, <citedDecision>482 U. S., at 100</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“How a court describes its standard of review when a prison regulation infringes fundamental constitutional rights often has far less consequence for the inmates than the actual showing that the court demands of the State in order to uphold the regulation”).  While publications like Labyrinth reported on prison conditions and legal matters, other rejected publications discussed or depicted sexual activity, martial arts, and electronics, and advocated homosexual rights, neoNazism, and left-wing politics.  See App. 113-132.  See generally J. L.; Respondents’ Lodging.  Asked in a deposition to describe her method for reviewing publications, the clerk replied: “A.  I have a standard.  “Q.

 It is easier not to bother with cutting out different pieces, is that right?  “A.  Well, I think in dealing with the kind of individual that we deal with here or in any institution, if you start cutting up the magazines, you are going to leave yourself open to all kinds of criticism, remarks and other problems.  So it is best to just return the entire publication to the source and then no other insinuations or remarks can be made concerning us and what we do to individual publications or any magazines that people receive.” App. 100-101.  See also id., at 41, 68.  Thus I must disagree with petitioners’ staunch insistence that the reasonableness standard is not “toothless.” See Brief for Petitioners 27.  As I suggested in <citedDecision>Turner</citedDecision> : “[I]f the standard can be satisfied by nothing more than a ‘logical connection’ between the regulation and any legitimate penological concern perceived by a cautious warden, it is virtually meaningless.  Application of the standard would seem to permit disregard for inmates’ constitutional rights whenever the imagination of the warden produces a plausible security concern and a deferential trial court is able to discern a logical connection between that concern and the challenged regulation.  Indeed, there is a logical connection between prison discipline and the use of bullwhips on prisoners; and security is logically furthered by a total ban on inmate communication, not only with other inmates but also with outsiders who conceivably might be interested in arranging an attack within the prison or an escape from it.” 482 U. S., at 100-101 (concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).
