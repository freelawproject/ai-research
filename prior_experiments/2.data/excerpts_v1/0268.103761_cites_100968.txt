**Combined Opinion**
128 F.2d 169 . We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari because of the public importance of the problem. We agree with the court below that this was a maritime tort over which the admiralty court has jurisdiction. Vancouver S.S. Co. v. Rice, 288 U.S. 445 ; The Admiral Peoples, 295 U.S. 649 . And we may assume that petitioner could have sued either the United States or the Commission under the Suits in Admiralty Act. In any event, such a suit would be the exclusive remedy in admiralty against either of them. Eastern Transportation Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 675 ; Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Rosenberg Bros. & Co., 276 U.S. 202 . And it is likewise clear that the action in admiralty afforded by ยง 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act is the only available remedy against the United States or a corporation whose entire outstanding capital stock is owned by the United States or its representatives. Johnson v. Emergency Fleet Corp., supra . The sole question here is whether the Suits in Admiralty Act makes private operators such as respondent non-suable for their torts. *578 Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Lustgarten, 280 U.S. 320 , one of the three companion cases to the Johnson case, supports the view that it does. In that case a merchant vessel, Coelleda, was owned by the United States and operated for it by the Consolidated Navigation Co. pursuant to a contract made through the Fleet Corporation. A seaman employed thereon sued the Fleet Corporation and the Consolidated Navigation Co. to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in that service.
