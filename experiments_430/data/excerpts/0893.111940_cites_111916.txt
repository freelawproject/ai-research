**Lead Opinion**
 As to the first of these conclusions, the passage of time has revealed no occasion for doubt.  The language of the Clause is “clear and explicit.” Michigan v. *227 Doran, 439 U. S. 282, 286 (1978).  Its mandatory language furthers its intended purposes: “to enable each state to bring offenders to trial as swiftly as possible in the state where the alleged offense was committed,” and “to preclude any state from becoming a sanctuary for fugitives from justice of another state.” Id., at 287 ; see Biddinger v. Commissioner of Police, 245 U. S. 128, 132-133 (1917); Appleyard v. Massachusetts, 203 U. S. 222, 227 (1906).  The Framers of the Constitution perceived that the frustration of these objectives would create a serious impediment to national unity, and the Extradition Clause responds to that perception.  “It would have been far better to omit it altogether, and to have left it to the comity of the States, and their own sense of their respective interests, than to have inserted it as conferring a right, and yet defining that right so loosely as to make it a never-failing subject of dispute and ill-will.” Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How., at 102 .  We reaffirm the conclusion that the commands of the Extradition Clause are mandatory, and afford no discretion to the executive officers or courts of the asylum State.  See California v. Superior Court of California, <citedDecision>482 U. S. 400, 405-406</citedDecision> (1987).  The second, and dispositive, holding of Kentucky v. Dennison rests upon a foundation with which time and the currents of constitutional change have dealt much less favorably.  If it seemed clear to the Court in 1861, facing the looming shadow of a Civil War, that “the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it,” 24 How., at 107 , basic constitutional principles now point as clearly the other way.  Within 15 years of the decision in Dennison it was said that “when a plain official duty, requiring no exercise of discretion, is to be performed, and performance is refused, any person who will sustain personal injury by such refusal may have a mandamus to compel its performance,” and it was no objection that such an order might be sought in the federal courts against a state officer.  Board of Liquidation v. McComb, 92 U. S. 531, 541 (1876).  *228 It has long been a settled principle that federal courts may enjoin unconstitutional action by state officials.  See Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 155-156 (1908).
**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice O’Connor, with whom Justice Powell joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join Parts I, II-A, II-C, and III of the Court’s opinion. Because the Court ultimately resolves this case under the *231 Extradition Act, 18 U. S. C. § 3182 , I do not find Part II-B, and its statements concerning the Extradition Clause of the Constitution, necessary to the decision of this case. Accordingly, I do not subscribe to that part of the Court’s opinion. See, e. g., Jean v. Nelson, 472 U. S. 846, 854 (1985); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 361, n. 10 (1983); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).
