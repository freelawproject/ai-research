 Pearce, 395 U. S., at 723-725 .  “Due process of law, then, requires that vindictiveness against a defendant for having successfully attacked his first conviction must play no part in the sentence he receives after a new trial.” Id., at 725 .  “In order to assure the absence of such a motivation, we have concluded that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for him doing so must affirmatively appear.” Id. at 726 .  Otherwise, a presump *799 tion arises that a greater sentence has been imposed for a vindictive purpose — a presumption that must be rebutted by “‘objective information .  .  .  justifying the increased sentence.’” Texas v. McCullough, 475 U. S. 134, 142 (1986) (quoting United States v. Goodwin, <citedDecision>457 U. S. 368, 374</citedDecision> (1982)).  While the Pearce opinion appeared on its face to announce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent cases have made clear that its presumption of vindictiveness “do[es] not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.  ” Texas v. McCullough, 475 U. S., at 138 .  As we explained in Texas v. McCullough , “the evil the [Pearce] Court sought to prevent” was not the imposition of “enlarged sentences after a new trial” but “vindictiveness of a sentencing judge.” Ibid. See also Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U. S. 17, 25 (1973) (the Pearce presumption was not designed to prevent the imposition of an increased sentence on retrial “for some valid reason associated with the need for flexibility and discretion in the sentencing process,” but was “premised on the apparent need to guard against vindictiveness in the resentencing process”).  Because the Pearce presumption “may operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus .  .  .  block a legitimate response to criminal conduct,” United States v. <citedDecision>Goodwin, supra, at 373</citedDecision> , we have limited its application, like that of “other ‘judicially created means of effectuating the rights secured by the [Constitution],’” to circumstances “where its ‘objectives are thought most efficaciously served,’” Texas v. McCullough, supra, at 138 , quoting Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 482, 487 (1976).  Such circumstances are those in which there is a “reasonable likelihood,” United States v. <citedDecision>Goodwin, supra, at 373</citedDecision> , that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.  Where there is no such reasonable likelihood, the burden remains upon the defendant to prove actual vindic *800 tiveness, see Wasman v. United States, 468 U. S. 559, 569 (1984).  In Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104 (1972), for example, we refused to apply the presumption when the increased sentence was imposed by the second court in a two-tiered system which gave a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor in an inferior court the right to trial de novo in a superior court. We observed that the trial de novo represented a “completely fresh determination of guilt or innocence” by a court that was not being “asked to do over what it thought it had already done correctly.” Id., at 117 .  If the de novo trial resulted in a greater penalty, we said that “it no more follows that such a sentence is a vindictive penalty .  .  .  than that the inferior court imposed a lenient penalty.” Ibid. Consequently, we rejected the proposition that greater penalties on retrial were explained by vindictiveness “with sufficient frequency to warrant the imposition of a prophylactic rule.” Id., at 116 .

 Compare, for example, the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision in the instant case, Ex parte Smith, 557 So. 2d 13 (1988), State v. Sutton, 197 Conn. 485 , 498 A. 2d 65 (1985), and United States v. Gilliss, 645 F. 2d 1269 (CA8 1981), with State v. Bawdon, 386 N. W. 2d 484 (S. D. 1986), and McKenzie v. Risley, 842 F. 2d 1525, 1536-1537 (CA9 1988) (en banc).  We adopted a similar prophylactic rule to guard against vindictiveness by the prosecutor at the postconviction stage in Blackledge v. Perry, 417 U. S. 21 (1974).  There the prosecutor charged the defendant with a felony when the latter availed himself of de novo review of his initial conviction of a misdemeanor for the same conduct.  He received a sentence of five to seven years for the felony compared to the 6-month sentence he had received for the misdemeanor.  On these facts, we concluded that a presumption of vindictiveness arose analogous to that in Pearce because the “prosecutor clearly has a considerable stake in discouraging convicted misdemeanants from appealing.” Id., at 27.  We made clear, however, that “the Due Process Clause is not offended by all possibilities of increased punishment upon retrial after appeal, but only by those that pose a realistic *801 likelihood of ‘vindictiveness.’ ” Ibicl.  And in our other cases dealing with pretrial prosecutorial decisions to modify the charges against a defendant, we have continued to stress that “a mere opportunity for vindictiveness is insufficient to justify the imposition of a prophylactic rule.” United States v. Goodwin, <citedDecision>457 U. S. 368, 384</citedDecision> (1982); Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U. S. 357 (1978).
