**Combined Opinion**
 Keeping potentially dangerous weapons out of the hands of unlicensed dealers is a goal plainly more remedial than punitive.  Accordingly, we hold that Congress viewed § 924(d) forfeiture as a remedial civil sanction rather than a criminal punishment.  6 *365 We now turn to the second aspect of our inquiry: “whether the statutory scheme [is] so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate” Congress’ intention to establish a civil remedial mechanism.  United States v. Ward, 448 U. S., at 248-249 .  “ ‘Only the clearest proof’ ” that the purpose and effect of the forfeiture are punitive will suffice to override Congress’ manifest preference for a civil sanction.  Id., at 249 (quoting Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960)).  In Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 144, 168-169</citedDecision> (1963), we set forth a list of considerations that has proved helpful in the past in making such determinations.  7 See, e. g., United States v. Ward, supra, at 249-251 ; Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 537-538 (1979).  Only one of the <citedDecision>Mendoza-Martinez</citedDecision> factors — whether or not the proscribed behavior is already a crime — lends any support to Mulcahey’s position that § 924(d) imposes a criminal penalty.  The fact that actions giving rise to forfeiture proceedings under § 924(d) may also entail the criminal penalties of § 922(a)(1) admittedly suggests that § 924(d) is criminal in nature.  But that indication is not as strong as it might seem at first blush.  United States v. Ward, supra, at 250 .  Clearly “Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission,” Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S., at 399 ; indeed, it has done so on other *366 occasions.  Moreover, Congress in fact drafted § 924(d) to cover a broader range of conduct than is proscribed by the criminal provisions of § 922(a)(1).  See supra, at 363-364.  Because the sanction embodied in § 924(d) is not limited to criminal misconduct, the forfeiture remedy cannot be said to be coextensive with the criminal penalty.  What overlap there is between the two sanctions is not sufficient to persuade us that the forfeiture proceeding may not legitimately be viewed as civil in nature.  In short, an analysis of the <citedDecision>Mendoza-Martinez</citedDecision> factors in no way undermines Congress’ classification of the § 924(d) forfeiture action as a civil sanction.  Mulcahey has failed to establish by the “clearest proof” that Congress has provided a sanction so punitive as to “transfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.” Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956).  We accordingly conclude that the forfeiture mechanism set forth in § 924(d) is not an additional penalty for the commission of a criminal act, but rather is a separate civil sanction, remedial in nature.  Because the § 924(d) forfeiture proceeding brought against Mulcahey’s firearms is not a criminal proceeding, it is not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  > I — I We hold that a gun owner’s acquittal on criminal charges involving firearms does not preclude a subsequent in rem forfeiture proceeding against those firearms under § 924(d).  Neither collateral estoppel nor the Double Jeopardy Clause affords a doctrinal basis for such a rule of preclusion, and we reject today the contrary rationale of Coffey v. United States, 116 U. S. 436 (1886).  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is accordingly reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

 Still later, for reasons not relevant here, 4 of the seized firearms were returned to Mulcahey’s wife, leaving 89 firearms as the subject of the forfeiture proceeding.  4 A divided panel of the Fourth Circuit had previously reversed the District Court’s forfeiture order.  669 F. 2d 206 (1982).  5 See, e. g., United States v. Burch, 294 P. 2d 1, 3, n. 2 (CA5 1961); United States v. One Dodge Sedan, 113 F. 2d 552, 553 , and n. 1 (CA3 1940) (collecting cases and law review articles); IB J. Moore, J. Lucas, & T. Currier, Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 0.418[3], pp. 587-589, and n. 12 (1983) (collecting cases).  6 Mulcahey relies heavily upon Congress’ labeling of §924 with the appellation “Penalties,” arguing that inclusion of the forfeiture provision in that section demonstrates Congress’ intention to create an additional criminal sanction.  This argument is unavailing; both criminal and civil sanctions may be labeled “penalties.” Moreover, the congressional Reports accompanying § 924 describe it as “containing] the penalty and forfeiture provisions,” H. R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 17 (1968); S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 117 (1968), indicating that Congress was cognizant of the important differences between criminal punishment and in rem forfeiture.  7 In <citedDecision>Kennedy</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Mendoza-Martinez</citedDecision> , the Court enumerated “the tests traditionally applied to determine whether an Act of Congress is penal or regulatory in character.” <citedDecision>372 U. S., at 168</citedDecision> .  “Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment — retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions.” <citedDecision>
