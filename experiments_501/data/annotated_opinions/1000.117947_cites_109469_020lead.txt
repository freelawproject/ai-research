 Ill Respondents urge that “[t]he Subcontracting Compensation Clause program is ... a program based on disadvantage, not on race,” and thus that it is subject only to “the most *213 relaxed judicial scrutiny.” Brief for Respondents 26.  To the extent that the statutes and regulations involved in this case are race neutral, we agree.  Respondents concede, however, that “the race-based rebuttable presumption used in some certification determinations under the Subcontracting Compensation Clause” is subject to some heightened level of scrutiny.  Id., at 27.  The parties disagree as to what that level should be.  (We note, incidentally, that this case concerns only classifications based explicitly on race, and presents none of the additional difficulties posed by laws that, although facially race neutral, result in racially disproportionate impact and are motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose.  See generally Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252 (1977); Washington v. Davis, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 229</citedDecision> (1976).) Adarand’s claim arises under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, which provides that “No person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” Although this Court has always understood that Clause to provide some measure of protection against arbitrary treatment by the Federal Government, it is not as explicit a guarantee of equal treatment as the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that “No State shall .  .  .  deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws” (emphasis added).  Our cases have accorded varying degrees of significance to the difference in the language of those two Clauses.  We think it necessary to revisit the issue here.
