**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with whom The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Powell concur, dissenting.  Today the Court overrules Ahrens v. Clark, <citedDecision>335 U. S. 188</citedDecision> (1948), which construed the legislative intent of Congress in enacting the lineal predecessor of 28 U. S. C, § 2241.  Although considerations of “convenience” may support the result reached in this case, those considerations are, in this context, appropriate for Congress, mot this Court, to make.  Congress has not legislatively overruled <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> , and subsequent “developments” are simply irrelevant to the judicial task of ascertaining the legislative intent of Congress in providing, in 1867, that federal district courts may issue writs of habeas corpus “within their respective jurisdictions” for prisoners in the custody of state authorities.  The Court, however, not only accomplishes a feat of judicial prestidigitation but, without discussion or analysis, explicitly extends the scope of Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), and implicitly rejects Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886).  I In order to appreciate the full impact of the Court’s decision, a brief reiteration of the procedural stance of the case at the time the petition for habeas corpus was filed is necessary.  Petitioner is incarcerated in Alabama pursuant to a state court judgment, the validity of which petitioner does not attack.  Petitioner had been indicted in Kentucky and a detainer filed by Kentucky authorities with the Alabama authorities.  Kentucky had conducted no proceedings against petitioner; no judgment of conviction on the Kentucky indictment had been obtained.  From Alabama, petitioner requested Kentucky authorities to ask the Alabama authorities to de *503 liver him to Kentucky so that petitioner could be tried on the Kentucky indictment.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The situations in which pretrial or preconviction federal interference by way of habeas corpus with state criminal processes is justified involve the lack of jurisdiction, under the Supremacy Clause, for the State to bring any criminal charges against the petitioner.  Wildenhus’s Case, 120 U. S. 1 (1887); In re Loney, 134 U. S. 372 (1890); In re Neagle, 135 U. S. 1 (1890).  The effect of today's ruling that federal habeas corpus prior to trial is appropriate because it will determine the validity of custody that may be imposed in actuality only sometime in the indefinite future constitutes an unjustifiable federal interference with the judicial administration of a State’s criminal laws.  The use of federal habeas corpus is, presumably, limited neither to the interstate detainer situation nor to the constitutional rights secured by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The same reasoning would apply to a state prisoner who alleges that “future custody” will result because the State plans to introduce at a criminal trial sometime in the future a confession allegedly obtained in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, or evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  I thoroughly disagree with this conversion of federal habeas corpus into a pretrial-motion forum for state prisoners.  *509 III In addition to sanctioning an expansion of when a federal court may interfere with state judicial administration, the Court overrules <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clark, supra,</citedDecision> and expands the parameters of which federal courts may so intervene.  In <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> , the Court held that “the presence within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court of the person detained is [a] prerequisite to filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus.” <citedDecision>335 U. S., at 189</citedDecision> .  The Court construed the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” to mean that Congress intended to limit the jurisdiction of a district court to prisoners in custody within its territorial jurisdiction.  <citedDecision>Id., at 193</citedDecision> .  The Court here says that the “language” of <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> “indicates” the result reached below.  The explicit holding of the Court, however, is plainly much more than an “indication.” “Thus the view that the jurisdiction of the District Court to issue the writ in cases such as this is restricted to those petitioners who are confined or detained within the territorial jurisdiction of the court is supported by the language of the statute, by considerations of policy, and by the legislative history of the enactment.  We therefore do not feel free to weigh the policy considerations which are advanced for giving district courts discretion in cases like this.  If that concept is to be imported into this statute, Congress must do so.” Id., at 192-193 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).  The result reached today may be desirable from the point of view of sound judicial administration, see <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clark, supra, at 191</citedDecision> ; Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224 , 228 n. 5 (1970).  It is the function of this Court, however, to ascertain the intent of Congress as to the mean *510 ing of “within their respective jurisdictions.” Having completed that task in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> , it is the function of Congress to amend the statute if this Court misinterpreted congressional intent or if subsequent developments suggest the desirability, from a policy viewpoint, of alterations in the statute.  See Cleveland v. United States, 329 U. S. 14 (1946).  We noted in Nelson that the resolution of any apparent dilemma “caused” by this Court’s holding in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> is appropriately one to be undertaken by Congress.  399 U. S., at 228 n. 5.  Legislative “inaction” in amending a statute to comport with this Court’s evaluation of “[s]ound judicial administration” hardly warrants the disingenuous reading of a previous decision to achieve the result that Congress, despite judicial prodding, has refused to mandate.  However impatient we may be with a federal statute which sometimes may fail to provide a remedy for every situation, one would have thought it inappropriate for the Court to amend the statute by judicial action.  The Court lists several “developments” that have somehow undercut the validity, in the Court’s opinion, of the statutory interpretation of the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions.” As the amended § 2255 is relevant only to federal prisoners collaterally attacking a conviction, and as § 2241 (d) applies only to intrastate jurisdiction, the relevance of the amendments with respect to the jurisdictional requirement of § 2241 (c) (3) is not a little obscure.  The interpretation of the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> is hardly incompatible with these recent amendments of statutes dealing with situations not involving the interstate transportation of state prisoners.  The further argument that Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137 (1953), “undermines” <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> overlooks the fact that the Court in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> specifically reserved that question, <citedDecision>335 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> n. 4, the resolution of which is by no means an explicit rejec *511 tion of <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> .  Finally, the fact that this Court has expanded the notion of “custody” for habeas corpus purposes hardly supports, much less compels, the rejection of a statutory construction of an unrelated phrase.  In the final analysis, the Court apparently reasons that since Congress amended other statutory provisions dealing with habeas corpus, therefore the congressional intent with respect to the meaning of an unamended phrase must somehow have changed since the Court previously ascertained that intent.  This approach to statutory construction, however, justifies with as much, if not more, force, the result reached below: Congress, aware of this Court’s interpretation of the phrase in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> , deliberately chose not to amend § 2241 (c) (3) when it selectively amended other statutory provisions dealing with federal habeas corpus.  Indeed, the most recent indications of legislative intent support this conclusion rather than that advanced by the Court. See H. R. Rep. No. 1894, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 1-2 (1966); S. Rep. No. 1502, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966).  See also n. 13,.  ante, at 497.  I would adhere to this Court’s interpretation of the legislative intent set forth in <citedDecision>Ahrens</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Clark, supra,</citedDecision> and leave it to Congress, during the process of considering legislation to amend this section, to consider and to weigh the various policy factors that the Court today weighs for itself.
