 B Mulcahey next contends that a forfeiture proceeding under § 924(d) is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Unless the forfeiture sanction was intended as punishment, so that the proceeding is essentially criminal in character, the Double Jeopardy Clause is not applicable.  Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S., at 398-399 .  The question, then, is whether a § 924(d) forfeiture proceeding is intended to be, or by its nature necessarily is, criminal and punitive, or civil and remedial.  Resolution of this question begins as a matter of statutory interpretation.  Id., at 399.  As the Court noted in United States v. Ward, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 242, 248</citedDecision> (1980): “Our inquiry in this regard has traditionally proceeded on two levels.  First, we have set out to determine whether Congress, in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.  See One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, supra, at 236-237.  Second, where Congress has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or *363 effect as to negate that intention.  See Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617-621 (1960).” Applying the first prong of the Ward test to the facts of the instant case, we conclude that Congress designed forfeiture under § 924(d) as a remedial civil sanction.  Congress’ intent in this regard is most clearly demonstrated by the procedural mechanisms it established for enforcing forfeitures under the statute.  Section 924(d) does not prescribe the steps to be followed in effectuating a forfeiture, but rather incorporates by reference the procedures of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code), 26 U. S. C. §§7321-7328 .

 In enacting the 1968 gun control legislation, Congress “was concerned with the widespread traffic in firearms and with their general availability to those whose possession thereof was contrary to the public interest.” Huddleston v. United States, 415 U. S. 814, 824 (1974).  Accordingly, Congress sought to “control the indiscriminate flow” of firearms and to “assist and encourage States and local communities to adopt and enforce stricter gun control laws.” H. R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 8 (1968).  Section 924(d) plays an important role in furthering the prophylactic purposes of the 1968 gun control legislation by discouraging unregulated commerce in firearms and by removing from circulation firearms that have been used or intended for use outside regulated channels of commerce.  Keeping potentially dangerous weapons out of the hands of unlicensed dealers is a goal plainly more remedial than punitive.  Accordingly, we hold that Congress viewed § 924(d) forfeiture as a remedial civil sanction rather than a criminal punishment.  6 *365 We now turn to the second aspect of our inquiry: “whether the statutory scheme [is] so punitive either in purpose or effect as to negate” Congress’ intention to establish a civil remedial mechanism.  United States v. Ward, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 248-249</citedDecision> .  “ ‘Only the clearest proof’ ” that the purpose and effect of the forfeiture are punitive will suffice to override Congress’ manifest preference for a civil sanction.  <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 249 (quoting Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960)).  In Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), we set forth a list of considerations that has proved helpful in the past in making such determinations.  7 See, e. g., United States v. <citedDecision>
   Ward, supra,
  
  at 249-251</citedDecision> ; Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520, 537-538 (1979).  Only one of the Mendoza-Martinez factors — whether or not the proscribed behavior is already a crime — lends any support to Mulcahey’s position that § 924(d) imposes a criminal penalty.  The fact that actions giving rise to forfeiture proceedings under § 924(d) may also entail the criminal penalties of § 922(a)(1) admittedly suggests that § 924(d) is criminal in nature.  But that indication is not as strong as it might seem at first blush.  United States v. <citedDecision>
   Ward, supra,
  
  at 250</citedDecision> .  Clearly “Congress may impose both a criminal and a civil sanction in respect to the same act or omission,” Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S., at 399 ; indeed, it has done so on other *366 occasions.  Moreover, Congress in fact drafted § 924(d) to cover a broader range of conduct than is proscribed by the criminal provisions of § 922(a)(1).  See supra, at 363-364.  Because the sanction embodied in § 924(d) is not limited to criminal misconduct, the forfeiture remedy cannot be said to be coextensive with the criminal penalty.  What overlap there is between the two sanctions is not sufficient to persuade us that the forfeiture proceeding may not legitimately be viewed as civil in nature.  In short, an analysis of the Mendoza-Martinez factors in no way undermines Congress’ classification of the § 924(d) forfeiture action as a civil sanction.

 669 F. 2d 206 (1982).  5 See, e. g., United States v. Burch, 294 P. 2d 1, 3, n. 2 (CA5 1961); United States v. One Dodge Sedan, 113 F. 2d 552, 553 , and n. 1 (CA3 1940) (collecting cases and law review articles); IB J. Moore, J. Lucas, & T. Currier, Moore’s Federal Practice ¶ 0.418[3], pp. 587-589, and n. 12 (1983) (collecting cases).  6 Mulcahey relies heavily upon Congress’ labeling of §924 with the appellation “Penalties,” arguing that inclusion of the forfeiture provision in that section demonstrates Congress’ intention to create an additional criminal sanction.  This argument is unavailing; both criminal and civil sanctions may be labeled “penalties.” Moreover, the congressional Reports accompanying § 924 describe it as “containing] the penalty and forfeiture provisions,” H. R. Rep. No. 1577, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 17 (1968); S. Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 117 (1968), indicating that Congress was cognizant of the important differences between criminal punishment and in rem forfeiture.  7 In Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez , the Court enumerated “the tests traditionally applied to determine whether an Act of Congress is penal or regulatory in character.” 372 U. S., at 168 .  “Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment — retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions.” Id., at 168-169 (footnotes omitted).  This list of considerations is, however, “neither exhaustive nor dispos-itive.” United States v. Ward, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 242, 249</citedDecision> (1980).
