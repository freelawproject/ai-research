 The same might be said about § 504, as was said about its predecessor: “Political affiliations of the kind here involved, no less than business affiliations, provide rational ground for the legislative judgment that those persons proscribed by § 9 (h) would be subject to ‘tempting opportunities’ to commit acts deemed harmful to the national economy.  In this respect, § 9 (h) is not unlike a host of other statutes which prohibit specified groups of persons from holding positions of power and public interest because, in the legislative judgment, they threaten to abuse the trust that is a necessary concomitant of the power of office.” Id., at 392.  Conflict-of-interest statutes are an accepted type of legislation.  2 Indeed, our Constitution contains a con *468 flict-of-interest provision in Art. I, § 6, cl. 2, which prohibits any Congressman from simultaneously holding office under the United States.  If the Court would save the conflict-of-interest statutes, which apparently it would, it is difficult to understand why § 504 is stricken down as a bill of attainder.  Other legislative enactments relevant here are those statutes disqualifying felons fropi occupying certain positions.  The leading case is Hawker v. New York, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 189</citedDecision> , which upheld a provision prohibiting convicted felons from practicing medicine against a claim that, as applied to one convicted before its enactment, it was an ex post facto law. The Court noted that a legislature may establish qualifications for the practice of medicine, and character may be such a qualification.  Conviction of a felony, the Court reasoned, may be evidence of character: “It is not open to doubt that the commission of crime .  .  .  has some relation to the question of character.  It is not, as a rule, the good people who commit crime.  When the legislature decíales that whoever has violated the criminal laws of the State shall be deemed lacking in good moral character it is not laying down an arbitrary or fanciful rule — one having no relation to the subject-matter, but is only appealing to a well recognized fact of human experience .... “It is no answer to say that this test of character is not in all. cases absolutely certain, and that sometimes it works harshly.  Doubtless, one who has violated the criminal law may thereafter reform and become in fact possessed of a good moral character.  But the legislature has power in cases of this kind *469 to make a rule of universal application, and no inquiry is permissible back of the rule to ascertain whether the fact of which the rule is made the absolute test does or does not exist.” <citedDecision>170 U. S., at 196-197</citedDecision> .  Accord, De Veau v. Braisted, 363 U. S. 144, 159-160 (Frankfurter, J., announcing judgment) (bill of attainder and ex post facto challenges).  Like § 504, the legislation challenged in <citedDecision>Hawker</citedDecision> was both overinclusive and underinclusive.  Felons were not the only persons who might possess character defects making them unsuitable practitioners of medicine; and, as the Court expressly noted, not all felons would lack good moral character.  Nevertheless, the legislature was permitted to disqualify all members of the class, rather than being required to delegate to the courts the responsibility of determining the character of each individual based on all relevant facts, including the prior conviction.  The legislative findings that sustained the legislation attacked in <citedDecision>Hawker</citedDecision> were simply that a substantial number of felons would be likely to abuse the practice of medicine because of their bad character.  It is just such findings respecting the average propensities of a given class of persons to engage in particular conduct that the Court will not now permit under the Bill of Attainder Clause.  Though the Court makes no attempt to distinguish the Hawker-type laws it apparently would save them, see Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 96-97 (Warren, C. J., announcing judgment), and with them the provision of the statute now before the Court which disqualifies felons from holding union office.  3 *470 The Court apparently agrees that the Subversive Activities Control Act was not a bill of attainder with regard to the Communist Party because, as the Court pointed out in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U. S. 1 , the finding that the Party was a Communist-action organization was not made by the legislature but was made administratively, after a trial-type hearing and subject to judicial review.  But this apparently does not settle whether the statute is a bill of attainder with respect to Party members; for under today’s approach, a finding about the Party and about some of its members does not cure the vice of overinclu-siveness.  The Subversive Activities Control Act attaches certain disqualifications to each Party member following the administrative-judicial finding that the Party is a Communist-action organization.  Among other things, each Party member is disqualified from holding union office, almost the same disqualification as is involved here.  Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, § 5 (a)(1)(E), added by the Act of Aug. 24, 1954, § 6, 68 Stat. 777 , 50 U. S. C. § 784 (a)(1)(E) (1958 ed.).  I do not see how this and the other consequences attached to Party membership in that Act could survive examination under the principles announced today.  On the other hand, if the statutes involved in <citedDecision>Hawker</citedDecision> and Agnew are not bills of attainder, how can the Subversive Activities Control Act be an attainder with respect to members of the Communist Party?  In the Communist Party case, the Board found that the “[Party’s] principal leaders and a substantial number of its members are subject to and recognize the disciplinary power of the Soviet Union and its representatives.  This evidences domination and control over [the Party] by the Soviet Union, and a purpose to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement.” Modified Report of the Board, December 18, 1956, in Record in that case, *471 p. 2538.  That finding was expressly sustained by this Court. 367 U. S. 1, 57 .  Certainly, if <citedDecision>Hawker</citedDecision> and Agnew are to be followed at all, these nonlegislative findings establish a sufficient probability or likelihood with regard to Party members- — -a sufficient temptation to Party members who are also union officers — to permit the legislature to disqualify Party members from union office as it did in the Subversive Activities Control Act.  And if the disqualification of Party members in the Subversive Activities Control Act is not a bill of attainder, neither is § 504.  If it is § 504’s specific designation of the Communist Party and its members which concerns the Court — if the Court would have the same concern if the statute in Agnew had disqualified the members of a particular underwriting firm — it seems to me that at this point this vice is no vice at all; for the Congress has provided in another statute, the Subversive Activities Control Act, for an adjudication about Communist-action organizations, the nature of the Party has now been adjudicated and an adequate probability about the future conduct of its members established to justify the disqualification which Congress has imposed.  Compare Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232, 244 (absent findings respecting nature of Communist Party at time of bar applicant’s membership, membership in Party 15 years prior to application provides no rational ground for disqualification).  This, of course, is not the path the Court follows.  Section 504 is said to impose punishment on specific individuals because it has disqualified all Communist Party members without providing for a judicial determination as to each member that he will call a political strike.  A likelihood of doing so based on membership is not enough.  By the same token, a statute disqualifying Communists (or authorizing the Executive Branch to do so) from holding sensitive positions in the Government would be auto *472 matically infirm, as would a requirement that employees of the Central Intelligence Agency or the National Security Agency disclaim membership in the Communist Party, unless in each case it is proved by evidence other than membership in the Communist Party, the nature of which has already been adjudicated, that the individual would commit acts of disloyalty or subordinate his official undertakings to the interests of the Party.  But how does one prove that a person would be disloyal?  The Communist Party’s illegal purpose and its domination by a foreign power have already been adjudicated, both administratively and judicially.  If this does not in itself provide a sufficient probability with respect to the individual who persists in remaining a member of the Party, or if a probability is in any event insufficient, what evidence with regard to the individual will be sufficient to disqualify him?  If he must be apprehended in the act of calling one political strike or in one act of disloyalty before steps can be taken to exclude him from office, there is little or nothing left of the preventive or prophylactic function of § 504 or of the statutes such as the Court had before it in <citedDecision>Hawker</citedDecision> and Agnew .  Examples of statutes that will now be suspect because of the Court’s opinion but were, until today, unanimously accepted as legitimate exercises of legislative power could easily be multiplied.  Such a catalogue in itself would lead one to inquire whether the Court’s reasoning does not contain some flaw that explains such perverse results.  II.  One might well begin by challenging the Court’s premise that the Bill of Attainder Clause was intended to provide a general dividing line between legislative and judicial functions and thereby to operate as the chief means of implementing the separation of powers.  While it must be conceded that our system of government is *473 based on the separation of powers and that the prohibition on bills of attainder is a judicially enforceable restraint on legislative power and therefore constitutes one among the many mechanisms implementing the separation of powers, that conclusion is the most that can be gleaned from the authorities cited by the Court. Some, like the statement quoted from Chief Justice Marshall, Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87,136 , reflect views concerning “whether the nature of society and of government does not prescribe some limits to the legislative power,” id., at 135 , rather than an analysis of the bill-of-attainder provision.  None assigns a pre-eminent position to that provision as compared with other restraints on the legislature.

 Admittedly the degree of specificity is a relevant factor — as when individuals are singled out by name — but because in many instances specificity of the degree here held impermissible may be wholly consistent with a regulatory, rather than a punitive purpose, the Court’s per se approach cuts too broadly and invalidates legitimate legislative activity.  IV. Putting aside the Court’s per se approach based on the nature of the classification specified by the legislation, we must still test § 504 against the traditional definition of the bill of attainder as legislative punishment of particular individuals.  In my view, § 504 does not impose punishment and is not a bill of attainder.  *476 We have said that “only the clearest proof could suffice” to establish that Congress’ purpose was punitive rather than regulatory.  Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 .  A punitive purpose has been found when it could be said that a statute passed amid the fierce passions aroused by the Civil War bore no rational connection to any permissible legislative purpose.  Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 319, 322 ; see Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114, 128 ; Hawker v. New York, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 189, 198</citedDecision> .  The imposition of a particularly harsh deprivation without any discernible legitimate legislative purpose has similarly been characterized as penal.  Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86 (Warren, C. J., announcing judgment).  Similarly a punitive purpose has been found when such a purpose clearly appeared in the legislative history.  Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martines, 372 U. S. 144, 169 ; United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, 308-314 .  In other cases the analysis is more difficult.  We summarized the relevant considerations in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, supra: “Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment, whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter, whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment— retribution and deterrence, whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime, whether an alternative purpose u) which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it, and whether it appears excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned are all relevant to the inquiry, and may often point in differing directions.” 372 TJ. S., at 168-169.
