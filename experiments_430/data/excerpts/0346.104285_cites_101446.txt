Mr. Justice Douglas delivered the opinion of the Court. In 1943 petitioner, a native of Canada, filed his petition for naturalization in the District Court of Massachusetts.  He stated in his application that he understood the prin *62 ciples of the government of the United States, believed in its form of government, and was willing to take the oath of allegiance ( 54 Stat. 1157 , 8 U. S. C. § 735 (b)) which reads as follows: “I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion: So help me God.” To the question in the application “If necessary, are you willing to take up arms in defense of this country?” he replied, “No (Non-combatant) Seventh Day Adventist.” He explained that answer before the examiner by saying “it is a purely religious matter with me, I have no political or personal reasons other than that.” He did not claim before his Selective Service board exemption from all military service, but only from combatant military duty.  At the hearing in the District Court petitioner testified that he was a member of the Seventh Day Adventist denomination, of whom approximately 10,000 were then serving in the armed forces of the United States as non-combatants, especially in the medical corps; and that he was willing to serve in the army but would not bear arms.  The District Court admitted him to citizenship.  The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting.  149 F. 2d 760 .  It took that action on the authority of United States v. Schwimmer, <citedDecision>279 U. S. 644</citedDecision> ; United States v. Macintosh, 283 U. S. 605 , and United States v. Bland, 283 U. S. 636 , saying that the facts of the present case brought it squarely within the principle of those cases. The case is here on *63 a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted so that those authorities might be re-examined.  The Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases involved, as does the present one, a question of statutory construction.  At the time of those cases, Congress required an alien, before admission to citizenship, to declare on oath in open court that “he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” 1 It also required the court to be satisfied that the alien had during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of his application “behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.” 2 Those provisions were reenacted into the present law in substantially the same, form.  3 While there are some factual distinctions between this case and the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> and Macintosh cases, the Bland case on its facts is indistinguishable.  But the principle emerging from the three cases obliterates any factual distinction among them.  As we recognized in In re Summers, 325 U. S. 561, 572, 577 , they stand for the same general rule — that an alien who refuses to bear arms will not be admitted to citizenship.  As an original proposition, we could not agree with that rule.  The fallacies underlying *64 it were, we think, demonstrated in the dissents of Mr. Justice Holmes in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case and of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes in the Macintosh case. The oath required of aliens does not in terms require that they promise to bear arms.  Nor has Congress expressly made any such finding a prerequisite to citizenship.  To hold that it is required is to read it into the Act by implication.  But we could not assume that Congress intended to make such an abrupt and radical departure from our traditions unless it spoke in unequivocal terms.  The bearing of arms, important as it is, is not the only way in which our institutions may be supported and defended, even in times of great peril.  Total war in its modern form dramatizes as never before the great cooperative effort necessary for victory.  The nuclear physicists who developed the atomic bomb, the worker at his lathe, the seamen on cargo vessels, construction battalions, nurses, engineers, litter bearers, doctors, chaplains — these, too, made essential contributions.  And many of them made the supreme sacrifice.  Mr. Justice Holmes stated in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case (279 U. S. p. 655) that “the Quakers have done their share to make the country what it is.” And the annals of the recent war show that many whose religious scruples prevented them from bearing arms, nevertheless were unselfish participants in the war effort.  Refusal to bear arms is not necessarily a sign of disloyalty or a lack of attachment to our institutions.  One may serve his country faithfully and devotedly, though his religious scruples make it impossible for him to shoulder a rifle.  Devotion to one’s country can be as real and as enduring among non-combatants as among combatants.  One may adhere to what he deems to be his obligation to God and yet assume all military risks to secure victory.  The effort of war is indivisible; and those whose religious scruples prevent them from killing are no less patriots than those whose special traits or handicaps result in their *65 assignment to duties far behind the fighting front.  Each is making the utmost contribution according to his capacity.
**Lead Opinion**
 Can it be that the oath means one thing to one who has served to the extent permitted by his religious scruples and another thing to one equally willing to serve but who has not had the opportunity?  It is not enough to say that petitioner is not entitled to the benefits of the new Act since he did not serve in the armed forces.  He is not seeking the benefits of the expedited procedure and the relaxed requirements.  The oath which he must take is identical with the oath which both non-combatants and combatants must take.  It would, indeed, be a strange construction to say that “support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic” demands something more from some than it does from others.  That oath can hardly be adequate for one who is unwilling to bear arms because of religious scruples and yet exact from another a promise to bear arms despite religious scruples.  Mr. Justice Holmes stated in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case (279 U. S. pp. 654-55): “if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought — not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.  I think that we should adhere to that principle with regard to admission into, as well as to life within this country.” The struggle for religious liberty has through the centuries been an effort to accommodate the demands of the State to the conscience of the individual.  The victory for freedom of thought recorded in our Bill of Rights recognizes that in the domain of conscience there is a moral power higher than the State.  Throughout the ages, men have suffered death rather than subordinate their allegiance to God to the authority of the State.  Freedom of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment is the product of that struggle.  As we *69 recently stated in United States v. Ballard, 322 U. S. 78, 86 , “Freedom of thought, which includes freedom of religious belief, is basic in a society of free men.  Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 .” The test oath is abhorrent to our tradition.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Chief Justice Stone, dissenting.  I think the judgment should be affirmed, for the reason that the court below, in applying the controlling provisions of the naturalization statutes, correctly applied them as earlier construed by this Court, whose construction Congress has adopted and confirmed.  In three cases decided more than fifteen years ago, this Court denied citizenship to applicants for naturalization who had announced that they proposed to take the pre *71 scribed oath of allegiance with the reservation or qualification that they would not, as naturalized citizens, assist in the defense of this country by force of arms or give their moral support to the government in any war which they did not believe to be morally justified or in the best interests of the country.  See United States v. Schwimmer, <citedDecision>279 U. S. 644</citedDecision> ; United States v. Macintosh, 283 U. S. 605 ; United States v. Bland, 283 U. S. 636 .  In each of these cases this Court held that the applicant had failed to meet the conditions which Congress had made prerequisite to naturalization by § 4 of the Naturalization Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592, 34 Stat. 596 , the provisions of which, here relevant, were enacted in the Nationality Act of October 14, 1940.  See c. 876, 54 Stat. 1137 , as amended by the Act of March 27, 1942, c. 199, 56 Stat. 176 , 182-183, and by the Act of December 7, 1942, c. 690, 56 Stat. 1041 , 8 U. S. C. §§ 707 , 735.  Section 4 of the Naturalization Act of 1906, paragraph “Third,” provided that before the admission to citizenship the applicant should declare on oath in open court that “he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” And paragraph “Fourth” required that before admission it be made to appear “to the satisfaction of the court admitting any alien to citizenship” that at least for a period of five years immediately preceding his application the applicant “has behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same .  .  .” In applying these provisions in the cases mentioned, this Court held only that an applicant who is unable to take the oath of allegiance without the reservations or qualifications insisted upon by the applicants in those cases manifests his want of attachment to the principles of the Constitution and his unwillingness to meet *72 the requirements of the oath, that he will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and so does not comply with the statutory conditions of his naturalization.  No question of the constitutional power of Congress to withhold citizenship on these grounds was involved.  That power was not doubted.  See Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U. S. 366 ; Hamilton v. Regents, 293 U. S. 245 .  The only question was of construction of the statute which Congress at all times has been free to amend if dissatisfied with the construction adopted by the Court. With three other Justices of the Court I dissented in the Macintosh and Bland cases, for reasons which the Court now adopts as ground for overruling them.  1 Since this Court in three considered earlier opinions has rejected the construction of the statute for which the dissenting Justices contended, the question, which for me is decisive of the present case, is whether Congress has likewise rejected that construction by its subsequent legislative action, and has adopted and confirmed the Court’s earlier construction of the statutes in question.  A study of Congressional action taken with respect to proposals for amendment of the naturalization laws since the decision in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case, leads me to conclude that Congress has adopted and confirmed this Court’s earlier con *73 struction of the naturalization laws.  For that reason alone I think that the judgment should be affirmed.  The construction of the naturalization statutes, adopted by this Court in the three cases mentioned, immediately became the target of an active, publicized legislative attack in Congress which persisted for a period of eleven years, until the adoption of the Nationality Act in 1940.  Two days after the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case was decided, a bill was introduced in the House, H. R. 3547, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., to give the Naturalization Act a construction contrary to that which had been given to it by this Court and which, if adopted, would have made the applicants rejected by this Court in the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases eligible for citizenship.  This effort to establish by Congressional action that the construction which this Court had placed on the Naturalization Act was not one which Congress had adopted or intended, was renewed without success after the decision in the Macintosh and Bland cases, and was continued for a period of about ten years.  2 All of these measures were of substantially the same pattern as H. R. 297, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., introduced December 8, 1931, at the first session of Congress, after the decision in the Macintosh case. It provided that no person otherwise qualified “shall be debarred from citizenship by reason of his or her religious views or philosophical opinions with respect to the lawfulness of war as a means of settling international disputes, but every alien admitted to citizenship shall be subject to the same obligations as the native-born citizen.” H. R. 3547, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., *74 introduced immediately after the decision in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case, had contained a like provision, but with the omission of the last clause beginning “but every alien.” Hearings were had before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization on both bills at which their proponents had stated clearly their purpose to set aside the interpretation placed on the oath of allegiance by the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> and Macintosh cases. 3 There was opposition on each occasion.  4 Bills identical with H. R. 297 were introduced in three later Congresses.  5 None of these bills were reported out of Committee.  The other proposals, all of which failed of passage (see footnote 2, ante), had the same purpose and differed only in phraseology.  Thus, for six successive Congresses, over a period of more than a decade, there were continuously pending before Congress in one form or another proposals to overturn the rulings in the three Supreme Court decisions in question.  Congress declined to adopt these proposals after full hearings and after speeches on the floor advocating the change.  72 Cong. Rec. 6966-7; 75 Cong. Rec. 15354-7.  In the meantime the decisions of this Court had been followed in Clarke’s Case, 301 Pa. 321 , 152 A. 92 ; Beale v. United States, 71 F. 2d 737 ; In re Warkentin, 93 F. 2d 42 .  In Beale v. United States, supra, the court pointed out that the proposed amendments affecting the provisions of the statutes relating to admission to citizenship had failed, saying: “We must conclude, therefore, that these statutory requirements as construed *75 by the Supreme Court have congressional sanction and approval.” Any doubts that such were the purpose and will of Congress would seem, to have been dissipated by the reenactment by Congress in 1940 of Paragraphs “Third” and “Fourth” of § 4 of the Naturalization Act of 1906, and by the incorporation in the Act of 1940 of the very form of oath which had been administratively prescribed for the applicants in the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases. See Rule 8 (c), Naturalization Regulations of July 1, 1929.  6 The Nationality Act of 1940 was a comprehensive, slowly matured and carefully considered revision of the naturalization laws.  The preparation of this measure was not only delegated to a Congressional Committee, but was considered by a committee of Cabinet members, one of whom was the Attorney General.  Both were aware of our decisions in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> and related cases and that no other question pertinent to the naturalization laws had been as persistently and continuously before Congress in the ten years following the decision in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case. The modifications in the provisions of Paragraphs “Third” and “Fourth” of § 4 of the 1906 Act show conclusively the careful attention which was given to them.  *76 In the face of this legislative history the "failure of Congress to alter the Act after it had been judicially construed, and the enactment by Congress of legislation which implicitly recognizes the judicial construction as effective, is persuasive of legislative recognition that the judicial construction is the correct one.  This is the more so where, as here, the application of the statute .  .  .  has brought forth sharply conflicting views both on the Court and in Congress, and where after the matter has been fully brought to the attention of the public and the Congress, the latter has not seen fit to change the statute.” Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U. S. 469, 488-9 .  And see to like effect United States v. Ryan, 284 U. S. 167 -175; United States v. Elgin, J. & E. R. Co., 298 U. S. 492, 500 ; Missouri v. Ross, 299 U. S. 72, 75 ; cf. Helvering v. Winmill, 305 U. S. 79, 82, 83 .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 There is no necessary inconsistency in this respect between the 1940 Act and the 1942 amendments.  Without it repeal by implication is not favored.  United States v. Borden Co., 308 U. S. 188, 198-9, 203-6 ; Georgia v. Pennsylvania R. Co., 324 U. S. 439, 457 ; United States Alkali Assn. v. United States, 325 U. S. 196, 209 .  The amendments and their legislative history give no hint of any purpose of Congress to relax, at least for persons who had rendered no military service, the requirements of the oath of allegiance and proof of attachment to the Constitution as this Court had interpreted them and as the Nationality Act of 1940 plainly required them to be interpreted.  It is not the function of this Court to disregard the will of Congress in the exercise of its constitutional power.  Mr. Justice Reed and Mr. Justice Frankfurter join in this opinion.  In the opinion of the writer there was evidence in United States v. Schwimmer, <citedDecision>279 U. S. 644</citedDecision> , from which the district court could and presumably did infer that applicant’s behavior evidenced a disposition, present and future, actively to resist all laws of the United States and lawful commands of its officers for the furthering of any military enterprise of the United States, and actively to aid and encourage such resistance in others, and this the district court presumably concluded evidenced a want of attachment of the applicant to the principles of the Constitution which the naturalization law requires to be exhibited by the behavior of the applicant, preceding the application for citizenship.

He explained that answer before the examiner by saying "it is a purely religious matter with me, I have no political or personal reasons other than that." He did not claim before his Selective Service board exemption from all military service, but only from combatant military duty.  At the hearing in the District Court petitioner testified that he was a member of the Seventh Day Adventist denomination, of whom approximately 10,000 were then serving in the armed forces of the United States as non-combatants, especially in the medical corps; and that he was willing to serve in the army but would not bear arms.  The District Court admitted him to citizenship.  The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting.  149 F.2d 760 .  It took that action on the authority of United States v. Schwimmer, <citedDecision>279 U.S. 644</citedDecision> ; United States v. Macintosh, 283 U.S. 605 , and United States v. Bland, 283 U.S. 636 , saying that the facts of the present case brought it squarely within the principle of those cases. The case is here on *63 a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted so that those authorities might be re-examined.  The Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases involved, as does the present one, a question of statutory construction.

[2] Those provisions were reenacted into the present law in substantially the same form.  [3] While there are some factual distinctions between this case and the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> and Macintosh cases, the Bland case on its facts is indistinguishable.  But the principle emerging from the three cases obliterates any factual distinction among them.  As we recognized in In re Summers, 325 U.S. 561, 572, 577 , they stand for the same general rule  that an alien who refuses to bear arms will not be admitted to citizenship.

 And, as we have said, we cannot believe that the oath was designed to exact something more from one person than from another.  Thus the affirmative action taken by Congress in 1942 negatives any inference that otherwise might be drawn from its silence when it reenacted the oath in 1940.  Reversed.  MR. JUSTICE JACKSON took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. MR. CHIEF JUSTICE STONE, dissenting.  I think the judgment should be affirmed, for the reason that the court below, in applying the controlling provisions of the naturalization statutes, correctly applied them as earlier construed by this Court, whose construction Congress has adopted and confirmed.  In three cases decided more than fifteen years ago, this Court denied citizenship to applicants for naturalization who had announced that they proposed to take the prescribed *71 oath of allegiance with the reservation or qualification that they would not, as naturalized citizens, assist in the defense of this country by force of arms or give their moral support to the government in any war which they did not believe to be morally justified or in the best interests of the country.  See United States v. Schwimmer, <citedDecision>279 U.S. 644</citedDecision> ; United States v. Macintosh, 283 U.S. 605 ; United States v. Bland, 283 U.S. 636 .  In each of these cases this Court held that the applicant had failed to meet the conditions which Congress had made prerequisite to naturalization by § 4 of the Naturalization Act of June 29, 1906, c. 3592, 34 Stat. 596 , the provisions of which, here relevant, were enacted in the Nationality Act of October 14, 1940.  See c. 876, 54 Stat. 1137 , as amended by the Act of March 27, 1942, c. 199, 56 Stat. 176 , 182-183, and by the Act of December 7, 1942, c. 690, 56 Stat. 1041 , 8 U.S.C. §§ 707 , 735.  Section 4 of the Naturalization Act of 1906, paragraph "Third," provided that before the admission to citizenship the applicant should declare on oath in open court that "he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same." And paragraph "Fourth" required that before admission it be made to appear "to the satisfaction of the court admitting any alien to citizenship" that at least for a period of five years immediately preceding his application the applicant "has behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same .  .  ." In applying these provisions in the cases mentioned, this Court held only that an applicant who is unable to take the oath of allegiance without the reservations or qualifications insisted upon by the applicants in those cases manifests his want of attachment to the principles of the Constitution and his unwillingness to meet *72 the requirements of the oath, that he will support and defend the Constitution of the United States and bear true faith and allegiance to the same, and so does not comply with the statutory conditions of his naturalization.  No question of the constitutional power of Congress to withhold citizenship on these grounds was involved.  That power was not doubted.  See Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U.S. 366 ; Hamilton v. Regents, 293 U.S. 245 .  The only question was of construction of the statute which Congress at all times has been free to amend if dissatisfied with the construction adopted by the Court. With three other Justices of the Court I dissented in the Macintosh and Bland cases, for reasons which the Court now adopts as ground for overruling them.  [1] Since this Court in three considered earlier opinions has rejected the construction of the statute for which the dissenting Justices contended, the question, which for me is decisive of the present case, is whether Congress has likewise rejected that construction by its subsequent legislative action, and has adopted and confirmed the Court's earlier construction of the statutes in question.  A study of Congressional action taken with respect to proposals for amendment of the naturalization laws since the decision in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case, leads me to conclude that Congress has adopted and confirmed this Court's earlier construction *73 of the naturalization laws.  For that reason alone I think that the judgment should be affirmed.  The construction of the naturalization statutes, adopted by this Court in the three cases mentioned, immediately became the target of an active, publicized legislative attack in Congress which persisted for a period of eleven years, until the adoption of the Nationality Act in 1940.  Two days after the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case was decided, a bill was introduced in the House, H.R. 3547, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., to give the Naturalization Act a construction contrary to that which had been given to it by this Court and which, if adopted, would have made the applicants rejected by this Court in the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases eligible for citizenship.  This effort to establish by Congressional action that the construction which this Court had placed on the Naturalization Act was not one which Congress had adopted or intended, was renewed without success after the decision in the Macintosh and Bland cases, and was continued for a period of about ten years.  [2] All of these measures were of substantially the same pattern as H.R. 297, 72d Cong., 1st Sess., introduced December 8, 1931, at the first session of Congress, after the decision in the Macintosh case. It provided that no person otherwise qualified "shall be debarred from citizenship by reason of his or her religious views or philosophical opinions with respect to the lawfulness of war as a means of settling international disputes, but every alien admitted to citizenship shall be subject to the same obligations as the native-born citizen." H.R. 3547, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., *74 introduced immediately after the decision in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case, had contained a like provision, but with the omission of the last clause beginning "but every alien." Hearings were had before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization on both bills at which their proponents had stated clearly their purpose to set aside the interpretation placed on the oath of allegiance by the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> and Macintosh cases. [3] There was opposition on each occasion.  [4] Bills identical with H.R. 297 were introduced in three later Congresses.  [5] None of these bills were reported out of Committee.  The other proposals, all of which failed of passage (see footnote 2, ante ), had the same purpose and differed only in phraseology.  Thus, for six successive Congresses, over a period of more than a decade, there were continuously pending before Congress in one form or another proposals to overturn the rulings in the three Supreme Court decisions in question.  Congress declined to adopt these proposals after full hearings and after speeches on the floor advocating the change.  72 Cong. Rec. 6966-7; 75 Cong. Rec. 15354-7.  In the meantime the decisions of this Court had been followed in Clarke's Case, 301 Pa. 321 , 152 A. 92 ; Beale v. United States, 71 F.2d 737 ; In re Warkentin, 93 F.2d 42 .  In Beale v. United States, supra , the court pointed out that the proposed amendments affecting the provisions of the statutes relating to admission to citizenship had failed, saying: "We must conclude, therefore, that these statutory requirements as construed *75 by the Supreme Court have congressional sanction and approval." Any doubts that such were the purpose and will of Congress would seem to have been dissipated by the reenactment by Congress in 1940 of Paragraphs "Third" and "Fourth" of § 4 of the Naturalization Act of 1906, and by the incorporation in the Act of 1940 of the very form of oath which had been administratively prescribed for the applicants in the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases. See Rule 8 (c), Naturalization Regulations of July 1, 1929.  [6] The Nationality Act of 1940 was a comprehensive, slowly matured and carefully considered revision of the naturalization laws.  The preparation of this measure was not only delegated to a Congressional Committee, but was considered by a committee of Cabinet members, one of whom was the Attorney General.  Both were aware of our decisions in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> and related cases and that no other question pertinent to the naturalization laws had been as persistently and continuously before Congress in the ten years following the decision in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case. The modifications in the provisions of Paragraphs "Third" and "Fourth" of § 4 of the 1906 Act show conclusively the careful attention which was given to them.  *76 In the face of this legislative history the "failure of Congress to alter the Act after it had been judicially construed, and the enactment by Congress of legislation which implicitly recognizes the judicial construction as effective, is persuasive of legislative recognition that the judicial construction is the correct one.  This is the more so where, as here, the application of the statute .  .  .  has brought forth sharply conflicting views both on the Court and in Congress, and where after the matter has been fully brought to the attention of the public and the Congress, the latter has not seen fit to change the statute." Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader, 310 U.S. 469, 488-9 .
**Combined Opinion**
 He had been inducted into the army as a non-combatant.  His naturalization was opposed by the Immigration Service on the ground that he could not promise to bear arms.  The court overruled the objection, stating, p. 523: "If conscientious objectors, who are aliens, performing military duty, and wearing the uniform, are not granted the privileges of citizenship under this act, then the act would be meaningless.  It would be so made if an applicant, being a conscientious objector, who has attained the status of a soldier, performs military duty, and honorably wears the uniform (as is admitted in the instant cases), is denied citizenship.  If the oath of allegiance is to be construed as requiring such applicant to agree, without mental reservation, to bear arms, then the result would be a denial of citizenship, even though Congress has conferred such privilege upon him." And see In re Sawyer, 59 F. Supp. 428 .  [1]  Page 72 In the opinion of the writer there was evidence in United States v. Schwimmer, <citedDecision>279 U.S. 644</citedDecision> , from which the district court could and presumably did infer that applicant's behavior evidenced a disposition, present and future, actively to resist all laws of the United States and lawful commands of its officers for the furthering of any military enterprise of the United States, and actively to aid and encourage such resistance in others, and this the district court presumably concluded evidenced a want of attachment of the applicant to the principles of the Constitution which the naturalization law requires to be exhibited by the behavior of the applicant, preceding the application for citizenship.
