 278 App. Div. 253 , 104 N. Y. S. 2d 740.  On appeal the New York Court of Appeals, two judges dissenting, affirmed the order of the Appellate Division.  303 N. Y. 242 , 101 N. E. 2d 665 .  The case is here on appeal.  28 U. S. C. § 1257 (2).  As we view the case, we need consider only appellant’s contention that the New York statute is an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech and a free press.  In Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm’n, <citedDecision>236 U. S. 230</citedDecision> (1915), a distributor of motion pictures sought to enjoin the enforcement of an Ohio statute which required the prior approval of a board of censors before any motion *500 picture could be publicly exhibited in the state, and which directed the board to approve only such films as it adjudged to be “of a moral, educational or amusing and harmless character.” The statute was assailed in part as an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court rejected this contention, stating that the first eight Amendments were not a restriction on state action.  215 F. 138, 141 (D. C. N. D. Ohio 1914).  On appeal to this Court, plaintiff in its brief abandoned this claim and contended merely that the statute in question violated the freedom of speech and publication guaranteed by the Constitution of Ohio.  In affirming the decree of the District Court denying injunctive relief, this Court stated: “It cannot be put out of view that the exhibition of moving pictures is a business pure and simple, originated and conducted for profit, like other spectacles, not to be regarded, nor intended to be regarded by the Ohio constitution, we think, as part of the press of the country or as organs of public opinion.” 7 In a series of decisions beginning with Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652 (1925), this Court held that the liberty of speech and of the press which the First Amendment guarantees against abridgment by the federal government is within the liberty safeguarded by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action.  8 That principle has been *501 followed and reaffirmed to the present day. Since this series of decisions came after the Mutual decision, the present case is the first to present squarely to us the question whether motion pictures are within the ambit of protection which the First Amendment, through the Fourteenth, secures to any form of “speech” or “the press.” 9 It cannot be doubted that motion pictures are a significant medium for the communication of ideas.  They may affect public attitudes and behavior in a variety of ways, ranging from direct espousal of a political or social doctrine to the subtle shaping of thought which characterizes all artistic expression.

**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Reed, concurring in the judgment of the Court. Assuming that a state may establish a system for the licensing of motion pictures, an issue not foreclosed by the Court’s opinion, our duty requires us to examine the facts of the refusal of a license in each case to determine *507 whether the principles of the First Amendment have been honored.- This film does not seem to me to be of a character that the First Amendment permits a state to exclude from public view.

**Combined Opinion**
 After concluding that the Board of Regents acted within its authority and that its determination was not "one that no reasonable mind could reach," id., at 250-255, 256-257 , 101 N. E. 2d 665, 667-671 , the majority held, first, that "sacrilegious" was an adequately definite standard, quoting a definition from Funk & Wagnalls' Dictionary and referring to opinions in this Court that in passing used the term "profane," which the New York court said was a synonym of "sacrilegious"; second, that the State's assurance "that no religion.  .  .  shall be treated with contempt, mockery, scorn and ridicule .  .  .  by those engaged in selling entertainment by way of motion pictures" does not violate the religious guarantee of the First Amendment; and third, that motion pictures are not entitled to the immunities from regulation enjoyed by the press, in view of the decision in Mutual Film Corp. v. Ohio Industrial Comm'n, <citedDecision>236 U. S. 230</citedDecision> .  Id., at 255-256, 258-260, 260-262 , 101 N. E. 2d 670 -674.  The two dissenting judges, after dealing with a matter of local law not reviewable here, found that the standard "sacrilegious" is unconstitutionally vague, and, finally, that the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech applied equally to motion pictures and prevented this censorship.  303 N. Y. 242, 264 , 101 N. E. 2d 665, 675 .  Both State courts, as did this Court, viewed "The Miracle." Arguments by the parties and in briefs amici invite us to pursue to their farthest reach the problems in which this case is involved.  Positions are advanced so absolute and abstract that in any event they could not properly determine this controversy.
**Combined Opinion**
 *519 So far as the Court of Appeals sought to support its notion that "sacrilegious" has the necessary precision of meaning which the Due Process Clause enjoins for statutes regulating men's activities, it relied on this definition from Funk & Wagnalls' Dictionary: "The act of violating or profaning anything sacred." But this merely defines by turning an adjective into a noun and bringing in two new words equally undefined.  It leaves wide open the question as to what persons, doctrines or things are "sacred." It sheds no light on what representations on the motion picture screen will constitute "profaning" those things which the State censors find to be "sacred." To criticize or assail religious doctrine may wound to the quick those who are attached to the doctrine and profoundly cherish it.  But to bar such pictorial discussion is to subject non-conformists to the rule of sects.  Even in Mutual Film Corp. v. Ohio Industrial Comm'n, <citedDecision>236 U. S. 230</citedDecision> , it was deemed necessary to find that the terms "educational, moral, amusing or harmless" do not leave "decision to arbitrary judgment." Such general words were found to "get precision from the sense and experience of men." <citedDecision>Id., at 245, 246</citedDecision> .  This cannot be said of "sacrilegious." If there is one thing that the history of religious conflicts shows, it is that the term "sacrilegious" if by that is implied offense to the deep convictions of members of different sects, which is what the Court of Appeals seems to mean so far as it means anything preciselydoes not gain "precision from the sense and experience of men." The vast apparatus of indices and digests, which mirrors our law, affords no clue to a judicial definition of sacrilege.  Not one case, barring the present, has been uncovered which considers the meaning of the term in any context.  Nor has the practice under the New York law contributed light.  The Motion Picture Division of the Education Department does not support with explanatory *520 statements its action on any specific motion picture, which we are advised is itself not made public.
