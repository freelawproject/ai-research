<author id="b76-5">Mr. Justice Peckham,</author>
<p id="Af-">after making the foregoing statement of the facts, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p id="b76-6">The indictment, it will be seen, charges that the plaintiff in error violated the one hundred and tenth section of article 8, chapter 415, of the Laws of 1897, known as the labor law of the State of New York, in that he wrongfully and unlawfully required and permitted an employé working for him to work more than sixty hours in one week. There is nothing in any of the opinions delivered in this case, either in the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeals of the State, which construes the section, in using the word “required,” as referring to any physical force being used to obtain the labor of an employé. It is assumed that the word means nothing more , than the requirement arising from voluntary contract for such labor in excess of the number of hours specified in the statute. There is no pretense in any of the opinions that the statute was intended to meet, a case of involuntary labor in any form. All the opinions assume that there is no real distinction, so far as this question is concerned, between the words “ required ” and “permitted.” The mandate of the statute that “no employé shall be required or permitted to work,” is the substantial equivalent of an enactment that “no employé shall cdntract or agree to. work,” more than ten hours per day, and as there is no provision for special emergencies the statute is mandatory in all cases.' It is not an act merely fixing the number of hours which shall constitute a legal day’s work, but an absolute prohibition upon the employer, permitting, under any circumstances, more than ten hours work to be done in his establishment. The employé may desire to earn the extra money, which would arise from his working more than the prescribed <page-number citation-index="1" label="53">*53</page-number>time, but this statute forbids the employer from permitting the employé to earn it.</p>
<p id="b77-5">The statute necessarily interferes with the right of contract between the employer and employes, concerning the number of hours in which the latter may labor in the bakery of the employer. The general right to make a contract in relation to his business is part of the liberty of the individual protected by the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. <em>Allgeyer </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>165 U. S. 578. Under that provision no State can deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law. The right to purchase or to sell labor is part of the liberty protected by this amendment, unless there are circumstances which exclude the right. There are, however, certain powers, existing in the. sovereignty of each State in the Union, somewhat vaguely termed police powers, the exact description and limitation of which have not been attempted by the courts. Those powers, broadly stated and without, at present, any attempt at a more specific limitation, relate to the safety, health, morals and general welfare of the public. Both property and liberty are held on such reasonable conditions as may be imposed by the governing power of the State in the exercise of those powers, and with such conditions the Fourteenth Amendment was not designed to interfere. <em>Mugler </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>123 U. S. 623; <em>In re Kemmler, </em>136 U. S. 436; <em>Crowley </em>v. Christensen, 137 U. S. 86; <em>In re </em>Conv<em>erse, </em>137 U. S. 624.</p>
<p id="b77-6">The State, therefore, has power to prevent the individual from making certain kinds of contracts, and in regard to them the Federal Constitution offers no protection. If the contract be one which the State, in the legitimate exercise of its police power, has the right to prohibit, it is not prevented from prohibiting it by the Fourteenth Amendment. Contracts in violation of a statute, either of the Federal or state government, or a contract to ‘let one’s property for immoral purposes, or to do any other unlawful act, could obtain no protection from the Federal Constitution, as coming under the liberty of <page-number citation-index="1" label="54">*54</page-number>person or of free contract. Therefore, when the State, by its legislature, in the assumed exercise of its police powers, has passed an act which seriously limits the right to labor or the right of contract in regard to their means of livelihood between persons who are <em>sui juris </em>(both employer and employé), it becomes of great importance to determine which shall prevail — the right of the individual to labor for such time as he may choose, or the right of the State to prevent the individual from laboring- or from entering into any contract to labor, beyond a certain time prescribed by the State.</p>
<p id="b78-5">This court has recognized the existence and upheld the exercise of the police powers of the States in many cases which might.fairly be considered as border ones, and it has, in the course of its determination of questions regarding the asserted invalidity of such statutes, on the ground of their violation of the rights secured by the Federal Constitution, been guided by rules óf a very liberal nature, the application of Which has resulted, in numerous instances, in upholding the validity of state statutes thus assailed. Among the later cases where the-state law has been upheld by this court is that of <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Hardy, </em>169 U. S. 366. A provision in the act of the legislature of Utah was there under consideration, the act limiting the employment-of workmen in all underground mines or workings, to eight hours per day, “except in cases of emergency, where life or property is in imminent danger.” It also limited the hours of labor in smelting and other institutions for the reduction or refining of ores or metals to eight hours per day, except in like cases of emergency. The act was held to be a valid exercise of the police powers of the State. A review of many of the cases on the subject, decided by this and other courts, is given, in the opinion. It was held that the kind, of employment, mining, smelting, etc., and the character of the employés in such kinds of labor, were such as to make it reasonable and proper for the State to interfere to prevent the employés from being constrained' by the. rules laid down by the proprietors in regard to labor. The following citation <page-number citation-index="1" label="55">*55</page-number>from the observations of the Supreme Court of Utah in that case was made by the judge writing the opinion of this court, and approved: “The law in question is confined to the protection of that class of people engaged in labor in underground mines, and in smelters and other works wherein ores are reduced and refined. This law applies only to the classes subjected by their employment to the peculiar conditions and effects attending underground mining and work in smelters, and other works for the reduction and refining of ores. Therefore it is not necessary to discuss or decide whether the legislature can fix the hours of labor in other employments.”</p>
<p id="b79-5">It will be observed that, even with regard to that class of labor, the Utah statute provided for cases of emergency wherein the provisions of .the statute would not apply. The statute now before this court has no emergency clause in it, and, if the statute is valid, there are no circumstances and no emergencies under which the slightest violation of the provisions of the act would be innocent. There is nothing in <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>which covers the case now before us. Nor does <em>Atkin </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>191 U. S. 207, touch the case at bar. The <em>Atkin case </em>was decided upon the right of the State to control its municipal corporations and to prescribe the conditions upon which it will permit work of a public character to be done for a municipality. <em>Knoxville Iron Co. v. Harbison, </em>183 U. S. 13, is equally far from an authority for this legislation. The employes in that case were held to be at a disadvantage with the employer in matters of wages, they being miners and coal workers, and the act simply provided for the cashing of coal orders when presented by the miner to the employer.</p>
<p id="b79-6">The latest case decided by this court, involving the police power, is that of <em>Jacobson </em>v. Massachusetts, decided at this term and reported in 197 U. S. 11. It related to compulsory vaccination, and the law was held valid as a proper exercise^ of the police powers with reference to the public health. It was stated in the opinion .that it was a case “of an adult who, for aught, that appears, was himself in perfect health and a fit <page-number citation-index="1" label="56">*56</page-number>subject for vaccination, and yet, while remaining in the community, refused to obey the statute and the regulation adopted in execution of its provisions for the protection of the public health and the public safety, confessedly endangered by the presence of a dangerous disease.” That case is also far from covering the one now before the court.</p>
<p id="b80-5"><em>Petit </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>177 U. S. 164, was upheld as a proper exercise of the police power relating to the observance of Sunday, and the case held that the legislature had the right to declare that, as matter of law, keeping barber shops open on Sunday was not a work of necessity or charity.</p>
<p id="b80-6">It must, of course, be conceded that there is a limit to the valid exercise of the police power by the State. There is no dispute concerning this general proposition. Otherwise the Fourteenth Amendment would have no efficacy and the legislatures of the States would have unbounded power, and it would be enough to say that any piece of legislation was enacted to conserve the morals, the health or the safety of the people; such legislation would be valid, no matter how absolutely without foundation the claim might be. The claim of the police power would be a mere pretext — become another and delusive name for the supreme sovereignty of the State to be' exercised free from constitutional restraint. This is not contended for. In every case that comes before this court, therefore, where legislation of this character is concerned and where the protection of the Federal Constitution is sought, the question necessarily arises: Is this a fair, reasonable and appropriate exercise of the police power of the State, or is it an unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right of the individual to his personal liberty - or to enter into those contracts in relation to labor which may seem to him appropriate or necessary for the support .of himself and his family? Of course the liberty of contract relating to labor includes both parties to it. The one has as much right to purchase as the other to sell labor.</p>
<p id="b80-7">This‘is not a question of substituting the judgment of the <page-number citation-index="1" label="57">*57</page-number>court for that of the legislature. If the act.be within the power of the State it is valid, although the judgment of the court might be totally opposed to the enactment of such a law. But the question would still remain: Is it within the police power of the State? and that question must be answered by the court.</p>
<p id="b81-5">The question whether this act is valid as a labor law, pure and simple, may be dismissed in a few words. There is no reasonable ground for interfering, with the liberty of person or the right of free contract, by determining the hours of labor, in the occupation of a baker. There is no contention that bakers as a class are not equal in intelligence and capacity to men in other trades or manual occupations, or that they are not able to assert their rights and care for themselves without the protecting arm of the State, interfering with their independence of judgment and of action. They are in no sense wards of the State. Viewed in the light of a purely labor law, with no‘reference whatever, to the question of health, we think that a law like the one before üs involves neither the .safety, the morals nor the welfare of the public, and that the interest of. the public is not in the slightest degree affected by such an act. The law must be upheld, if at all, as a law pertaining to the health of the individual engaged in the occupation of a baker. It does not affect any other portion of the public than those who are engaged in that occupation. Clean and wholesome bread does not depend upon whether the baker works but ten hours per day or only sixty hours a week. The limitation of the hours of labor does not come within the police nower on that ground.</p>
<p id="A1G">It is a question of which of two powers or rights shall prevail —the power of the State to legislate or the right of the individual to liberty of person and freedom of contract. The mere assertion that the subject relates though but in a remote degree to the public health does not necessarily render the enactment valid. The act must have a more direct relation, as a means to an end, and the end itself must be appropriate and legitimate, before an act. can be held to be valid which interferes <page-number citation-index="1" label="58">*58</page-number>with the general right of an individual to be free in his person and in his power to contract in relation to his own labor.</p>
<p id="b82-5">This case has caused much diversity'of opinion in the state courts. In the Supreme Court two of the five judges composing the Appellate Division dissented from the judgment affirming the validity of the act. In the Court of Appeals three of the seven judges also dissented from, the judgment upholding the statute. Although found in what is called a labor law of the State, the Court of Appeals has upheld the act-as one relating to the public health — in other words, as a health law. One of the judges of the Court of Appeals, in upholding the law, stated that, in his opinion, the regulation in question could not be sustained unless, they were able to say,.from common knowledge, that working in a bakery and candy factory was an unhealthy employment. The judge held that, while the evidence was not uniform, it still led him'to the conclusion that the occupation of a baker or confectioner was unhealthy and tended to result in diseases of the respiratory organs. Three of the judges dissented from that view, and they thought the occupation of a baker was not to such an extent unhealthy as to warrant the interference of the legislature with the liberty of the individual.</p>
<p id="b82-6">We think the limit of the police power has been reached and passed in this case. There is, in our judgment, no reasonable foundation for holding this to be necessary or appropriate as a health law to safeguard the public health or the health of the individuals who are following the trade of a baker. If this statute be valid, and if, therefore, a proper case is made out in which to deny the right of an individual, <em>sui juris, </em>as employer or employe, to make contracts for tlie labor of the latter under the protection of the provisions of the Federal Constitution, there would seem to be no length to which legislation of this nature might not go. The case differs widely, as we have already stated, from the expressions of this court in regard to laws of this nature, as stated in <em>Holden </em>v. <em>Hardy </em>and <em>Jacobson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra.</em></p>
<p id="b83-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="59">*59</page-number>' We think that there can be no fair doubt that the trade of a baker, in and of itself, is not an unhealthy one to that degree which-would authorize the legislature to interfere with the right to labor,- and with the right of free contract on the part of the individual, either as employer or employé. In looking through statistics regarding all trades and occupations, it may be true that the trade of a baker does not appear to be as healthy as some other trades, and is also vastly more healthy than still others.- To the common understanding the trade of a baker has newer been regarded as an unhealthy one. Very likely physicians would not recommend the exercise of that or of any other trade as a remedy for ill health. Some occupations are more healthy than others, but we think there are none which might not come under the power of the legislature to supervisé and control the hours of working therein, if the mere fact that the occupation is not absolutely and perfectly healthy is to confer that right upon the legislative department of the Government. It might be safely affirmed that almost all occupations more or less affect the health. There must be more than the mere fact of the possible existence-'of. some small amount of unhealthiness to warrant legislative interference with liberty. It is unfortunately true that labor, even in any department, may possibly carry with it the seeds of unhealthiness. But are we all, on that account, at the mercy of legislative majorities? A printer, a tinsmith, a locksmith, a carpenter, a cabinetmaker, a dry goods clerk, a bank’s, a lawyer’s or a physician’s glerk, or a clerk in almost any kind of business, would all come under the power of the legislature, on this .assumption. No trade, no occupation, no -mode of earning one’s living, could escape this all-pervading power, and the acts of the legislature in limiting the hours of labor in all employments would be valid, although such limitation might seriously cripple the ability of the laborer to support himself and his family. In our large cities there are many buildings into which the sun penetrates for but a short time in each day, and these buildings are occupied by people carrying on the <page-number citation-index="1" label="60">*60</page-number>business of bankers, brokers, lawyers, real estate, and many other kinds of business, aided by many clerks, messengers, and other employés. Upon the assumption of the validity of this act under review, it is not possible to say that an act, prohibiting lawyers’ or bank clerks, or others, from contracting,to labor for their employers more than eight hours a day, would be invalid, It might be said that it is unhealthy to work more than that number of hours in an apartment lighted by artificial light during the working hours of the day; that the occupation of the bank clerk, the lawyer’s clerk, the real éstate clerk, or the broker’s clerk in such offices is therefore unhealthy, and the legislature in its paternal wisdom must, therefore, have the right to legislate on the subject of and to limit the hours for such labor, and if it exercises that power and its validity be questioned, it .is sufficient to say, it has reference to the public health; it has reference to the health pf the employés condemned to labor day after day in buildings where the sun never shines; it is a health law, and therefore.it is valid, and cannot be questioned.by the courts.</p>
<p id="b84-5">It is also urged, pursuing the same, line of argument, that it is to the interest of the State that its population should be strong and robust, and therefore any legislation which may be said to tend to make people healthy must be valid as health laws, enacted under the police power. If this be a. valid argument and'a justification for this kind of legislation, it follows that the protection of the Federal Constitution from undue interference with liberty of person and freedom of contract is visionary, wherever the law is sought to be justified as a valid exercise of the police power. Scarcely any law but might find shelter under such assumptions, and conduct; properly so called, as well as contract, would come under the restrictive sway of the legislature. Not only the hours of employés,' but the hours of employers, could be regulated, and doctors, lawyers, scientists, all professional men, as well as athletes and artisans, could be forbidden to fatigue their brains' and bodies by prolonged hours of exercise, lest the fighting strength <page-number citation-index="1" label="61">*61</page-number>of the State be impaired. We mention these extreme cases because, the. contention is extreme. We do not believe in the soundness of the views' which uphold this law. On the contrary, we think- that such a law as this, although passed in the assumed exercise of the police power, and as relating to the public health, or the health of the employés named, is not within that powpr, and is invalid. The act is not, within any fair meaning of the term, a health law, but is an illegal intérference with the rights of individuals, both employers and employés, to make contracts regarding labor upon such terms as they may think best, or which they may agree upon with the other parties to such contracts. Statutes of the nature of that under review, limiting the hours in which grown and intelligent men may labor to earn their living, are mere meddlesome interferences with the rights of- the individual, and they are not saved from condemnation by the claim that they are passed in the exercise of the police power and upon the subject of the health of the individual whose rights are interfered with, unless there be some fair ground, reasonable in and of itself, to say that there is material danger to the public health or to the health of the employés, if the hours of labor are not curtailed. If this be not clearly the case the individuals, whose rights are thus made the subject of legislative interference, are under the protection of the Federal Constitution regarding their liberty of contract as well as of person; and the legislature of the State has ho power to limit their right as proposed in this .statute. All that it could properly do has been doné by it with regard to the conduct of bakeries, as provided for in the other sections of the act, above set forth. These several sections provide for the inspection'of the premises where the bakery is carried on, with' regard to furnishing proper wash-rooms and water-closets, apart from the bake-room, also with regard to providing proper drainage, plumbing and painting; the sections, in' addition, provide for the height of the ceiling, the cementing or tiling of floors, where necessary in the opinion of thé factory inspector, and for other things of <page-number citation-index="1" label="62">*62</page-number>that nature; alterations are also provided for and are to be made where necessary'in the opinion of the inspector, in order to comply with the provisions of the statute. These various sections may be wise and valid regulations, and they certainly go to the full extent of providing for the cleanliness and the healthiness, so far as possible,' of the quarters in which bakeries are to be conducted. Adding to all these requirements, a prohibition to enter into any contract of labor in a bakery for more than a certain number of hours a week, is, in our judgement, so wholly beside the matter of a proper, reasonable and fair provision, as to run counter to that liberty of person and of free contract provided for in the Federal Constitution.</p>
<p id="AM8">It was further urged on the argument that restricting the hours of labor in the case of bakers was valid because it-tended to cleanliness on the part of the workers, as a man was more apt to be cleanly when not overworked, and if cleanly then his “output” was also more likely to beso. What has already been said applies with equal force to this contention. We do not admit the reasoning to be sufficient to justify the claimed right of such interference. The State in that case would assume the position of a supervisor, or <em>pater familias, </em>over every act of the individual, and its right of governmental interference with his hours of labor, his hours of exercise, the character thereof, and the extent to which it shall be carried would be recognized and upheld. In our judgment it is not possible in fact to discover the connection between the number of hours a baker may work in the bakery and the healthful quality of the bread made by the workman. The connection, if any exists, is too shadowy and thin to build any argument for the interference of the legislature. If the man works ten hours a day it is all right, but if ten and a half or eleven his health is in danger and his bread may be unhealthful, and, therefore, he shall not be permitted to do it. This, we think, is unreasonable and entirely arbitrary. When assertions such as we have adverted to become necessary in order to give, if possible, a plausible foundation for the contention that the law is a “health law,” <page-number citation-index="1" label="63">*63</page-number>it gives rise to at least a suspicion that there was some other motive dominating the legislature than the purpose to sub-serve the public health or welfare.</p>
<p id="b87-5">This interference on the part of the legislatures of the several States with the ordinary trades and occupations of the people seems to be on the increase. In the Supreme Court of New York, in the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Beattie, </em>Appellate Division, First Department, decided in 1904, 89 N. Y. Supp. 193, a statute regulating the trade of horseshoeing, and requiring the.person practicing such trade to be examined and to obtain a certificate from a board of examiners and file the same with-the clerk of the county wherein the person proposes to practice such trade, was held invalid, as an arbitrary interference with personal liberty and private property without due process of law. The attempt was made, unsuccessfully, to justify it as a health law.</p>
<p id="b87-6">The same kind of a statute was held invalid <em>(In re Aubry) </em>by the Supreme Court of Washington in December, 1904. 78 Pac. Rep. 900. The court held that the act deprived citizens of their liberty and property without due process of law and denied to them the equal protection of the laws. It also held that the trade of a horseshoer is not a subject of regulation under the police power of the State, as a business concerning and directly affecting the health, welfare or comfort of its inhabitants; and that therefore a law which provided for the examination and registration of horseshoers in certain cities was unconstitutional, as an illegitimate exercise of the police power.</p>
<p id="b87-7">The Supreme Court of Illinois in <em>Bessette </em>v. <em>People, </em>193 Illinois, 334, also held that a law of the same nature, providing for the regulation and licensing of horseshoers, was unconstitutional as an illegal interference with the liberty of the individual in adopting and pursuing such calling as he may choose, subject only to the restraint necessary to secure the common welfare. See also <em>Godcharles </em>v. <em>Wigeman, </em>113 Pa. St. 431, 437; <em>Low </em>v. <em>Rees Printing Co., </em>41 Nebraska, 127, 145. In <page-number citation-index="1" label="64">*64</page-number>these cases the courts upheld the right of free contract and the right to purchase and sell labor upon such terms as the parties may agree to.</p>
<p id="b88-4">It is impossible for. us to shut our eyes to the fact that many of the laws of this character, while passed under what is claimed to be the police power for the purpose of protecting the public health or welfare, are, in reality, passed from other motives. We are justified in saying so when, from the character of the law and the subject upon which it legislates, it is apparent that the public health or welfare bears but the most remote relation to the law. The purpose of a statute must he determined from the natural and legal effect of the language employed; and whether it is or is not repugnant to the Constitution of the United States must be determined from the natural effect of such statutes when put into operation, and not from their proclaimed purpose. <em>Minnesota </em>v. Barber, 136 U. S. 313; <em>Brimmer </em>v. <em>Rebman, </em>138 U. S. 78. The court looks beyond the mere letter of the law in such cases. <em>Yick Wo </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>118 U. S. 356.</p>
<p id="b88-5">It is manifest to us that the limitation of the hours of labor as provided for in this section of .the statute under which the indictment was found, and the plaintiff in error convicted, has no such direct relation to and no such substantial effect upon the health of the employé, as to justify us in regarding' the section as really a health law. It seems'to us that the real object and purpose were simply to regulate the hours of labor between the master and his employés (all being men, <em>sui juris), </em>in a private business, riot dangerous in any degree to morals or in any real and substantial degree, to the health of the employés. Under such circumstances the freedom of master and employé to contract with each other in relation to their employment, and in defining the same, cannot be prohibited or interfered with, without violating the Federal Constitution.</p>
<p id="b88-6">The judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York as well as that of the Supreme Court and of the County Court of Oneida County must be reversed and the case remanded to <page-number citation-index="1" label="65">*65</page-number>the County Court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
<p id="b89-5">
<em>Reversed.</em>
