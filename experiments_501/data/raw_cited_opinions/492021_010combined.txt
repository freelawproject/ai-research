      <p class="indent">This action involved, among other things, regulation of correspondence between inmates of different prisons, and rejection of publications directed to inmates.  Named plaintiffs were prisoners and former prisoners suing on behalf of themselves and all other prisoners in federal institutions.  On June 7, 1974, the district court ordered that the action be maintained as a class action, except for determining the question of damages, and that the class consist of all current and future prisoners.  On September 1, 1978, on plaintiff's motion, the district judge ordered the addition, as plaintiffs, of the Prisoners' Union, Weekly Guardian Associates, and the Revolutionary Socialist League, publishers of publications which had been rejected at federal prisons.</p>

      <p class="indent">On September 13, 1984, after trial, the district court filed a decision, and ordered defendants permanently enjoined from applying certain regulations, but granted judgment for defendants in all other respects.  Plaintiffs and defendants appealed from the portions of the judgment adverse to them.  Defendants' appeal, however, was later dismissed on their motion.  Individual damage claims had been "severed" before trial.  Assuming that the existence of unresolved damage claims deprives the judgment of finality, we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(a)(1) since the order refused injunctions sought by plaintiffs.</p>

The Warden may approve such correspondence in other exceptional circumstances, with particular regard to the security level of the institution, the nature of the relationship between the two inmates, and whether the inmate has other regular correspondence.  The following additional limitations apply:</p>

      <span class="num">11</span>
      <p class="indent">The plaintiffs contend that the general ban on prisoner-to-prisoner correspondence destroys prisoner relationships, thus working a hardship on inmates and prohibiting a potentially rehabilitative activity.  As on the publications issues, the plaintiffs point to state systems which have liberal policies but find no adverse results.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p12">
      <span class="num">12</span>
      <p class="indent">They argue that inmate "grapevines" are usually strong enough to relay information between prisons without the benefit of mail privileges, rendering the ban on written communication useless and therefore unduly restrictive.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p13">
      <span class="num">13</span>
      <p class="indent">The defendants respond that prisoner-to-prisoner mail could be used for communication between members of prison gangs:  in particular it could be used to arrange assaults on inmates who are transferred under the Bureau's protective custody program.  Testimony on the conduct of prison gangs indicated that this is not a remote possibility.  There was evidence, too, that prisoners have succeeded in sending letters to one another in order to carry on drug transactions and formulate escape plans.  The plaintiffs suggest that the risk of such problems could be handled by monitoring correspondence;  but the defendants reply that they could not hope to monitor a sufficient number of letters, and in any event, prisoners could easily write in private jargon that prison authorities would not understand.  Thus no less restrictive policy than a general ban on inter-inmate correspondence is in the interest of security.  The court sustains this position.  Again, as in the case of publications, the Bureau is not obliged to take risks other systems accept, nor is it required to forego controlling one means of communication where it cannot all means.</p>

See Rudolph v. Locke, <span class="citation no-link">594 F.2d 1076</span>, 1078 (5th Cir.1979).    Johnson was extended to assistance in civil rights actions in Wolff v.

Section 543.15 governs legal aid programs which are funded or approved by the Bureau.  Section 543.11(f) provides that unless the institution has an active, ongoing legal aid program, the Warden shall allow an inmate the assistance of another inmate during leisure time.</p>

    <p>II. REJECTION OF PUBLICATIONS</p>
    <div class="num" id="p21">
      <span class="num">21</span>
      <p class="indent">The Bureau of Prisons has issued regulations delegating to each warden authority to reject a publication to which an inmate has subscribed or which has been otherwise sent to him.  Generally the warden may reject a publication only if it is determined "detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution or if it might facilitate criminal activity."    28 C.F.R. Sec. 540.71(b) (1986).  The regulation also sets forth a non-exhaustive list of criteria, and a publication which meets one of them "may" be rejected.  Rejection by the warden is subject to appeal within the Bureau of Prisons.  We set forth in an Appendix the governing regulations, 28 C.F.R. Sec. 540.70 and Sec. 540.71(b), (c), (d), and (e), as well as a portion of a Bureau Program Statement No. 5266.5 which contains updated additional instructions dealing with sexually explicit material.</p>

      <span class="num">22</span>
      <p class="indent">Plaintiffs challenge on First Amendment grounds parts of Sec. 540.71(b) and the Program Statement facially and as applied.  They seek a specific determination on 46 rejected publications.  "[A] prison inmate retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner or with the legitimate penological objectives of the corrections system."    Pell v. Procunier, <span class="citation" data-id="109079"><a href="/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/">417 U.S. 817</a></span>, 822, <span class="citation" data-id="109079"><a href="/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/">94 S.Ct. 2800</a></span>, 2804, <span class="citation" data-id="109079"><a href="/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/">41 L.Ed.2d 495</a></span> (1974).  The freedom of the inmates to receive publications and to read them is at stake.  "It is now well established that the Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas.  'This freedom [of speech and press] ... necessarily protects the right to receive....' "  Stanley v. Georgia, <span class="citation" data-id="107898"><a href="/opinion/107898/stanley-v-georgia/">394 U.S. 557</a></span>, 564, <span class="citation" data-id="107898"><a href="/opinion/107898/stanley-v-georgia/">89 S.Ct. 1243</a></span>, 1247, <span class="citation" data-id="107898"><a href="/opinion/107898/stanley-v-georgia/">22 L.Ed.2d 542</a></span> (1969) (quoting Martin v.

More significantly, however, in this area of the law, the regulation causes a restriction on the First Amendment rights of the publishers of the material, including those publishers who are plaintiffs.    See Procunier v. Martinez, <span class="citation no-link">16 U.S. 396</span>, 409, <span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/">94 S.Ct. 1800</a></span>, 1809, <span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/">40 L.Ed.2d 224</a></span> (1974), and Turner, --- U.S. at ----, <span class="citation" data-id="111904"><a href="/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/">107 S.Ct. at 2259</a></span>.</p>

Martinez dealt with ideas expressed in correspondence (where here the expressions come to the inmate in published material).    Martinez dealt with inter-personal communication between inmates and non-inmates, and emphasized protection of the rights of the non-inmate correspondent in two-way communication (where here the communication is in one direction, and not between individuals;  the right of the non-inmate being to publish and the right of the inmate being to receive and read).  Both Martinez and the case at bar deal with some aspect of the First Amendment rights of a non-inmate, and both deal with the expression of ideas on paper and not with conduct qua expression.  We conclude that the Martinez standards are applicable here.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a></p>

    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p25">
      <span class="num">25</span>
      <p>First, the regulation or practice in question must further an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.  Prison officials may not censor inmate correspondence simply to eliminate unflattering or unwelcome opinions or factually inaccurate statements.  Rather, they must show that a regulation authorizing mail censorship furthers one or more of the substantial governmental interests of security, order, and rehabilitation.  Second, the limitation of First Amendment freedoms must be no greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest involved.  Thus a restriction on inmate correspondence that furthers an important or substantial interest of penal administration will nevertheless be invalid if its sweep is unnecessarily broad.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p28">
      <span class="num">28</span>
      <p>This does not mean, of course, that prison administrators may be required to show with certainty that adverse consequences would flow from the failure to censor a particular letter.  Some latitude in anticipating the probable consequences of allowing certain speech in a prison environment is essential to the proper discharge of an administrator's duty.  But any regulation or practice that restricts inmate correspondence must be generally necessary to protect one or more of the legitimate governmental interests identified above.</p>

When, however, the question involves the entry of people into the prisons for face-to-face communication with inmates, it is obvious that institutional considerations, such as security and related administrative problems, as well as the accepted and legitimate policy objectives of the corrections system itself, require that some limitation be placed on such visitations.  So long as reasonable and effective means of communication remain open and no discrimination in terms of content is involved, we believe that, in drawing such lines, "prison officials must be accorded latitude."</p>

They also are difficult to search effectively.  There is simply no evidence in the record to indicate that MCC officials have exaggerated their response to this security problem and to the administrative difficulties posed by the necessity of carefully inspecting each book mailed from unidentified sources.

Going beyond minimum constitutional requirements, it would follow that the more pointedly the regulation spelled out a requirement of a specific finding, including reasons therefor, that particular rejected material would very probably produce a specifically described breach of security or order or an impairment of rehabilitation in some particular way, the more likely each rejection would be sustained when challenged in court.</p>

      <p class="indent">The regulation before us, however, fails to satisfy the minimum Martinez test.  Although the introductory paragraph of (b) appears at first to limit the Warden's authority to rejecting material "determined detrimental to the security, good order, or discipline of the institution," it goes on to provide:  "or if it might facilitate criminal activity."    "[M]ight facilitate" permits a far looser causal nexus between expression and proscribed conduct than "encourages."    Moreover, the term "detrimental" is susceptible of different meanings and must be interpreted in the light of the fact that the Regulation goes on expressly to authorize rejection of a publication which meets any one of a list of seven criteria, the list being non-exhaustive.</p>

Even assuming that the portion is appropriately rejected under Martinez standards, rejection of the balance is not "generally necessary" to protect the legitimate governmental interest involved in the portion properly rejected.  Defendant Carlson admitted that there is really no reason for not deleting the offending material and turning over the balance to the inmate, although there was testimony by some that in their judgment deleting specific portions would generate more discontent than total rejection.  The district court found that these fears were reasonably founded.  We conclude the finding conflicts with the holding of Martinez that prison administrators have the burden of showing that a restrictive practice is "generally necessary."    <span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/">416 U.S. at 414</a></span>, 94 S.Ct. at 1812.

Chiefly they lack reference to the circumstances in the prison that support the Warden's decision.  At first this is a striking omission, since the Warden's awareness of conditions in his particular facility is the theoretical basis for his wide discretion to reject publications.  Defense witnesses testified, however, that it is unwise to inform inmates of conditions that cause security concerns in the Warden.  Such a policy could expose weaknesses in prison security to exploitation by inmates.  This reasoning the court finds, supports the defendant's practice.</p>

        <p> The complaint, filed in 1973, names as its first defendant Elliot Richardson, individually and as Attorney General of the United States.  Insofar as he was sued in his official capacity, his successors in office from time to time have been automatically substituted by operation of FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 25(d)(1), including the present Attorney General, the Honorable Edwin Meese, III.

        <p>Although in Turner, the Court rejected application of the stricter Martinez standard to regulation of correspondence between inmates, we conclude that it did not overrule or restrict Martinez as applied to situations where the First Amendment rights of non-inmates are involved.</p>
