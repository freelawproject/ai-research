 usiness of The Haines- ... in accordance with the standard form of General- Agency Service Agreement,” id. at p. 5, the court felt itself bound by the decision of this Court in Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines, supra. It relied upon the fact that we expressly distinguished the Hust *787 ease in Caldarola v. Eckert, supra. The Court of Appeals reached this conclusion despite the fact that the injury to Hust occurred prior to the' Clarification Act, and the injury here occurred subsequent to that act.  In its view the Hust case held, as a matter of law, that before the Clarification Act a seaman under the Jones Act could recover for a tort against a service agreement general agent, as an employer.  The court did not perceive how the Clarification Act changed this liability.  169 F.. 2d 4,8.  I.  We are impelled to the conclusion that the Clarification Act affords no basis for distinguishing the present case from the Hust case and that the reasoning in the later Caldarola case, which we accept as sound, calls for the rejection of the basis of the Hust case. The Hust case went on the theory that the general agents for the United States under the same standard service agreement were employers of the injured seaman, Hust, for the purposes of liability under the Jones Act.  6 The general agent was found to be liable to the seaman by two steps of reasoning: first, that the overruling of Fleet Corporation v. Lustgarten, 280 U. S. 320 , by Brady v. Roosevelt S. S. Co., <citedDecision>317 U. S. 575</citedDecision> , gave a seaman a right tó sue undér the Jones Act such general agents as were employed under Contracts like Moore-McCormack’s for torts committed against seamen by masters and crew, 328 U. S. 716 -722; second, that although “technically the agree *788 ment made Hust an employee of the United States,” p. 723, the “rules of private agency,” p. 724, should not be applied to take away “protections” from seamen.  See 332 U. S. 165 -166 7 This second step was said to find support in the election given to seamen by § 1 of the Clarification Act to proceed under the new Act for claims arising after October 1,1941, and before the enactment of the Clarification Act, March 24, 1943.  328 U. S. at 725 , et seq. 8 *789 As to the first conclusion, we think it arises from a misconception of the ruling of the <citedDecision>Brady</citedDecision> case. The <citedDecision>Brady</citedDecision> case decided no more, directly or by implication, than that an action could be maintained against agents of the United States at common law for the agents’ own torts.  The case did not involve the right to recover against employers under the Jones Act.  Brady was a customs inspector suing for injuries sustained when a ship’s ladder broke.  The opinion said, <citedDecision>317 U. S. at 577</citedDecision> , “The sole question here is whether the Suits in Admiralty Act makes private operators such as respondent nonsuable for their torts.” 9 Cf. Caldarola v. Eckert, 332 U. S. at 159-160 .  As to the second conclusion, we are unable to perceive in the statutes relating to sailors’ rights or the history *790 behind their enactment any legislative purpose to create in seamen employees of the United States through the War Shipping Administration a right to enforce tort claims under the Jones Act against others than their employers or any recognition that such right ever existed.  The Jones Act was welfare legislation that created new rights in seamen for damages arising from maritime torts.  As welfare legislation, this statute is entitled to a liberal construction to accomplish its beneficent purposes.  Compare Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 318 U. S. 724 ; American Stevedores v. Porello, 330 U. S. 446 .  In considering similar legislation in other fields, we have concluded that Congress intended that the purposes of such enactments should not be restricted by common-law concepts of control so as to bar from welfare legislation as independent contractors persons who were as a matter of economic reality a part of the processes and dependent upon the businesses to which they rendered service.  10 The issue in this case is whether a construction- of the Jones Act carrying out the 'intention of Congress to grant those nety rights to seamen against their employers requires or permits a holding that the general agent under the contract here in question is an employer undér the Jones Act.
**Combined Opinion**
 12 The seaman’s substantive rights are the same whoever is the employer.  Under the Jones Act, his remedy permits him to demand a jury trial. If the Government is the employer, his remedy is in admiralty' Without.  a jury.  See the excerpt from the' House Report, p. 792, infra.  It was said in Hust that the election of remedies granted seamen injured between October 1, 1941, and the effective date of the Clarification Act, March 24, 1943, indicated that a seaman had broader rights before the Clarification Act than he did after.  328 U. S.- at 725, Part III. The suggestion was that Congress could not have intended to restrict suits against general agents.  This statement springs from the Court’s then understanding of the <citedDecision>Brady</citedDecision> case, which we have heretofore considered.  The reason for the election given by the Clarification Act was quite different.  It was to give seamen employees of the United States through the War Shipping Administration on public vessels or foreign-flag vessels or otherwise *792 an election to employ the means for redress theretofore possessed by them, such as those mentioned in § 1 of the Clarification Act, note 8, supra, or to enjoy the same rights as similar employees on merchant vessels.  13 Nothing has been presented to us from the Act or from its legislative history indicative of congressional purpose to do anything other than to extend existing rights of merchant seamen to all seamen employed through the War Shipping Administration.  This was specifically declared in H. R. Rep. No. 107, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 21: “The various rights and remedies under statute and general maritime law with respect to death, injury, illness, and other casualty to seamen, have been rather fully set forth hereinabove.  Under clause 2 of section 1 (a) these substantive rights would be governed by existing law relating to privately employed seamen.  The only modification thereof arises from the remedial provision that they shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act.
**Combined Opinion**
 Any claim referred to in clause (2) or (3) hereof shall, if administratively disallowed in whole or in part, be enforced pursuant to the provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act, notwithstanding the vessel on which the seaman is employed is not a merchant vessel within the meaning of such Act.  Any claim, right, or cause of action of or in respect of any such seaman accruing on or after October 1, 1941, and prior to the date of enactment of this section may be enforced, and upon the election of the seaman or his surviving dependent or beneficiary, or his legal representative to do so shall be governed, as if this section had been in effect when such claim, right, or cause of action accrued, such election to be made in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Administrator, War Shipping Administration.  Rights of any seaman under the Social Security Act, as amended by subsection (b) (2) and (3), .and claims therefor shall be governed solely by the provisions of such Act, so amended.  When used in this subsection the term ‘administratively disallowed’ means a denial of a written claim'in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed by the Administrator, War Shipping Administration.  .  .  .” 9 See the discussion of the <citedDecision>Brady</citedDecision> case at 328 U. S. 745 -47.  10 Newsboys, Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U. S. 111, 120, 128-31 ; unloaders of coal cars, United States v. Silk, 331 U. S. 704, 713 ; meat boners, Rutherford Food Corp. v. McComb, 331 U. S. 722 .  11 But compare Robinson v. Baltimore & L. O. R. Co., 237 U. S. 84 , 94: “We are of the opinion that Congress used the words ‘employé’ and ‘employed’ in the statute in their natural sense, and intended to describe the conventional relation , of employer and employe.” Hull v. Philadelphia & Reading R. Co., 252 U. S. 475 .  12 It is much the same type of problem as was presented in Bartels v. Birmingham, 332 U. S. 126 .  There we concluded that the leader and organizer of a traveling orchestra was the employer of the band members rather than the various dance hall proprietors for whom the orchestra performed.  13 Eor a full discussion see the dissent in Hust v.
