 The Commission dismissed the complaint on the ground that the rules were within the carriers’ authority to make conditions for the acceptance of private cars.  Procter & Gamble then petitioned the Commerce Court to annul the Commission’s action and to enjoin the carriers from enforcing the rules.  The Commerce Court took jurisdiction' but found the Commission’s action to be within its authority.  On appeal this Court held that the Com *136 merce Court erred in taking jurisdiction and remanded the cause for dismissal.  Clearly Procter & Gamble was authorized under § 13 of the Act to Regulate Commerce to institute the proceedings before the Commission.  Since it asserted a legal right under that Act to have the Commission apply different principles of law from those which led the Commission to dismiss.the complaint, the ingredients for an adjudication — constituting a case or controversy — were present.  Compare Interstate Commerce Comm’n v. Brimson, supra; Interstate Commerce Comm’n v. Baird, <citedDecision>194 U. S. 25, 38</citedDecision> .  Judicial relief would be precisely the same as in the recognized instances of review by courts of Commission action: if the legal principles on which the Commission acted were not erroneous, the bill would be ordered dismissed; if the Commission was found to'have proceeded on erroneous legal principles, the Commission would be ordered to proceed within the framework of its own discretionary authority on the, indicated correct principles.  The requisites of equity have of course to be satisfied, but by the conventional criteria.  They were satisfied in the Procter & Gamble case, since the bill sought to avoid a multiplicity of.  suits.  Finally, the shipper was within the express language of Congress authorizing suits “to enjoin, set aside, annul, .  .

 An action before the Interstate Commerce Commission is akin to an inclusive equity suit in which all relevant claims are adjusted.  28 An order of the Commission dismissing a complaint on the merits and maintaining the status quo is an exercise of administrative function, no more and no less, than an order directing some change in status.  The nature of the issues foreclosed by the Commission’s action and the nature of the issues left open, so far as the reviewing power of courts is concerned, are the same.  Refusal to change an existing situation may, of course, itself be a factor in the Commission’s allowable exercise of discretion.  In the application of relevant canons of judicial review an order of the Commission directing the adoption of a practice might raise considerations absent from a situation where the Commission merely allowed such a practice to continue.  But this bears on the disposition of a case and should not control jurisdiction.  The nature of judicial relief, that is the *143 form of directions available, in situations like those presented by the Procter & Gamble and the Lehigh Valley cases, were the Commission’s orders reviewed, would be' no different than was that used in the Intermountain Rate and the New River Coal Co. cases. 29 In both types of situations “a judgment rendered will be a final and indisputable basis of action as between the Commission and the defendant,” Interstate Commerce Comm’n v. Baird, <citedDecision>194 U. S. 25, 38</citedDecision> .  We conclude, therefore, that any distinction, as such, between “negative” and “affirmative” orders, as a touchstone of jurisdiction to review the Commission’s orders, serves no useful purpose, and insofar as earlier decisions have been controlled by this distinction, they can nc> longer be guiding.  The order of the Communications Commission in this case was therefore reviewable.  It was not a mere abstract declaration regarding the status of the Rochester under the Communications Act, 30 nor was it a stage in an incomplete process of administrative .adjudication.  The *144 contested order determining the status of the Rochester necessarily' and immediately carried direction of obedience to previously formulated mandatory orders addressed generally to all carriers amenable to the Commission’s authority.  Into this class of carriers the order under dispute covered the Rochester, and by that fact, in conjunction with the other orders, made determination of the status of the Rochester a reviewable order of the Commission.  But while the Rochester had a right to challenge the order, it cannot pre/vajj.

 It is not too much to say that Chief Justice White in construing the measure and its great amendments has had more to do with placing this vital part of our practical govern *138 ment on a useful basis than any other judge. His -opinions in the case of the Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. The Abilene Cotton Oil Co., and the cases which followed, it, are model's of clear and satisfactory reasoning which gave to the people, to state- legislatures, to Congress, and the courts a much-needed knowledge of the practical functions the Commerce Commission was to discharge, and of how they were to be reconciled to existing governmental machinery, for the vindication of the rights of the public in respect of national transportation.  They are a conspicuous instance of his unusual and remarkable power and facility in statesmanlike interpretation of statute law.” Proceedings on the Death of Chief Justice White, 257 U.

United States, 246 U.

In part this may have been on the theory that the issue of the divisions was not properly before the Commission.  See 246 U. S. at 482-483 .
