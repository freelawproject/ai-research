**Lead Opinion**
 where the court refuses to grant such relief by reason of a finding by the court that a divorce .  .  .  declaring the marriage a nullity had previously been granted to the husband in an action in which jurisdiction over the person of the wife was not obtained, the court may, nevertheless, render in the same action such judgment as justice may require for the maintenance of the wife.” Gilbert-Bliss’ N. Y. Civ. Prac., Vol. 6A, 1956 Cum. Supp., § 1170-b.  The petition for certiorari also raised a number of other contentions.  We have considered them and find that they do not justify reversing the decision below.  Pennoyer v. Neff, <citedDecision>95 U. S. 714, 726-727</citedDecision> .  If a defendant has property in a State it can adjudicate his obligations, but only to *419 the extent of his interest in that property.  Pennington v. Fourth Natl. Bank of Cincinnati, 243 U. S. 269 ; Harris v. Balk, 198 U. S. 215 .  A concurring opinion in Armstrong v. Armstrong, 350 U. S. 568, 575 , and the authorities collected there, set forth in greater detail the reasons underlying this holding.  Cf. Meredith v. Meredith, 96 U. S. App. D. C. 355, 226 F. 2d 257 , 69 Harv. L. Rev. 1497 .  “A state lacks judicial jurisdiction to absolve a spouse from any duty of support which, under the law of a second state, he may owe the other spouse in the absence of personal jurisdiction over the latter.” Restatement, Conflict of Laws, § 116 (2) (Tent.  Draft No. 1, 1953), and see Comment f to § 116.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting.  The Court holds today, as I understand its opinion, that Nevada, lacking personal jurisdiction over Mrs. Vanderbilt, had no power to adjudicate the question of support, and that any divorce decree purporting so to do is to that extent wholly void — presumably in Nevada as well as in New York — under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, pursuant to the doctrine of Pennoyer v. Neff, <citedDecision>95 U. S. 714</citedDecision> .  I cannot agree with such a holding.  In the first place, as I see this case, there is no necessity to pass on this question at all. Our problem should be, initially at least, not whether this decree, insofar as it affects property, is “void” for lack of due process, but whether it binds New York *429 under the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  In other words, we need not, in the first instance, decide what the Due Process Clause forbids Nevada to do, but merely what the Full Faith and Credit Clause compels New York to do.  One of the wisest of our constitutional commentators has warned us to beware the “constricting necessitari-anism” of deeming the two questions to be one and the same: “In a problem so fraught with infelicities whatever mediation is devised, there is wisdom in confining pronouncements closely to what is imperative in the particular case. It is not logically necessary to deny Nevada’s mastery within her own boundaries in order to deny her power of projection beyond them.  Freedom of home manufacture and consumption does not necessarily entail freedom of export.  Only if it is inexorable that what is meant by ‘jurisdiction’ must be either wholly absent or wholly unlimited need frailty in sister states be conditioned on total impotence at home.” T. R. Powell, And Repent at Leisure, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 930 , 936.
