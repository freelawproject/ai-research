**Combined Opinion**
[29] The bitterness of war did not cause Congress here to neglect the requirements of the Constitution; for it was urged in both Houses that ยง 21 as written was ex post facto, and thus was constitutionally *281 impermissible. [30] Significantly, however, it was never suggested in either debate that expatriation without a citizen's consent lay beyond Congress' authority. Members of both Houses had apparently examined intensively the section's constitutional validity, and yet had been undisturbed by the matters upon which the Court now relies. Some doubt, based on the phrase "rights of citizenship," has since been expressed [31] that ยง 21 was intended to require any more than disfranchisement, but this is, for several reasons, unconvincing. First, ยง 21 also explicitly provided that persons subject to its provisions should not thereafter exercise various "rights of citizens"; [32] if the section had not been intended to cause expatriation, it is difficult to see why these additional provisions would have been thought necessary. Second, the executive authorities of the United States afterwards consistently construed the section as causing expatriation. [33] Third, the section was apparently understood by various courts to result in expatriation; in particular, Mr. Justice Strong, while a member of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, construed the section to cause a "forfeiture of citizenship," Huber v. Reily, 53 Pa. 112 , 118, and although this point was not expressly reached, his general understanding of the statute was approved by this Court in Kurtz v. Moffitt, <targetCase>115 U. S. 487</targetCase> , 501. Finally, Congress in 1867 approved an exemption from the section's provisions for those who had deserted after the termination of general hostilities, and the statute as adopted specifically described the disability from which exemption was given as a "loss of his citizenship." *282 15 Stat. 14 . The same choice of phrase occurs in the pertinent debates. [34] It thus appears that Congress had twice, immediately before its passage of the Fourteenth Amendment, unequivocally affirmed its belief that it had authority to expatriate an unwilling citizen. The pertinent evidence for the period prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment can therefore be summarized as follows.

14 (1867). In combination, this evidence again suggests that the Citizenship Clause was expected merely to declare to whom citizenship initially attaches, and to overturn the doctrine of primary state citizenship. [49] Senator Hendricks, for example, lamented its unfairness, declared that its presence was an "embarrassment" to the country, and asserted that it "is not required any longer." Cong. Globe, 40th Cong., 1st Sess., 660-661. [50] Similarly, in 1885, this Court construed ยง 21 without any apparent indication that the section was, or had ever been thought to be, beyond Congress' authority. Kurtz v. Moffitt, <targetCase>115 U. S. 487</targetCase> , 501-502. [51] Tsiang, supra, n. 3, at 95.
