 That section provides: “Any person, firm, city, village, municipal corporation or any other entity intending to withdraw ground water from any well or pit located in the State of Nebraska and transport it for use in an adjoining state shall apply to the Department of Water Resources for a permit to do so. If the Director of Water Resources finds that the withdrawal of the ground water requested is reasonable, is not contrary to the conservation and use of ground water, and is not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare, he shall grant the permit if the state in which the water is to be used grants reciprocal rights to withdraw and transport ground water from that state for use in the State of Nebraska.” Appellee brought this action to enjoin appellants from transferring the water across the border without a permit.  2 The trial court rejected the defense that the statute imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce and granted the injunction.  The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed.  208 Neb. 703 , 305 N. W. 2d 614 (1981).  It held that, under Nebraska law, ground water is not “a market item freely transferable for value among private parties, and therefore [is] not an article of commerce.” Id., at 705 , 305 N. W. 2d, at *945 616 .  3 The Chief Justice, while agreeing that the statutory criteria governing the transfer of water to an adjoining State did not violate the Commerce Clause, dissented on the narrow ground that appellee violated both the Federal and Nebraska Constitutions by attempting “to absolutely prohibit the transfer of water, without regard to its need or availability, based solely upon the acts of another state oyer which citizens of this state have no control.” Id., at 713 , 305 N. W. 2d, at 620 .  I In holding that ground water is not an article of commerce, the Nebraska Supreme Court and appellee cite as controlling precedent Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 349</citedDecision> (1908).  In that case a New Jersey statute prohibited the interstate transfer of any surface water located within the State.  4 The Hudson County Water Co. nevertheless contracted with New York City to supply one of its boroughs with water from the Passaic River in New Jersey.  The State Attorney General sought from the New Jersey courts an injunction against fulfillment of the contract.  Over the water company’s objections that the statute impaired the obligation of contract, took property without just compensation, interfered with interstate commerce, denied New York citizens the privileges afforded New Jersey citizens, and denied New York citizens the equal protection of the laws, the injunction was granted.  This Court, in an opinion by Justice Holmes, affirmed.  *946 Most of the Court’s opinion addresses the just compensation claim.  Justice Holmes refused to ground the Court’s holding, as did the New Jersey state courts, 5 on “the more or less attenuated residuum of title that the State may be said to possess.” Id,., at 355.  For the statute was justified as a regulatory measure that, on balance, did not amount to a taking of property that required just compensation.  Putting aside the “problems of irrigation,” the State’s interest in preserving its waters was well within its police power.  6 That interest was not dependent on any demonstration that the State’s water resources were inadequate for present or future use.  The State “finds itself in possession of what all admit to be a great public good, and what it has it may keep and give no one a reason for its will.” <citedDecision>Id., at 357</citedDecision> .  Having disposed of the just compensation claim, Justice Holmes turned very briefly to the other constitutional chal *947 lenges.  In one paragraph, he rejected the Contract Clause claim.  In the remaining paragraph of the opinion, he rejected all the other defenses.  His treatment of the Commerce Clause challenge consists of three sentences: “A man cannot acquire a right to property by his desire to use it in commerce among the States.  Neither can he enlarge his otherwise limited and qualified right to the same end.  The case is covered in this respect by Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 [(1896)].” Ibid. While appellee relies upon Hudson County, appellants rest on our summary affirmance of a three-judge District Court judgment in City of Altus v. Carr, 255 F. Supp. 828 (WD Tex.), summarily aff’d, 385 U. S. 35 (1966).

 It consequently obtained from the owners of land in an adjoining Texas county the contractual right to pump the ground water underlying that land and to transport it across the border.  The Texas Legislature thereafter enacted a statute that forbade the interstate exportation of ground water without the approval of that body.  7 The city filed suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the statute violated the Commerce Clause.  The city relied upon West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State, 8 and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923), which invalidated a West Virginia statute *948 that accorded a preference to the citizens of that State in the purchase of natural gas produced therein.  9 The Texas Attorney General defended the statute on two grounds.  First, he asserted that its purpose was to conserve and protect the State’s water resources by regulating the withdrawal of ground water.  The District Court rejected that defense because similar conservation claims had met defeat in West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., supra, and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, supra. 10 Second, the State argued that the statute regulated ground water and that ground water is not an article of commerce, citing Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 (1896), and Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 349</citedDecision> (1908).  The court rejected this argument since the statute directly regulated the interstate transportation of *949 water that had been pumped from the ground, and under Texas law such water was an article of commerce.  The court then had little difficulty in concluding that the statute imposed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.  11 In summarily affirming the District Court in City of Altus, we did not necessarily adopt the court’s reasoning.  Our affirmance indicates only our agreement with the result reached by the District Court. Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 499 (1981).  That result is not necessarily inconsistent with the Nebraska Supreme Court’s holding in this case. For Texas law differs significantly from Nebraska law regarding the rights of a surface owner to ground water that he has withdrawn.  According to the District Court in City ofAltus, the “rule in Texas was that an owner of land could use all of the percolating water he could capture from the wells on his land for whatever beneficial purposes he needed it, on or off the land, and could likewise sell it to others for use on or off the land and outside the basin where produced, just as he could sell any other species of property.” 255 F. Supp., at 833, n. 8 .

 Article I, §8, cl. 3, of the United States Constitution provides: “The Congress shall have Power ... To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” For general explanations of Commerce Clause analysis, see, e. g., Western & Southern Life Insurance Co. v. State Board of Equalization, 451 U. S. 648, 652-653 (1981); Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761, 766-770 (1945).  Because of the reciprocity requirement of § 46-613.01, appellants would not have been granted a permit had they applied for one.  Their failure to submit an application therefore does not deprive them of standing to challenge the legality of the reciprocity requirement.  Cf. Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228 (1982).  The Nebraska Supreme Court also rejected appellants’ equal protection and due process challenges.  Appellants renew those challenges before this Court, but we need not reach these issues in light of our disposition of the Commerce Clause claim.  The Court quoted the statute: “ ‘It shall be unlawful for any person or corporation to transport or carry, through pipes, conduits, ditches or canals, the waters of any fresh water lake, pond, brook, creek, river or stream of this State into any other State, for use therein.’ ” <citedDecision>209 U. S., at 353</citedDecision> .  “The Courts below assumed or decided and we shall assume that the defendant represents the rights of a riparian proprietor, and on the other hand, that it represents no special chartered powers that give it greater rights than those.  On these assumptions the Court of Errors and Appeals pointed out that a riparian proprietor has no right to divert waters for more than a reasonable distance from the body of the stream or for other than the well-known ordinary uses, and that for any purpose anywhere he is narrowly limited in amount.  It went on to infer that his only right in the body of the stream is to have the flow continue, and that there is a residuum of public ownership in the State.  It reinforced the State’s rights by the State’s title to the bed of the stream where flowed-by the tide, and concluded from the foregoing and other considerations that, as against the rights of riparian owners merely as such, the State was warranted in prohibiting the acquisition of the title to water on a larger scale.” <citedDecision>Id., at 354</citedDecision> .  “The problems of irrigation have no place here.  Leaving them on one side, it appears to us that few public interests are more obvious, indisputable and independent of particular theory than the interest of the public of a State to maintain the rivers that are wholly within it substantially undiminished, except by such drafts upon them as the guardian of the public welfare may permit for the purpose of turning them to a more perfect use.” <citedDecision>Id., at 356</citedDecision> .  The District Court quoted the statute: ‘“No one shall withdraw water from any underground source in this State for use in any other state by drilling a well in Texas and transporting the water outside the boundaries of the State unless the same be specifically authorized by an Act of the Texas Legislature and thereafter as approved by it.’” 255 F. Supp., at 830 .  Justiee Holmes, the author of the Court’s opinion in Hudson County, noted his dissent.  See 221 U. S., at 262 .  Justice Holmes dissented, expressing the view that the Court’s decision was inconsistent with Hudson County.  See 262 U. S., at 603 .  The District Court opinion, 255 F. Supp., at 839 , included these quotations from the two cases: “The statute of Oklahoma recognizes [natural gas] to be a subject of intrastate commerce, but seeks to prohibit it from being the subject of interstate commerce, and this is the purpose of its conservation.
