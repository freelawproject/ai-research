**Combined Opinion**
The deceased was a United States customs inspector. While boarding the vessel on his official duties in July 1938, a rung of the ladder which he was climbing broke. The injuries which resulted caused his death. At the time of the injury the vessel was docked at a pier in New York City. *577 Petitioner, the widow, sued as administratrix to recover damages for the benefit of herself and the children. That suit was brought in the New York Supreme Court but removed to the federal District Court. Respondent moved to dismiss on the authority of Johnson v. Emergency Fleet Corp., <targetCase>280 U.S. 320</targetCase> . That motion was denied and a trial to a jury on the law side of the court was had. A verdict for petitioner was returned. On appeal the judgment was reversed with directions to dismiss the complaint, one judge dissenting. The Circuit Court of Appeals stated in reaching that result that the Suits in Admiralty Act ( 41 Stat. 525 , 46 U.S.C. §§ 741 , 742) as construed by the decision in the <targetCase>Johnson</targetCase> case made the remedies afforded by that Act the exclusive ones, viz. a libel in personam against the United States or the Maritime Commission. 128 F.2d 169 . We granted the petition for a writ of certiorari because of the public importance of the problem. We agree with the court below that this was a maritime tort over which the admiralty court has jurisdiction. Vancouver S.S. Co. v. Rice, 288 U.S. 445 ; The Admiral Peoples, 295 U.S. 649 . And we may assume that petitioner could have sued either the United States or the Commission under the Suits in Admiralty Act. In any event, such a suit would be the exclusive remedy in admiralty against either of them. Eastern Transportation Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 675 ; Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Rosenberg Bros. & Co., 276 U.S. 202 . And it is likewise clear that the action in admiralty afforded by § 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act is the only available remedy against the United States or a corporation whose entire outstanding capital stock is owned by the United States or its representatives. <targetCase>Johnson</targetCase> v. Emergency Fleet Corp., supra . The sole question here is whether the Suits in Admiralty Act makes private operators such as respondent non-suable for their torts. *578 Emergency Fleet Corp. v. Lustgarten, <targetCase>280 U.S. 320</targetCase> , one of the three companion cases to the <targetCase>Johnson</targetCase> case, supports the view that it does. In that case a merchant vessel, Coelleda, was owned by the United States and operated for it by the Consolidated Navigation Co. pursuant to a contract made through the Fleet Corporation. A seaman employed thereon sued the Fleet Corporation and the Consolidated Navigation Co. to recover damages for personal injuries sustained in that service. There was a judgment for the plaintiff which was affirmed on appeal. This Court reversed and remanded the cause with directions to dismiss. The <targetCase>Johnson</targetCase> case and the other two companion cases were suits against the Fleet Corporation or the United States. In one opinion dealing with all four cases, this Court said: "Directly or mediately, the money required to pay a judgment against any of the defendants in these cases would come out of the United States. It is the real party affected in all of these actions." 280 U.S. pp. 326-327. It added that the aim of uniformity would not be established "if suits under the Tucker Act and in the Court of Claims be allowed against the United States and actions at law in state and federal courts be permitted against the Fleet Corporation or other agents for enforcement of the maritime causes of action covered by the Act." p. 327. Accordingly it concluded that "the remedies given by the Act are exclusive in all cases where a libel might be filed under it." p. 327. These statements, coupled with the fact that the judgment in the <targetCase>Lustgarten</targetCase> case was reversed not only as respects the Fleet Corporation but the Consolidated Navigation Co. as well, support the view adopted by the court below. Our conclusion, however, is that that position is untenable and that the <targetCase>Lustgarten</targetCase> case so far as it would prevent a private operator from being sued under the circumstances of this case must be considered as no longer controlling. *579 There is ample support for the holding in the <targetCase>Johnson</targetCase> case that § 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act was intended to provide the only available remedy against the United States or its wholly owned corporations for enforcement of maritime causes of action covered by the Act. But there is not the slightest intimation or suggestion in the history of that Act that it was designed to abolish all remedies which might exist against a private company for torts committed during its operation of government vessels under agency agreements. Sec. 1 of the Suits in Admiralty Act provides that no vessel owned by the United States or a governmental corporation or "operated by or for the United States, or such corporation" shall be "subject to arrest or seizure by judicial process in the United States or its possessions." That section was designed to avoid the inconvenience, expense and delay resulting from the holdings in The Florence H., 248 F. 1012 , and The Lake Monroe, 250 U.S. 246 , that libel in rem would lie against vessels owned by the United States. See S. Rep. No. 223, 66th Cong., 1st Sess.
**Combined Opinion**
Would this bill apply to Shipping Board vessels that are allocated to private concerns and are being operated by private concerns? Mr. Volstead: Yes; it covers all ships owned by *582 the Government." The reply was accurate. The Act does cover government ships operated by private concerns. For as we have seen § 1 is applicable to that situation as well as to others and takes away the remedy of a libel in rem. But it is a non sequitur to say that because the Act takes away the remedy of libel in rem in all cases involving government vessels and restricts the remedies against the United States and its wholly owned corporations, it must be presumed to have abolished all right to proceed against all other parties. Congress in fashioning § 2 of the Act, like this Court in interpreting it in the <targetCase>Johnson</targetCase> case, was preoccupied with suits against the United States and its wholly owned corporations. Since it dealt under § 2 only with libels in personam against them, the only fair assumption is that it left all personal actions against others wholly unaffected. It is contended, however, that if the judgment against respondent stands, the United States ultimately will have to pay it by reason of provisions of the contract between respondent and the Commission. It is therefore urged that the United States is the real party in interest. We do not stop to interpret the contract. Even if we assume, without deciding, that the Commission has contracted to reimburse the respondent for such expenditures, it does not affect the result in this case. The right of the private operator to recover over from the United States would be a matter of favor, not of right, in many cases.
