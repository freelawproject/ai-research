 Braden thus may find himself ensnared in what has aptly been termed `Catch 2254'unable to vindicate his constitutional rights in either of the only two states that could possibly afford a remedy.  See Tuttle, Catch 2254: Federal Jurisdiction and Interstate Detainers, 32 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 489 , 502-03 (1971)." 454 F. 2d, at 146-147 .  II We granted certiorari to resolve a sharp conflict among the federal courts [2] on the choice of forum where a prisoner attacks an interstate detainer on federal habeas corpus.  Before turning to that question, we must make clear that petitioner is entitled to raise his speedy trial claim on federal habeas corpus at this time.  First, he is currently "in custody" within the meaning of the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U. S. C. § 2241 (c) (3).  Prior to our decision in Peyton v. Rowe, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 54</citedDecision> (1968), the "prematurity doctrine" of McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934), would, of course, have barred his petition for relief.  [3] But our decision in <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Rowe</citedDecision> discarded the prematurity doctrine, which had permitted *489 a prisoner to attack on habeas corpus only his current confinement, and not confinement that would be imposed in the future, and opened the door to this action.  [4] Second, petitioner has exhausted all available state remedies as a prelude to this action.  It is true, of course, that he has not yet been tried on the Kentucky indictment, and he can assert a speedy trial defense when, and if, he is finally brought to trial. It is also true, as our Brother REHNQUIST points out in dissent, that federal habeas corpus does not lie, absent "special circumstances," to adjudicate the merits of an affirmative defense to a state criminal charge prior to a judgment of conviction by a state court. Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 253 (1886).  Petitioner does not, however, seek at this time to litigate a federal defense to a criminal charge, but only *490 to demand enforcement of the Commonwealth's affirmative constitutional obligation to bring him promptly to trial. Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969).  He has made repeated demands for trial to the courts of Kentucky, offering those courts an opportunity to consider on the merits his constitutional claim of the present denial of a speedy trial. Under these circumstances it is clear that he has exhausted all available state court remedies for consideration of that constitutional claim, even though Kentucky has not yet brought him to trial. The exhaustion doctrine is a judicially crafted instrument which reflects a careful balance between important interests of federalism and the need to preserve the writ of habeas corpus as a "swift and imperative remedy in all cases of illegal restraint or confinement." Secretary of State for Home Affairs v. O'Brien, [1923] A. C. 603, 609 (H. L.).  It cannot be used as a blunderbuss to shatter the attempt at litigation of constitutional claims without regard to the purposes that underlie the doctrine and that called it into existence.
**Combined Opinion**
 Moreover, petitioner made no effort to abort a state proceeding or to disrupt the orderly functioning of state judicial processes.  He comes to federal court, not in an effort to forestall a state prosecution, but to enforce the Commonwealth's obligation to provide him with a state court forum.  He delayed his application for federal relief until the state courts had conclusively determined that his prosecution was temporarily moribund.  Since petitioner began serving the second of two 10-year Alabama sentences in March 1972, the revival of the prosecution may be delayed until as late as 1982.  A federal habeas corpus action at this time and under these circumstances *492 does not jeopardize any legitimate interest of federalism.  [5] Respondent apparently shares that view since it specifically concedes that petitioner has exhausted all available state remedies, Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.  In the case before us, the Court of Appeals heldnot surprisingly, in view of the considerations discussed abovethat even though petitioner had chosen the wrong forum, his speedy trial claim was one "which he is legally entitled to assert at this time under Peyton v. Rowe, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 54</citedDecision> (1968)." 454 F. 2d, at 146 .  And the District Court, which upheld on the merits petitioner's speedy *493 trial claim, necessarily adopted that view.  Indeed, the great majority of lower federal courts which have considered the question since Smith v. Hooey, supra , have reached this same, and indisputably correct, conclusion.  [6] We emphasize that nothing we have said would permit the derailment of a pending state proceeding by an attempt to litigate constitutional defenses prematurely in federal court. The contention in dissent that our decision converts federal habeas corpus into "a pretrial-motion forum for state prisoners," wholly misapprehends today's holding.  III Accordingly, we turn to the determination of the forum in which the petition for habeas corpus should be brought.  In terms of traditional venue considerations, the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky is almost surely the most desirable forum for the adjudication of the claim.
**Combined Opinion**
 28 U. S. C. § 2243 .  See also United States v. Hayman, 342 U. S. 205, 222-223 (1952).  [14] This Court, too, has undercut some of the premises of the Ahrens decision.  Where American citizens confined overseas (and thus outside the territory of any district court) have sought relief in habeas corpus, we have held, if only implicitly, that the petitioners' absence from the district does not present a jurisdictional obstacle to the consideration of the claim.  Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137 (1953), rehearing denied, 346 U. S. 844, 851-852 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); cf. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11 (1955); Hirota v. MacArthur, 338 U. S. 197 , 199 (1948) (DOUGLAS, J., concurring (1949)).  A further, critical development since our decision in Ahrens is the emergence of new classes of prisoners who are able to petition for habeas corpus because of the adoption of a more expansive definition of the "custody" requirement of the habeas statute.  See Peyton v. Rowe, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 54</citedDecision> (1968); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234 (1968); Jones v. Cunningham 371 U. S. 236 (1963).  The overruling of McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934), made it possible for prisoners in custody under one sentence to attack a sentence which they had not yet begun to serve.  And it also enabled a petitioner held in one State to attack a detainer lodged against him by another State.  In such a case, the State holding the prisoner in immediate confinement acts as agent for the demanding *499 State, [15] and the custodian State is presumably indifferent to the resolution of prisoner's attack on the detainer.  Here, for example, the petitioner is confined in Alabama, but his dispute is with the Commonwealth of Kentucky, not the State of Alabama.  Under these circumstances it would serve no useful purpose to apply the Ahrens rule and require that the action be brought in Alabama.  In fact, a slavish application of the rule would jar with the very purpose underlying the addition of the phrase, "within their respective jurisdictions."
**Combined Opinion**
 Since the petitioner's absence from the Western District of Kentucky did not deprive the court of jurisdiction, and since the respondent was properly served in that district, see Strait v. Laird, 406 U. S. 341 (1972); Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U. S. 487 (1971), the court below erred in ordering the dismissal of the petition on jurisdictional grounds.  The judgment of the Court of *501 Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Reversed and remanded.  MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, concurring in the result.  I concur in the result.  The conclusion the Court reaches is not unexpected when one notes the extraordinary expansion of the concept of habeas corpus effected in recent years.  See Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S. 546 (1941); Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283 (1944); Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963); Peyton v. Rowe, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 54</citedDecision> (1968); Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234 (1968); Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224 (1970).  Cf. Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U. S. 487 (1971).  A trend of this kind, once begun, easily assumes startling proportions.  The present case is but one more step, with the Alabama warden now made the agent of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  I do not go so far as to say that on the facts of this case the result is necessarily wrong.  I merely point out that we have come a long way from the traditional notions of the Great Writ.  The common-law scholars of the past hardly would recognize what the Court has developed, see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *131-134, and they would, I suspect, conclude that it is not for the better.
**Combined Opinion**
 Furthermore, the petitioner is free to assert his speedy trial claim in the Kentucky courts if and when he is brought to trial there.  *502 And the claim, already strong on the facts here, increases in strength as time goes by.  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE POWELL concur, dissenting.  Today the Court overrules Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188 (1948), which construed the legislative intent of Congress in enacting the lineal predecessor of 28 U. S. C. § 2241 .  Although considerations of "convenience" may support the result reached in this case, those considerations are, in this context, appropriate for Congress, not this Court, to make.  Congress has not legislatively overruled Ahrens , and subsequent "developments" are simply irrelevant to the judicial task of ascertaining the legislative intent of Congress in providing, in 1867, that federal district courts may issue writs of habeas corpus "within their respective jurisdictions" for prisoners in the custody of state authorities.  The Court, however, not only accomplishes a feat of judicial prestidigitation but, without discussion or analysis, explicitly extends the scope of Peyton v. Rowe, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 54</citedDecision> (1968), and implicitly rejects Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886).  I In order to appreciate the full impact of the Court's decision, a brief reiteration of the procedural stance of the case at the time the petition for habeas corpus was filed is necessary.  Petitioner is incarcerated in Alabama pursuant to a state court judgment, the validity of which petitioner does not attack.  Petitioner had been indicted in Kentucky and a detainer filed by Kentucky authorities with the Alabama authorities.  Kentucky had conducted no proceedings against petitioner; no judgment of conviction on the Kentucky indictment had been obtained.  From Alabama, petitioner requested Kentucky authorities to ask the Alabama authorities to deliver *503 him to Kentucky so that petitioner could be tried on the Kentucky indictment.  No action was taken on this request, and the Kentucky Supreme Court refused to issue a writ of mandamus requiring Kentucky authorities to request that Alabama deliver petitioner for trial in Kentucky.  Petitioner then filed the instant habeas corpus proceeding in Kentucky, contending that he was "in custody" of Kentucky authorities and that the "custody" was illegal because he had been denied his right to a speedy trial. Petitioner is not seeking to attack collaterally a state judgment of conviction in federal court. In substance, petitioner is seeking, prior to trial, to force the Commonwealth of Kentucky to litigate a question that otherwise could only be raised as an absolute defense in a state criminal proceeding against petitioner.  II The first inquiry is whether a state prisoner can, prior to trial, raise the claim of the denial of a right to a speedy trial by petitioning a federal court for writ of habeas corpus.  The Court reasons that since <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Rowe, supra</citedDecision> , "discarded the prematurity doctrine," ante, at 488, "petitioner is entitled to raise his speedy trial claim on federal habeas corpus." Petitioner filed this petition alleging federal jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U. S. C. §§ 2241 , 2254.  Section 2254 pertains only to a prisoner in custody pursuant to a judgment of conviction of a state court; in the context of the attempt to assert a right to a speedy trial, there is simply no § 2254 trap to "ensnare" petitioner, such as the court below felt existed.  The issue here is whether habeas corpus is warranted under § 2241 (c) (3); that section empowers district courts to issue the writ, inter alia, before a judgment is rendered in a criminal proceeding.  It is in the context of an application for federal habeas *504 corpus by a state prisoner prior to any trial in a state court that the effect of the instant decision must be analyzed.  The Court reasons that since Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969), held that a State must, consistent with the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, "make a diligent, good-faith effort to bring" a prisoner to trial on a state indictment even though he is incarcerated in another jurisdiction, id., at 383 , and, since <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Rowe, supra</citedDecision> , overruled "the prematurity doctrine," therefore, a prisoner can attack in a federal habeas corpus proceeding the validity of an indictment lodged against him in one State even though he is imprisoned in another.  I cannot agree with this reasoning.  In Smith , this Court held that a State must make an effort to try a person even though he was incarcerated in another jurisdiction.  That case did not, however, involve federal habeas corpus.  It came here on certiorari after the state court had denied a petition for a writ of mandamus seeking to have the underlying indictment dismissed.  The Texas Supreme Court had ruled that the state courts had no power to order the federal prisoner produced for trial on the state indictment.  This Court reversed, holding that, in view of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of a speedy trial, the State must, after demand therefor, attempt to obtain the prisoner from the sovereignty with custody over the prisoner.
**Combined Opinion**
 It merely held that a State could not totally rely on the fact that it could not order that a prisoner be brought from another jurisdiction as a justification for not attempting to try the defendant as expeditiously as possible.  The right to a speedy trial is, like other constitutional rights, a defense to a criminal charge, but one which, unlike others, increases in terms of potential benefit to the accused with the passage of time.  Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514 (1972).  The fact that a State must make an effort to obtain a defendant from another sovereign for trial but fails, after demand, to make an effort would weigh heavily in the defendant's favor.  But Smith v. Hooey does not necessarily imply that federal courts may, as the District Court did in this case, in effect, issue an injunction requiring a state court to conduct a criminal trial. If the State fails to perform its duty, Smith v. Hooey , it must face the consequences of possibly not obtaining a conviction, Barker v. Wingo .  But the fact that the State has a duty by no means leads to the conclusion that the failure to perform that duty can be raised by a prospective defendant on federal habeas corpus in advance of trial. The history of habeas corpus and the principles of federalism strongly support the approach established by Ex parte Royall, supra , that, absent extraordinary circumstances, federal habeas corpus should not be used to adjudicate the merits of an affirmative defense to a state criminal charge prior to a judgment of conviction by a state court. The Court's reasoning for allowing a state prisoner to resort to federal habeas corpus is that the prisoner is attacking the validity of a "future custody." The Court relies on <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> to justify federal jurisdiction.  <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> , however, was in a significantly different procedural posture from the instant case. There, the Court held that a *506 state prisoner could challenge the constitutional validity of a sentence which he had not yet begun to serve when he was currently incarcerated pursuant to a valid conviction and sentence, but the sentence he sought to attack was to run consecutively to the valid sentence.  Even though a person may be "in custody" for purposes of §§ 2241 (c) (3), or 2254, if he has not yet begun to serve a sentence entered after a judgment of conviction, as the Court held in <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> , it by no means follows that he is similarly "in custody" when no judgment of conviction has been entered or even any trial on the underlying charge conducted.  The Court's suggestion that a person may challenge by way of federal habeas corpus any custody that might possibly be imposed at some time in the "future," which suggestion unwarrantedly assumes both that a constitutional defense will be rejected and that the jury will convict, is not supported by the language or reasoning of <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> .  Mr. Chief Justice Warren, writing for the Court in <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> , emphasized the role of federal habeas corpus for state prisoners as "substantially a post-conviction device," 391 U. S., at 60, and "the instrument for resolving fact issues not adequately developed in the original proceedings." Id., at 63.  The Court there stated that the demise of the McNally rule would allow prisoners "the opportunity to challenge defective convictions." Id., at 65.  The Court here glosses over the disparate procedural posture of this case, and merely asserts, without analyzing the historical function of federal habeas corpus for state prisoners, that the rationale of <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> is applicable to a pretrial, preconviction situation.  Citation to that decision cannot obscure the fact that the Court here makes a significant departure from previous decisions, a departure that certainly requires analysis and justification more detailed than that which the Court puts forth.  *507 There is no doubt that a prisoner such as petitioner can assert, by appropriate motion in the courts of the State in which the indictment was handed down, that he should be brought to trial on that charge.  Smith v. Hooey, supra .  There is also no doubt that such a prisoner may petition a federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus prior to trial. See 28 U. S. C. § 2241 (c) (3).  What the Court here disregards, however, is almost a century of decisions of this Court to the effect that federal habeas corpus for state prisoners, prior to conviction, should not be granted absent truly extraordinary circumstances.  In Ex parte Royall, supra , the petitioner was indicted in state court for selling a bond coupon without a license.

Tennessee, 447 F. 2d 1354 (CA6 1971).  [2]  Compare United States ex rel. Meadows v. New York, 426 F. 2d 1176 (CA2 1970), and Word v.

Washington, 394 F. 2d 125 (CA9 1968), and Booker v. Arkansas, 380 F. 2d 240 (CA8 1967) (proper forum is in the State of confinement).  [3]  See generally Note, Developments in the LawFederal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038 , 1087-1093 (1970).  [4]  In Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969), we considered a speedy trial claim similar to the one presented in the case before us, and we held that a State which had lodged a detainer against a petitioner in another State must, on the prisoner's demand, "make a diligent, good-faith effort" to bring the prisoner to trial. Id., at 383 .  But that case arose on direct review of the denial of relief by the state court, and we had no occasion to consider whether the same or similar claims could have been raised on federal habeas corpus.  Yet it logically follows from Peyton v. Rowe, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 54</citedDecision> (1968), that the claims can be raised on collateral attack.  In this context, as opposed to the situation presented in <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> , the "future custody" under attack will not be imposed by the same sovereign which holds the petitioner in his current confinement.  Nevertheless, the considerations which were held in <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> to warrant a prompt resolution of the claim also apply with full force in this context.  391 U. S., at 63-64.  See United States ex rel. Meadows v. New York, supra, at 1179.  Word v. North Carolina, supra, at 353-355 .  Since the Alabama warden acts here as the agent of the Commonwealth of Kentucky in holding the petitioner pursuant to the Kentucky detainer, we have no difficulty concluding that petitioner is "in custody" for purposes of 28 U. S. C. § 2241 (c) (3).  On the facts of this case, we need not decide whether, if no detainer had been issued against him, petitioner would be sufficiently "in custody" to attack the Kentucky indictment by an action in habeas corpus.  [5]  Cf. Baker v. Grice, 169 U. S. 284 (1898), where this Court held that a petitioner for a writ of habeas corpus had failed to exhaust state court remedies.
**Combined Opinion**
 [14]  See Note, Developments in the LawFederal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038 , 1189-1191 (1970).  [15]  Nothing in this opinion should be taken to preclude the exercise of concurrent habeas corpus jurisdiction over the petitioner's claim by a federal district court in the district of confinement.  But as we have made clear above, that forum will not in the ordinary case prove as convenient as the district court in the State which has lodged the detainer.  Where a prisoner brings an action in the district of confinement attacking a detainer lodged by another State, the court can, of course, transfer the suit to a more convenient forum.  28 U. S. C. § 1404 (a).  Hoffman v. Blaski, 363 U. S. 335 (1960).  [16]  Obviously, since petitioner could not have presented his habeas corpus claim prior to our 1968 decision in <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Rowe, supra</citedDecision> , and since the choice-of-forum provisions in the habeas corpus statute were most recently amended in 1966, see n. 13, supra, we can hardly draw any inference from the fact that the amendment did not specifically overrule Ahrens with respect to the type of case now before us.  [17]  In Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224 , 228 n. 5 (1970), we adverted to, but reserved judgment on, the precise question at issue here.  We did point out, however, that the "obvious, logical, and practical solution is an amendment to § 2241 to remedy the shortcoming that has become apparent following the holding in <citedDecision>Peyton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Rowe</citedDecision> .  Sound judicial administration calls for such an amendment." We note that an amendment to § 2241 drafted by the Administrative Conference of the United States Courts was introduced during the 92d Congress, but no action was taken upon it.
