 .” Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 526 .  For “¿tjhe threat of sanctions may deter .  .  .  almost as potently as the actual application of sanctions.” N. A. A. C. P. v. Button, supra, at 433 .  The danger of that chilling effect upon the exercise of vital First Amendment rights must be guarded against by sensitive tools which clearly inform teachers what is being proscribed.  See Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359, 369 ; Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, <citedDecision>368 U. S. 278</citedDecision> ; Baggett v. Bullitt, supra. The regulatory maze created by New York is wholly lacking in “terms susceptible of objective measurement.” <citedDecision>Cramp</citedDecision> v. Board of Public Instruction, supra, at 286.  It has the quality of “extraordinary ambiguity” found to be fatal to the oaths considered in <citedDecision>Cramp</citedDecision> and Baggett v. Bullitt .  “[M]en of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application .  .  .  .” Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 367 .  Vagueness of wording is aggravated by prolixity and profusion of statutes, regulations, and administrative machinery, and by manifold cross-references to interrelated enactments and rules.  We therefore hold that § 3021 of the Education Law and subdivisions 1 (a), 1 (b) and 3 of § 105 of the Civil Service Law as implemented by the machinery created pursuant to § 3022 of the Education Law are unconstitutional.

 That premise was that public employment, including academic employment, may be conditioned upon the surrender of constitutional rights which could not be abridged by direct government action.  Teachers, the Court said in Adler , “may work for the school system upon the reasonable terms laid down by the proper authorities of New York. If they do not choose to work on such terms, they are at liberty to retain their beliefs and associations and go elsewhere.” 342 U. S., at 492 .  The Court also stated that a teacher denied employment because of membership in a listed organization “is not thereby denied the right of free speech and assembly.  Hir freedom of choice between membership in the organization and employment in the school system might be limited, but not his freedom of speech or assembly, except in the remote sense that limitation is inherent in every choice.” Id., at 493 .  However, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit correctly said in an earlier stage of this case, “... the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless *606 'of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.” Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 345 F. 2d 236, 239 .  Indeed, that theory was expressly rejected in a series of decisions following Adler .  See Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 ; Slochower v. Board of Education, 350 U. S. 551 ; <citedDecision>Cramp</citedDecision> v. Board of Public <citedDecision>Instruction, supra;</citedDecision> Baggett v. Bullitt, supra; Shelton v. Tucker, supra; Speiser v. Randall, supra; see also Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232 ; Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 .  In Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 404 , we said: “It is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of.  or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege.” We proceed then to the question of the validity of the provisions of subdivision 1 (c) of § 105 and subdivision 2 of § 3022, barring employment to members of listed organizations.  Here again constitutional doctrine has developed since Adler .  Mere knowing membership without a specific intent to further the unlawful aims of an organization is not a constitutionally adequate basis for exclusion from such positions as those held by appellants.  In Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11 , we said, “Those who join an organization but do not share its unlawful purposes and who do not participate in its unlawful activities surely pose no threat, either as citizens or as public employees.” Id., at 17 .  We there struck down a statutorily required oath binding the state employee not to become a member of the Communist Party with knowledge of its unlawful purpose, on threat of discharge and perjury prosecution if the oath were violated.

 It must preserve the integrity of the schools.  That the school authorities have the right and the duty to screen the officials, teachers, and employees as to their fitness to maintain the integrity of the schools as a part of ordered society, cannot be doubted.” At 493.  And again in 1958 the problem was before us in Beilan v. Board of Education, supra. There our late Brother Burton wrote for the Court: “By engaging in teaching in the public schools, petitioner did not give up his right to freedom of belief, speech or association.  He did, however, undertake obligations of frankness, candor and cooperation in answering inquiries made of him by his employing Board examining into his fitness to serve it as a public school teacher.” 357 U. S., at 405 .  And on the same day in Lerner v. Casey, 357 U. S. 468 , our Brother Harlan again upheld the severance of a public employee for his refusal to answer questions concerning his loyalty.  And also on the same day my Brother Brennan himself cited Garner with approval in Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513 (1958).  Since that time the Adler line of cases has been cited again and again with approval: Shelton v. Tucker, 364 *625 U. S. 479 (1960), in which both Adler and Beilan were quoted with approval, and Garner and Lerner were cited in a like manner; likewise in Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, <citedDecision>368 U. S. 278</citedDecision> (1961), Adler was quoted twice with approval; and, in a related field where the employee was discharged for refusal to answer questions as to his loyalty after being ordered to do so, Nelson v. Los Angeles County, 362 U. S. 1 (1960), the Court cited with approval all of the cases which today it says have been rejected, i.  e., Garner, Adler, Beilan and Lerner .  Later Konigsberg v. State Bar, 366 U. S. 36 (1961), likewise cited with approval both Beilan and Garner .  And in our decision in In re Anastaplo, 366 U. S. 82 (1961), Garner, Beilan and Lerner were all referred to.  Finally, only three Terms ago my Brother White relied upon <citedDecision>Cramp</citedDecision> , which in turn cited Adler with approval twice.  See Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360 (1964).  In view of this long list of decisions covering over 15 years of this Court’s history, in which no opinion of this Court even questioned the validity of the Adler line of cases, it is strange to me that the Court now finds that the “constitutional doctrine which has emerged since .  .  .  has rejected [Adler’s] major premise.” With due respect, as I read them, our cases have done no such thing.  III. The majority also finds that Adler did not pass upon § 3021 of the Education Law, nor subdivision 3 of § 105 of the Civil Service Law, nor upon the vagueness questions of subdivisions 1 (a), 1 (b) and 1 (c) of § 105.
