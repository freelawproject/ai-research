. . ." 168 U. S., at 549 . And see, id., at 542. The Court has adhered to this reasoning. In 1924, Mr. Justice Brandeis wrote for a unanimous Court in reversing a conviction resting on a compelled confession, Wan v. United States, <targetCase>266 U. S. 1</targetCase> . He stated: "In the federal courts, the requisite of voluntariness is not satisfied by establishing merely that the confession was not induced by a promise or a threat. A confession is voluntary in law if, and only if, it was, in fact, voluntarily made. A confession may have been given voluntarily, although it was made to police officers, while in custody, and in answer to an examination conducted by them. But a confession obtained by compulsion must be excluded whatever may have been the character of the compulsion, and whether the compulsion was applied in a judicial proceeding or otherwise. Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532 ." 266 U. S., at 14-15 .

CONSTITUTIONAL PREMISES. It is most fitting to begin an inquiry into the constitutional precedents by surveying the limits on confessions the Court has evolved under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is so because these cases show that there exists a workable and effective means of dealing with confessions in a judicial manner; because the cases are the baseline from which the Court now departs and so serve to measure the actual as opposed to the professed distance it travels; and because examination of them helps reveal how the Court has coasted into its present position. The earliest confession cases in this Court emerged from federal prosecutions and were settled on a nonconstitutional basis, the Court adopting the common-law rule that the absence of inducements, promises, and threats made a confession voluntary and admissible. Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574 ; Pierce v. United States, 160 U. S. 355 . While a later case said the Fifth Amendment privilege controlled admissibility, this proposition was not itself developed in subsequent decisions. [2] The Court did, however, heighten the test of admissibility in federal trials to one of voluntariness "in fact," Wan v. *507 United States, <targetCase>266 U. S. 1</targetCase> , 14 (quoted, ante, p. 462), and then by and large left federal judges to apply the same standards the Court began to derive in a string of state court cases. This new line of decisions, testing admissibility by the Due Process Clause, began in 1936 with Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 , and must now embrace somewhat more than 30 full opinions of the Court. [3] While the voluntariness rubric was repeated in many instances, e. g., Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U. S. 596 , the Court never pinned it down to a single meaning but on the contrary infused it with a number of different values. To travel quickly over the main themes, there was an initial emphasis on reliability, e. g., Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S. 547 , supplemented by concern over the legality and fairness of the police practices, e. g., Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 , in an "accusatorial" system of law enforcement, Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49 , 54, and eventually by close attention to the individual's state of mind and capacity for effective choice, e. g., Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49 . The outcome was a continuing re-evaluation on the facts of each case of how much pressure on the suspect was permissible. [4] *508 Among the criteria often taken into account were threats or imminent danger, e. g., Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560 , physical deprivations such as lack of sleep or food, e. g., Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433 , repeated or extended interrogation, e. g., Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227 , limits on access to counsel or friends, Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 ; Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , length and illegality of detention under state law, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 , and individual weakness or incapacities, Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 . Apart from direct physical coercion, however, no single default or fixed combination of defaults guaranteed exclusion, and synopses of the cases would serve little use because the overall gauge has been steadily changing, usually in the direction of restricting admissibility.

. . . And it is laid down *530 that it is not essential to the admissibility of a confession that it should appear that the person was warned that what he said would be used against him, but on the contrary, if the confession was voluntary, it is sufficient though it appear that he was not so warned." Since Bram, the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation has been frequently reiterated. Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303 , cited Wilson approvingly and held admissible as voluntary statements the accused's testimony at a preliminary hearing even though he was not warned that what he said might be used against him. Without any discussion of the presence or absence of warnings, presumably because such discussion was deemed unnecessary, numerous other cases have declared that "[t]he mere fact that a confession was made while in the custody of the police does not render it inadmissible," McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 , 346; accord, United States v. Mitchell, 322 U. S. 65 , despite its having been elicited by police examination, Wan v. United States, <targetCase>266 U. S. 1</targetCase> , 14; United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36 , 39. Likewise, in Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 , 437, the Court said that "the bare fact of police `detention and police examination in private of one in official state custody' does not render involuntary a confession by the one so detained." And finally, in Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , a confession obtained by police interrogation after arrest was held voluntary even though the authorities refused to permit the defendant to consult with his attorney. See generally Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568 , 587-602 (opinion of Frankfurter, J. ); 3 Wigmore, Evidence ยง 851, at 313 (3d ed. 1940); see also Joy, Admissibility of Confessions 38, 46 (1842). Only a tiny minority of our judges who have dealt with the question, including today's majority, have considered in-custody interrogation, without more, to be a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

When federal officials arrest an individual, they must as always comply with the dictates of the congressional legislation and cases thereunder. See generally, Hogan & Snee, The McNabb-Mallory Rule: Its Rise, Rationale and Rescue, 47 Geo. L. J. 1 (1958). [33] The decisions of this Court have guaranteed the same procedural protection for the defendant whether his confession was used in a federal or state court. It is now axiomatic that the defendant's constitutional rights have been violated if his conviction is based, in whole or in part, on an involuntary confession, regardless of its truth or falsity. Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534 , 544 (1961); Wan v. United States, <targetCase>266 U. S. 1</targetCase> (1924). This is so even if there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction, e. g., Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401 , 404 (1945); Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532 , 540-542 (1897). Both state and federal courts now adhere to trial procedures which seek to assure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession offered at trial, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964); United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36 , 38 (1951); see also Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613 , 624 (1896). Appellate review is exacting, see Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199 (1960). Whether his conviction was in a federal or state court, the defendant may secure a post-conviction hearing based on the alleged involuntary character of his confession, provided he meets the procedural requirements, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963). In addition, see Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U. S. 52 (1964). [34] See Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219 , 241 (1941); Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 (1944); Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401 (1945); Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315 (1959); Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 (1963); Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963).
