<p id="b159-8">The question to be decided in this case is whether federal labor policy pre-empts the authority of a state labor relations board to grant an employer covered by the National Labor Relations Act an order enjoining a union and its members from continuing to refuse to work overtime pursuant to a union policy to put economic pressure on the employer in negotiations for renewal of an expired collective-bargaining agreement.</p>
<p id="b159-9">A collective-bargaining agreement between petitioner Lodge 76 (Union) and respondent Kearney &amp; Trecker <page-number citation-index="1" label="134">*134</page-number>Corp. (employer) was terminated by the employer pursuant to the terms of the agreement on June 19, 1971. Good-faith bargaining over the terms of a renewal agreement continued for over a year thereafter, finally resulting in the signing of a new agreement effective July 23, 1972. A particularly controverted issue during negotiations was the employer’s demand that the provision of the expired agreement under which, as for the prior 17 years, the basic workday was seven and one-half hours, Monday through Friday, and the basic workweek was 37% hours, be replaced with a new provision providing a basic workday of eight hours and a basic workweek of 40 hours, and that the terms on which overtime rates of pay were payable be changed accordingly.</p>
<p id="b160-5">A few days after the old agreement was terminated the employer unilaterally began to make changes in some conditions of employment provided in the expired contract, <em>e. g., </em>eliminating the checkoff of Union dues, eliminating the Union’s office in the plant, and eliminating Union lost time. No immediate change was made in the basic workweek or workday, but in March 1972, the employer announced that it would unilaterally implement, as of March 13, 1972, its proposal for a 40-hour week and eight-hour day. The Union response was a membership* meeting on March 7 at which strike action was authorized and a resolution was adopted binding Union members to refuse to work any overtime, defined as work in excess of seven and one-half hours in any day or 37% hours in any week. Following the strike vote, the employer offered to “defer the implementation” of its workweek proposal if the Union would agree to call off the concerted refusal to work overtime. The Union, however, refused the offer and indicated its intent to continue the concerted ban on overtime. Thereafter, the employer did not make effective the proposed changes in the workday and workweek <page-number citation-index="1" label="135">*135</page-number>before the new agreement became effective on July 23, 1972. Although all but a very few employees complied with the Union’s resolution against acceptance of overtime work during the negotiations, the employer did not discipline, or attempt to discipline, any employee for refusing L&gt; work overtime.</p>
<p id="b161-4">Instead, while negotiations continued, the employer filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board that the Union’s resolution violated § 8 (b) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, <span class="citation no-link">49 Stat. 452</span>, as amended, <span class="citation no-link">29 U. S. C. § 158</span> (b)(3). The Regional Director dismissed the charge on the ground that the “policy prohibiting overtime work by its member employees . . . does not appear to be in violation of the Act” and therefore was not conduct cognizable by the Board under <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Insurance Agents, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105999"><a href="/opinion/105999/national-labor-relations-board-v-insurance-agents-international-union/" aria-description="Citation for case: National Labor Relations Board v. Insurance Agents&#x27;...">361 U. S. 477</a></span> (1960). However, the employer also filed a complaint before the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission charging that the refusal to work overtime constituted an unfair labor practice under state law. The Union filed a motion before the Commission to dismiss the complaint for want of “jurisdiction over the subject matter” in that jurisdiction over “the activity of the [Union] complained of [is] pre-empted by” the National Labor Relations Act. App. 11. The motion was denied and the Commission adopted the Conclusion of Law of its Examiner that “the concerted refusal to work overtime, is not an activity which is arguably protected under Section 7 or arguably prohibited under Section 8 of the National Labor Relations Act, as amended, and . . . , therefore, the . . . Commission is not pre-empted from asserting its jurisdiction to regulate said conduct.” The Commission also adopted the further Conclusion of Law that the Union “by authorizing . . . the concerted refusal to work overtime . . . engaged in a concerted effort to interfere with production and . . . committed an unfair labor practice within the meaning <page-number citation-index="1" label="136">*136</page-number>of Section 111.06 (2) (h). . . <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission thereupon entered an order that the Union, <em>inter alia, </em>“[i]immediately cease and desist from authorizing, encouraging or condoning any concerted refusal to accept overtime assignments . . . The Wisconsin Circuit Court affirmed and entered judgment enforcing the Commission’s order. The Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed the Circuit Court. <span class="citation" data-id="8201571"><a href="/opinion/8236747/lodge-76-international-assn-of-machinist-aerospace-workers-v-wisconsin/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lodge 76, International Ass&#x27;n of Machinist &amp; Aerospace...">67 Wis. 2d 13</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="8201571"><a href="/opinion/8236747/lodge-76-international-assn-of-machinist-aerospace-workers-v-wisconsin/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lodge 76, International Ass&#x27;n of Machinist &amp; Aerospace...">226 N.

<p id="b164-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="138">*138</page-number>Cases that have held state authority to be pre-empted by federal law tend to fall into one of two categories: (1) those that reflect the concern that “one forum would enjoin, as illegal, conduct which the other forum would find legal” and (2) those that reflect the concern “that the [application of state law by] state courts would restrict the exercise of rights guaranteed by the Federal Acts.” <em>Automobile Workers </em>v. <em>Russell, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105698"><a href="/opinion/105698/international-union-united-automobile-aircraft-agricultural-implement/#644" aria-description="Citation for case: International Union, United Automobile, Aircraft &amp;...">356 U.

<blockquote id="b164-6">“ [Y] arying approaches were taken by the Court in initially grappling i with this pre-emption problem. Thus, for example, some early cases suggested the true distinction lay between judicial application of general common law, which was permissible, as opposed to state rules specifically designed to regulate <page-number citation-index="1" label="139">*139</page-number>labor relations, which were pre-empted. See, <em>e. g., Automobile Workers </em>v. <em>Russell, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105698"><a href="/opinion/105698/international-union-united-automobile-aircraft-agricultural-implement/#645" aria-description="Citation for case: International Union, United Automobile, Aircraft &amp;...">356 U. S. 634, 645</a></span> (1958). Others made pre-emption turn on whether the States purported to apply a remedy not provided for by the federal scheme, <em>e. g., Weber </em>v. <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="105284"><a href="/opinion/105284/weber-v-anheuser-busch-inc/#479" aria-description="Citation for case: Weber v. Anheuser-Busch, Inc.">348 U. S. 468, 479-480</a></span> (1955), while in still others the Court undertook a thorough scrutiny of the federal Act to ascertain whether the state courts had, in fact, arrived at conclusions inconsistent with its provisions, <em>e. g., Automobile Workers </em>v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Bd., </em><span class="citation" data-id="104636"><a href="/opinion/104636/international-union-u-a-w-a-a-f-of-l-local-232-v-wisconsin/" aria-description="Citation for case: International Union, U.

It was, in short, experience — not pure logic — which initially taught that each of these methods sacrificed important federal interests in a uniform law of labor relations centrally administered by an expert agency without yielding anything in return by way of predictability or ease of judicial application.</blockquote>

Board, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104636"><a href="/opinion/104636/international-union-u-a-w-a-a-f-of-l-local-232-v-wisconsin/" aria-description="Citation for case: International Union, U. A. W. A., A. F. of L., Local 232...">336 U. S. 245</a></span> (1949), the decision of this Court heavily relied upon by the court below in reaching its decision that state regulation of the conduct at issue is not pre-empted by national labor law. In <em>Briggs-Stratton, </em>the union, in order to bring pressure on the employer during, negotia<page-number citation-index="1" label="141">*141</page-number>tions, adopted a plan whereby union meetings were called at irregular times during working hours without advance notice to the employer or any notice as to whether or when the workers would return. In a proceeding under the Wisconsin Employment Peace Act, the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board issued an order forbidding the union and its members to engage in concerted efforts to interfere with production by those methods. This Court did not inquire whether Congress meant that such methods should be reserved to the union “to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.” Rather, because these methods were “neither made a right under federal law nor a violation of it” the Court held that there “was no basis for denying to Wisconsin the power, in governing her internal affairs, to regulate” such conduct. <span class="citation" data-id="104636"><a href="/opinion/104636/international-union-u-a-w-a-a-f-of-l-local-232-v-wisconsin/#265" aria-description="Citation for case: International Union, U.

<p id="b167-4">However, the <em>Briggs-Stratton </em>holding that state power is not pre-empted as to peaceful conduct neither protected by § 7 nor prohibited by § 8 of the federal Act, a holding premised on the statement that “[t]his conduct is governable by the State or it is entirely ungoverned,” <span class="citation" data-id="104636"><a href="/opinion/104636/international-union-u-a-w-a-a-f-of-l-local-232-v-wisconsin/#254" aria-description="Citation for case: International Union, U.

For the Court soon recognized that a particular activity might be “protected” by federal law not only when it fell within § 7, but also when it was an activity that Congress intended to be “unrestricted by <em>any </em>governmental power to regulate” because it was among the permissible “economic weapons in reserve, . . . actual exercise [of which] on occasion by the parties, is part and parcel of the system that the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts have recognized.” <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Insurance Agents, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105999"><a href="/opinion/105999/national-labor-relations-board-v-insurance-agents-international-union/#488" aria-description="Citation for case: National Labor Relations Board v.

The charge was based on union activities that occurred during good-faith bargaining over the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement. During the negotiations, the union directed concerted on-the-job activities by its members of a harassing nature designed to interfere with the conduct of the employer’s business, for the avowed purpose of putting economic pressure on the employer to accede to the union’s bargaining demands. The harassing activities, all peaceful, by the member insurance agents included refusal for a time to solicit new business, and refusal (after the writing of new business was resumed) to comply with the employer insurance company’s reporting procedures; refusal to participate in a company campaign to solicit new business; reporting late at district offices the days the agents were scheduled to attend them; refusing to perform customary duties at the office, instead engaging there in “sit-in-mornings,” “doing what comes naturally,” and leaving at noon as a group; absenting themselves from special business conferences arranged by the company; picketing and distributing leaflets outside the various offices of the company on specified days and hours as directed by the union; distributing leaflets each day to policyholders and others and soliciting policyholders’ signatures on petitions directed to the company; and presenting the signed policyholders’ petitions to the company at its home office while simultaneously engaging in mass demonstrations there. <span class="citation" data-id="105999"><a href="/opinion/105999/national-labor-relations-board-v-insurance-agents-international-union/#480" aria-description="Citation for case: National Labor Relations Board v. Insurance Agents&#x27;...">361 U. S., at 480-481</a></span>. We held that such tactics would not support a finding by the NLRB that the union had failed to bargain in good faith as required by § 8 (b) (3) and rejected the <em>per se </em>rule applied by the Board that use of “economically harassing activities” alone sufficed to prove a vio<page-number citation-index="1" label="143">*143</page-number>lation of that section. The Court assumed “that the activities in question here were not 'protected’ under § 7 of the Act,” <span class="citation" data-id="105999"><a href="/opinion/105999/national-labor-relations-board-v-insurance-agents-international-union/" aria-description="Citation for case: National Labor Relations Board v.

<blockquote id="AuG">“The scope of § 8(b)(3) and the limitations on Board power which were the design of § 8 (d) are exceeded, we hold, by inferring a lack of good faith not from any deficiencies of the union’s performance at the bargaining table by reason of its attempted use of economic pressure, but solely and simply because tactics designed to exert economic pressure were employed during the course of the good-faith negotiations. Thus the Board in the guise of determining good or bad faith in negotiations could regulate what economic weapons a party might summon to its aid. And if the Board could regulate the choice of economic weapons that may be used as part of collective bargaining, it would be in a position to exercise considerable influence upon the substantive terms on which the parties contract. As the parties’ own devices became more limited, the Government might have to enter even more directly into the negotiation of collective agreements. Our labor policy is not presently erected on a foundation of government control of the results of negotiations. See S. Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2. Nor does it contain a charter for the National Labor Relations Board to act at large in equalizing disparities of bargaining power between employer and union.” <em>Id., </em>at 490.</blockquote>
<p id="b169-5">We noted further that “Congress has been rather specific when it has come to outlaw particular economic weapons on the part of unions” and “the activities here involved have never been specifically outlawed by Congress.” <em>Id., </em>at 498. Accordingly, the Board’s claim “to power . . . <page-number citation-index="1" label="144">*144</page-number>to distinguish among various economic pressure tactics and brand the ones at bar inconsistent with good-faith collective bargaining,” <em>id., </em>at 492, was simply inconsistent with the design of the federal scheme in which “the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is . . . part and parcel of the process of collective bargaining.” <em>Id., </em>at 495.</p>

Otherwise, it is implicit in the Act that the public interest is served by freedom of labor to use the weapon of picketing.

If the Ohio law of secondary boycott can be applied to proscribe the same type of conduct which Congress focused upon but did not proscribe when it enacted § 303, the inevitable result would be to frustrate the congressional determination to leave this weapon of self-help available, and to upset the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy. ‘For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act <page-number citation-index="1" label="147">*147</page-number>prohibits,’ <em>Garner </em>v. <em>Teamsters Union, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105175"><a href="/opinion/105175/garner-v-teamsters-chauffeurs-helpers-local-union-no-776/#500" aria-description="Citation for case: Garner v.

<p id="b173-4">Although many of our past decisions concerning conduct left by Congress to the free play of economic forces address the question in the context of union and employee activities, self-help is of course also the prerogative of the employer because he, too, may properly employ economic weapons Congress meant to be un-regulable.

<blockquote id="b173-5">“[T]he Act as presently drawn does not contemplate that unions will always be secure and able to achieve agreement even when their economic position is weak, or that strikes and lockouts will never result from a bargaining impasse.

<p id="b176-4"> “It must be realized that collective bargaining, under a system where the Government does not attempt to control the results of negotiations, cannot be equated with an academic collective search for truth — or even with what might be thought to be the ideal of one. The parties — even granting the modification of views that may come from a realization of economic interdependence — still proceed from contrary and to an extent antagonistic viewpoints and concepts of self-interest. The system has not reached the ideal of the philosophic notion that perfect understanding among people would lead to perfect agreement among them on values. The presence of economic weapons in reserve, and their actual exercise on occasion by the parties, is part and parcel of the system that the Wagner and Taft-Hartley Acts have recognized. . . . [T]he truth of the matter is that at the present statutory stage of our national labor relations policy, the two factors — -necessity for good-faith bargaining between parties, and the availability of economic pressure devices to each to make the other party incline to agree on one’s terms — exist side by side. . . .
