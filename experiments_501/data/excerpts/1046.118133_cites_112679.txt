 These “Aguilar costs” thus reduce the amount of Title I money an LEA has available for remedial education, and LEA’s have had to cut back on the number of students who receive Title I benefits.  From Title I funds available for New York City children between the 1986-1987 and the 1993-1994 school years, the Board had to deduct $7.9 million “off-the-top” for compliance with Aguilar .  App. 333.  When Aguilar was handed down, it was estimated that some 20,000 economically disadvantaged children in the city of New York, see 473 U. S., at 431 *214 (O’Connor, J., dissenting), and some 183,000 children nationwide, see L. Levy, The Establishment Clause 176 (1986), would experience a decline in Title I services.  See also S. Rep. No. 100-222, p. 14 (1987) (estimating that Aguilar costs have “resulted in a decline of about 35 percent in the number of private school children who are served”).  In October and December of 1995, petitioners — the Board and a new group of parents of parochial school students entitled to Title I services — filed motions in the District Court seeking relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) from the permanent injunction entered by the District Court on remand from our decision in Aguilar .  Petitioners argued that relief was proper under Rule 60(b)(5) and our decision in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, <citedDecision>502 U. S. 367, 388</citedDecision> (1992), because the “decisional law [had] changed to make legal what the [injunction] was designed to prevent.” Specifically, petitioners pointed to the statements of five Justices in Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687 (1994), calling for the overruling of Aguilar .  The District Court denied the motion.  The District Court recognized that petitioners, “at bottom,” sought “a procedurally sound vehicle to get the [propriety of the injunction] back before the Supreme Court,” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 96-553, p. A12, and concluded that “the Board ha[d] properly proceeded under Rule 60(b) to seek relief from the injunction.” Id., at A19.  Despite its observations that “the landscape of Establishment* Clause decisions has changed,” id., at A10, and that “[t]here may be good reason to conclude that Aguilar's demise is imminent,” id., at A20, the District Court denied the Rule 60(b) motion on the merits because Aguilar’s demise had “not yet occurred.” The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit “affirmed substantially for the reasons stated in” the District Court’s opinion.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 96-553, p. A5; judgt.  order reported at 101 F. 3d 1394 (1996).  We granted certiorari, 519 U. S. 1086 (1997), and now reverse.

 Rule 60(b)(5), the subsection under which petitioners proceeded below, states: “On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party .  .  .  from a final judgment [or] order .  .  .  [when] it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.” In <citedDecision>Rufo</citedDecision> v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, supra, at 384, we held that it is appropriate to grant a Rule 60(b)(5) motion when the party seeking relief from an injunction or consent decree can show “a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.” A court may recognize subsequent changes in either statutory or decisional law. See Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 652-653 (1961) (consent decree should be vacated under Rule 60(b) in light of amendments to the Railway Labor Act); <citedDecision>Rufo, supra, at 393</citedDecision> (vacating denial of Rule 60(b)(5) motion and remanding so District Court could consider whether consent decree should be modified in light of Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979)); Pasadena City Bd. of Ed. v. Spangler, 427 U. S. 424, 437-438 (1976) (injunction should have been vacated in light of Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U. S. 1 (1971)).  A court errs when it refuses to modify an injunction or consent decree in light of such changes.  See Wright, supra, at 647 (“[T]he court cannot be required to disregard significant changes in law or facts if it is satisfied that what it has been doing has been turned through changed circumstances into an instrument of wrong” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Petitioners point to three changes in the factual and legal landscape that they believe justify their claim for relief under Rule 60(b)(5).  They first contend that the exorbitant costs of complying with the District Court’s injunction con *216 stitute a significant factual development warranting modification of the injunction.  See Brief for Petitioner Agostini et al. 38-40.  Petitioners also argue that there have been two significant legal developments since Aguilar was decided: a majority of Justices have expressed their views that Aguilar should be reconsidered or overruled, see supra, at 214; and Aguilar has in any event been undermined by subsequent Establishment Clause decisions, including Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993), and Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995).  Respondents counter that, because the costs of providing Title I services off site were known at the time Aguilar was decided, and because the relevant case law has not changed, the District Court did not err in denying petitioners’ motions.  Obviously, if neither the law supporting our original decision in this litigation nor the facts have changed, there would be no need to decide the propriety of a Rule 60(b)(5) motion.  Accordingly, we turn to the threshold issue whether the factual or legal landscape has changed since we decided Aguilar .  We agree with respondents that petitioners have failed to establish the significant change in factual conditions required by <citedDecision>Rufo</citedDecision> .  Both petitioners and this Court were, at the time Aguilar was decided, aware that additional costs would be incurred if Title I services could not be provided in parochial school classrooms.  See App. 66-68 (Defendants’ Joint Statement of Material Facts Not In Dispute, filed in 1982, detailing costs of providing off-premises services); Aguilar, 473 U. S., at 430-431 (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (observing that costs of complying with Aguilar decision would likely cause a decline in Title I services for 20,000 New York City students).  That these predictions of additional costs turned out to be accurate does not constitute a change in factual conditions warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(5).  Accord, Rufo, *217 supra, at 385 (“Ordinarily .  .  .

 Under this doctrine, a court should not reopen issues decided in earlier stages of the same litigation.  Messenger v. Anderson, 225 U. S. 436, 444 (1912).  The doctrine does not apply if the court is “convinced that [its prior decision] is clearly erroneous and would work a manifest injustice.” Arizona v. California, 460 U. S. 605, 618, n. 8 (1983).  In light of our conclusion that Aguilar would be decided differently under our current Establishment Clause law, we think adherence to that decision would undoubtedly work a “manifest injustice,” such that the law of the case doctrine does not apply.  Accord, Davis v. United States, 417 U. S. 333, 342 (1974) (Court of Appeals erred in adhering to law of the case doctrine despite intervening Supreme Court precedent).  *237 > We therefore conclude that our Establishment Clause law has “significant[ly] change[d]” since we decided Aguilar .  See Rufo, <citedDecision>502 U. S., at 384</citedDecision> .  We are only left to decide whether this change in law entitles petitioners to relief under Rule 60(b)(5).  We conclude that it does.  Our general practice is to apply the rule of law we announce in a case to the parties before us.  Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/ American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 485 (1989) (“The general rule of long standing is that the law announced in the Court’s decision controls the case at bar”).  We adhere to this practice even when we overrule a case. In Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña, 515 U. S. 200 (1995), for example, the District Court and Court of Appeals rejected the argument that racial classifications in federal programs should be evaluated under strict scrutiny, relying upon our decision in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990).  When we granted certiorari and overruled Metro Broadcasting, we did not hesitate to vacate the judgments of the lower courts.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The service to which Rule 60(b) has been impressed is unprecedented, and neither the Court nor those urging reconsidera *256 tion of Aguilar contend otherwise.  See, e. g., ante, at 238; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11 (acknowledgment by counsel for the United States that “we do not know of another instance in which Rule 60(b) has been used in this way”).  The Court makes clear, fortunately, that any future efforts to expand today’s ruling will not be favored.  See ante, at 238-239.  I therefore anticipate that the extraordinary action taken in this case will remain aberrational.  Rule 60(b) provides, in relevant part: “On motion and upon such terms as are just, the [district] court may relieve a party or a party’s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:... (5)... it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.” Under that Rule, a district court may, in its discretion, grant relief from a final judgment with prospective effect if the party seeking modification can show “a significant change either in factual conditions or in law” that renders continued operation of the judgment inequitable.  Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, <citedDecision>502 U. S. 367, 384</citedDecision> (1992) (addressing modification of consent decree in institutional-reform setting); see 12 J. Moore, Moore’s Federal Practice § 60.47[2][c], pp. 60-163 to 60-166 (3d ed. 1997); 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2863, pp. 336-347 (2d ed. 1995) (hereinafter Wright, Miller, & Kane).  Appellate courts review denials of Rule 60(b) motions for abuse of discretion.  See Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill., 434 U. S. 257, 263 ,.  n. 7 (1978); Railway Employees v. Wright, 364 U. S. 642, 648-650 (1961).  As we recognized in our unanimous opinion in Browder , “an appeal from denial of Rule 60(b) relief does not bring up the underlying judgment for review.” 434 U. S., at 263, n. 7 .  For in this context, “[w]e are not framing a decree.  We are asking ourselves whether anything has happened that will justify *257 us now in changing a decree.
