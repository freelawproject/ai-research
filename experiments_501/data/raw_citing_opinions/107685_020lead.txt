<author id="b192-6">Mr. Justice White</author>
<p id="ADq">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b192-7">Appellant, Gary Duncan, was convicted of simple battery in the Twenty-fifth Judicial District Court of Louisiana. Under Louisiana law simple battery is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum of two years’ imprisonment and a $300 fine. Appellant sought trial by jury, but because the Louisiana Constitution grants jury trials only in cases in which capital punishment or imprisonment at hard labor may be imposed,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the trial judge denied the request. Appellant was convicted and sentenced to serve 60 days in the parish prison and pay a fine of $150. Appellant sought review in the Supreme Court of Louisiana, asserting that the denial of jury trial violated rights guaranteed to him by the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court, finding “[n]o error of law in the ruling complained of,” denied appellant a writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pursuant to <span class="citation no-link">28 U. S. C. <page-number citation-index="1" label="147">*147</page-number>§ 1257</span> (2) appellant sought review in this Court, alleging that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution secure the right to jury trial in state criminal prosecutions where a sentence as long as two years may be imposed. We noted probable jurisdiction,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and set the case for oral argument with No. 52, <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Illinois, post, </em>p. 194.</p>
<p id="b193-5">Appellant was 19 years of age when tried. While driving on Highway 23 in Plaquemines Parish on October 18, 1966, he saw two younger cousins engaged in a conversation by the side of the road with four white boys. Knowing his cousins, Negroes who had recently transferred to a formerly all-white high school, had reported the occurrence of racial incidents at the school, Duncan stopped the car, got out, and approached the six boys. At trial the white boys and a white onlooker testified, as did appellant and his cousins. The testimony was in dispute on many points, but the witnesses agreed that appellant and the white boys spoke to each other, that appellant encouraged his cousins to break off the encounter and enter his car, and that appellant was about to enter the car himself for the purpose of driving away with his cousins. The whites testified that just before getting in the car appellant slapped Herman Landry, one of the white boys, on the elbow. The Negroes testified that appellant had not slapped Landry, but liad merely touched him. The trial judge concluded that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Duncan had committed simple battery, and found him guilty.</p>

<p id="b193-7">The Fourteenth Amendment denies the States the power to “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” In resolving conflicting <page-number citation-index="1" label="148">*148</page-number>claims concerning the meaning of this spacious language, the Co'urt has looked increasingly to the Bill of Rights for guidance; many of the rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution have been held to be protected against state action by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That clause now protects the right to compensation for property taken by the State;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the rights of speech, press, and religion covered by the First Amendment;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and to have excluded from criminal trials any evidence illegally seized; <footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to be free of compelled self-incrimination; <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> to a speedy<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and public<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> trial, to confrontation of opposing witnesses,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b194-4">The test for determining whether a right extended by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments with respect to federal criminal proceedings is also protected against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment has been phrased in a variety of ways in the opinions of this Court. The question has been asked whether a right is among those “ 'fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,' ” <em>Powell </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1236300"><a href="/opinion/1236300/powell-v-alabama/#67" aria-description="Citation for case: Powell v. Alabama">287 U. S. 45, 67</a></span> (1932);<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> whether <page-number citation-index="1" label="149">*149</page-number>it is “basic in our system of jurisprudence,” <em>In re Oliver, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104521"><a href="/opinion/104521/in-re-oliver/#273" aria-description="Citation for case: In Re Oliver">333 U. S. 257, 273</a></span> (1948); and whether it is “a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,” <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106545"><a href="/opinion/106545/gideon-v-wainwright/#343" aria-description="Citation for case: Gideon v. Wainwright">372 U. S. 335, 343-344</a></span> (1963); <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106862"><a href="/opinion/106862/malloy-v-hogan/#6" aria-description="Citation for case: Malloy v.

Texas">380 U. S. 400, 403</a></span> (1965). The claim before us is that the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment meets these tests. The position of Louisiana, on the other hand, is that the Constitution imposes upon the States no duty to give a jury trial in any criminal case, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or the size of the punishment which may be imposed. Because we believe that trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American scheme of justice, we hold that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in all criminal cases which — were they to be tried in a federal court — would come within the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Since we consider the appeal be<page-number citation-index="1" label="150">*150</page-number>fore us to be such a case, we hold that the Constitution was violated when appellant’s demand for jury trial was refused.</p>
<p id="b197-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="151">*151</page-number>The history of trial by jury in criminal cases has been frequently told.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It is sufficient for present purposes to say that by the time our Constitution was written, jury trial in criminal cases had been in existence in England for several centuries and carried impressive credentials traced by many to Magna Carta.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Its preservation and proper operation as a protection against arbitrary rule were among the major objectives of the revolutionary settlement which was expressed in the Declaration and Bill of Rights of 1689. In the 18th century Blackstone could write:</p>
<blockquote id="b197-5">“Our law has therefore wisely placed this strong and two-fold barrier, of a presentment and a trial by jury, between the liberties of the people and the prerogative of the crown. It was necessary, for preserving the admirable balance of our constitution, to vest the executive power of the laws in the prince: and yet this power might be dangerous and destructive to that very constitution, if exerted without check or control, by justices of <em>oyer </em>and <em>terminer </em>occasionally named by the crown; who might then, as in France or Turkey, imprison, dispatch, or exile any man that was obnoxious to the government, by an instant declaration that such is their will and pleasure. But the founders of the English law have, with excellent forecast, contrived that . . . the truth of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unani<page-number citation-index="1" label="152">*152</page-number>mous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours, indifferently chosen and superior to all suspicion.” <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>
<p id="b198-6">Jury trial came to America with English colonists, and received strong support from them. Royal interference with the jury trial was deeply resented. Among the resolutions adopted by the First Congress of the American Colonies (the Stamp Act Congress) on October 19, 1765 — resolutions deemed by their authors to state “the most essential rights and liberties of the colonists” <footnotemark>18</footnotemark>— was the declaration:</p>
<blockquote id="b198-7">“That trial by jury is the inherent and invaluable right of every British subject in these colonies.”</blockquote>
<p id="b198-8">The First Continental Congress, in the resolve of October 14, 1774, objected to trials before judges dependent upon the Crown alone for their salaries and to trials in England for alleged crimes committed in the colonies; the Congress therefore declared:</p>
<blockquote id="b198-9">“That the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to the course of that law.” <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>
<p id="b198-10">The Declaration of Independence stated solemn objections to the King’s making “Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries,” to his “depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury,” and to his “transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses.” The Constitution itself, in Art. Ill, § 2, commanded:</p>
<blockquote id="b198-11">“The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall <page-number citation-index="1" label="153">*153</page-number>be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed.”</blockquote>
<p id="b199-5">Objections to the Constitution because of the absence of a bill of rights were met by the immediate submission and adoption of the Bill of Rights. Included was the Sixth Amendment which, among other things, provided:</p>
<blockquote id="b199-6">“In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.” <footnotemark>20</footnotemark></blockquote>
<p id="b199-7">The constitutions adopted by the original States guaranteed jury trial. Also, the constitution of every State entering the Union thereafter in one form or another protected the right to jury trial in criminal cases.</p>
<p id="b199-8">Even such skeletal history is impressive support for considering the right to jury trial in criminal cases to be fundamental to our system of justice, an importance <page-number citation-index="1" label="154">*154</page-number>frequently recognized in the opinions of this Court. For example, the Court has said:</p>
<blockquote id="b200-4">“Those who emigrated to this country from England brought with them this great privilege 'as their birthright and inheritance, as a part of that admirable common law which had fenced around and interposed barriers on every side against the approaches of arbitrary power.’ ” <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></blockquote>
<p id="b200-5">Jury trial continues to receive strong support. The laws of every State guarantee a right to jury trial in serious criminal cases; no State has dispensed with it; nor are there significant movements underway to do so. Indeed, the three most recent state constitutional revisions, in Maryland, Michigan, and New York, carefully preserved the right of the accused to have the judgment of a jury when tried for a serious crime.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b200-6">We are aware of prior cases in this Court in which the prevailing opinion contains statements contrary to our holding today that the right to jury trial in serious criminal cases is a fundamental right and hence must be recognized by the States as part of their obligation to extend due process of law to all persons within their jurisdiction. Louisiana relies especially on <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Dow, </em><span class="citation" data-id="95204"><a href="/opinion/95204/maxwell-v-dow/" aria-description="Citation for case: Maxwell v. Dow">176 U. S. 581</a></span> (1900); <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102879"><a href="/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Palko v. Connecticut">302 U. S. 319</a></span> (1937); and <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102189"><a href="/opinion/102189/snyder-v-massachusetts/" aria-description="Citation for case: Snyder v. Massachusetts">291 U. S. 97</a></span> (1934). None of these cases, however, dealt with a State which had purported to dispense entirely with a <page-number citation-index="1" label="155">*155</page-number>jury trial in serious criminal cases. <em><span class="citation" data-id="95204"><a href="/opinion/95204/maxwell-v-dow/" aria-description="Citation for case: Maxwell v. Dow">Maxwell</a></span> </em>held that no provision of the Bill of Rights applied to the States— a position long since repudiated — and that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not prevent a State from trying a defendant for a noncapital offense with fewer than 12 men on the jury. It did not deal with a case in which no jury at all had been provided. In neither <em><span class="citation" data-id="102879"><a href="/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Palko v. Connecticut">Palko</a></span> </em>nor <em><span class="citation" data-id="102189"><a href="/opinion/102189/snyder-v-massachusetts/" aria-description="Citation for case: Snyder v. Massachusetts">Snyder</a></span> </em>was jury trial actually at issue, although both cases contain important dicta asserting that the right to jury trial is not essential to ordered liberty and may be dispensed with by the States regardless of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. These observations, though weighty and respectable, are nevertheless dicta, unsupported by holdings in this Court that a State may refuse a defendant’s demand for a jury trial when he is charged with a serious crime. Perhaps because the right to jury trial was not directly at stake, the Court’s remarks about the jury in <em><span class="citation" data-id="102879"><a href="/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Palko v. Connecticut">Palko</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="102189"><a href="/opinion/102189/snyder-v-massachusetts/" aria-description="Citation for case: Snyder v. Massachusetts">Snyder</a></span> </em>took no note of past or current developments regarding jury trials, did not consider its purposes and functions, attempted no inquiry into how well it was performing its job, and did not discuss possible distinctions between civil and criminal cases. In <em><span class="citation" data-id="106862"><a href="/opinion/106862/malloy-v-hogan/" aria-description="Citation for case: Malloy v. Hogan">Malloy</a></span> </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="106862"><a href="/opinion/106862/malloy-v-hogan/" aria-description="Citation for case: Malloy v. Hogan">Hogan, supra,</a></span> </em>the Court rejected Palko’s discussion of the self-incrimination clause. Respectfully, we reject the prior dicta regarding jury trial in criminal cases.</p>
<p id="b201-5">The guarantees of jury trial in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered. A right to jury trial is granted to criminal defendants in order to prevent oppression by the Government.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="156">*156</page-number>Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history and experience that it was necessary to protect against unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too responsive to the voice of higher authority. The framers of the constitutions strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection against arbitrary action. Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge. If the defendant preferred the common-sense judgment of a jury to the more tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single judge, he was to have it. Beyond this, the jury trial provisions in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power — a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges. Fear of unchecked power, so typical of our State and Federal Governments in other respects, found expression in the criminal law in this insistence upon community participation in the determination of guilt or innocence. The deep commitment of the Nation to the right of jury trial in serious criminal cases as a defense against arbitrary law enforcement qualifies for protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and must therefore be respected by the States.</p>
<p id="b202-5">Of course jury trial has “its weaknesses and the potential for misuse,” <em>Singer </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106985"><a href="/opinion/106985/singer-v-united-states/#35" aria-description="Citation for case: Singer v. United States">380 U. S. 24, 35</a></span> (1965). We are aware of the long debate, especially in this century, among those who write about the admin<page-number citation-index="1" label="157">*157</page-number>istration of justice, as to the wisdom of permitting untrained laymen to determine the facts in civil and criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Although the debate has been intense, with powerful voices on either side, most of the controversy has centered on the jury in civil cases. Indeed, some of the severest critics of civil juries acknowledge that the arguments for criminal juries are much stronger.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In addition, at the heart of the dispute have been express or implicit assertions that juries are incapable of adequately understanding evidence or determining issues of fact, and that they are unpredictable, quixotic, and little better than a roll of dice. Yet, the most recent and exhaustive study of the jury in criminal cases concluded that juries do understand the evidence and come to sound conclusions in most of the cases presented to them and that when juries differ with the result at which the judge would have arrived, it is usually because they are serving some of the very purposes for which they were created and for which they are now employed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b203-5">The State of Louisiana urges that holding that the Fourteenth Amendment assures a right to jury trial will cast doubt on the integrity of every trial conducted without a jury. Plainly, this is not the import of our holding. Our conclusion is that in the American States, as in the federal judicial system, a general grant of jury trial for <page-number citation-index="1" label="158">*158</page-number>serious offenses is a fundamental right, essential for preventing miscarriages of justice and for assuring that fair trials are provided for all defendants. We would not assert, however, that every criminal trial — or any particular trial — held before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury. Thus we hold no constitutional doubts about the practices, common in both federal and state courts, of accepting waivers of jury trial<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and prosecuting petty crimes without extending a right to jury trial.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> However, the fact is that in most places more trials for serious crimes are to juries than to a court alone; a great many defendants prefer the judgment of a jury to that of a court.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Even where defendants are satisfied with bench trials, the right to a jury trial very likely serves its intended purpose of making judicial or prosecutorial unfairness less likely.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b205-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="159">*159</page-number>II.</p>
<p id="b205-6">Louisiana’s final contention is that even if it must grant jury trials in serious criminal cases, the conviction before us is valid and constitutional because here the petitioner was tried for simple battery and was sentenced to only 60 days in the parish prison. We are not persuaded. It is doubtless true that there is a category of petty crimes or offenses which is not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and should not be subject to the Fourteenth Amendment jury trial requirement here applied to the States. Crimes carrying possible penalties up to six months do not require a jury trial if they otherwise qualify as petty offenses, <em>Cheff </em>v. <em>Schnackenberg, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107249"><a href="/opinion/107249/cheff-v-schnackenberg/" aria-description="Citation for case: Cheff v. Schnackenberg">384 U. S. 373</a></span> (1966). But the penalty authorized for a particular crime is of major relevance in determining whether it is serious or not and may in itself, if severe enough, subject the trial to the mandates of the Sixth Amendment. <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <page-number citation-index="1" label="160">*160</page-number><em>Clawans, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102801"><a href="/opinion/102801/district-of-columbia-v-clawans/" aria-description="Citation for case: District of Columbia v. Clawans">300 U. S. 617</a></span> (1937). The penalty authorized by the law of the locality may be taken “as a gauge of its social and ethical judgments,” <span class="citation" data-id="102801"><a href="/opinion/102801/district-of-columbia-v-clawans/#628" aria-description="Citation for case: District of Columbia v. Clawans">300 U. S., at 628</a></span>, of the crime in question. In <em><span class="citation" data-id="102801"><a href="/opinion/102801/district-of-columbia-v-clawans/" aria-description="Citation for case: District of Columbia v. Clawans">Clawans</a></span> </em>the defendant was jailed for 60 days, but it was the 90-day authorized punishment on which the Court focused in determining that the offense was not one for which the Constitution assured trial by jury. In the case before us the Legislature of Louisiana has made simple battery a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for up to two years and a fine. The question, then, is whether a crime carrying such a penalty is an offense which Louisiana may insist on trying without a jury.</p>
<p id="b206-6">We think not. So-called petty offenses were tried without juries both in England and in the Colonies and have always been held to be exempt from the otherwise comprehensive language of the Sixth Amendment’s jury trial provisions. There is no substantial evidence that the Framers intended to depart from this established common-law practice, and the possible consequences to defendants from convictions for petty offenses have been thought insufficient to outweigh the benefits to efficient law enforcement and simplified judicial administration resulting from the availability of speedy and inexpensive non jury adjudications. These same considerations compel the same result under the Fourteenth Amendment. Of course the boundaries of the petty offense category have always been ill-defined, if not ambulatory. In the absence of an explicit constitutional provision, the definitional task necessarily falls on the courts, which must either pass upon the validity of legislative attempts to identify those petty offenses which are exempt from jury trial or, where the legislature has not addressed itself to the problem, themselves face the question in the first instance. In either case it is necessary to draw a line in the spectrum of crime, separating petty from serious <page-number citation-index="1" label="161">*161</page-number>infractions. This process, although essential, cannot be wholly satisfactory, for it requires attaching different consequences to events which, when they lie near the line, actually differ very little.</p>
<p id="b207-5">In determining whether the length of the authorized prison term or the seriousness of other punishment is enough in itself to require a jury trial, we are counseled by <em><span class="citation" data-id="102801"><a href="/opinion/102801/district-of-columbia-v-clawans/" aria-description="Citation for case: District of Columbia v. Clawans">District of Columbia</a></span> </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="102801"><a href="/opinion/102801/district-of-columbia-v-clawans/" aria-description="Citation for case: District of Columbia v. Clawans">Clawans, supra,</a></span> </em>to refer to objective criteria, chiefly the existing laws and practices in the Nation. In the federal system, petty offenses are defined as those punishable by no more than six months in prison and a $500 fine.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In 49 of the 50 States crimes subject to trial without a jury, which occasionally include simple battery, are punishable by no more than one year in jail.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Moreover, in the late 18th century in America crimes triable without a jury were for the most part punishable by no more than a six-month prison term, although there appear to have been exceptions to this rule.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> We need not, however, settle in this case the exact location of the line between petty offenses and serious crimes. It is sufficient for our purposes to hold <page-number citation-index="1" label="162">*162</page-number>that a crime punishable by two years in prison is, based on past and contemporary standards in this country, a serious crime and not a petty offense.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Consequently, appellant was entitled to a jury trial and it was error to deny it.</p>

<p id="b195-5"> In one sense recent cases applying provisions of the first eight Amendments to the States represent a new approach to the "incorporation” debate. Earlier the Court can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into whether some particular procedural safeguard was required of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection. For example, <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102879"><a href="/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/#325" aria-description="Citation for case: Palko v. Connecticut">302 U. S. 319, 325</a></span> (1937), stated: “The right to trial by jury and the immunity from prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have value and importance. Even so, they are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty. . . . Few would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without them.” The recent cases, on the other hand, have proceeded upon the valid assumption that state criminal processes are not imaginary and theoretical schemes but actual systems bearing virtually every characteristic of the common-law system that has been developing contemporaneously in England and in this country. The question thus is whether given this kind of system a particular procedure is <page-number citation-index="1" label="150">*150</page-number>fundamental — whether, that is, a procedure is necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty. It is this sort of inquiry that can justify the conclusions that state courts must exclude evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106285"><a href="/opinion/106285/mapp-v-ohio/" aria-description="Citation for case: Mapp v. Ohio">367 U. S. 643</a></span> (1961); that state prosecutors may not comment on a defendant’s failure to testify, <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107038"><a href="/opinion/107038/griffin-v-california/" aria-description="Citation for case: Griffin v. California">380 U. S. 609</a></span> (1965); and that criminal punishment may not be imposed for the status of narcotics addiction, <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106451"><a href="/opinion/106451/robinson-v-california/" aria-description="Citation for case: Robinson v. California">370 U. S. 660</a></span> (1962). Of immediate relevance for this case are the Court’s holdings that the States must comply with certain provisions of the Sixth Amendment, specifically that the States may not refuse a speedy trial, confrontation of witnesses, and the assistance, at state expense if necessary, of counsel. See cases cited in nn. 8-12, <em>supra. </em>Of each of these determinations that a constitutional provision originally written to bind the Federal Government should bind the States as well it might be said that the limitation in question is not necessarily fundamental to fairness in every criminal system that might be imagined but is fundamental in the context of the criminal processes maintained by the American States.</p>
<p id="b196-5">When the inquiry is approached in this way the question whether the States can impose criminal punishment without granting a jury trial appears quite different from the way it appeared in the older cases opining that States might abolish jury trial. See, <em>e. g., Maxwell </em>v. <em>Dow, </em><span class="citation" data-id="95204"><a href="/opinion/95204/maxwell-v-dow/" aria-description="Citation for case: Maxwell v. Dow">176 U. S. 581</a></span> (1900). A criminal process which was fair and equitable but used no juries is easy to imagine. It would make use of alternative guarantees and protections which would serve the purposes that the jury serves in the English and American systems. Yet no American State has undertaken to construct such a system. Instead, every American State, including Louisiana, uses the jury extensively, and imposes very serious punishments only after a trial at which the defendant has a right to a jury’s verdict. In every State, including Louisiana, the structure and style of the criminal process — the supporting framework and the subsidiary procedures — are of the sort that naturally complement jury trial, and have developed in connection with and in reliance upon jury trial.</p>

<p id="b204-9"> Louisiana also asserts that if due process is deemed to include the right to jury trial, States will be obligated to comply with all past interpretations of the Sixth Amendment, an amendment which in its inception was designed to control only the federal courts and which throughout its history has operated in this limited environment where uniformity is a more obvious and immediate consideration. In particular, Louisiana objects to application of the decisions of this Court interpreting the Sixth Amendment as guaranteeing a 12-man jury in serious criminal cases, <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Utah, </em><span class="citation" data-id="94866"><a href="/opinion/94866/thompson-v-utah/" aria-description="Citation for case: Thompson v. Utah">170 U. S. 343</a></span> (1898); as requiring a unanimous verdict before guilt can be found, <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Dow, </em><span class="citation" data-id="95204"><a href="/opinion/95204/maxwell-v-dow/#586" aria-description="Citation for case: Maxwell v. Dow">176 U. S. 581, 586</a></span> (1900); and as barring procedures by which crimes subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision are tried in the first instance without a jury but at the first appellate stage by <em>de novo </em>trial with a jury, <em>Callan </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="92280"><a href="/opinion/92280/callan-v-wilson/#557" aria-description="Citation for case: Callan v. Wilson">127 U. S. 540, 557</a></span> (1888). It seems very unlikely to us that our decision today will require widespread changes in state criminal processes. First, our decisions interpreting the Sixth Amendment are always subject to reconsideration, a fact amply demonstrated by the instant decision. In addition, most of the <page-number citation-index="1" label="159">*159</page-number>States have provisions for jury trials equal in breadth to the Sixth Amendment, if that amendment is construed, as it has been, to permit the trial of petty crimes and offenses without a jury. Indeed, there appear to be only four States in which juries of fewer than 12 can be used without the defendant’s consent for offenses carrying a maximum penalty of greater than one year. Only in Oregon and Louisiana can a less-than-unanimous jury convict for an offense with a maximum penalty greater than one year. However 10 States authorize first-stage trials without juries for crimes carrying lengthy penalties; these States give a convicted defendant the right to a <em>de novo </em>trial before a jury in a different court. The statutory provisions are listed in the briefs filed in this case.</p>

New Jersey’s disorderly conduct offense, N. J. Stat. Ann. §2A: 169-4 (1953), carries a one-year maximum sentence but no jury trial. The denial of jury trial was upheld by a 4 — 3 vote against state constitutional attack in <em>State </em>v. <em>Maier, </em>13 N.

In our view that case does not reach the situation where a legislative judgment as to the seriousness of the crime is imbedded in the statute in the form of an express authorization to impose a heavy penalty for the crime in question. <em><span class="citation" data-id="107249"><a href="/opinion/107249/cheff-v-schnackenberg/" aria-description="Citation for case: Cheff v.
