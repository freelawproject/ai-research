 That section provides: “Any person, firm, city, village, municipal corporation or any other entity intending to withdraw ground water from any well or pit located in the State of Nebraska and transport it for use in an adjoining state shall apply to the Department of Water Resources for a permit to do so. If the Director of Water Resources finds that the withdrawal of the ground water requested is reasonable, is not contrary to the conservation and use of ground water, and is not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare, he shall grant the permit if the state in which the water is to be used grants reciprocal rights to withdraw and transport ground water from that state for use in the State of Nebraska.” Appellee brought this action to enjoin appellants from transferring the water across the border without a permit.  2 The trial court rejected the defense that the statute imposed an undue burden on interstate commerce and granted the injunction.  The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed.  208 Neb. 703 , 305 N. W. 2d 614 (1981).  It held that, under Nebraska law, ground water is not “a market item freely transferable for value among private parties, and therefore [is] not an article of commerce.” Id., at 705 , 305 N. W. 2d, at *945 616 .  3 The Chief Justice, while agreeing that the statutory criteria governing the transfer of water to an adjoining State did not violate the Commerce Clause, dissented on the narrow ground that appellee violated both the Federal and Nebraska Constitutions by attempting “to absolutely prohibit the transfer of water, without regard to its need or availability, based solely upon the acts of another state oyer which citizens of this state have no control.” Id., at 713 , 305 N. W. 2d, at 620 .  I In holding that ground water is not an article of commerce, the Nebraska Supreme Court and appellee cite as controlling precedent Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 349</citedDecision> (1908).  In that case a New Jersey statute prohibited the interstate transfer of any surface water located within the State.  4 The Hudson County Water Co. nevertheless contracted with New York City to supply one of its boroughs with water from the Passaic River in New Jersey.  The State Attorney General sought from the New Jersey courts an injunction against fulfillment of the contract.  Over the water company’s objections that the statute impaired the obligation of contract, took property without just compensation, interfered with interstate commerce, denied New York citizens the privileges afforded New Jersey citizens, and denied New York citizens the equal protection of the laws, the injunction was granted.  This Court, in an opinion by Justice Holmes, affirmed.  *946 Most of the Court’s opinion addresses the just compensation claim.  Justice Holmes refused to ground the Court’s holding, as did the New Jersey state courts, 5 on “the more or less attenuated residuum of title that the State may be said to possess.” Id,., at 355.  For the statute was justified as a regulatory measure that, on balance, did not amount to a taking of property that required just compensation.  Putting aside the “problems of irrigation,” the State’s interest in preserving its waters was well within its police power.  6 That interest was not dependent on any demonstration that the State’s water resources were inadequate for present or future use.  The State “finds itself in possession of what all admit to be a great public good, and what it has it may keep and give no one a reason for its will.” <citedDecision>Id., at 357</citedDecision> .  Having disposed of the just compensation claim, Justice Holmes turned very briefly to the other constitutional chal *947 lenges.  In one paragraph, he rejected the Contract Clause claim.  In the remaining paragraph of the opinion, he rejected all the other defenses.  His treatment of the Commerce Clause challenge consists of three sentences: “A man cannot acquire a right to property by his desire to use it in commerce among the States.  Neither can he enlarge his otherwise limited and qualified right to the same end.  The case is covered in this respect by Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 [(1896)].” Ibid. While appellee relies upon Hudson County, appellants rest on our summary affirmance of a three-judge District Court judgment in City of Altus v. Carr, 255 F. Supp. 828 (WD Tex.), summarily aff’d, 385 U. S. 35 (1966).

 It consequently obtained from the owners of land in an adjoining Texas county the contractual right to pump the ground water underlying that land and to transport it across the border.  The Texas Legislature thereafter enacted a statute that forbade the interstate exportation of ground water without the approval of that body.  7 The city filed suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the statute violated the Commerce Clause.  The city relied upon West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State, 8 and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923), which invalidated a West Virginia statute *948 that accorded a preference to the citizens of that State in the purchase of natural gas produced therein.  9 The Texas Attorney General defended the statute on two grounds.  First, he asserted that its purpose was to conserve and protect the State’s water resources by regulating the withdrawal of ground water.  The District Court rejected that defense because similar conservation claims had met defeat in West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., supra, and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, supra. 10 Second, the State argued that the statute regulated ground water and that ground water is not an article of commerce, citing Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 (1896), and Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 349</citedDecision> (1908).  The court rejected this argument since the statute directly regulated the interstate transportation of *949 water that had been pumped from the ground, and under Texas law such water was an article of commerce.  The court then had little difficulty in concluding that the statute imposed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.  11 In summarily affirming the District Court in City of Altus, we did not necessarily adopt the court’s reasoning.  Our affirmance indicates only our agreement with the result reached by the District Court. Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 499 (1981).  That result is not necessarily inconsistent with the Nebraska Supreme Court’s holding in this case. For Texas law differs significantly from Nebraska law regarding the rights of a surface owner to ground water that he has withdrawn.  According to the District Court in City ofAltus, the “rule in Texas was that an owner of land could use all of the percolating water he could capture from the wells on his land for whatever beneficial purposes he needed it, on or off the land, and could likewise sell it to others for use on or off the land and outside the basin where produced, just as he could sell any other species of property.” 255 F. Supp., at 833, n. 8 .

 Article I, §8, cl. 3, of the United States Constitution provides: “The Congress shall have Power ... To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” For general explanations of Commerce Clause analysis, see, e. g., Western & Southern Life Insurance Co. v. State Board of Equalization, 451 U. S. 648, 652-653 (1981); Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761, 766-770 (1945).  Because of the reciprocity requirement of § 46-613.01, appellants would not have been granted a permit had they applied for one.  Their failure to submit an application therefore does not deprive them of standing to challenge the legality of the reciprocity requirement.  Cf. Larson v. Valente, 456 U. S. 228 (1982).  The Nebraska Supreme Court also rejected appellants’ equal protection and due process challenges.  Appellants renew those challenges before this Court, but we need not reach these issues in light of our disposition of the Commerce Clause claim.  The Court quoted the statute: “ ‘It shall be unlawful for any person or corporation to transport or carry, through pipes, conduits, ditches or canals, the waters of any fresh water lake, pond, brook, creek, river or stream of this State into any other State, for use therein.’ ” <citedDecision>209 U. S., at 353</citedDecision> .  “The Courts below assumed or decided and we shall assume that the defendant represents the rights of a riparian proprietor, and on the other hand, that it represents no special chartered powers that give it greater rights than those.  On these assumptions the Court of Errors and Appeals pointed out that a riparian proprietor has no right to divert waters for more than a reasonable distance from the body of the stream or for other than the well-known ordinary uses, and that for any purpose anywhere he is narrowly limited in amount.  It went on to infer that his only right in the body of the stream is to have the flow continue, and that there is a residuum of public ownership in the State.  It reinforced the State’s rights by the State’s title to the bed of the stream where flowed-by the tide, and concluded from the foregoing and other considerations that, as against the rights of riparian owners merely as such, the State was warranted in prohibiting the acquisition of the title to water on a larger scale.” <citedDecision>Id., at 354</citedDecision> .  “The problems of irrigation have no place here.  Leaving them on one side, it appears to us that few public interests are more obvious, indisputable and independent of particular theory than the interest of the public of a State to maintain the rivers that are wholly within it substantially undiminished, except by such drafts upon them as the guardian of the public welfare may permit for the purpose of turning them to a more perfect use.” <citedDecision>Id., at 356</citedDecision> .  The District Court quoted the statute: ‘“No one shall withdraw water from any underground source in this State for use in any other state by drilling a well in Texas and transporting the water outside the boundaries of the State unless the same be specifically authorized by an Act of the Texas Legislature and thereafter as approved by it.’” 255 F. Supp., at 830 .  Justiee Holmes, the author of the Court’s opinion in Hudson County, noted his dissent.  See 221 U. S., at 262 .  Justice Holmes dissented, expressing the view that the Court’s decision was inconsistent with Hudson County.  See 262 U. S., at 603 .  The District Court opinion, 255 F. Supp., at 839 , included these quotations from the two cases: “The statute of Oklahoma recognizes [natural gas] to be a subject of intrastate commerce, but seeks to prohibit it from being the subject of interstate commerce, and this is the purpose of its conservation.
**Dissenting Opinion**
*961 Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O’Connor joins, dissenting. The issue presented by this case, and the only issue, is whether the existence of the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution by itself, in the absence of any action by Congress, invalidates some or all of Neb. Rev. Stat. §46-613.01 (1978), which relates to ground water. But instead of confining its opinion to this question, the Court first quite gratuitously undertakes to answer the question of whether the authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce, conferred by the same provision of the Constitution, would enable it to legislate with respect to groundwater overdraft in some or all of the States. That these two questions are quite distinct leaves no room for doubt. Congress may regulate not only the stream of commerce itself, but also activities which affect interstate commerce, including wholly intrastate activities. See, e. g., Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling, 316 U. S. 517 (1942); United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941); Houston & Texas R. Co. v. United States, 234 U. S. 342 (1914). The activity upon which the regulatory effect of the congressional statute falls in many of these cases does not directly involve articles of commerce at all. For example, in Kirschbaum, the employees were engaged in the operation and maintenance of a loft building in which large quantities of goods for interstate commerce were produced; no one contended that these employees themselves, or the work which they actually performed, dealt with articles of commerce. Nonetheless, the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act were applied to them because Congress extended the terms of the Act not only to those who were “engaged in commerce” but also to those who were engaged “in the production of goods for commerce.” 316 U. S., at 522 . Thus, the authority of Congress under the power to regulate interstate commerce may reach a good deal further than *962 the mere negative impact of the Commerce Clause in the absence of any action by Congress. Upon a showing that ground-water overdraft has a substantial economic effect on interstate commerce, for example, Congress arguably could regulate ground-water overdraft, even if ground water is not an “article of commerce” itself. See, e. g., Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 281-283 (1981); id., at 310-313 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111 (1942). It is therefore wholly unnecessary to decide whether Congress could regulate ground-water overdraft in order to decide this case; since Congress has not undertaken such a regulation, I would leave the determination of its validity until such time as it is necessary to decide that question. The question actually involved in this case is whether Neb. Rev. Stat. §46-613.01 (1978) runs afoul of the unexercised authority of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. While the Court apparently agrees that our equitable apportionment decrees in cases such as Wyoming v. Colorado, 353 U. S. 953 (1957), and the execution and approval of interstate compacts apportioning water have given rise to “the legal expectation that under certain circumstances each State may restrict water within its borders,” ante, at 956, it insists on an elaborate balancing process in which the State’s “interest” is weighed under traditional Commerce Clause analysis. I think that in more than one of our cases in which a State has invoked our original jurisdiction, the unsoundness of the Court’s approach is manifest. For example, in Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., 206 U. S. 230, 237 (1907), the Court said: “This is a suit by a State for an injury to it in its capacity of gwcm-sovereign. In that capacity the State has an interest independent of and behind the titles of its citizens, in all the earth and air within its domain. It has the last word as to whether its mountains shall be stripped of their forests and its inhabitants shall breathe pure air.” *963 Five years earlier, in Kansas v. Colorado, 185 U. S. 125, 142, 145-146 (1902), the Court had made clear that a State’s quasi-sovereign interest in the flow of surface and subterranean water within its borders was of the same magnitude as its interest in pure air or healthy forests. In my view, these cases appropriately recognize the traditional authority of a State over resources within its boundaries which are essential not only to the well-being but often to the very lives of its citizens. In the exercise of this authority, a State may so regulate a natural resource as to preclude that resource from attaining the status of an “article of commerce” for the purposes of the negative- impact of the Commerce Clause. It is difficult, if not impossible, to conclude that “commerce” exists in an item that cannot be reduced to possession under state law and in which the State recognizes only a usufructuary right. “Commerce” cannot exist in a natural resource that cannot be sold, rented, traded, or transferred, but only used. Of course, a State may not discriminate against interstate commerce when it regulates even such a resource. If the State allows indiscriminate intrastate commercial dealings in a particular resource, it may have a difficult task proving that an outright prohibition on interstate commercial dealings is not such a discrimination. I had thought that this was the basis for this Court’s decisions in Hughes v. Oklahoma, 441 U. S. 322 (1979), Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923), and West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911). In each case, the State permitted a natural resource to be reduced to private possession, permitted an intrastate market to exist in that resource, and either barred interstate commerce entirely or granted its residents a commercial preference. 1 *964 By contrast, Nebraska so regulates ground water that it cannot be said that the State permits any “commerce,” intrastate or interstate, to exist in this natural resource. As with almost all of the Western States, Nebraska does- not recognize an absolute ownership interest in ground water, but grants landowners only a right to use ground water on the land from which it has been extracted. Moreover, the landowner’s right to use ground water is limited. Nebraska landowners may not extract ground water “in excess of a reasonable and beneficial use upon the land in which he owns, especially if such use is injurious to others who have substantial rights to the waters, and if the natural underground supply is insufficient for all owners, each is entitled to a reasonable proportion of the whole.” Olson v. City of Wahoo, 124 Neb. 802, 811 , 248 N. W. 304, 308 (1933). With the exception of municipal water systems, Nebraska forbids any transportation of ground water off the land owned or controlled by the person who has appropriated the water from its subterranean source. 208 Neb. 703, 710 , 305 N. W. 2d 614, 619 (1981). See App. 68-69. Nebraska places additional restrictions on ground-water users within certain areas, such as the portion of appellants’ land situated in Nebraska, where the shortage of ground water is determined to be critical. Water users in appellants’ district are permitted only to irrigate the acreage irrigated in 1977, or the average number of acres irrigated between 1972 and 1976, whichever is greater, and must obtain permission from the water district’s board before any *965 additional acreage may be placed under irrigation. The amount of ground water that may be extracted is strictly limited on an acre-inch-per-irrigated-acre basis. There are also detailed regulations as to the spacing of wells and the use and operation of flow meters. Id., at 71-82. Since Nebraska recognizes only a limited right to use ground water on land owned by the appropriator, it cannot be said that “commerce” in ground water exists as far as Nebraska is concerned. Therefore, it cannot be said that Neb. Rev. Stat. §46-613.01 (1978) either discriminates against, or “burdens,” interstate commerce. Section 46-613.01 is simply a regulation of the landowner’s right to use ground water extracted from lands he owns within Nebraska. 2 Unlike the Court, I cannot agree that Nebraska’s limitation upon a landowner’s right to extract water from his land situated in Nebraska for his own use on land he owns in an adjoining State runs afoul of Congress’ unexercised authority to regulate interstate commerce. 3 Similarly, in City of Altus v. Carr, 255 F. Supp. 828 (WD Tex.), summarily aff’d, 385 U. S. 35 (1966), Texas placed no restrictions upon the use or the intrastate sale of ground water. The “rule in Texas was that an *964 owner of land could use all of the percolating water he could capture from the wells on his land for whatever beneficial purposes he needed it, on or off the land, and could likewise sell it to others for use on or off the land and outside the basin where produced, just as he could sell any other species of property.” 255 F. Supp., at 833, n. 8 . Texas’ absolute ownership rule is an anomaly among the Western States. See 5 R. Clark, Waters and Water Rights §441 (1972 and 1978 Supp.). In Nebraska, as in most of the Western States, ground water is not treated as “any other species of property.” Unlike several other Western States, Nebraska does not entirely forbid ground water extracted in Nebraska to be used in other States. See Brief for City of El Paso as Amicus Curiae 2, n. 3. As noted by the Court, Nebraska merely places conditions on such a use of the State’s ground water. A permit must be obtained from the Nebraska Department of Water Resources. If the requested withdrawal of ground water is determined to be “reasonable,. . . not contrary to the conservation and use of ground water, and . . . not otherwise detrimental to the public welfare,” a permit will be issued so long as the “state in which the water is to be used grants reciprocal rights to withdraw and transport ground water from that state for use in the State of Nebraska.” Neb. Rev. Stat. § 46-613.01 (1978). The Court today invalidates only the reciprocity provision in § 46-613.01. Ante, at 957-958. Appellants, however, have never applied for the permit required by the Nebraska statute. I see nothing in the Court’s opinion that would preclude the Nebraska Department of Water Resources from prohibiting appellants from transporting ground water into the Colorado portion of their land until they obtain the permit required by the statute. I also see nothing in the Court’s opinion that would preclude the Department of Water Resources from denying appellants a permit because of a failure to satisfy the remaining conditions in the statute.
**Combined Opinion**
 The Nebraska Supreme Court affirmed.  208 Neb. 703 , 305 N. W. 2d 614 (1981).  It held that, under Nebraska law, ground water is not "a market item freely transferable for value among private parties, and therefore [is] not an article of commerce." Id., at 705 , 305 N. W. 2d, at *945 616.  [3] The Chief Justice, while agreeing that the statutory criteria governing the transfer of water to an adjoining State did not violate the Commerce Clause, dissented on the narrow ground that appellee violated both the Federal and Nebraska Constitutions by attempting "to absolutely prohibit the transfer of water, without regard to its need or availability, based solely upon the acts of another state over which citizens of this state have no control." Id., at 713 , 305 N. W. 2d, at 620 .  I In holding that ground water is not an article of commerce, the Nebraska Supreme Court and appellee cite as controlling precedent Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 349</citedDecision> (1908).  In that case a New Jersey statute prohibited the interstate transfer of any surface water located within the State.  [4] The Hudson County Water Co. nevertheless contracted with New York City to supply one of its boroughs with water from the Passaic River in New Jersey.  The State Attorney General sought from the New Jersey courts an injunction against fulfillment of the contract.  Over the water company's objections that the statute impaired the obligation of contract, took property without just compensation, interfered with interstate commerce, denied New York citizens the privileges afforded New Jersey citizens, and denied New York citizens the equal protection of the laws, the injunction was granted.  This Court, in an opinion by Justice Holmes, affirmed.  *946 Most of the Court's opinion addresses the just compensation claim.  Justice Holmes refused to ground the Court's holding, as did the New Jersey state courts, [5] on "the more or less attenuated residuum of title that the State may be said to possess." <citedDecision>Id., at 355</citedDecision> .  For the statute was justified as a regulatory measure that, on balance, did not amount to a taking of property that required just compensation.  Putting aside the "problems of irrigation," the State's interest in preserving its waters was well within its police power.  [6] That interest was not dependent on any demonstration that the State's water resources were inadequate for present or future use.  The State "finds itself in possession of what all admit to be a great public good, and what it has it may keep and give no one a reason for its will." <citedDecision>Id., at 357</citedDecision> .  Having disposed of the just compensation claim, Justice Holmes turned very briefly to the other constitutional challenges.  *947 In one paragraph, he rejected the Contract Clause claim.  In the remaining paragraph of the opinion, he rejected all the other defenses.  His treatment of the Commerce Clause challenge consists of three sentences: "A man cannot acquire a right to property by his desire to use it in commerce among the States.  Neither can he enlarge his otherwise limited and qualified right to the same end.  The case is covered in this respect by Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 [(1896)]."

 It consequently obtained from the owners of land in an adjoining Texas county the contractual right to pump the ground water underlying that land and to transport it across the border.  The Texas Legislature thereafter enacted a statute that forbade the interstate exportation of ground water without the approval of that body.  [7] The city filed suit in Federal District Court, claiming that the statute violated the Commerce Clause.  The city relied upon West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State, [8] and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923), which invalidated a West Virginia statute *948 that accorded a preference to the citizens of that State in the purchase of natural gas produced therein.  [9] The Texas Attorney General defended the statute on two grounds.  First, he asserted that its purpose was to conserve and protect the State's water resources by regulating the withdrawal of ground water.  The District Court rejected that defense because similar conservation claims had met defeat in West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., supra , and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, supra. [10] Second, the State argued that the statute regulated ground water and that ground water is not an article of commerce, citing Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 (1896), and Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 349</citedDecision> (1908).  The court rejected this argument since the statute directly regulated the interstate transportation of *949 water that had been pumped from the ground, and under Texas law such water was an article of commerce.  The court then had little difficulty in concluding that the statute imposed an impermissible burden on interstate commerce.  [11] In summarily affirming the District Court in City of Altus , we did not necessarily adopt the court's reasoning.  Our affirmance indicates only our agreement with the result reached by the District Court. Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 499 (1981).  That result is not necessarily inconsistent with the Nebraska Supreme Court's holding in this case. For Texas law differs significantly from Nebraska law regarding the rights of a surface owner to ground water that he has withdrawn.  According to the District Court in City of Altus , the "rule in Texas was that an owner of land could use all of the percolating water he could capture from the wells on his land for whatever beneficial purposes he needed it, on or off the land, and could likewise sell it to others for use on or off the land and outside the basin where produced, just as he could sell any other species of property."
