 If they are truly open, nothing prevents the ‘professional’ pharmacist from marketing his own as-sertedly superior product, and contrasting it with that of the low-cost, high-volume prescription drug retailer.  But the choice among these alternative approaches is not ours to make or the Virginia General Assembly’s.  It is precisely this kind of choice, between the dangers of suppressing information, and the dangers of its misuse if it is freely available, that the.  First Amendment makes for us.” Id., at 770 .  On the basis of these principles, our early cases uniformly struck down several broadly based bans on truthful, nonmis-leading commercial speech, each of which served ends unre *498 lated to consumer protection.  8 Indeed, one of those cases expressly likened the rationale that Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy employed to the one that Justice Brandeis adopted in his concurrence in Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357 (1927).  See Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, <citedDecision>431 U. S. 85, 97</citedDecision> (1977).  There, Justice Brandéis wrote, in explaining his objection to a prohibition of political speech, that “the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.  Only an emergency can justify repression.” Whitney, 274 U. S., at 377 ; see also Carey v. Population Services Int’l, 431 U. S. 678, 701 (1977) (applying test for suppressing political speech set forth in Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U. S. 444, 447 (1969)).  At the same time, our early cases recognized that the State may regulate some types of commercial advertising more freely than other forms of protected speech.  Specifically, we explained that the State may require commercial messages to “appear in such a form, or include such additional information, warnings, and disclaimers, as are necessary to prevent its being deceptive,” Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 772, n. 24 , and that it may restrict some forms of aggressive sales practices that have the potential to exert “undue influence” over consumers, see Bates v. State Bar of Aria., 433 U. S. 350 , 366 (1977).  Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy attributed the State’s authority to impose these regulations in part to certain “commonsense *499 differences” that exist between commercial messages and other types of protected expression.  425 U. S., at 771, n. 24 .

 See Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 491-494 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  When a State regulates commercial messages to protect consumers from misleading, deceptive, or aggressive sales practices, or requires the disclosure of beneficial consumer information, the purpose of its regulation is consistent with the reasons for according constitutional protection to commercial speech and therefore justifies less than strict review.  However, when a State entirely prohibits the dissemination of truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages for reasons unrelated to the preservation of a fair bargaining process, there is far less reason to depart from the rigorous review that the First Amendment generally demands.  Sound reasons justify reviewing the latter type of commercial speech regulation more carefully.  Most obviously, complete speech bans, unlike content-neutral restrictions on the time, place, or manner of expression, see Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 89 (1949), are particularly dangerous because they all but foreclose alternative means of disseminating certain information.  Our commercial speech cases have recognized the dangers that attend governmental attempts to single out certain messages for suppression.  For example, in Linmark, <citedDecision>431 U. S., at 92-94</citedDecision> , we concluded that a ban on “For Sale” signs *502 was “content based” and failed to leave open “satisfactory” alternative channels of communication; see also Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 771 .  Moreover, last Term we upheld a 30-day prohibition against a certain form of legal solicitation largely because it left so many channels of communication open to Florida lawyers.  Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 633-634 (1995).  11 The special dangers that attend complete bans on truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech cannot be explained away by appeals to the “commonsense distinctions” that exist between commercial and noncommercial speech.  Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U. S., at 771, n. 24 .  Regulations that suppress the truth are no less troubling because they target objectively verifiable information, nor are they less effective because they aim at durable messages.  As a result, neither the “greater objectivity” nor the “greater hardiness” of truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech justifies reviewing its complete suppression with added deference.

 Yet bans *503 that target truthful, nonmisleading commercial messages rarely protect consumers from such harms.  12 Instead, such bans often serve only to obscure an “underlying governmental policy” that could be implemented without regulating speech.  Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566, n. 9 .  In this way, these commercial speech bans not only hinder consumer choice, but also impede debate over central issues of public policy.  See id., at 575 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).  13 Precisely because bans against truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech rarely seek to protect consumers from either deception or overreaching, they usually rest solely on the offensive assumption that the public will respond “irrationally” to the truth.  Linmark, <citedDecision>431 U. S., at 96</citedDecision> .  The First Amendment directs us to be especially skeptical of regulations that seek to keep people in the dark for what the government perceives to be their own good.  That teaching applies equally to state attempts to deprive consumers of accurate information about their chosen products: “The commercial marketplace, like other spheres of our social and cultural life, provides a forum where ideas and information flourish.  Some of the ideas and information are vital, some of slight worth.  But the general rule is that the speaker and the audience, not the gov *504 ernment, assess the value of the information presented.  Thus, even a communication that does no more than propose a commercial transaction is entitled to the coverage of the First Amendment.  See Virginia State Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 762.” Edenfield v. Fane, 507 U. S. 761, 767 (1993).  See also Linmark, <citedDecision>431 U. S., at 96</citedDecision> (1977); Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 497-498 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); Tribe, American Constitutional Law § 12-2, at 790, and n. 11.  V In this- case, there is no question that Rhode Island’s price advertising ban constitutes a blanket prohibition against truthful, nonmisleading speech about a lawful product.  There is also no question that the ban serves an end unrelated to consumer protection.  Accordingly, we must review the price advertising ban with “special care,” Central Hudson, 447 U. S., at 566, n. 9 , mindful that speech prohibitions of this type rarely survive constitutional review, ibid. The State argues that the price advertising prohibition should nevertheless be upheld because it directly advances the State’s substantial interest in promoting temperance, and because it is no more extensive than necessary.  Cf. id., at 566 .  Although there is some confusion as to what Rhode Island means by temperance, we assume that the State asserts an interest in reducing alcohol consumption.  14 *505 In evaluating the ban’s effectiveness in advancing the State’s interest, we note that a commercial speech regulation “may not be sustained if it provides only ineffective or remote support for the government’s purpose.” Id., at 564 .

 It is perfectly obvious that alternative forms of regulation that would not involve any restriction on speech would be more likely to achieve the State’s goal of promoting temperance.  As the State’s own expert conceded, higher prices can be maintained either by direct regulation or by increased taxation.  829 F. Supp., at 549 .  Per capita purchases could be limited as is the case with prescription drugs.  Even educational campaigns focused on the problems of excessive, or even moderate, drinking might prove to be more effective.  As a result, even under the less than strict standard that generally applies in commercial speech cases, the State has failed to establish a “reasonable fit” between its abridgment of speech and its temperance goal.  Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989); see also *508 Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 491 (explaining that defects in a federal ban on alcohol advertising are “further highlighted by the availability of alternatives that would prove less intrusive to the First Amendment’s protections for commercial speech”); Linmark, <citedDecision>431 U. S., at 97</citedDecision> (suggesting that the State use financial incentives or counterspeech, rather than speech restrictions, to advance its interests).  It necessarily follows that the price advertising ban cannot survive the more stringent constitutional review that Central Hudson itself concluded was appropriate for the complete suppression of truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech.  447 U. S., at 566, n. 9 .  VI The State responds by arguing that it merely exercised appropriate “legislative judgment” in determining that a price advertising ban would best promote temperance.  Relying on the Central Hudson analysis set forth in Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R., 478 U. S. 328 (1986), and United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co., 509 U. S. 418 (1993), Rhode Island first argues that, because expert opinions as to the effectiveness of the price advertising ban “go both ways,” the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the ban constituted a “reasonable choice” by the legislature.  39 F. 3d, at 7 .  The State next contends that precedent requires us to give particular deference to that legislative choice because the State could, if it chose, ban the sale of alcoholic beverages outright.

 Other than the two Rhode Island Supreme Court decisions upholding the constitutionality of the statutes at issue in this case, only one published state court opinion has considered our summary action in Queensgate in passing on a liquor advertising restriction.  See Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Assn. v. Attorney General, 142 Mich. App. 294 , 370 N. W. 2d 328 (1985).  There, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that Queens-gate did not control because it involved a far narrower restriction on liquor advertising than the one that Michigan had imposed.  142 Mich. App., at 304-305 , 370 N. W. 2d, at 333-335 .  By contrast, the First Amendment does not protect commercial speech about unlawful activities.  See Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm’n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376 (1973).  See Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350 , 355 (1977) (ban on lawyer advertising); Carey v. Population Services Int’l, 431 U. S. 678, 700 (1977) (ban on contraceptive advertising); Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, <citedDecision>431 U. S. 85, 92-94</citedDecision> (1977) (ban on “For Sale” signs); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976) (ban on prescription drug prices); Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 825 (1975) (ban on abortion advertising).  Although Linmark involved a prohibition against a particular means of advertising the sale of one’s home, we treated the restriction as if it were a complete ban because it did not leave open “satisfactory” alternative channels of communication.  431 U. S., at 92-94.  In other words, the regulation failed the fourth step in the four-part inquiry that the majority announced in its opinion.  It wrote: “In commercial speech cases, then, a four-part analysis has developed.  At the outset, we must determine whether the expression is protected by the First Amendment.  For commercial speech to come within that provision, it at least must concern lawful activity and not be misleading.
