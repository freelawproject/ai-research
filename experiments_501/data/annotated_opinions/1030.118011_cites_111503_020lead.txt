 Petitioner nevertheless contends that its suit is not barred by state sovereign immunity.  First, it argues that Congress through the Act abrogated the States’ sovereign immunity.  Alternatively, petitioner maintains that its suit against the Governor may go forward under Ex parte Young, supra. We consider each of those arguments in turn.  II Petitioner argues that Congress through the Act abrogated the States’ immunity from suit.  In order to determine whether Congress has abrogated the States’ sovereign immunity, we ask two questions: first, whether Congress has “unequivocally expresse[d] its intent to abrogate the immunity,” Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68 (1985); and second, whether Congress has acted “pursuant to a valid exercise of power,” ibid. A Congress’ intent to abrogate the States’ immunity from suit must be obvious from “a clear legislative statement.” Blatchford, supra, at 786 .  This rule arises from a recognition of the important role played by the Eleventh Amend *56 ment and the broader principles that it reflects.  See Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 234, 238-239</citedDecision> (1985); Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 345 (1979).  In Atas-cadero, we held that “[a] general authorization for suit in federal court is not the kind of unequivocal statutory language sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment.” <citedDecision>473 U. S., at 246</citedDecision> ; see also Blatchford, supra, at 786, n. 4 (“The fact that Congress grants jurisdiction to hear a claim does not suffice to show Congress has abrogated all defenses to that claim”) (emphases deleted).  Rather, as we said in Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223 (1989): “To temper Congress’ acknowledged powers of abrogation with due concern for the Eleventh Amendment’s role as an essential component of our constitutional structure, we have applied a simple but stringent test: ‘Congress may abrogate the States’ constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.’” Id., at 227-228 .  See also Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468, 474 (1987) (plurality opinion).  Here, we agree with the parties, with the Eleventh Circuit in the decision below, 11 F. 3d, at 1024, and with virtually every other court that has confronted the question 8 that Congress has in § 2710(d)(7) provided an “unmistakably clear” statement of its intent to abrogate.  Section 2710(d)(7)(A)(i) *57 vests jurisdiction in “[t]he United States district courts .  .  .

 The Eleventh Amendment does not exist solely in order to “preven[t] federal-court judgments that must be paid out of a State’s treasury,” Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U. S. 30, 48 (1994); it also serves to avoid “the indignity of subjecting a State to the coercive process of judicial tribunals at the instance of private parties,” Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority, 506 U. S., at 146 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Similarly, petitioner argues that the abrogation power is validly exercised here because the Act grants the States a power that they would not otherwise have, viz., some measure of authority over gaming on Indian lands.  It is true enough that the Act extends to the States a power withheld from them by the Constitution.  See California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, 480 U. S. 202 (1987).  Nevertheless, we do not see how that consideration is relevant to the question whether Congress may abrogate state sovereign immunity.  The Eleventh Amendment immunity may not be lifted by Congress unilaterally deciding that it will be re *59 placed by grant of some other authority.  Cf. Atascadero, <citedDecision>473 U. S., at 246-247</citedDecision> (“[T]he mere receipt of federal funds cannot establish that a State has consented to suit in federal court”).  Thus our inquiry into whether Congress has the power to abrogate unilaterally the States’ immunity from suit is narrowly focused on one question: Was the Act in question passed pursuant to a constitutional provision granting Congress the power to abrogate?  See, e. g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 452-456 (1976).  Previously, in conducting that inquiry, we have found authority to abrogate under only two provisions of the Constitution.  In Fitzpatrick, we recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment, by expanding federal power at the expense of state autonomy, had fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution.  Id., at 455 .  We noted that § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contained prohibitions expressly directed at the States and that § 5 of the Amendment expressly provided that “The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.” See id., at 453 (internal quotation marks omitted).

 Following its conclusion that petitioner’s suit should be dismissed, the Court of Appeals went on to consider how § 2710(d)(7) would operate in the wake of its decision.  The court decided that those provisions of § 2710(d)(7) that were problematic could be severed from the rest of the section, and read the surviving provisions of § 2710(d)(7) to provide an Indian tribe with immediate recourse to the Secretary of the Interior from the dismissal of a suit against a State.  11 F. 3d 1016 , 1029 (1994).  Respondents filed a cross-petition, No. 94-219, challenging only the Eleventh Circuit’s modification of § 2710(d)(7), see n. 4, supra. That petition is still pending.  While the appeal was pending before the Eleventh Circuit, the District Court granted respondents’ earlier filed summary judgment motion, finding that Florida had fulfilled its obligation under the Act to negotiate in good faith.  The Eleventh Circuit has stayed its review of that decision pending the disposition of this ease.  E.g., North Carolina v. Temple, 134 U. S. 22, 30 (1890); Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U. S. 516, 524 (1899); Bell v. Mississippi, 177 U. S. 693 (1900); Smith v. Reeves, 178 U. S. 436, 446 (1900); Palmer v. Ohio, 248 U. S. 32, 34 (1918); Duhne v. New Jersey, 251 U.

Michigan, 800 F. Supp. 1484, 1488-1489 (WD Mich. 1992); Poarch Band of Creek Indians v. Alabama, 776 F. Supp., at 557-558 .  Justice Souter, in his dissenting opinion, argues that in order to avoid a constitutional question, we should interpret the Act to provide only a suit against state officials rather than a suit against the State itself.  Post, at 182.  But in light of the plain text of § 2710(d)(7)(B), we disagree with the dissent’s assertion that the Act can reasonably be read in that way.  “We cannot press statutory construction ‘to the point of disingenuous evasion’ even to avoid a constitutional question.” See United States v. Locke, 471 U. S. 84, 96 (1985), quoting George Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, 289 U. S. 373, 379 (1933) (Cardozo, J.).  We already have found the clear statement rule satisfied, and that finding renders the preference for avoiding a constitutional question inapplicable.
