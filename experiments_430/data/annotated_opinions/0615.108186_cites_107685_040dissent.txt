**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Marshall, dissenting in part.  I join Part I of the Court’s opinion.  However, since I believe that the Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed Williams a jury of 12 to pass upon the question of his guilt or innocence before he could be sent to prison for the rest of his life, I dissent from the affirmance of his conviction.  I adhere to the holding of Duncan v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 145, 149</citedDecision> (1968), that “[bjecause .  .  .  trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American scheme of justice .  .  .  the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in all criminal cases which — were they to be tried in a federal court — would come within the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee.” And I agree with *117 the Court that the same “trial by jury” is guaranteed to state defendants by the Fourteenth Amendment as to federal defendants by the Sixth.
