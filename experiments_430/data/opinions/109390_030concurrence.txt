<p id="Ai0">with whom The Chief Justice joins, concurring.</p>
<p id="b577-9">Although I agree with Mr. Justice White’s view concurring in the result that <em>Lloyd Corp. </em>v. <em>Tanner, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108592"><a href="/opinion/108592/lloyd-corp-v-tanner/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lloyd Corp. v.

<p id="b577-10">The law in this area, particularly with respect to whether First Amendment or labor law principles are applicable, has been less than clear since <em>Logan Valley </em>analogized a shopping center to the “company town” in <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104216"><a href="/opinion/104216/marsh-v-alabama/" aria-description="Citation for case: Marsh v. Alabama">326 U. S. 501</a></span> (1946). Mr. Justice Black, the author of the Court’s opinion in <em><span class="citation" data-id="104216"><a href="/opinion/104216/marsh-v-alabama/" aria-description="Citation for case: Marsh v. Alabama">Marsh</a></span>, </em>thought the decisions were irreconcilable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I now agree <page-number citation-index="1" label="524">*524</page-number>with Mr. Justice Black that the opinions in these cases cannot be harmonized in a principled way. Upon more mature thought, I have concluded that we would have been wiser in <em>Lloyd Corp. </em>to have confronted this disharmony rather than draw distinctions based upon rather attenuated factual differences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b578-5">The Court’s opinion today clarifies the confusion engendered by these cases by accepting Mr. Justice Black’s reading of <em><span class="citation" data-id="104216"><a href="/opinion/104216/marsh-v-alabama/" aria-description="Citation for case: Marsh v. Alabama">Marsh</a></span> </em>and by recognizing more sharply the distinction between the First Amendment and labor law issues that may arise in cases of this kind. It seems to me that this clarification of the law is desirable.</p>

<p id="b577-11"> In his dissent in <em>Logan Valley, </em>Mr. Justice Black stated that <em>“Marsh </em>was never intended to apply to this kind of situation. . . .

I can find very little resemblance between the shopping center involved in this case and Chickasaw, Alabama.” <span class="citation" data-id="107692"><a href="/opinion/107692/amalgamated-food-employees-union-local-590-v-logan-valley-plaza-inc/#330" aria-description="Citation for case: Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v.
