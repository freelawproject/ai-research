 For it was the Act of June 6, 1932 that gave notice to all judges thereafter to be appointed, of .the new Congressional policy to include the judicial .salaries of.  such judges in the assessment of income taxes.  The fact that Judge Woodrough before he became a circuit judge and prior to June 6, 1932, had been 'a 1 district judge *280 is wholly irrelevant, to the matter in issue.  The two offices have different statutory origins, are filled by separate nominations and confirmations, and enjoy different emoluments.  A new appointee to a circuit court of appeals occupies a new office no less, when he is taken from the district bench than when he is drawn from the bar.  By means of § 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932, Congress sought to avoid, at least in part, the consequences of Evans v. Gore, 253 U. S. 245 .  That case, decided on June 1, 1920, ruled for the first time that a provision requiring the compensation received by the judges of the United States to be included in the “gross income” from which the net income is to be computed, although merely part of a taxing measure of general, non-discriminatory application to all earners of incomes, is contrary to Article III, § 1, of the Constitution which provides that the “Compensation” of the “Judges” “shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.” See also the separate opinion of Mr. Justice Field in Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., <citedDecision>157 U. S. 429, 586</citedDecision> , 604 et seq. To be sure, in a letter to Secretary Chase, Chief Justice Taney expressed similar views.  1 In doing so, he merely gave his extra-judicial opinion, asserting at the same time that the question could not be adjudicated.  2 Chief Justice Taney’s vigorous views were shared by Attorney General Hoar.  3 Thereafter, both the Treasury Department 4 and Con *281 gress 5 acted upon this construction of the Constitution.  However, the meaning which Evans v. Gore imputed to the history which explains Article III, § 1, was contrary to the way in which it was read by other English-speaking courts.  6 The decision met wide and steadily growing disfavor from legal scholarship and professional opinion.  7 Evans v. Gore itself was rejected by most of the courts before whom the matter came after that decision.

 But to the extent *283 that what the Court now says is inconsistent with what was said in Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501 , the latter cannot survive.  Judgment reversed.  MR. Justice McReynolds did not hear the argument in this cause and took no part in its consideration or debision.  The letter was written on February 16, 1863, and will be found in 157 U. S. 701 .  “ ... I should not have troubled you with this letter, if there was any mode by which the question could be decided in a judicial proceeding.. But all of the judges of the courts of the United States have an interest in the question, and could not therefore with propriety undertake to hear and decide it.” 157 U. S. at 702.  13 Op. A. G. 161; but see the opinion of Attorney General Palmer, 31 Op. A. G. 475.  See Mr. Justice Field, concurring, in Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., <citedDecision>157 U.

Attorney-General for Saskatchewan [1937] 2 D. L. R. 209, construing § 96 of the British North America Act, 1867, that “The Salaries ... of the Judges .  .  .  shall be fixed and provided by the Parliament of Canada” in connection with the Income Tax Act, 1932, of Saskatchewan.
