However, the facts alleged fall well short of coercion in my view, and I believe the involvement of federal agents in petitioner’s arrest and detention by the State too slight to invoke Anderson. I agree with the Government that the admission of the evidence now protested by petitioner was at most harmless error, and two final contentions — one involving weight of the evidence and another improper prosecutor comment — seem to me without merit. I would thérefore affirm Westover’s conviction. In conclusion: Nothing in the letter or the spirit of the Constitution or in the precedents squares with the heavy-handed and one-sided action that is so precipi *526 tously taken by the Court in the name of fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities. The foray which the Court makes today brings to mind the wise and farsighted words of Mr. Justice Jackson in Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157, 181 (separate opinion): “This Court is forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples have a way of collapsing when one story too many is added.” E. g., Inbau & Reid, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions (1962); O’Hara, Fundamentals of Criminal Investigation (1956); Dienstein, Technics for the Crime Investigator (1952); Mulbar, Interrogation (1951); Kidd, Police Interrogation (1940). As developed by my Brother Harlan, post, pp. 506-514, such cases, with the exception of the long-discredited decision in Brarn v. United States, <targetCase>168 U. S. 532</targetCase> (1897), were adequately treated in terms of due process. The Court points to England, Scotland, Ceylon and India as having equally rigid rules. As my Brother Harlan points out, post, pp. 521-523, the Court is mistaken in this regard, for it overlooks counterbalancing prosecutorial advantages. Moreover, the requirements of the Federal Bureau of Investigation do not appear from the Solicitor General’s letter, ante, pp. 484-486, to be as strict as *501 those imposed today in at least two respects: (1) The offer of counsel is articulated only as “a right to counsel”; nothing is said about a right to have counsel present at the custodial interrogation. (See also the examples cited by the Solicitor General, Westover v. United States, 342 F. 2d 684, 685 (1965) (“right to consult counsel”); Jackson v. United States, 337 F. 2d 136, 138 (1964) (accused “entitled to an attorney”).)

Rather, the statement may well be interpreted by the suspect to mean that the burden is placed upon himself and that he may have counsel appointed only when brought before the judge or at trial — but not at custodial interrogation. As I view the FBI practice, it is not as broad as the one laid down today by the Court. In my view there is “no significant support” in our cases for the holding of the Court today that the Fifth Amendment privilege, in effect, forbids custodial interrogation. For a discussion of this point see the dissenting opinion of my Brother White, post, pp. 526-531. My discussion in this opinion is directed to the main questions decided by the Court and necessary to its decision; in ignoring some of the collateral points, I do not mean to imply agreement. The case was Bram v. United States, <targetCase>168 U. S. 532</targetCase> (quoted, ante, p. 461). Its historical premises were afterwards disproved by Wigmore, who concluded “that no assertions could be more unfounded.” 3 Wigmore, Evidence § 823, at 250, n. 5 (3d ed. 1940). The Court in United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 41, declined to choose between <targetCase>Bram</targetCase> and Wigmore, and Stein v. New York, 346 U. S. 156, 191, n. 35, cast further doubt on <targetCase>Bram</targetCase>. There are, however, several Court opinions which assume in dicta the relevance of the. Fifth Amendment privilege to confessions. Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U. S. 465, 475; see Shotwell Mfg. Co. v. United States, 371 U. S. 341, 347. On <targetCase>Bram</targetCase> and the federal confession cases generally, see Developments in the Law — Confessions, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 935, 959-961 (1966). Comment, 31 U. Chi. L. Rev. 313 & n. 1 (1964), states that by the 1963 Term 33 state coerced-confession cases had been decided by this Court, apart from per curiams. Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 321, n. 2, collects 28 cases.
