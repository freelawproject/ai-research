 As the present Chief Justice said in dissent in the Gobitis case, the State may “require teaching by instruction and study of all in our history and in the structure and organization of our government, including the guaranties of civil liberty, which tend to inspire patriotism and love of country.” 310 U. S. at 604 .  Here, however, we are dealing with a compulsion of students to declare a belief.  They are not merely made acquainted with the flag salute so that they may be informed as to what it is or even what it means.  The issue here is whether this slow and easily neglected 11 route to aroused loyalties constitutionally may be short-cut by substituting a compulsory salute and slogan.  12 This issue is not prejudiced by *632 the Court’s previous holding that where a State, without compelling attendance, extends college facilities to pupils who voluntarily enroll, it may prescribe military training as part of the course without offense to the Constitution.  It was held that those who take advantage of its opportunities may not on ground of conscience refuse compliance with such conditions.  Hamilton v. Regents, <citedDecision>293 U. S. 245</citedDecision> .  In the present case attendance is not optional.  That case is also to be distinguished from the present one because, independently of college privileges or requirements, the State has power to raise militia and impose the duties of service therein upon its citizens.  There is no doubt that, in connection with the pledges, the flag salute is a form of utterance.  Symbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating ideas.  The use of an emblem or flag to symbolize some system, idea, institution, or personality, is a short cut from mind to mind.  Causes and nations, political parties, lodges and ecclesiastical groups seek to knit the loyalty of their followings to a flag or banner, a color or design.
