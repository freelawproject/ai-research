 .  .  the trial by jury ever has been, and I trust ever will be, looked upon as the glory of the English law. And if it has so great an advantage over others in regulating civil property, how much must that advantage be heightened when it is applied to criminal cases!  ... [I]t is the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy, or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his *10 liberty, or his person, but by the unanimous consent of twelve of his neighbours and equals.” 13 Trial by jury in a court of law and in accordance with traditional modes of procedure after an indictment by grand jury has served and remains one of our most vital barriers to governmental arbitrariness.  These elemental procedural safeguards were embedded in our Constitution to.  secure their inviolateness and sanctity against the passing demands of expediency or convenience.  The keystone of supporting authorities mustered by the Court’s opinion last June to justify its holding that Art. Ill, § 2, and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not apply abroad was In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> .  The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case is one of those cases that cannot be understood except in its peculiar setting; even then, it seems highly unlikely that a similar result would be reached today.  Ross was serving as a seaman on an American ship in Japanese waters.  He killed a ship’s officer, was seized and tried before a consular “court” in Japan.  At that time, statutes authorized American consuls to try American citizens charged with committing crimes in Japan and certain other “non-Christian” countries.  14 These *11 statutes provided that the laws of the United States were to govern the trial except: “.  .  .  where such laws are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies, the common law and the law of equity and admiralty shall be extended in like manner over such citizens and others in those countries; and if neither the common law, nor the law of equity or admiralty, nor the statutes of the United States, furnish appropriate and sufficient remedies, the ministers in those countries, respectively, shall, by decrees and regulations which shall have the force of law, supply such defects and deficiencies.” 15 The consular power approved in the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case was about as extreme and absolute as that of the potentates of the “non-Christian” countries to which the statutes applied.  Under these statutes consuls could and did make the criminal laws, initiate charges, arrest alleged offenders, try them, and after conviction take away their liberty or their life — sometimes at the American consulate.  Such a blending of executive, legislative, and judicial powers in one person or even in one branch of the Government is ordinarily regarded as the very acme of absolutism.  16 Nevertheless, the Court sustained Ross’ conviction by the consul.  It stated that constitutional *12 protections applied “only to citizens and others within the United States, or who are brought there for trial for alleged offences committed elsewhere, and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad.” 17 Despite the fact that it upheld Ross’ conviction under United States laws passed pursuant to asserted constitutional authority, the Court went on to make a sweeping declaration that “[t]he Constitution can have no operation in another country.” 18 The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> approach that the Constitution has no applicability abroad has long since been directly repudiated by numerous cases. 19 That approach is obviously erroneous if the United States Government, which has no power except that granted by the Constitution, can and does try citizens for crimes committed abroad.  20 Thus the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case rested, at least in substantial part, on a fundamental misconception and the most that can be said in support of the result reached there is that the consular court jurisdiction had a long history antedating the adoption of the Constitution.  The Congress has recently buried the consular system of trying Americans.  21 We are not willing to jeopardize the lives and liberties of Americans by disinterring it.  At best, the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case should be left as a relic from a different era.  The Court’s opinion last Term alsp relied on the “Insular Cases” to support its conclusion that Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were not applicable *13 to the trial of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert.  22 We believe that reliance was misplaced.  The “Insular Cases,” which arose at the turn of the century, involved territories which had only recently been conquered or acquired by the United States.  These territories, governed and regulated by Congress under Art. IV, § 3, 23 had entirely different cultures and customs from those of this country.  This Court, although closely divided, 24 ruled that certain constitutional safeguards were not applicable to these territories since they had not been “expressly or impliedly incorporated” into the Union by Congress.  While conceding that “fundamental” constitutional rights applied everywhere, 25 the majority found that it would disrupt long-established practices and would be inexpedient to require a jury trial after an indictment by a grand jury in the insular possessions.

*65 Mr. Justice Harlan, concurring in the result.  I concur in the result, on the narrow ground that where the offense is capital, Article 2 (ll) 1 cannot constitutionally be applied to the trial of civilian dependents of members of the armed forces overseas in times of peace.  Since I am the only one among today’s majority who joined in the Court’s opinions of June 11, 1956, which sustained the court-martial jurisdiction in these cases, 351 U. S. 470, 487 , I think it appropriate to state the reasons which led to my voting, first, to rehear these cases, 352 U. S. 901 , and, now, to strike down that jurisdiction.  I.  The petitions for rehearing which were filed last summer afforded an opportunity for a greater degree of reflection upon the difficult issues involved in these cases than, at least for me, was possible in the short interval between the argument and decision of the cases in the closing days of last Term. 2 As a result I became satisfied that this court-martial jurisdiction could in any event not be sustained upon the reasoning of our prior opinion.  In essence, that reasoning was this: (1) Under In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> , and the Insular Cases, 3 the requirement of a trial by an Article III court and the other specific safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are not applicable to the trial of American citizens outside the United States; (2) there is thus no express constitutional prohibition against the use of courts- *66 martial for such trials abroad; (3) the choice of a court-martial in cases such as these was “reasonable,” because of these women’s connection with the military, and therefore satisfied due process; (4) the court-martial jurisdiction was thus constitutional.  I have since concluded that this analysis was not sound, for two reasons: (1) The underlying premise of the prior opinion, it seems to me, is that under the Constitution the mere absence of a prohibition against an asserted power, plus the abstract reasonableness of its use, is enough to establish the existence of the power.  I think this is erroneous.  The powers of Congress, unlike those of the English Parliament, are constitutionally circumscribed.  Under the Constitution Congress has only such powers as are expressly granted or those that are implied as reasonably necessary and proper to carry out the granted powers.  Hence the constitutionality of the statute here in question must be tested, not by abstract notions of what is reasonable “in the large,” so to speak, but by whether the statute, as applied in these instances, is a reasonably necessary and proper means of implementing a power granted to Congress by the Constitution.  To say that the validity of the statute may be rested upon the inherent “sovereign powers” of this country in its dealings with foreign nations seems to me to be no more than begging the question.  As I now see it, the validity of this court-martial jurisdiction must depend upon whether the statute, as applied to these women, can be justified as an exercise of the power, granted to Congress by Art. I, § 8, cl. 14 of the Constitution, “To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.” I can find no other constitutional power to which this statute can properly be related.  I therefore think that we were wrong last Term in considering that we need not decide *67 the case in terms of the Article I power.  In my opinion that question squarely confronts us.  (2) I also think that we were mistaken in interpreting <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases as standing for the sweeping proposition that the safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments automatically have no application to the trial of American citizens outside the United States, no matter what the circumstances.  Aside from the questionable wisdom of mortgaging the future by such a broad pronouncement, I am satisfied that our prior holding swept too lightly over the historical context in which this Court upheld the jurisdiction of the old consular and territorial courts in those cases. I shall not repeat what my brother Frankfurter has written on this subject, with which I agree.  But I do not go as far as my brother Black seems to go on this score.  His opinion, if I understand it correctly, in effect discards <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases as historical anomalies.  I believe that those cases, properly understood, still have vitality, and that, for reasons suggested later, which differ from those given in our prior opinions, they have an important bearing on the question now before us.  II.  I come then to the question whether this court-martial jurisdiction can be justified as an exercise of Congress’ Article I power to regulate the armed forces.  At the outset, I cannot accept the implication of my brother Black’s opinion that this Article I power was intended to be unmodified by the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, 4 and that therefore this power *68 is incapable of expansion under changing circumstances.  The historical evidence, in fact, shows quite the opposite.  True, the records of the time indicate that the Founders shared a deep fear of an unchecked military branch.

 This responsibility which is vested in the military commander extends to the administration and supervision of the operation and use of all facilities and major activities of the community including the proper control of occupants and users which is inherent in such supervision overseas.  In the absence of a supporting judicial system responsive to the same government as the military, such as is the case existing in the United States and overseas possessions, and as the law enforcement requirement stems primarily from the immediate unalterable responsibilities of the overseas commander and his subordinate commanders, it is essential that the commander be vested with the law enforcement authority commensurate with his responsibilities.” It seems to me clear on such a basis that these dependents, when sent overseas by the Government, become pro tanto a part of the military community.  I cannot say, therefore, that it is irrational or arbitrary for Congress to subject them to military discipline.  I do not deal now, of course, with the problem of alternatives to court-martial jurisdiction; all that needs to be established at this stage is that, viewing Art. I, § 8, cl. 14 in isolation, subjection of civilian dependents overseas to court-martial jurisdiction can in no wise be deemed unrelated to the power of Congress to make all necessary and proper laws to insure the effective governance of our overseas land and naval forces.  *74 B. I turn now to the other side of the coin.  For no matter how practical and how reasonable this jurisdiction might be, it still cannot be sustained if the Constitution guarantees to these army wives a trial in an Article III court, with indictment by grand jury and jury trial as provided by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  We return, therefore, to the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> question: to what extent do these provisions of the Constitution apply outside the United States?  As I have already stated, I do not think that it can be said that these safeguards of the Constitution are never operative without the United States, regardless of the particular circumstances.  On the other hand, I cannot agree with the suggestion that every provision of the Constitution must always be deemed automatically applicable to American citizens in every part of the world.  For <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases do stand for an important proposition, one which seems to me a wise and necessary gloss on our Constitution.  The proposition is, of course, not that the Constitution “does not apply” overseas, but that there are provisions in the Constitution which do not necessarily apply in all circumstances in every foreign place.  In other words, it seems to me that the basic teaching of <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases is that there is no rigid and abstract rule that Congress, as a condition precedent to exercising power over Americans overseas, must exercise it subject to all the guarantees of the Constitution, no matter what the conditions and considerations are that would make adherence to a specific guarantee altogether impracticable and anomalous.  To take but one example: Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U. S. 298 , is not good authority for the proposition that jury trials need never be provided for American citizens tried by *75 the United States abroad; but the case is good authority for the proposition that there is no rigid rule that jury trial must always be provided in the trial of an American overseas, if the circumstances are such that trial by jury would be impractical and anomalous.  In other words, what <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases hold is that the particular local setting, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives are relevant to a question of judgment, namely, whether jury trial should be deemed a necessary condition of the exercise of Congress’ power to provide for the trial of Americans overseas.  I think the above thought is crucial in approaching the cases before us.  Decision is easy if one adopts the constricting view that these constitutional guarantees as a totality do or do not “apply” overseas.  But, for me, the question is which guarantees of the Constitution should apply in view of the particular circumstances, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives which Congress had before it.  The question is one of judgment, not of compulsion.  And so I agree with my brother ErankfuRter that, in view of <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases, we have before us a question analogous, ultimately, to issues of due process; one can say, in fact, that-the question of which specific safeguards of the Constitution are appropriately to be applied in a particular context overseas can be reduced to the issue of what process is “due” a defendant in the particular circumstances of a particular case. On this basis, I cannot agree with the sweeping proposition that a full Article III trial, with indictment and trial by jury, is required in every case for the trial of a civilian dependent of a serviceman overseas.  The Government, it seems to me, has made an impressive showing that at least for the run-of-the-mill offenses committed by dependents overseas, such a requirement would *76 be as impractical and as anomalous as it would have been to require jury trial for Balzac in Porto Rico.  12 Again, I need not go into details, beyond stating that except for capital offenses, such as we have here, to which, in my opinion, special considerations apply, I am by no means ready to say that Congress’ power to provide for trial by court-martial of civilian dependents overseas is limited by Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  *77 Where, if at all, the dividing line should be drawn among cases not capital, need not now be decided.  We are confronted here with capital offenses alone; and it seems to me particularly unwise now to decide more than we have to.  Our far-flung foreign military establishments are a new phenomenon in our national life, and I think it would be unfortunate were we unnecessarily to foreclose, as my four brothers would do, our future consideration of the broad questions involved in maintaining the effectiveness of these national outposts, in the light of continuing experience with these problems.  So far as capital cases are concerned, I think they stand on quite a different footing than other offenses.  In such cases the law is especially sensitive to demands for that procedural fairness which inheres in a civilian trial where the judge and trier of fact are not responsive to the command of the convening authority.  I do not concede that whatever process is “due” an offender faced with a fine or a prison sentence necessarily satisfies the requirements of the Constitution in a capital case. The distinction is by no means novel, compare Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 , with Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 ; nor is it negligible, being literally that between life and death.  And, under what I deem to be the correct view of <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases, it is precisely the kind of distinction which plays a large role in the process of weighing the competing considerations which lead to sound judgment upon the question whether certain safeguards of the Constitution should be given effect in the trial of an American citizen abroad.  In fact, the Government itself has conceded that one grave offense, treason, presents a special case: “The gravity of this offense is such that we can well assume that, whatever difficulties may be involved in trial far from the scene of the offense .  .  .  the trial should be in our courts.” I see no reason for not applying the same principle to any case where a civilian *78 dependent stands trial on pain of life itself.  The number of such cases would appear to be so negligible that the practical problems of affording the defendant a civilian trial would not present insuperable problems.  On this narrow ground I concur in the result in these cases. 50 U. S. C. § 552 (11).

**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Clark, with whom Mr. Justice Burton joins, dissenting.  The Court today releases two women from prosecution though the evidence shows that they brutally killed their husbands, both American soldiers, while stationed with them in quarters furnished by our armed forces on its military installations in foreign lands.  In turning these women free, it declares unconstitutional an important section of an Act of Congress governing our armed forces.  Furthermore, four of my brothers would specifically overrule and two would impair the long-recognized vitality of an old and respected precedent in our law, the case of In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> (1891), cited by this Court with approval in many opinions and as late as 1929 by a unanimous Court 1 in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 451 .  And, finally, the Court reverses, sets aside, and overrules two majority opinions and judgments of this Court in these same cases, reported in 351.U.  S., at 470 and 487, and entered on June 11,1956, less than 12 months ago.  In substitute therefor it enters no opinion whatever for the Court. It is unable to muster a majority.  Instead, there are handed down three opinions.  But, worst of all, it gives no authoritative guidance as to what, if anything, the Executive or the Congress may do to remedy the distressing situation in which they now find themselves.  *79 MR. Justice Burton and I remain convinced that the former opinions of the Court are correct and that they set forth valid constitutional doctrine under the long-recognized cases of this Court. The opinions were neither written nor agreed to in haste and they reflect the consensus of the majority reached after thorough discussion at many conferences.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Upon attack by an enemy they would be so treated; all foreign governments so recognized them at all times; and, in addition, it has been clearly shown, unlike in Toth, that “the discipline of the Army is going to be disrupted, its morale impaired, or its orderly processes disturbed” by excluding them from the provisions of the Uniform Code. Every single one of our major military commanders over the world has filed a statement to this effect in this case. We should not substitute our views as to this necessity for the views of those charged with the responsibility of the protection of such far-flung outposts of the free world.  The former minority, however, repudiates this underlying basis of the opinion in Toth, namely, that where disciplinary measures are necessary to the regulation of the armed forces the Congress does have constitutional power to make rules.  In my opinion the rules it has made are necessary to the regulation of the land and naval forces and the means chosen, the Uniform Code, is in no way an unreasonable one.
