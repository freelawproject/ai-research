<p id="AC2">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b241-7">After the convictions of petitioners had been affirmed, and while their cases were pending here, it was revealed that the United States had engaged in electronic surveillance which might have violated their Fourth Amendment rights and tainted their convictions. A remand to the District Court being necessary in each case for adjudication in the first instance, the questions now before us relate to the standards and procedures to be followed by the District Court in determining whether any of the Government's evidence supporting these convictions was the product of illegal surveillance to which any of the petitioners are entitled to object.</p>
<p id="b241-8">No. 133, O. T., 1967. Petitioners Alderman and Al-derisio, along with Ruby Kolod, now deceased, were convicted of conspiring to transmit murderous threats in interstate commerce, 18 U. S. C. §§ 371, 875 (c). Their convictions were affirmed on appeal, 371 F. 2d 983 (C. A. 10th Cir. 1967), and this Court denied certiorari, 389 U. S. 834 (1967). In their petition for rehearing, petitioners alleged they had recently discovered that Alderisio’s place of business in Chicago had been the subject of electronic surveillance by the Government. Reading the response of the Government to admit that Alderisio’s conversations had been overheard by unlawful <page-number citation-index="1" label="168">*168</page-number>electronic eavesdropping,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we granted the petition for rehearing over the objection of the United States that “no overheard conversation in which any of the petitioners participated is arguably relevant to this prosecution.” In our per <em>curiam </em>opinion, 390 U. S. 136 (1968), we refused to accept the <em>ex parte </em>determination of relevance by the Department of Justice in lieu of adversary proceedings in the District Court, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings.</p>
<p id="b242-5">The United States subsequently filed a motion to modify that order. Although accepting the Court’s order insofar as it required judicial determination of whether any of the prosecution’s evidence was the product of illegal surveillance, the United States urged that in order to protect innocent third parties participating or referred to in- irrelevant conversations overheard by the Government, surveillance records should first be subjected to <em>in camera </em>inspection by the trial judge, who would then turn over to the petitioners and their counsel only those materials arguably relevant to their prosecution. Petitioners opposed the motion, and the matter was argued before the Court last Term. We then set the case down for reargument at the opening of the current Term, 392 U. S. 919 (1968), the attention of the parties being directed to the disclosure issue and the question of <page-number citation-index="1" label="169">*169</page-number>standing to object to the Government’s use of the fruits of illegal surveillance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b243-5">Nos. 11 and 197. Both petitioners were convicted of conspiring to transmit to the Soviet Union information relating to the national defense of the United States, 18 U. S. C. §§ 794 (a), (c), and of conspiring to violate 18 U. S. C. § 951 by causing Butenko to act as an agent of the Soviet Union without prior notification to the Secretary of State. Butenko was also convicted of a substantive offense under 18 U. S. C. § 951. The Court of Appeals affirmed all but Ivanov’s conviction on the second conspiracy count. 384 F. 2d 554 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1967). Petitions for certiorari were then filed in this Court, as was a subsequent motion to amend the <page-number citation-index="1" label="170">*170</page-number><em>Ivanov </em>petition to raise an issue similar to that which was presented in No. 133, O. T. 1967.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Following the first argument in <em>Alderman (sub nom. Kolod </em>v. <em>United States), </em>the petitions for certiorari of both Ivanov and Butenko were granted, limited to questions nearly identical to those involved in the reargument of the <em>Alderman </em>case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b245-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="171">*171</page-number>I.</p>
<p id="b245-5">The exclusionary rule fashioned in <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U. S. 383 (1914), and <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643 (1961), excludes from a criminal trial any evidence seized from the defendant in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. Fruits of such evidence are excluded as well. <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U. S. 385, 391-392 (1920). Because the Amendment now affords protection against the uninvited ear, oral statements, if illegally overheard, and their fruits are also subject to suppression. <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>365 U. S. 505 (1961); <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U. S. 347 (1967).</p>
<p id="b245-6">In <em>Mapp </em>and <em>Weeks, </em>the defendant against whom the evidence was held to be inadmissible was the victim of the search. However, in the cases before us each petitioner demands retrial if any of the evidence used to convict him was the product of unauthorized surveillance, regardless of whose Fourth Amendment rights the surveillance violated. At the very least, it is urged that if evidence is inadmissible against one defendant or conspirator, because tainted by electronic surveillance illegal as to him, it is also inadmissible against his codefendant or coconspirator.</p>
<p id="b245-7">This expansive reading of the Fourth Amendment and of the exclusionary rule fashioned to enforce it is admittedly inconsistent with prior cases, and we reject it. The established principle is that suppression of the product of a Fourth Amendment violation can be successfully urged only by those whose rights were vio<page-number citation-index="1" label="172">*172</page-number>lated by the search itself, not by those who are aggrieved solely by the introduction of damaging evidence. Co-conspirators and codefendants have been accorded no special standing.</p>
<p id="b246-6">Thus in <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>United States, </em>316 U. S. 114 (1942), testimony induced by disclosing to witnesses their own telephonic communications intercepted by the Government contrary to 47 U. S. C. § 605 was held admissible against their coconspirators. The Court equated the rule under § 605 with the exclusionary rule under the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 471 (1963), came to like conclusions. There, two defendants were tried together; narcotics seized from a third party were held inadmissible against one defendant because they were the product of statements made by him at the time of his unlawful arrest. But the same narcotics were found to be admissible against the codefendant because “[t]he seizure of this <page-number citation-index="1" label="173">*173</page-number>heroin invaded no right of privacy of person or premises which would entitle [him] to object to its use at his trial. Cf. <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>United States, </em>316 U. S. 114.” <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 492.</p>
<p id="b247-4">The rule is stated in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 257, 261 (1960):</p>
<blockquote id="b247-5">“In order to qualify as a ‘person aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure’ one must have been a victim of a search or seizure, one against whom the search was directed, as distinguished from one who claims prejudice only through the use of evidence gathered as a consequence of a search or seizure directed at someone else. . . .</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b247-6">“Ordinarily, then, it is entirely proper to require of one who seeks to challenge the legality of a search as the basis for suppressing relevant evidence that he allege, and if the allegation be disputed that he establish, that he himself was the victim of an invasion of privacy.” <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>
<p id="b247-7">This same principle was twice acknowledged last Term. <em>Mancusi </em>v. <em>DeForte, </em>392 U. S. 364 (1968); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U. S. 377 (1968).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b248-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="174">*174</page-number>We adhere to these cases and to the general rule that Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted. <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U. S. 377 (1968); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 267 (1960). Cf. <em>Tileston </em>v. <em>Ullman, </em>318 U. S. 44, 46 (1943). None of the special circumstances which prompted <em>NAACP </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>357 U. S. 449 (1958), and <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>346 U. S. 249 (1953), are present here. There is no necessity to exclude evidence against one defendant in order to protect the rights of another. No rights of the victim of an illegal search are at stake when the evidence is offered against some other party. The victim can and very probably will object for himself when and if it becomes important for him to do so.</p>
<p id="b248-5">What petitioners appear to assert is an independent constitutional right of their own to exclude relevant and probative evidence because it was seized from another in violation of the Fourth Amendment. But we think there is a substantial difference for constitutional purposes between preventing the incrimination of a defendant through the very evidence illegally seized from him and suppressing evidence on the motion of a party who cannot claim this predicate for exclusion.</p>
<p id="b248-6">The necessity for that predicate was not eliminated by recognizing and acknowledging the deterrent aim of the rule. See <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U. S. 618 (1965); <em>Elkins </em>v. <em>United States, </em>364 U. S. 206 (1960). Neither those cases nor any others hold that anything which deters illegal searches is thereby commanded by the Fourth Amendment. The deterrent values of preventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated have been considered sufficient to justify the suppression of probative evidence even though the case against the defendant is weakened or destroyed. We adhere to that judgment. But we are not convinced that <page-number citation-index="1" label="175">*175</page-number>the additional benefits of extending the exclusionary rule to other defendants would justify further encroachment upon the public interest in prosecuting those accused of crime and having them acquitted or convicted on the basis of all the evidence which exposes the truth.</p>
<p id="b249-4">We do not deprecate Fourth Amendment rights. The security of persons and property remain's a fundamental value which law enforcement officers must respect. Nor should those who flout the rules escape unscathed. In this respect we are mindful that there is now a comprehensive statute making unauthorized electronic surveillance a serious crime.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The general rule under the statute is that official eavesdropping and wiretapping are permitted only with probable cause and a warrant. Without experience showing the contrary, we should not assume that this new statute will be cavalierly disregarded or will not be enforced against transgressors.</p>
<p id="b249-5">Of course, Congress or state legislatures may extend the exclusionary rule and provide that illegally seized evidence is inadmissible against anyone for any purpose.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> But for constitutional purposes, we are not now <page-number citation-index="1" label="176">*176</page-number>inclined to expand the existing rule that unlawful wiretapping or eavesdropping, whether deliberate or negligent, can produce nothing usable against the person aggrieved by the invasion.</p>
<p id="b250-4">II.</p>
<p id="b250-5">In these cases, therefore, any petitioner would be entitled to the suppression of government evidence originating in electronic surveillance violative of his own Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. Such violation would occur if the United States unlawfully overheard conversations of a petitioner himself or conversations occurring on his premises, whether or not he was present or participated in those conversations. The United States concedes this much and agrees that for purposes of a hearing to determine whether the Government’s evidence is tainted by illegal surveillance, the transcripts or recordings of the overheard conversations of any petitioner or of third persons on his premises must be duly and properly examined in the District Court.</p>
<p id="b250-6">MR. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart, who are in partial dissent on this phase of the case, object to our protecting the homeowner against the use of third-party conversations overheard on his premises by an unauthorized surveillance. Their position is that unless the conversational privacy of the homeowner himself is invaded, there is no basis in the Fourth Amendment for excluding third-party conversations overheard on his premises. We cannot agree. If the police make an unwarranted search of a house and seize tangible property belonging to third parties — even a transcript of a third-party conversation — the homeowner may object to <page-number citation-index="1" label="177">*177</page-number>its use against him, not because he had any interest in the seized items as “effects” protected by the Fourth Amendment, but because they were the fruits of an unauthorized search of his house, which is itself expressly protected by the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nothing seen or found on the premises may legally form the basis for an arrest or search warrant or for testimony at the homeowner’s trial, since the prosecution would be using the fruits of a Fourth Amendment violation. <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U. S. 385 (1920); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U. S. 10 (1948); <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 471 (1963).</p>
<p id="b251-5">The Court has characteristically applied the same rule where an unauthorized electronic surveillance is carried out by physical invasion of the premises. This much the dissent frankly concedes. Like physical evidence which might be seized, overheard conversations are fruits <page-number citation-index="1" label="178">*178</page-number>of an illegal entry and are inadmissible in evidence. <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>365 U. S. 505 (1961); <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>When <em>Silverman </em>was decided, no right of conversational privacy had been recognized as such; the right vindicated in that case was the Fourth Amendment right to be secure in one’s own home. In <em>Wong Sun, </em>the words spoken by Blackie Toy when the police illegally entered his house were not usable against him because they were the fruits of a physical invasion of his premises which violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p id="b252-6">Because the Court has now decided that the Fourth Amendment protects a person’s private conversations as well as his private premises, <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em>389 U. S. 347 (1967), the dissent would discard the concept that private conversations overheard through an illegal entry into a private place must be excluded as the fruits of a Fourth Amendment violation. Although officers without a valid warrant may not search a house for physical evidence or incriminating information, whether the owner is present or away, the dissent would permit them to enter that house without consent and without a warrant, install a listening device, and use any overheard third-party conversations against the owner in a criminal case, in spite of the obvious violation of his Fourth Amendment right to be secure in his own dwelling. Even if the owner is present on his premises during the surveillance, he would have no complaint unless his own conversations were offered or used against him. Information from a telephone tap or from the microphone in the kitchen or in the rooms of guests or children would be freely usable as long as the homeowner’s own conversations are not monitored and used against him. Indeed, if the police, instead of installing a device, secreted themselves on the premises, they could neither testify about nor use against the owner anything they <page-number citation-index="1" label="179">*179</page-number>saw or carried away, but would be free to use against him everything they overheard except his own conversations. And should police overhear third parties describing narcotics which they have discovered in the owner’s desk drawer, the police could not then open the drawer and seize the narcotics, but they could secure a warrant on the basis of what they had heard and forthwith seize the narcotics pursuant to that warrant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b253-5">These views we do not accept. We adhere to the established view in this Court that the right to be secure in one’s house against unauthorized intrusion is not limited to protection against a policeman viewing or seizing tangible property — “papers” and “effects.” Otherwise, the express security for the home provided by the Fourth Amendment would approach redundancy. The rights of the owner of the premises are as clearly <page-number citation-index="1" label="180">*180</page-number>invaded when the police enter and install a listening device in his house as they are when the entry is made to undertake a warrantless search for tangible property; and the prosecution as surely employs the fruits of an illegal search of the home when it offers overheard third-party conversations as it does when it introduces tangible evidence belonging not to the homeowner, but to others. Nor do we believe that <em>Katz, </em>by holding that the Fourth Amendment protects persons and their private conversations, was intended to withdraw any of the protection which the Amendment extends to the home or to overrule the existing doctrine, recognized at least since <em>Silverman, </em>that conversations as well as property are excludable from the criminal trial when they are found to be the fruits of an illegal invasion of the home. It was noted in <em>Silverman, </em>365 U. S., at 511-512, that</p>
<blockquote id="b254-4">“This Court has never held that a federal officer may without warrant and without consent physically entrench into a man’s office or home, there secretly observe or listen, and relate at the man’s subsequent criminal triai what was seen or heard.”</blockquote>
<p id="b254-5">The Court proceeded to hold quite the contrary. We take the same course here.</p>
<p id="b254-6">III.</p>
<p id="b254-7">The remaining aspect of these cases relates to the procedures to be followed by the District Court in resolving the ultimate issue which will be before it — whether the evidence against any petitioner grew out of his illegally overheard conversations or conversations occurring on his premises.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The question as stated in <em>Wong Sun </em>v. <em>United States, </em>371 U. S. 471, 488 (1963), is “ ‘whether, <page-number citation-index="1" label="181">*181</page-number>granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.’ ” See also <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 U. S. 338, 341 (1939).</p>
<p id="b255-5">The Government concedes that it must disclose to petitioners any surveillance records which are relevant to the decision of this ultimate issue. And it recognizes that this disclosure must be made even though attended by potential danger to the reputation or safety of third parties or to the national security — unless the United States would prefer dismissal of the case to disclosure of the information. However, the Government contends that it need not be put to this disclose-or-dismiss option in the instant cases because none of the information obtained from its surveillance is “arguably relevant” to petitioners’ convictions, in the sense that none of the overheard conversations arguably underlay any of the evidence offered in these cases. Although not now insisting that its own evaluation of relevance should be accepted automatically and without judicial scrutiny, the United States urges that the records of the specified conversations be first submitted to the trial judge for an <em>in camera </em>examination. Any record found arguably relevant by the judge would be turned over to the petitioner whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated, and that petitioner would then have the opportunity to use the disclosed information in his attempt to show that the Government has used tainted evidence to convict him. Material not arguably relevant would not be disclosed to any petitioner.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b256-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="182">*182</page-number>Although this may appear a modest proposal, especially since the standard for disclosure would be “arguable” relevance, we conclude that surveillance records as to which any petitioner has standing to object should be turned over to him without being screened <em>in camera </em>by the trial judge. Admittedly, there may be much learned from an electronic surveillance which ultimately contributes nothing to probative evidence. But winnowing this material from those items which might have made a substantial contribution to the case against a petitioner is a task which should not be entrusted wholly to the court in the first instance. It might be otherwise if the trial judge had only to place the transcript or other record of the surveillance alongside the record evidence and compare the two for textual or substantive similarities. Even that assignment would be difficult enough for the trial judge to perform unaided. But a good deal more is involved. An apparently innocent phrase, a chance remark, a reference to what appears to be a neutral person or event, the identity of a caller or the individual on the other end of a telephone, or even the manner of speaking or using words may have special significance to one who knows the more intimate facts of an accused’s life. And yet that information may be wholly colorless and devoid of meaning to one less well acquainted with all relevant circumstances. Unavoidably, this is a matter of judgment, but in our view the task is too complex, and the margin for error too great, to rely wholly on the <em>in camera </em>judgment of the trial court to identify those records which might have contributed to the Government’s case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b257-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="183">*183</page-number>The United States concedes that when an illegal search has come to light, it has the ultimate burden of persuasion to show that its evidence is untainted. But at the same time petitioners acknowledge that they must go forward with specific evidence demonstrating taint. “[T]he trial judge must give opportunity, however closely confined, to the accused to prove that a substantial portion of the case against him was a fruit of the poisonous tree. This leaves ample opportunity to the Government to convince the trial court that its proof had an independent origin.” <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 U. S. 338, 341 (1939). With this task ahead of them, and if the hearings are to be more than a formality and petitioners not left entirely to reliance on government testimony, there should be turned over to them the records of those overheard conversations which the Government was not entitled to use in building its case against them.</p>
<p id="b257-5">Adversary proceedings are a major aspect of our system of criminal justice. Their superiority as a means for attaining justice in a given case is nowhere more evident than in those cases, such as the ones at bar, where an issue must be decided on the basis of a large volume of <page-number citation-index="1" label="184">*184</page-number>factual materials, and after consideration of the many and subtle interrelationships which may exist among the facts reflected by these records. As the need for adversary inquiry is increased by the complexity of the issues presented for adjudication, and by the consequent inadequacy of <em>ex parte </em>procedures as a means for their accurate resolution, the displacement of well-informed advocacy necessarily becomes less justifiable.</p>
<p id="b258-6">Adversary proceedings will not magically eliminate all error, but they will substantially reduce its incidence by guarding against the possibility that the trial judge, through lack of time or unfamiliarity with the information contained in and suggested by the materials, will be unable to provide the scrutiny which the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule demands. It may be that the prospect of disclosure will compel the Government to dismiss some prosecutions in deference to national security or third-party interests. But this is a choice the Government concededly faces with respect to material which it has obtained illegally and which it admits, or which a judge would find, is arguably relevant to the evidence offered against the defendant.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b258-7">We think this resolution will avoid an exorbitant expenditure of judicial time and energy and will not unduly prejudice others or the public interest. It must be remembered that disclosure will be limited to the transcripts of a defendant’s own conversations and of those which took place on his premises. It can be safely <page-number citation-index="1" label="185">*185</page-number>assumed that much of this he will already know, and disclosure should therefore involve a minimum hazard to others. In addition, the trial court can and should, where appropriate, place a defendant and his counsel under enforceable orders against unwarranted disclosure of the materials which they may be entitled to inspect. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16 (e). We would not expect the district courts to permit the parties or counsel to take these orders lightly.</p>
<p id="b259-5">None of this means that any defendant will have an unlimited license to rummage in the files of the Department of Justice. Armed with the specified records of overheard conversations and with the right to cross-examine the appropriate officials in regard to the connection between those records and the case made against him, a defendant may need or be entitled to nothing else. Whether this is the case or not must be left to the informed discretion, good sense, and fairness of the trial judge. See <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>United States, </em>308 U. S. 338, 341-342 (1939).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b259-6">IV.</p>
<p id="b259-7">Accordingly, in No. 133, O. T. 1967, the motion of the United States is denied to the extent that it requests an initial <em>in camera </em>inspection of the fruits of any unlawful <page-number citation-index="1" label="186">*186</page-number>surveillance and the withholding of those portions of the materials which the trial judge might deem irrelevant to these convictions. Primarily because of our decision with respect to standing, however, the order and judgment of January 29, 1968, are withdrawn. The order denying to petitioners a writ of certiorari is set aside. The petition for rehearing is granted, and the petition for certiorari is granted as to both Alderisio and Alderman. The judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in No. 133, O. T. 1967, and the judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Nos. 11 and 197 are vacated, and each of the cases is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion, that is, for a hearing, findings, and conclusions (1) on the question of whether with respect to any petitioner there was electronic surveillance which violated his Fourth Amendment rights, and (2) if there was such surveillance with respect to any petitioner, on the nature and relevance to his conviction of any conversations which may have been overheard through that surveillance. The District Court should confine the evidence presented by both sides to that which is material to the question of the possible violation of a petitioner’s Fourth Amendment rights, to the content of conversations illegally overheard by surveillance which violated those rights and to the relevance of such conversations to the petitioner’s subsequent conviction. The District Court will make such findings of fact on those questions as may be appropriate in light of the further evidence and of the entire existing record. If the District Court decides on the basis of such findings (1) that there was electronic surveillance with respect to one or more petitioners but not any which violated the Fourth Amendment, or (2) that although there was a surveillance in violation of one or more of the petitioners’ Fourth Amendment rights, the conviction of such petitioner was not tainted <page-number citation-index="1" label="187">*187</page-number>by the use of evidence so obtained, it will enter new final judgments of conviction based on the existing record as supplemented by its further findings, thereby preserving to all affected parties the right to seek further appropriate appellate review. If, on the other hand, the District Court concludes in such further proceedings that there was a violation of any petitioner’s Fourth Amendment rights and that the conviction of the petitioner was tainted by such violation, it would then become its duty to accord such petitioner a new trial.</p>

<p id="b244-6"> The United States admits overhearing conversations of each petitioner, but where the surveillance took place and other pertinent details are unknown. In its brief the Government states:</p>
<p id="b244-7">“In some of the instances the installation had been specifically approved by the then Attorney General. In others the equipment was installed under a broader grant of authority to the F. B. I., in effect at that time, which did not require specific authorization. . . . [P] resent Department of Justice policy would call for specific authorization from the Attorney General for any use of electronic equipment in such cases.”</p>
<p id="b244-8">In all three cases, the District Court must develop the relevant facts and decide if the Government’s electronic surveillance was unlawful. Our assumption, for present purposes, is that the surveillance was illegal.</p>

<p id="b244-9"> In each case the grant of certiorari, 392 U. S. 923, was limited to the following questions:</p>
<p id="b244-10">“On the assumption that there was electronic surveillance of petitioner or a codefendant which violated the Fourth Amendment,</p>
<p id="b244-11">“(1) Should the records of such electronic surveillance be subjected to <em>in camera </em>inspection by the trial judge to determine the necessity of compelling the Government to make disclosure of such records to petitioner, and if so to what extent?</p>
<p id="b244-12">“(2) If <em>in camera </em>inspection is to be authorized or ordered, by what standards (for example, relevance, and considerations of national security or injury to persons or reputations) should the trial judge determine whether the records are to be turned over to the defendant?</p>

<p id="b246-7"> As the issue was put and answered by the Court:</p>
<p id="b246-8">“The question now to be decided is whether we shall extend the sanction for violation of the Communications Act so as to make available to one not a party to the intercepted communication the objection that its use outside the courtroom, and prior to the trial, induced evidence which, except for that use, would be admissible.</p>
<p id="b246-9">“No court has ever gone so far in applying the implied sanction for violation of the Fourth Amendment. While this court has never been called upon to decide the point, the federal courts in numerous cases, and with unanimity, have denied standing to one not the victim of an unconstitutional search and seizure to object to the introduction in evidence of that which was seized. <em>A fortiori </em>the same rule should apply to the introduction of evidence induced by the use or disclosure thereof to a witness other than the victim of the seizure. We think no broader sanction should be imposed upon the Government in respect of violations of the Communications Act.” 316 U. S, at 121.</p>
<p id="b246-10">The Court noted that the principle had been applied “in at least fifty cases by the Circuit Courts of Appeals . . . not to mention many decisions by District Courts.” <em>Id., </em>at 121, n. 12.</p>

<p id="b247-9"> <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>United States, </em>335 U. S. 451 (1948), is not authority to the contrary. It is not at all clear that the <em>McDonald </em>opinion would automatically extend standing to a codefendant. Two of the five Justices joining the majority opinion did not read the opinion to do so and found the basis for the eodefendant’s standing to be the fact that he was a guest on the premises searched. “But even a guest may expect the shelter of the rooftree he is under against criminal intrusion.” <em>Id., </em>at 461 (Jackson, J., concurring). Cf. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>United States, </em>362 U. S. 257 (1960). Nor does <em>Hoffa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U.

<p id="b249-6"> Title III, Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub. L. 90-351, 82 Stat. 211.

C. §2511 (1964 ed., Supp. IV)) (fine of not more than $10,000, or imprisonment for not more than five years, or both), but it also authorizes the recovery of civil damages by a person whose wire or oral communication is intercepted, disclosed, or used in violation of the Act, 82 Stat. 223 (18 U.

<p id="b249-7"> Congress has not done so. In its recent wiretapping and eavesdropping legislation, Congress has provided only that an “aggrieved person” may move to suppress the contents of a wire or oral communication intercepted in violation of the Act. Title III, Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 221 (18 U. S. C. § 2518 (10) (a) (1964 ed., Supp. IV)).

<p id="b251-6"> If the police enter a house pursuant to a valid warrant authorizing the seizure of specified gambling paraphernalia but discover illegal narcotics in the process of the search, the narcotics may be seized and introduced in evidence in the prosecution of the homeowner, whether the narcotics belong to him or to a third party. <em>E. g., Harris </em>v. <em>United States, </em>331 U. S. 145, 155 (1947). But if the officers have neither a warrant nor the consent of the householder, it is elementary Fourth Amendment law that the narcotics are suppressible on his motion. In both cases, however, the homeowner’s interest in the narcotics and his standing to object to their seizure are the same; and insofar as the Fourth Amendment’s protection of “effects” is concerned, the right of the officer to seize the contraband without a warrant and use it in evidence is identical. The reason that the narcotics may be seized and introduced in evidence in the first ease where there was a valid warrant, in spite of the householder’s interest in the narcotics and his standing to object, but not in the second case where there was no warrant is not the simple reason suggested by Mr. Justice Harlan that the householder has a property interest in the narcotics and therefore has “standing” to object. Rather, it is because in the first case there was no illegal invasion of the premises, while in the second the officer’s entry and search violated the Fourth Amendment, the narcotics being the fruit of that illegality.</p>
</footnote>
<footnote label="11">
<p id="b253-6"> Mr. Justice Harlan would also distinguish between the situation where a document belonging to a third party and containing his own words is seized from the premises of another without a warrant and the situation where the third party’s words are spoken and overheard by electronic surveillance. Under that view the words of the third party would be admissible in the latter instance but not in the former. We would exclude the evidence in both cases.</p>
<p id="b253-7">So also we do not distinguish between electronic surveillance which is carried out by means of a physical entry and surveillance which penetrates a private area without a technical trespass. This much, we think, <em>Katz </em>makes quite clear. In either case, officialdom invades an area in which the homeowner has the right to expect privacy for himself, his family, and his invitees, and the right to object to the use against him of the fruits of that invasion, not because the rights of others have been violated, but because his own were. Those who converse and are overheard when the owner is not present also have a valid objection unless the owner of the premises has consented to the surveillance. Cf. <em>Mancusi </em>v. <em>DeForte, </em>392 U. S. 364, 367-370 (1968). The Fourth Amendment protects reasonable expectations of privacy and does not protect persons engaged in crime from the risk that those with whom they associate or converse will cooperate with the Government. <em>Hoffa </em>v. <em>United States, </em>385 U. S. 293, 303 (1966).</p>

<p id="b254-8"> It seems that in none of these cases were there introduced any recordings, transcripts, or other evidence, of the actual conversations overheard by electronic surveillance.</p>

<p id="b255-6"> This would be true even, though the material on its face contained no threat of injury to the public interest or national security, apparently because, in the Government’s view, it would be very difficult to distinguish between that which threatened and that which <page-number citation-index="1" label="182">*182</page-number>did not.

<p id="b256-7"> In both the volume of the material to be examined and the complexity and difficulty of the judgments involved, cases involving <page-number citation-index="1" label="183">*183</page-number>electronic surveillance will probably differ markedly from those situations in the criminal law where <em>in camera </em>procedures have been found acceptable to some extent. <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>384 U. S. 855 (1966) (disclosure of grand jury minutes subject to <em>in camera </em>deletion of “extraneous material”); <em>Palermo </em>v. <em>United States, </em>360 U. S. 343, 354 (1959) (whether the Jencks Act, 18 U. S. C. § 3500, requires disclosure of document to the defense); <em>Roviaro </em>v. <em>United States, </em>353 U. S. 53 (1957) (disclosure of informant’s identity). In the <em>Dennis </em>case the Court noted that ordinarily “[t]rial judges ought not be burdened with the task or the responsibility of examining sometimes voluminous grand jury testimony,” and that it is not “realistic to assume that the trial court’s judgment as to the utility of material for impeachment or other legitimate purposes, however conscientiously made, would exhaust the possibilities.” 384 U. S., at 874-875.</p>

<p id="b258-8"> The dissents, it should be noted, would require turnover of arguably relevant material, whatever its impact on national security might be. To this extent there is agreement that the defendant’s interest in excluding the fruits of illegally obtained evidence entitles him to the product of the surveillance. Given this basic proposition, the matter comes down to a judgment as to whether <em>in camera </em>inspection would characteristically be sufficiently reliable when national security interests are at stake. On this issue, the majority and the dissenters part company.</p>

<p id="b259-8"> The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Brennan, and Mr. Justice White join the entire opinion of the Court. In addition, Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart join the opinion to the extent that it denies standing to codefendants, coconspirators, and others whose Fourth Amendment rights have not been violated by the electronic surveillance involved. The four members of the Court joining the entire opinion agree with the opinion in recognizing the householder’s standing to object to evidence obtained from an unauthorized electronic surveillance of his premises even where his own conversations are not overheard; Mr. Justice Fortas concurs in the judgment to this extent. Finally, Mr. Justice Stewart, in addition to the four members of the Court joining the entire opinion, agrees with Part III of the opinion.</p>
