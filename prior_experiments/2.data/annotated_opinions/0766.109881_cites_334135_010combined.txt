The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions. The court first held that the Board of Education was not a "person" under § 1983 because "it performs a vital governmental function . . ., and, significantly, while it has the right to determine how the funds appropriated to it shall be spent . . ., it has no final say in deciding what its appropriations shall be." <targetCase>532 F.2d 259</targetCase> , 263 (1976). The individual defendants, however, were "persons" under § 1983, even when sued solely in their official capacities. 532 F.2d , at 264 . Yet, because a damages award would "have to be paid by a city that was held not to be amenable to such an action in Monroe v. Pape , " a damages action against officials sued in their official capacities could not proceed. Id., at 265. We granted certiorari in this case, 429 U.S. 1071 , to consider "Whether local governmental officials and/or local independent school boards are `persons' within the meaning of 42 U.S. C . § 1983 when equitable relief in the nature of back pay is sought against them in their official capacities?"

1159 , 1161 (ED Va. 1971), rev'd, 474 F.2d 395 (CA4 1973), rev'd and remanded, 414 U.S. 632 (1974); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School Dist., 393 U.S. 503 , 504 (1969). See also Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U.S. 441 , 445 (1973). Although the point was not squarely presented in this Court, these claims *712 for damages could not have been maintained in official-capacity suits if the government entity were not itself suable. Cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651 (1974). [8] Moreover, the rationale of Kenosha would have to be disturbed to avoid closing all avenues under § 1983 to injunctive relief against constitutional violations by local government. The Court of Appeals in this case suggested that we import, by analogy, the Eleventh Amendment fiction of Ex parte Young into § 1983, <targetCase>532 F.2d 259</targetCase> , 264-266 (CA2 1976). That approach, however, would create tension with Kenosha because it would require "a bifurcated application" of "the generic word `person' in § 1983" to public officials "depending on the nature of the relief sought against them." 412 U.S. , at 513 . A public official sued in his official capacity for carrying out official policy would be a "person" for purposes of injunctive relief, but a non-"person" in an action for damages. The Court's holding avoids this difficulty. See ante, at 690 n. 55. Finally, if we continued to adhere to a rule of absolute municipal immunity under § 1983, we could not long avoid the question whether "we should, by analogy to our decision in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed.

and Supp. V). The District Court held that the 1972 amendments to Title VII did not apply retroactively to discrimination suffered prior to those amendments even when an action challenging such prior discrimination was pending on the date of the amendments. 394 F. Supp. 853 , 856 (SDNY 1975). This holding was affirmed on appeal. <targetCase>532 F.2d 259</targetCase> , 261-262 (CA2 1976). Although petitioners sought certiorari on the Title VII issue as well as the § 1983 claim, we restricted our grant of certiorari to the latter issue. 429 U.S. 1071 . [2] The plaintiffs alleged that New York had a citywide policy of forcing women to take maternity leave after the fifth month of pregnancy unless a city physician and the head of an employee's agency allowed up to an additional two months of work. Amended Complaint ¶ 28, App. 13-14. The defendants did not deny this, but stated that this policy had been changed after suit was instituted.

Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 , 278-279 (1977), the existence of a claim for relief under § 1983 is "jurisdictional" for purposes of invoking 28 U.S. C . § 1343, even though the existence of a meritorious constitutional claim is not similarly required in order to invoke jurisdiction under 28 U.S. C . § 1331. See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678 , 682 (1946). [2] The other statutes cited by the Court, ante, at 697-699, n. 63, make no mention of § 1983, but refer generally to suits against "a local educational agency." As noted by the Court of Appeals, <targetCase>532 F.2d 259</targetCase> , 264-266, such suits may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either § 1983 or Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). Congress did not stop to consider the technically proper avenue of relief, but merely responded to the fact that relief was being granted. The practical result of choosing the avenue suggested by petitioners would be the subjection of school corporations to liability in damages. Nothing in recent congressional history even remotely supports such a result. [3] I find it somewhat ironic that, in abandoning the supposedly ill-considered holding of Monroe, my Brother POWELL relies heavily upon cases involving school boards, although he admits that "the exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction . . .
