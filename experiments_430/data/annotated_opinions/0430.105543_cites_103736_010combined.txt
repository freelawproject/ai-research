 [6] Here, the Nevada divorce court *419 was as powerless to cut off the wife's support right as it would have been to order the husband to pay alimony if the wife had brought the divorce action and he had not been subject to the divorce court's jurisdiction.  Therefore, the Nevada decree, to the extent it purported to affect the wife's right to support, was void and the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not obligate New York to give it recognition.  [7] Petitioner claims that this case is governed by Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551 .  For the reasons given in a concurring opinion in Armstrong v. Armstrong, 350 U. S. 568, 575 , at 580-581, the Thompson case, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.  Affirmed.  THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting.  The question in this case is whether Nevada, which was empowered to grant petitioner a divorce without personal jurisdiction over respondent that must be respected, by command of the Constitution, by every other State, Williams v. North Carolina, <citedDecision>317 U. S. 287</citedDecision> , *420 was at the same time empowered by virtue of its domiciliary connection with petitioner to make, incidental to its dissolution of the marriage, an adjudication denying alimony to which sister States must also give full faith and credit.  Whatever the answer to the question may be, Estin v. Estin, 334 U. S. 541 , does not supply it.  What the Court now states to be "not material" was crucial to the decision in that case, namely, the prior New York support order, which the Court held Nevada was required to respect by virtue of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, § 1, of the Constitution.  That this fact was crucial to the Court's decision in that case is made clear by the Court's reference to the prior New York judgment in its two statements of the question presented and more than a half dozen times throughout the course of its opinion.  The Court rightly regarded the fact as crucial because of the requirement of Art. IV, § 1, that Nevada give full faith and credit to the prior New York "judicial Proceedings." The Court now chooses to regard the existence of a prior New York support order as "not material," holding for the first time that "the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which [respondent] had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband.  It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant [citing for this proposition, Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 726-727 ]." We have thus reached another stageone cannot say it is the lastin the Court's tortuous course of constitutional adjudication relating to dissolution of the marriage status.  Whereas previously only the State of "matrimonial domicile" could grant an ex parte divorce and alimony, now any domiciliary State can grant an ex parte divorce, but no State, even if domiciliary, can grant alimony ex parte when it grants a divorce ex parte.  *421 It will make for clarity to give a brief review of the singular history of matrimonial law in this Court since the decision in Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S. 155 .  In that case, the Court held that a sister State had to give full faith and credit to a divorce granted, on the basis of constructive service, by the matrimonial domicile to a deserted husband.  In Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U. S. 562 , the Court refused to extend Atherton , holding that a State need not give full faith and credit to a divorce granted ex parte to a deserted husband by a domiciliary State other than the matrimonial domicile.  These precedents were applied to the incidental claim to alimony in Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551 , where the Court held that full faith and credit was to be given to the refusal of the matrimonial domicile to grant alimony when it granted a divorce on the basis of substituted service.  Under the pre- <citedDecision>Williams</citedDecision> law, then, the same jurisdictional rules applied to the dissolution of the marriage tie and to an incidental adjudication denying alimony.  Not only the adjudication of divorce but also the adjudication denying alimony by the matrimonial domicile was required to be given full faith and credit despite the lack of personal jurisdiction over the other spouse.  In Williams v. North Carolina, I, <citedDecision>317 U. S. 287</citedDecision> , the scope of Art. IV, § 1, was found to require full faith and credit to be given to a divorce granted ex parte by any State where one spouse was domiciled.  The limitation of ex parte divorces to the matrimonial domicile imposed by Haddock v. Haddock was rejected as being based on "fiction." Williams v. North Carolina, II, 325 U. S. 226 , made it clear that full faith and credit was required to be given only if the granting State was actually a domiciliary State, that the finding on this issue could not be foreclosed by the decreeing State, and that it could be readjudicated later by another State.  But this restriction of Williams II was considerably weakened *422 when the Court held that a sister State, no matter how great its interest because of its own social policy, was precluded from relitigating the existence of the jurisdictional facts underlying a divorce when both parties had merely made an appearance in the original divorce proceeding.  Sherrer v. Sherrer, 334 U. S. 343 , and Coe, v. Coe, 334 U. S. 378 .  This was so even if the collateral attack were made by a third party who had not appeared in the original proceeding and who had independent interests.  Johnson v. Muelberger, 340 U. S. 581 .
**Combined Opinion**
 The interest of New York in her domiciliaries seems .  .  .  to be of sufficient weight to justify allowing her to apply her own policy on the question of what effect ex parte divorces will be given as against the surviving support rights of her own domiciliaries." To begin with, it cannot be pretended that New York is not discriminating against alimony adjudications in all out-of-state ex parte divorces, for a divorce granted to a husband in New York against a wife who is not served personally in New York is not ex parte if the wife is a New York domiciliary.  Her domicile provides a basis of jurisdiction that would be sufficient in an ordinary non-matrimonial action.  See Williams v. North Carolina, I, <citedDecision>317 U. S. 287, 298-299</citedDecision> ; Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463 .  To go to the heart of the matter, the Full Faith and Credit Clause is itself a constitutional adjustment of the conflicting interests of States, and we are not free, by weighing contending claims in particular cases, to make readjustments of the conflicting interests as if the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not exist.  The clause requires that "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the .  .  .  judicial Proceedings of every other State." See also 28 U. S. C. § 1738 .  It is true that the commands of the Full Faith and Credit Clause are not inexorable in the sense that exceptional circumstances may relieve a State from giving full faith and credit to the judgment of a sister State because "obnoxious" to an overriding policy of its own.  But such instances "have been few and far between, apart from Haddock v. Haddock .  " See Williams v. North Carolina, I, <citedDecision>317 U. S. 287, 294-295</citedDecision> .  Of course New York has substantial connection with a domiciliary who has been divorced ex parte in Nevada, but that provides no justification for allowing it to refuse *427 to give full faith and credit to that part of the Nevada judgment denying alimony.  A State desiring to deny full faith and credit to the judgment of another State almost always has such a connection.  Whatever the unusual circumstances that may justify making an exception to the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, this case does not present them because, for the reasons I have already stated, no stronger state policy can be urged in this case than was overridden in Williams I.  Blanket discrimination against ex parte alimony decrees of sister States therefore subordinates the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to the policy of New York. To justify the New York law as a "mere survival of a pre-existing right" is only another proof that "the word `right' is one of the most deceptive of pitfalls; it is so easy to slip from a qualified meaning in the premise to an unqualified one in the conclusion." American Bank & Trust Co. v. Federal Reserve Bank, 256 U. S. 350, 358 .  There can be no "right" until the termination of the marriage, and the whole question in the case is which State shall be able to determine the incidents of the dissolution of the marriage status.

 Were we compelled to reach the question, I would by no means be ready to hold that Nevada, in connection with a valid divorce proceeding, had no power to adjudicate an incident so inextricably knit to the marriage status as is support.  I would agree with Judge Fuld, dissenting below, that the denial of power to Nevada rests on the "erroneous premise that a mere incident of the marital status, which `in itself furnishes no foundation for a cause of action' .  .  .  is the equivalent of an independent right." [1] Nor does it help to label Mrs. Vanderbilt's claim to support a "property" right and therefore an in *430 personam, rather than an in rem, matter.  If it is due process for Nevada to adjudicate the marriage status of a domiciliary without personal service over the absent spouse (as it clearly is, see Williams v. North Carolina, I, <citedDecision>317 U. S. 287</citedDecision> ), I see no reason why Nevada cannot, at least for the purposes of her own law, also adjudicate the incidents of that status.  I do not think, however, that this forecloses the issue before us.  I revert, therefore, to what, for me, is the real question in this case: must New York respect Nevada's decree insofar as it purports to adjudicate the question of support?  The answer to this question, I think, turns squarely on an issue of New York law, namely, whether Mrs. Vanderbilt was domiciled in New York at the time of the divorce.  If Mrs. Vanderbilt was a New York domiciliary at the time of the divorce, the situation would seem to me to be as follows: New York's law and policy is that the right of a married woman domiciled in New York to support survives an ex parte divorce, whether obtained in New York or elsewhere.  The only question under the Full Faith and Credit Clause is whether New York is compelled to disregard her own law and policy in favor of the law of Nevada on the question of the survival of support rights subsequent to an ex parte divorce.  My answer to this question is "no." The interest of New York in her domiciliaries seems to me to be of sufficient weight to justify allowing her to apply her own policy on the question of what effect ex parte divorces will be given as against the surviving support rights of her own domiciliaries.
