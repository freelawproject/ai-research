 One month after SAMTA brought suit, the Department of Labor formally amended its FLSA interpretive regulations to provide that publicly owned local mass-transit systems are not entitled to immunity under *535 National League of Cities .  44 Fed. Reg. 75630 (1979), codified as 29 CFR ยง 775.3 (b)(3) (1984).  On November 17, 1981, the District Court granted SAMTA's motion for summary judgment and denied the Secretary's and Garcia's cross-motion for partial summary judgment.  Without further explanation, the District Court ruled that "local public mass transit systems (including [SAMTA]) constitute integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions" under National League of Cities .  App. D to Juris. Statement in No. 82-1913, p. 24a.  The Secretary and Garcia both appealed directly to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. ยง 1252 .  During the pendency of those appeals, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., <citedDecision>455 U. S. 678</citedDecision> (1982), was decided.  In that case, the Court ruled that commuter rail service provided by the state-owned Long Island Rail Road did not constitute a "traditional governmental function" and hence did not enjoy constitutional immunity, under National League of Cities , from the requirements of the Railway Labor Act.  Thereafter, it vacated the District Court's judgment in the present cases and remanded them for further consideration in the light of Long Island.  457 U. S. 1102 (1982).  On remand, the District Court adhered to its original view and again entered judgment for SAMTA.  557 F. Supp. 445 (1983).  The court looked first to what it regarded as the "historical reality" of state involvement in mass transit.
**Combined Opinion**
 We find it difficult, if not impossible, to identify an organizing principle that places each of the cases in the first group on one side of a line and each of the cases in the second group on the other side.  The constitutional distinction between licensing drivers and regulating traffic, for example, or between operating a highway authority and operating a mental health facility, is elusive at best.  Thus far, this Court itself has made little headway in defining the scope of the governmental functions deemed protected under National League of Cities.  In that case the Court set forth examples of protected and unprotected functions, see 426 U. S., at 851, 854, n. 18 , but provided no explanation of how those examples were identified.  The only other case in which the Court has had occasion to address the problem is Long Island.  [5] We there observed: "The determination of whether a federal law impairs a state's authority with respect to `areas of traditional [state] functions' may at times be a difficult one." <citedDecision>455 U. S., at 684</citedDecision> , quoting National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 852 .  The accuracy of that statement is demonstrated by this Court's own difficulties in Long Island is developing a workable standard for "traditional governmental functions." We relied in large part there on "the historical reality that the operation of railroads is not among the functions traditionally performed by state and local governments," but we *540 simultaneously disavowed "a static historical view of state functions generally immune from federal regulation." <citedDecision>455 U. S., at 686</citedDecision> (first emphasis added; second emphasis in original).  We held that the inquiry into a particular function's "traditional" nature was merely a means of determining whether the federal statute at issue unduly handicaps "basic state prerogatives," <citedDecision>id., at 686-687</citedDecision> , but we did not offer an explanation of what makes one state function a "basic prerogative" and another function not basic.  Finally, having disclaimed a rigid reliance on the historical pedigree of state involvement in a particular area, we nonetheless found it appropriate to emphasize the extended historical record of federal involvement in the field of rail transportation.  <citedDecision>Id., at 687-689</citedDecision> .  Many constitutional standards involve "undoubte[d] .  .  .  gray areas," Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 558 (1975) (dissenting opinion), and, despite the difficulties that this Court and other courts have encountered so far, it normally might be fair to venture the assumption that case-by-case development would lead to a workable standard for determining whether a particular governmental function should be immune from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.  A further cautionary note is sounded, however, by the Court's experience in the related field of state immunity from federal taxation.  In South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437 (1905), the Court held for the first time that the state tax immunity recognized in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871), extended only to the "ordinary" and "strictly governmental" instrumentalities of state governments and not to instrumentalities "used by the State in the carrying on of an ordinary private business."

 The Court today, in its 5-4 decision, overrules National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), a case in which we held that Congress lacked authority to impose the requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act on state and local governments.  Because I believe this decision substantially alters the federal system embodied in the Constitution, I dissent.  I There are, of course, numerous examples over the history of this Court in which prior decisions have been reconsidered and overruled.  There have been few cases, however, in which the principle of stare decisis and the rationale of recent *558 decisions were ignored as abruptly as we now witness.  [1] The reasoning of the Court in National League of Cities, and the principle applied there, have been reiterated consistently over the past eight years.  Since its decision in 1976, National League of Cities has been cited and quoted in opinions joined by every Member of the present Court. Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 287-293 (1981); Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., <citedDecision>455 U. S. 678, 684-686</citedDecision> (1982); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 764-767 (1982).  Less than three years ago, in Long Island R. Co., supra, a unanimous Court reaffirmed the principles of National League of Cities but found them inapplicable to the regulation of a railroad heavily engaged in interstate commerce.  The Court stated: "The key prong of the National League of Cities test applicable to this case is the third one [repeated and reformulated in Hodel ], which examines whether `the States' compliance with the federal law would directly impair their ability "to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions." ' " <citedDecision>455 U. S., at 684</citedDecision> .  The Court in that case recognized that the test "may at times be a difficult one," ibid., but it was considered in that unanimous decision as settled constitutional doctrine.  As recently as June 1, 1982, the five Justices who constitute the majority in these cases also were the majority in FERC v. Mississippi .  In that case, the Court said: "In National League of Cities v. Usery, supra , for example, the Court made clear that the State's regulation of its relationship with its employees is an `undoubted attribute of state sovereignty.' 426 U. S., at 845 .  Yet, *559 by holding `unimpaired' California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), which upheld a federal labor regulation as applied to state railroad employees, 426 U. S., at 854, n. 18 , National League of Cities acknowledged that not all aspects of a State's sovereign authority are immune from federal control." 456 U. S., at 764, n. 28 .

It concluded, as Madison did, that this authority extended to "nearly the whole charge of interior regulation.  .  .  ; to [the States] and to the people all powers not expressly delegated to the national government are reserved." Id., at 76 .  Recently, in Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, 455 U. S. 40, 53 (1982), the Court recognized that the state action exemption from the antitrust laws was based on state sovereignty.  Similarly, in <citedDecision>Transportation Union</citedDecision> v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S., at 683, although finding the Railway Labor Act applicable to a state-owned railroad, the *574 unanimous Court was careful to say that the States possess constitutionally preserved sovereign powers.  Again, in FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 752 (1982), in determining the constitutionality of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act, the Court explicitly considered whether the Act impinged on state sovereignty in violation of the Tenth Amendment.  These represent only a few of the many cases in which the Court has recognized not only the role, but also the importance, of state sovereignty.  See also, e. g., Fry v. United States, supra ; Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514 (1926); Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  As Justice Frankfurter noted, the States are not merely a factor in the "shifting economic arrangements" of our country, Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U. S. 77, 95 (1949) (concurring), but also constitute a "coordinate element in the system established by the Framers for governing our Federal Union." National League of Cities, supra, at 849.  D In contrast, the Court today propounds a view of federalism that pays only lipservice to the role of the States.
**Combined Opinion**
 With the abandonment of National League of Cities, all that stands between the remaining essentials of state sovereignty and Congress is the latter's underdeveloped capacity for self-restraint.  The problems of federalism in an integrated national economy are capable of more responsible resolution than holding that the States as States retain no status apart from that which Congress chooses to let them retain.  The proper resolution, I suggest, lies in weighing state autonomy as a factor in the balance when interpreting the means by which Congress can exercise its authority on the States as States.  It is insufficient, in assessing the validity of congressional regulation of a State pursuant to the commerce power, to ask only whether the same regulation would be valid if enforced against a private party.  That reasoning, embodied in the majority opinion, is inconsistent with the spirit of our Constitution.  It remains relevant that a State is being regulated, as National League of Cities and every recent case have recognized.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, supra ; Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., <citedDecision>455 U. S. 678, 684</citedDecision> (1982); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 287-288 (1981); National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 841-846 .  As far as the Constitution is concerned, a State should not be equated with any private litigant.  Cf. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 428 (1979) (BLACKMUN, J., dissenting) (criticizing the ability of a state court to treat a sister State no differently than a private litigant).  Instead, the autonomy of a State is an essential component of federalism.  If state autonomy is ignored in assessing the means by which Congress regulates matters affecting commerce, then federalism becomes irrelevant simply because the set of activities remaining beyond the reach of such a commerce power "may well be negligible." Ante, at 545.

 [20] Ibid. [21]  Our references to UMTA are not meant to imply that regulation under the Commerce Clause must be accompanied by countervailing financial benefits under the Spending Clause.  The application of the FLSA to SAMTA would be constitutional even had Congress not provided federal funding under UMTA.  [22]  But see United States v. Scott, 437 U. S. 82, 86-87 (1978).  [1] National League of Cities, following some changes in the composition of the Court, had overruled Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968).  Unlike National League of Cities, the rationale of Wirtz had not been repeatedly accepted by our subsequent decisions.  [2]  JUSTICE O'CONNOR, the only new Member of the Court since our decision in National League of Cities, has joined the Court in reaffirming its principles.  See Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., <citedDecision>455 U. S. 678</citedDecision> (1982), and FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 775 (1982) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting in part).  [3]  As one commentator noted, stare decisis represents "a natural evolution from the very nature of our institutions." Lile, Some Views on the Rule of Stare Decisis, 4 Va. L. Rev. 95 , 97 (1916).  [4]  In National League of Cities, we referred to the sphere of state sovereignty as including "traditional governmental functions," a realm which is, of course, difficult to define with precision.  But the luxury of precise definitions is one rarely enjoyed in interpreting and applying the general provisions of our Constitution.  Not surprisingly, therefore, the Court's attempt to demonstrate the impossibility of definition is unhelpful.  A number of the cases it cites simply do not involve the problem of defining governmental functions.
**Combined Opinion**
 In the cited cases, however, the courts considered the issue of state immunity on the specific facts at issue; they did not make blanket pronouncements that particular things inherently qualified as traditional governmental functions or did not.  Having thus considered the cases out of context, it was not difficult for the Court to conclude that there is no "organizing principle" among them.  See ante, at 539.  [5]  In undertaking such balancing, we have considered, on the one hand, the strength of the federal interest in the challenged legislation and the impact of exempting the States from its reach.  Central to our inquiry into the federal interest is how closely the challenged action implicates the central concerns of the Commerce Clause, viz., the promotion of a national economy and free trade among the States.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 244 (1983) (STEVENS, J., concurring).  See also, for example, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., <citedDecision>455 U. S. 678, 688</citedDecision> (1982) ("Congress long ago concluded that federal regulation of railroad labor services is necessary to prevent disruptions in vital rail service essential to the national economy"); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 757 (1982) ("[I]t is difficult to conceive of a more basic element of interstate commerce than electric energy .  .  .  ").  Similarly, we have considered whether exempting States from federal regulation would undermine the goals of the federal program.  See Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975).  See also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.
