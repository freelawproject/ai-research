Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court. The Constitution’s Compensation Clause guarantees federal judges a “Compensation, which shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office.” U. S. Const., Art. Ill, § 1. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that this Clause prevents the Government from collecting certain *561 Medicare and Social Security taxes from a small number of federal judges who held office nearly 20 years ago — before Congress extended the taxes to federal employees in the early 1980’s. In our view, the Clause does not prevent Congress from imposing a "non-diseriminatory tax laid generally” upon judges and other citizens, O’Malley v. Woodrough, <targetCase>307 U.S. 277</targetCase>, 282 (1989), but it does prohibit taxation that singles out judges for specially unfavorable treatment. Consequently, unlike the Court of Appeals, we conclude that Congress may apply the Medicare tax — a nondiseriminatory tax — to then-sitting federal judges. The special retroactivity-related Social Security rules that Congress enacted in 1984, however, effectively singled out then-sitting federal judges for unfavorable treatment. Hence, like the Court of Appeals, we conclude that the Clause forbids the application of the Social Security tax to those judges. I A The Medicare law before us is straightforward. In 1965, Congress created a Federal Medicare “hospital insurance” program and tied its financing to Social Security. See Social Security Amendments of 1965, 79 Stat.

1065 (defining “gross income” to include judicial salaries). In Evans itself, the Court held that the Compensation Clause barred application of the tax to Evans, who had been appointed a judge before Congress enacted the tax. 253 U. S., at 264. A few years later, the Court extended Evans, making clear that its rationale covered not only judges appointed before Congress enacted a tax but also judges whose appointments took place after the tax had become law. See Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501, 509 (1925). Fourteen years after deciding Miles, this Court overruled Miles. O’Malley v. Woodrough, <targetCase>307 U.S. 277</targetCase> (1939). But, *567 as the Court of Appeals noted, this Court did not expressly overrule Evans itself. 64 F. 3d, at 650. The Court of Appeals added that, if “changes in judicial doctrine” had significantly undermined Evans’ holding, this “Court itself would have overruled the case.” Ibid. Noting that this case is like Evans (involving judges appointed before enactment of the tax), not like <targetCase>O’Malley</targetCase> (involving judges appointed after enactment of the tax), the Court of Appeals held that Evans controlled the outcome. 64 F. 3d, at 650. Hence application of both Medicare and Social Security taxes to these preenactment judges violated the Compensation Clause. The Court of Appeals was correct in applying Evans to the instant ease, given that “it is this Court’s prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.” State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3,20 (1997); see also Rodriguez de Quijos v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989). Nonetheless, the court below, in effect, has invited us to reconsider Evans. We now overrule Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiseriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before enactment of the tax. The Court’s opinion in Evans began by explaining why the Compensation Clause is constitutionally important, and we begin by reaffirming that explanation.

Justice Holmes, joined by Justice Brandéis, wrote that the Compensation Clause offers “no reason for exonerating” a judge “from the ordinary duties of a citizen, which he shares with all others. To require a man to pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot possibly be made an instrument to attack his independence as a judge.” 253 U. S., at 265. Holmes analogized the “diminution” that a tax might bring about to the burden that a state law might impose upon interstate commerce. If “there was no discrimination against such commerce the tax constituted one of the ordinary burdens of government from which parties were not exempted.” Id., at 267. For another thing, this Court’s subsequent law repudiated Evans’ reasoning. In 1939, 14 years after Miles extended Evans’ tax immunity to judges appointed after enactment of the tax, this Court retreated from that extension. See <targetCase>O’Malley</targetCase>, 307 U.S., at 283 (overruling Miles). And in so doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans dissent. The Court said that the question was whether judges are immune “from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes ... is subjected.” 307 U.S., at 282. Holding that judges are not “immun[e] from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government,” ibid., the Court pointed out that the legal profession had criticized Evans’ contrary conclusion, and that courts outside the United States had resolved similar matters differently, 307 U.S., at 281. And the Court concluded that “a non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not, when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution *571 of his salary within the prohibition of Article III.” Id., at 282. The Court conceded that Miles had reached the opposite conclusion, but it said that Miles “cannot survive.” 307 U. S., at 283. Still later, this Court noted that “[b]ecause Miles relied on Evans v. Gore, O’Malley must also be read to undermine the reasoning of Evans.” United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 227, n. 31 (1980). Finally, and most importantly, we believe that the reasoning of Justices Holmes and Brandéis, and of this Court in <targetCase>O’Malley</targetCase>, is correct. There is no good reason why a judge should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens. We concede that this Court has held that the Legislature cannot directly reduce judicial salaries even as part of an equitable effort to reduce all Government salaries. See 449 U. S., at 226. But a tax law, unlike a law mandating a salary reduction, affects compensation indirectly, not directly. See ibid. (distinguishing between measures that directly and those that indirectly diminish judicial compensation).

For these reasons, we hold that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax (including an increase in rates or a change in conditions) upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect. Insofar as Evans holds to the contrary, that case, in O’Malley’s words, “cannot survive.” 307 U.S., at 283. *572 The Government points out that the Medicare tax is just such a nondiseriminatory tax. Neither the courts below, nor the federal judges here, argue to the contrary. Hence, insofar as the Court of Appeals found that application of the Medicare tax law to federal judges is unconstitutional, we reverse its decision. IV The Social Security tax is a different matter. Respondents argue that the 1983 law imposing that tax upon then-sitting judges violates the Compensation Clause, for it discriminates against judges in a manner forbidden by the Clause, even as interpreted in <targetCase>O’Malley</targetCase>, not Evans. Cf. O’Malley, supra, at 282 (stating question as whether judges are immune "from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes ... is subjected” (emphasis added)). After examining the statute’s details, we agree with the judges that it does discriminate in a manner that the Clause forbids. Four features of the law, taken together, lead us to this conclusion. First, federal employees had remained outside the Social Security system for nearly 50 years prior to the passage of the 1983 law. Congress enacted the law pursuant to the Social Security Commission’s recommendation to bring those employees within the law.

28 U. S. C. §§ 376(b), (l) (1982 ed.). These two systems were not equal either before or after Congress enacted the 1983 law. Before 1983, a typical married federal employee other than a judge had to contribute 7% to 8% of annual salary to receive benefits that were better in some respects (vesting period, spousal benefit) and worse in some respects (80% salary maximum) than his married judicial counterpart would receive in return for a 4.5% contribution. The 1983 law imposed an added 5.7% burden upon the judge, in return for which the typical judge received little, or no, financial benefit. Viewed purely in financial equalization terms, and as applied to typical judges, the new requirement seems to overequalize, putting the typical married judge at a financial disadvantage — though *576 perhaps it would produce greater equality when applied to other, less typical examples. Taken together, these four characteristics reveal a law that is special — in its manner of singling out judges for disadvantageous treatment, in its justification as necessary to offset advantages related to constitutionally protected features of the judicial office, and in the degree of permissible legislative discretion that would have to underlie any determination that the legislation has “equalized” rather than gone too far. For these reasons the law before us is very different from the “non-discriminatory” tax that <targetCase>O’Malley</targetCase> upheld. 307 U. S., at 282. Were the Compensation Clause to permit Congress to enact a discriminatory law with these features, it would authorize the Legislature to diminish, or to equalize away, those very characteristics of the Judicial Branch that Article III guarantees — characteristics which, as we have said, see supra, at 568-569, the public needs to secure that judicial independence upon which its rights depend. We consequently conclude that the 1983 Social Security tax law discriminates against the Judicial Branch, in violation of the Compensation Clause. The Government makes additional arguments in support of reversal. But we find them unconvincing. It suggests that Article III protects judges only against a reduction in stated salary, not against indirect measures that only reduce take-home pay. Brief for United States 28. In <targetCase>O’Malley</targetCase>, however, this Court, when upholding a “non-discriminatory” tax, strongly implied that the Compensation Clause would bar a discriminatory tax. 307 U. S., at 282. The commentators whose work <targetCase>O’Malley</targetCase> cited said so explicitly. See Fellman, The Diminution of Judicial Salaries, 24 Iowa L. Rev. 89, 99 (1938); see also Comment, 20 Ill. L. Rev. 376, 377 (1925); Corwin, Constitutional Law in 1919-1920, 14 Am. Pol. Sei. Rev.
