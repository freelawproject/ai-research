 .  .  .” Id., at 133 .  6 More than 50 years later, in Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141 (1962), this Court reviewed the issuance of a writ of mandamus by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit instructing a District Court to vacate certain judgments of acquittal.  Although indicating its agreement with the Court of Appeals that the judgments had been entered erroneously, this Court nonetheless held that a second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Id., at 143 .  Only last Term, this Court relied upon these precedents in United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., <citedDecision>430 U. S. 564</citedDecision> (1977), and held that the Government could not appeal the granting of a motion to acquit pursuant to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29 where a second trial would be required upon remand.  The Court, quoting language in Ball, supra, at 671, stated: “Perhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that '[a] verdict of acquittal .  .  .  could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.’ ” <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 571</citedDecision> .  These, then, at least, are two venerable principles of double jeopardy jurisprudence.  The successful appeal of a judgment of conviction, on any ground other than the insufficiency of *91 the evidence to support the verdict, Burks v. United States, ante, p. 1, poses no bar to further prosecution on the same charge.  A judgment of acquittal, whether based on a jury-verdict of not guilty or on a ruling by the court that the evidence is insufficient to convict, may not be appealed and terminates the prosecution when a second trial would be necessitated by a reversal.  7 What may seem superficially to be a disparity in the rules governing a defendant’s liability to be tried again is explainable by reference to the underlying purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  As Kepner and Fong Foo illustrate, the law attaches particular significance to an acquittal.  To permit a second trial after an acquittal, however mistaken the acquittal may have been, would present an unacceptably high risk that the Government, with its vastly superior resources, might wear down the defendant so that "even though innocent he may be found guilty.” Oreen, 356' U. S., at 188.

 This truth is expressed in the three common-law pleas of autrefois acquit, autrefois convict, and pardon, which lie at the core of the area protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  As we have recognized in cases from United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896), to Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54, a defendant once acquitted may not be again subjected to trial without violating the Double Jeopardy Clause.  But that situation is obviously a far cry from the present case, where the Government was quite willing to continue with its production of evidence to show the defendant guilty before the jury first empaneled to try him, but the defendant elected to seek termination of the trial on grounds unrelated to guilt or innocence.  This is scarcely a picture of an all-powerful state relentlessly pursuing a defendant who had either been found not guilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact.  It is instead a picture of a defendant who chooses to avoid conviction and imprisonment, not because of his assertion that the Government has failed to make out a case against him, but because of a legal claim that the Government’s case against him must fail even though it might satisfy the trier of fact that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  We have previously noted that “the trial judge’s characterization of his own action cannot control the classification of the action.” Jorn, 400 U. S., at 478 n. 7 (opinion of Harlan, J.), citing United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267, 290 (1970).  See also Martin Linen, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 571</citedDecision> ; Wilson, 420 U. S., at 336 .  Despite respondent’s contentions, an appeal is not barred simply because a ruling in favor of a defendant “is based upon facts outside the face of the indictment,” id., at 348 , or be *97 cause it “is granted on the ground .  .  .  that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged,” Lee, 432 U. S., at 30 .  Rather, a defendant is acquitted only when “the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in the defendant's favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.” <citedDecision>Martin Linen, supra, at 571</citedDecision> .  Where the court, before the' jury returns a verdict, enters a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29, appeal will, be barred, only when “it is plain that the District Court .  .  .  evaluated the Government’s evidence and determined that it was legally] insufficient to sustain a conviction.”., <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 572</citedDecision> .  9 Our opinion in Burks necessarily holds that there has been a “failure of proof,” ante, at 16, requiring an acquittal when the Government does not submit sufficient evidence to rebut a defendant’s essentially factual defense of insanity, though it may otherwise be entitled to have its case submitted to the jury.  The defense of insanity, like the defense of entrapment, arises from “the notion that Congress could not have intended criminal punishment for a defendant who has committed all the elements of a proscribed offense,” United States v. Russell, 411 U. S. 423, 435 (1973), where other facts established to the satisfaction of the trier of fact provide a legally *98 adequate justification for otherwise criminal acts.  10 Such a factual finding does “necessarily establish the criminal defendant’s lack of criminal culpability,” post, at 106 (Brennan, J., dissenting), under the existing law; the fact that “the acquittal may result from erroneous evidentiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing legal principles,” ibid., affects the accuracy of that determination, but it does not alter its essential character.  By contrast, the dismissal of an indictment for preindictment delay represents a legal judgment that a defendant, although criminally culpable, may not be punished because of a supposed constitutional violation.  11 We think that in a case such as this the defendant, by deliberately choosing to seek termination of the proceedings *99 against him on a basis unrelated to factual guilt or innocence of the offense of which he is accused, suffers no injury cognizable under the Double Jeopardy Clause if the Government is permitted to appeal from such a ruling of the trial court in favor of the defendant.  We do not thereby adopt the doctrine of “waiver” of double jeopardy rejected in Green .

 He went on to say: “If a statute should give the right to take exceptions to the Government, I believe it would be impossible to maintain that the prisoner would be protected by the Constitution from being tried again.  He no more would be put in jeopardy a second time when retried because of a mistake of law in his favor, than he would be when retried for a mistake that did him harm.” Id., at 135 .  Mr. Justice Holmes’ concept of continuing jeopardy would have greatly simplified the matter of Government appeals, but it has never been accepted by a majority of this Court. See Jenkins, 420 U. S., at 358 .  In Jenkins we had assumed that a judgment of acquittal could be appealed where no retrial would be needed on remand: “When this principle is applied to the situation where the jury returns a verdict of guilt but the trial court thereafter enters a judgment of acquittal, an appeal is permitted.  In that situation a conclusion by an appellate court that the judgment of acquittal was improper does not require a criminal defendant to submit to a second trial; the error can be corrected on remand by the entry of a judgment on the verdict.” Id,., at 365.  Despite the Court’s heavy emphasis on the finality of an acquittal in Martin Linen and Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54, neither decision explicitly repudiates this assumption.  Sanabria, ante, at 75; Martin Linen, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 569-570</citedDecision> .  Downum , in 1963, was the first case in which this Court actually reversed a subsequent conviction because of an improper declaration of a mistrial.  This, too, provided greater protection for a defendant than was available at the common law. Although English precedents clearly disapproved of unnecessary mistrials, see generally Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S., at 506-508 , and nn. 21-23, the English rule at the time of the adoption of the Constitution was, as it remains today, that nothing short of a final judgment would bar further prosecution.  “The fact that the jury was discharged without giving a verdict cannot be a bar to a subsequent indictment.” 11 Halsbury’s Laws of England, Criminal Law, Evidence, and Procedure ¶242 (4th ed. 1976).  In Jenkins , which was a bench trial, we had difficulty, as did the Court of Appeals in that case, in characterizing the jorecise import of the District Court’s order dismissing the indictment.  The analysis that governed our disposition turned not on whether the defendant had -been acquitted but on whether the proceeding had terminated “in the defendant’s favor,” 420 U. S., at 365 n. 7, and whether “further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand,” id., at 370.  We thus had no occasion to determine whether the District Court simply had made "an erroneous interpretation of the controlling law,” id., at 365 n. 7, or whether it had “resolved [controlling] issues of fact in favor of the respondent,” id., at 367; see id., at 362 n. 3.
