  In November, 1945, when

  Because of alleged negligence of the master and officers in furnishing proper treatment, he suffered permanent injury from the disease. McAllister sued the petitioner, Cosmopolitan, under the Jones Act. The complaint alleged that Cosmopolitan “managed, operated and controlled”

  case decided no more, directly or by implication, than that an action could be maintained against agents of the United States at common law for the agents’ own torts.

  behind their enactment any legislative purpose to create in seamen employees of the United States through the War Shipping Administration a right to enforce tort claims under the Jones Act against others than their employers or any recognition that such right ever existed.

In considering similar legislation in other fields, we have concluded that Congress intended that the purposes of such enactments should not be restricted by common-law concepts of control so as to bar from welfare legislation as independent contractors persons who were as a matter of economic reality a part of the processes and dependent upon the businesses to which they rendered service.

  The issue in this case is whether a construction- of the Jones Act carrying out the 'intention of Congress to grant those nety rights to seamen against their employers requires or permits a holding that the general agent under the contract here in question is an employer undér the Jones Act. The decision depends upon the interpretation of the contract between respondent and Cosmopolitan on one hand and that between Cosmopolitan and the United States on the other. We assume, without deciding, that the rule of the
  <em>

  case applies, that is, the word “employment” should be construed so as to give protection to seamen for torts committed against them by 'those standing in the proximate relation of employer, and the rules of private agency should not be rigorously ap

  Yet this Court may not disregard the plain and rational meaning of employment and employer to furnish a seaman a cause of action against one completely outside the broadest lines or definitions of employment or employer. We have no doubt that, under the Jones Act, only one person, firm, or corporation can be sued as employer. Either Cosmopolitan or the Government is that employer.

  Nothing has been presented to us from the Act or from its legislative history indicative of congressional purpose to do anything other than to extend existing rights of merchant seamen to all seamen employed through the War Shipping Administration. This was specifically declared in H. R. Rep. No. 107, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 21:
 </p>
<blockquote id="Ard">
  “The various rights and remedies under statute and general maritime law with respect to death, injury, illness, and other casualty to seamen, have been rather fully set forth hereinabove. Under clause 2 of section 1 (a) these substantive rights would be governed by existing law relating to privately employed seamen. The only modification thereof arises from the remedial provision that they shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act. This procedure is appropriate in view of the fact that the suits will be against the Government of the United States. In such a suit ño provision is made for a jury trial as may otherwise be had in a proceeding such as one under the Jones Act for reasons set forth in the letter of the Attorney General (September 14, 1942).”

  held that the general agents under the standard form contract were not in possession and control of the vessel so as to make them liable under New York law to an invitee for injuries arising from negligence in its maintenance. Pp. 158-59. Our ruling was based on “the interpretation of that contract” as “a matter of federal concern.” We do not think it consistent to hold that the general agent has enough “possession and control” to be an employer under the Jones Act but not enough to be responsible for maintenance under New York law. It is true, as respondent argues, that

  </em>
  dealt only with the general agent’s liability to a stevedore, as opposed to a crew member, under the law of New York. We think, however, that vicarious liability to anyone must be predicated on the relation which exists under the standard form agreement and the shipping articlés between the general agent on the one hand and the master and crew of the vessel on the other.

  held that this relation was not one which involved that proximity necessary to a finding of liability in the general agent for the torts of the master and crew.

  The solution of the problem of determining the employer under such a contract depends upon determining whose enterprise the operation of the vessel was. Such words as employer, agent, independent contractor are not decisive. No single phrase can be said to determine the employer. One must look at the venture as a whole. Whose orders controlled the master and the crew? Whose money paid their wages? . Who hired the crew? Whose initiative and judgment chose the route and the ports? It is in the light of these basic considerations that one must read the contract. No evidence has come to our attention that indicates the general agent ever undertook to give orders or directions as to the route or management of the ship while on voyage.
 </p>
<p id="b859-4">
  An examination of the terms of the contract and the actual conduct of the parties under this agreement, so far as shown by the record, demonstrates that the United States had retained for the entire voyage the possession, management,, and navigation of the vessel and control of the ship’s officers and crew to the exclusion of the general agent. Under , the General Agency Agreement the general agent is appointed by the United States “as its agent and not as an independent contractor, to manage and conduct the business of vessels assigned to it.” Art.

The general agent agrees “to manage and conduct the business for the United States, in accordance with such directions, orders, or regulations as the latter has prescribed, or from time to time may prescribe.” Art. 2. The general agent engages itself to “maintain the vessels in such trade or service as the United States may direct,” to “collect all moneys due the United States” under the agreement, to “equip, victual, supply and maintain the vessels, subject to such directions, orders, regulations and methods of supervision and inspection as the United States m'afy from time to time prescribe,” Art. .3A, to “arrange for the repair of the vessels” and \ to “exercis^ reasonable diligence in making inspections an^ obtaining

The Master shall be an agent and employee of the United States, and shall have and exercise full control, responsibility and authority with respect to the navigation and management of the vessel. The General Agent shall procure and make available to the Master for engagement by him the officers and men required by him to fill the complement of the vessel. Such officers and men shall be procured by the General Agent through the usual channels and in accordance with the customary practices of commercial operators and upon the terms and conditions prevailing in the particular service or services in which the vessels are to be operated from time to time.

  It is thus seen that the duties of the respondent were expressly and intentionally limited to those of a ship’s husband who has been engaged to take care of the shore-side business of the ship and who has no part in the actual management or navigation of the vessel. This view is reinforced by the considerations which led to the establishment of the War Shipping Administration to control “the operation, purchase, charter, requisition, and use of all ocean vessels under the flag or control of the United States.”

  ation were of paramount importance. Direct governmental operation of the merchant fleet insured sovereign immunity from regulation, taxation,, and inspection, by other sovereignties both local and foreign. At the same time, the services of private shipping companies could be utilized because they possessed personnel skilled in the shoreside business of a ship and familiar with local port facilities and conditions. In addition these private companies were favorably situated through their union and other connections to secure seamen to man the vessels. As a result service agreements were designed whereby the shoreside services and administration of the merchant fleet were to be handled by existing private companiés while the United States, through the master of the ship, retained full control over the navigation and physical operation of the vessel.

<p id="b861-4">
  Two types of service agreements were drafted — the General Agency Agreement, with which we are presently concerned, and the Ber th Agency Agreement.

  The general agent has the responsibility of husbanding the vessel and his duties are to victual, supply, maintain, and repair the ship. The duties of the berth agent relate primarily to the handling and loading of cargo and other port services such as wharfage and pilotage needed by the vessel. In foreign ports the berth agent also takes care of the husbanding services. There is necessarily a certain overlapping of duties, but to avoid any conflict of authority both the general agent and the berth agent were made subject to “such directions, orders, or regulations* as the [United States] has prescribed, or from time to time may prescribe.”

  the general agent and the berth agent emphasizes the fact that neither the possession nor management of the vessel was conferred on either of them. There could be ho occasion for any conflict of authority with regard to orders received by the master as to the actual operation of the ship, for he was expressly made, in Art. 3A (d), the agent and employee of the United States with “full control, responsibility and authority with respect to the navigation and management of the vessel.”

  At the time of the wartime requisition of the privately owned merchant fleet, the government administrative agencies concerned gave careful study to the question of whether the crews were to be employees of the shipping companies or of the United States.
  <a class="footnote" href="#fn21" id="fn21_ref">

  There were outstanding many collective bargaining agreements between the private shipping companies and the maritime unions. It was manifestly undesirable to disturb these existing agreements and for the Government to negotiate new

  <a class="footnote" href="#fn22" id="fn22_ref">

  Yet it was essential that the masters and crews be government employees in order to obviate strikes and work stoppages, to insure sovereign immunity for the vessels, and to preserve wartime secrecy by confining all litigation concerning operation of the vessels to the admiralty courts where.appropriate security precautions could be observed. The service agreements, therefore, provided that the officers and men to fill the complement of the vessel should be procured by the general agent through the usual channels upon the terms and conditions customarily prevailing in the services in which the vessels were to be operated.
  <a class="footnote" href="#fn23" id="fn23_ref">

  These men, however, were to be hired by the master of the ship and were to be subject to his orders only. The responsibility of employing the officers, so the Regulations show, was vested exclusively in the master,

  pal maritime unions, known as the “Statements of Policy,” WSA Operations Regulations 1, May 25, 1942. Although the War Shipping Administration seamen fell within the exclusion of employees of the United States from the coverage of the National Labor Relations Act, the Administrator arranged to utilize the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board for the designation of bargaining units, while specifically reserving the Administration’s rights with respect to the Board’s absence of jurisdiction over personnel aboard WSA operated vessels.
  <a class="footnote" href="#fn26" id="fn26_ref">

  The House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries, in reporting the Clarification Act, expressly approved of this practical solution of the collective bargaining problem.

  The shipping articles summarized above, pp. 785-786, complied with the tenor of the General Agency Agreement by making it clear that respondent was an employee of the' United States. In order to pay the crew and the other expenses incidental to the operation of the ship, the War Shipping Administration deposited funds in a special joint bank account set up in the name of the agent “as general agent for the War Shipping Administration.” From this special account the general agent drew the funds and turned them over to the master to pay the crew. No money of the general agent was used for this purpose or in the operation of the vessel.
