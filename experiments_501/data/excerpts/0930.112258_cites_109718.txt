 The publisher or sender may obtain an independent review of the warden’s rejection decision by a timely writing to the Regional Director of the Bureau.  § 540.71(e).  An inmate may appeal through the Bureau’s Administrative Remedy Procedure.  See §§542.10 to 542.16.  7 The warden is instructed to permit the inmate to review the rejected material for the purpose of filing an appeal “unless such review may provide the inmate with information of a nature which is deemed to pose a threat or detriment to the security, good order or discipline of the institution or to encourage or instruct in criminal activity.” §540.71(d).  8 *407 III There is little doubt that the kind of censorship just described would raise grave First Amendment concerns outside the prison context.  It is equally certain that “[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution,” Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S., at 84 , nor do they bar free citizens from exercising their own constitutional rights by reaching out to those on the “inside,” id., at 94-99 ; Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., <citedDecision>433 U. S. 119</citedDecision> (1977); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817 (1974).  We have recognized, however, that these rights must be exercised with due regard for the “inordinately difficult undertaking” that is modern prison administration.  Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S., at 85 .  In particular, we have been sensitive to the delicate balance that prison administrators must strike between the order and security of the internal prison environment and the legitimate demands of those on the “outside” who seek to enter that environment, in person or through the written word.  Many categories of noninmates seek access to prisons.  Access is essential to lawyers and legal assistants representing prisoner clients, see Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396 (1974), to journalists seeking information about prison conditions, see Pell v. Procunier, supra, and to families and friends of prisoners who seek to sustain relationships with them, see Procunier v. Martinez, supra. All these claims to prison access undoubtedly are legitimate; yet prison officials may well conclude that certain proposed interactions, though seemingly innocuous to laymen, have potentially significant implications for the order and security of the prison.  Acknowledging the expertise of these officials and that the judiciary is “ill equipped” to deal with the difficult *408 and delicate problems of prison management, this Court has afforded considerable deference to the determinations of prison administrators who, in the interest of security, regulate the relations between prisoners and the outside world.

 legitimate governmental interests.” Id., at 414 .  The Court’s subsequent decisions regarding First Amendment rights in the prison context, however, laid down a different standard of review from that articulated in Martinez .  As recently explained in Turner , these later decisions, which we characterized as involving “prisoners’ rights,” adopted a standard of review that focuses on the reasonableness of prison regulations: the relevant inquiry is whether the actions of prison officials were “reasonably related to legitimate penological interests.” 482 U. S., at 89 .  The Court ruled that “such a standard is necessary if ‘prison administrators .  .  .  , and not the courts, [are] to make- the difficult judgments concerning institutional operations.’” Ibid., quoting <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 128</citedDecision> .  The Court set forth in Turner the development of this reasonableness standard in the respective decisions in Pell and <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> and in Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576 (1984), and we need not repeat that discussion here.  The Court’s decision to apply a reasonableness standard in these cases rather than Martinez’ less deferential approach stemmed from its concern that language in Martinez might be too readily understood as establishing a standard of “strict” or “heightened” scrutiny, and that such a strict *410 standard simply was not appropriate for consideration of regulations that are centrally concerned with the maintenance of order and security within prisons.  9 See Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S., at 81, 87, 89 .  Specifically, the Court declined to apply the Martinez standard in “prisoners’ rights” cases because, as was noted in Turner, Martinez could be (and had been) read to require a strict “least restrictive alternative” analysis, without sufficient sensitivity to the need for discretion in meeting legitimate prison needs.  482 U. S., at 89-90 .  The Court expressed concern that “every administrative judgment would be subject to the possibility that some court somewhere would conclude that it had a less restrictive way *411 of solving the problem at hand,” id., at 89 , and rejected the costs of a “least restrictive alternative” rule as too high.  Id., at 90 .

 The warden or Regional Director is to respond within 15 or 30 days, respectively.  § 542.14.  An adverse decision by the Regional Director may be appealed to the General Counsel of the Bureau; an adverse decision by the warden may be appealed to the Regional Director.  § 542.15.  Although the regulations do not so provide, it is the practice of the Bureau to withhold in its entirety any publication containing excludable *407 material.  This practice, referred to by the parties as the “all-or-nothing rule," is also at issue in this case. We do not think it sufficient to focus, as respondents urge, on the identity of the individuals whose rights allegedly have been infringed.  Although the Court took special note in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396 (1974), of the fact that the rights of nonprisoners were at issue, and stated a rule in Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78 (1987), for circumstances in which “a prison regulation impinges on inmates’ constitutional rights,” id,., at 89 (emphasis added), any attempt to forge separate standards for cases implicating the rights of outsiders is out of step with the intervening decisions in Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817 (1974); Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’Labor Union, Inc., <citedDecision>433 U. S. 119</citedDecision> (1977); and Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979).  These three cases, on which the Court expressly relied in Turner when it announced the reasonableness standard for “inmates’ constitutional rights” cases, all involved regulations that affected rights of prisoners and outsiders.  Pell involved the right of representatives of the news media to conduct interviews in the prisons in order to inform the public about prison conditions.  The asserted right at issue in <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> was the right of a prisoners’ union to send its literature into the prison.  In Wolfish , publishers sought to send hardback books into the prison.  In all these eases, regulations worked a “consequential restriction on the .  .  .  rights of those who are not prisoners.” Martinez, 416 U. S., at 409 .  But the Court in Turner observed: “In none of these .

 But the Court noted that the regulation banning transmission of “inflammatory political, racial, religious or other views” was not “limited to incoming letters.” 416 U. S., at 416 .  This observation suggests that the Court’s approach to the regulation might have been different had the regulation been so limited.  The District Court in the present case stated its standard of review: “the Bureau [must] articulate a relationship between its regulations (and practices) and legitimate penological objectives such as internal security.  Once the Bureau meets that requirement, the plaintiffs must show by ‘substantial evidence’ that the defendants have ‘exaggerated their response’ to the problems the regulations address.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a-47a (citing, among other cases, St. Claire v. Cuyler, 634 F. 2d 109, 114 (CA3 1980)).  The District Court did not have the benefit of this Court’s decision in Turner , and the standard of review it applied is not precisely identical to the Turner standard.  In particular, it is by no means certain what the District Court meant by “substantial evidence.” We do not pass on any question of evidentiary burdens or burden shifting here, but we conclude that the standard applied by the District Court is sufficiently close to the Turner standard for present purposes to permit reliance on the District Court’s findings.  Indeed, the Court upheld content distinctions in <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> , where internal distribution of a prisoners’ union’s materials was prohibited while distribution of materials from the Jay cees and Alcoholics Anonymous was permitted.  <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 131, n. 8</citedDecision> .  It upheld these distinctions against an equal protection challenge because the distinctions had a rational basis in the legitimate penological interests of the prisons: in contrast with the prisoners’ union, the Jaycees and Alcoholics Anonymous “were seen as serving a rehabilitative purpose, working in harmony with the goals and desires of the prison administrators, and both had been determined not to pose any threat to the order or security of the institution.” <citedDecision>Id., at 134</citedDecision> .  In contrast, the censorship at issue in Martinez closely resembled the kind of censorship which is expressly prohibited by the regulations presently at issue.  In Martinez , the regulations barred writings that “unduly complain” or “magnify grievances,” express “inflammatory political, racial, religious or other views,” or are “defamatory” or “otherwise inappropriate.” 416 U. S, at 415.  We found in Martinez that “[t]hese regulations fairly invited prison officials and employees to apply their own personal prejudices and opinions as standards for prisoner mail censorship,” and that the purpose of the regulations had not been found “unrelated to the suppression of expression.” Ibid. The regulations at issue in Martinez , therefore, were decidedly not “neutral” in the relevant sense.  The exercise of discretion called for by these regulations may produce seeming “inconsistencies,” but what may appear to be inconsistent results are not necessarily signs of arbitrariness or irrationality.  Given the likely variability within and between institutions over time, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a; App. 20-21, 50, greater consistency might be attainable only at the cost of a more broadly restrictive rule against admission of incoming publications.  Cf. F. Dostoyevsky, The House of the Dead 40 (Penguin 1985) (prisoners permitted to read only the Bible).

 Id., at 819 .  The infringement on prisoners’ rights, the Court held, was reasonable because prisoners could write letters to the media — a means of communication less disruptive than the physical entry of reporters into the prison.  Id., at 824 .  The reporters’ assertion of a special right of access could not prevail, the Court explained, because the First Amendment does not give the media greater access to public events or institutions — including prisons — than it gives ordinary citizens.  9 Id., at 835 .  Pell in no way diluted the basic distinction articulated in Martinez .  Inmates in Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., <citedDecision>433 U. S. 119</citedDecision> (1977), had maintained that First *426 Amendment associational rights protected their efforts to form a union.  The Court concluded that the administrators’ grounds for preventing union organizing within the prison— an activity occurring largely among inmates — were reasonable.  <citedDecision>Id., at 129</citedDecision> .  It also approved the officials’ refusal to deliver bulk packets of union literature to specific inmates for distribution to others.  Applying Equal Protection Clause as well as First Amendment standards, the Court held that the restriction was reasonable because it was limited in scope and because the union retained “other avenues of outside informational flow .  .  .  .” <citedDecision>Id., at 131</citedDecision> ; see <citedDecision>id., at 133, 136</citedDecision> .  In the third case, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979), the Court upheld a regulation that allowed only publishers, bookstores, and book clubs to mail hardbound books to pretrial detainees.  Hardbacks might serve as containers for contraband, jail administrators argued.  Since the risk of improper use by publishers and similar sources was low, the jail delivered books from them but not from other outsiders.  Id., at 549 .  The Court found this explanation acceptable and held that the rule did not violate the detainees’ First Amendment rights.  Id., at 550 .

 See Abbott v. Meese, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 193, 824 F. 2d 1166, 1173 (1987).  The term “detrimental” invites so many interpretations that it scarcely checks administrators’ actions.  Similarly, “might facilitate” —in contrast with “encourage” or “advocate” — so attenuates the causal connection between expression and proscribed conduct that the warden has virtually free rein to censor incoming publications.  Despite this vagueness, the Court accepts petitioners’ assertion that they need “broad discretion” to prevent internal disorder, and thus holds that all the regulations are facially valid.  See ante, at 416.  This premature leap of faith creates a presumption that rejections pursuant to these regulations are “reasonable” — a presumption that makes likely far less judicial protection of publishers’ rights than I believe the First Amendment requires.  As was Justice Blackmun in *429 Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 593 (1984) (concurring in judgment), I am concerned that the Court today too readily “shbstitute[s] the rhetoric of judicial deference for meaningful scrutiny of constitutional claims in the prison setting.” Cf. O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342, 358 (1987) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Jones, <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 142-143</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., dissenting).  The feeble protection provided by a “reasonableness” standard applied within the framework of these regulations is apparent in this record.  12 Like the Labyrinth issue, many of the 46 rejected publications criticized prison conditions or otherwise presented viewpoints that prison administrators likely would not welcome.  13 Testimony by one mail clerk 14 *430 and the rote explanations for decisions 15 suggest that rejections were based on personal prejudices or categorical assumptions rather than individual assessments of risk.  Cf. Martinez, 416 U. S., at 415 .  These circumstances belie the Court’s interpretation of these regulations as “content-neutral” and its assertion that rejection decisions are made individually.  See ante, at 414-417.

 Therefore, I believe that that is the questionable area and they are the ones that I refer.” App. 97-98.  Statements of reasons for returning different publications were identical even in their misspelling.  See J. L. 5, 46, 47, 48 (“fT]his publication is used in part to glorify problem inmates and prison unions which could cause problems to inmates and staff in the security and orderly running of this institution.  This publication also propagets /sic/ an adversary attitude by inmates toward staff”); cf. id., at 40 (“|T]his type of material on institutions has a tendency to develop an adversary attitude by inmates toward staff, which can cause an unhealthy environment in this institution").  The Court makes this assumption on the basis of a 14 statement by petitioners at oral argument.  See ante, at 413 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 10).  But each publication at issue was addressed to a single inmate, making this case more analogous to the personal correspondence in Martinez than to the bulk mailings in Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., <citedDecision>433 U. S. 119</citedDecision> (1977).  The prison regulations in Martinez raised the specter of disruptive dissemination as a justification for censorship, 416 U. S., at 399, n. 3 ; the Court nevertheless found those regulations unconstitutional.  Iquote, in its entirety, the discussion of the record that preceded the District Court’s finding that the all-or-nothing rule was reasonable: “The plaintiffs offered evidence that a less restrictive policy, at no cost to security, would be to tear out the rejected portions and admit the rest of the publication.  But the defendants contend that such censorship would create more discontent than the current practice, and one of the plaintiffs’ witnesses agreed." ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  The District Court’s footnote cites to the following trial testimony by a witness whom respondents offered as an expert in the field of corrections: “Q Are you familiar with the policy of the Bureau of Prisons concerning what we call the all-or-nothing rule?  “A As I understand it, if a publication is approved for admission, it may be approved in toto.
