<author id="b226-7">Justice Brennan,</author>
<p id="ATK">concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="b226-8">After respondent was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment upon his conviction for murder, Judge Harney granted respondent’s motion for a new trial based on prosecutorial misconduct. Under these circumstances, I believe that the possibility that an increased sentence upon retrial resulted from judicial vindictiveness is sufficiently remote that the presumption established in <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Pearce, </em>395 U. S. 711 (1969), should not apply here. Because respondent has not shown that the 50-year sentence imposed by <page-number citation-index="1" label="145">*145</page-number>Judge Harney after respondent’s retrial resulted from actual vindictiveness for having successfully attacked his first conviction,. I would reverse the judgment below.</p>
<p id="b227-5">I emphasize, however, that were I able to find that vindictiveness should be presumed here, I would agree with Justice Marshall that “the reasons offered by Judge Harney [were] far from adequate to rebut any presumption of vindictiveness.” <em>Post, </em>at 152. The Court’s dictum to the contrary, see <em>ante, </em>at 141-144, serves in my view only to distort the holding of <em>Pearce.</em></p>
