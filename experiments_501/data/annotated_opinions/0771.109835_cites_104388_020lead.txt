 5 Revised Rule 193D restores the original scope of the Washington business and occupation tax. After initial imposition *739 of the tax in 1935, 6 the then State Tax Commission 7 adopted Rule 198 of the Rules and Regulations Relating to the Revenue Act of 1935.  8 That Rule permitted taxpayers to deduct certain income received from interstate and foreign commerce.  Income from stevedoring, however, was not described as deductible.  When, in 1937, this Court in Puget Sound invalidated the application of the tax to stevedoring, the Commission complied by adding stevedoring income to the list of *740 deductions.  9 The deduction for stevedoring remained in effect until the revision of Rule 193 in 1974.  10 Seeking to retain their theretofore-enjoyed exemption from the tax, respondents in January 1975 sought from the Superior Court of Thurston County, Wash., a declaratory judgment to the effect that Revised Rule 193D violated both the Commerce Clause and the Import-Export Clause.  They urged that the case was controlled by Puget Sound, which this Court had reaffirmed in Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., <citedDecision>330 U. S. 422, 433</citedDecision> (1947) (together, the Stevedoring Cases).  Absent a clear invitation from this Court, respondents submitted that the Superior Court could not avoid the force of the Stevedoring Cases, which had never been overruled.  Record 9.  11 Petitioner replied that this Court had invited rejection *741 of those cases by casting doubt on the Commerce Clause analysis that distinguished between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce.  Id., at 25-37, citing, e. g., Interstate Pipe Line Co. v. Stone, 337 U. S. 662 (1949); Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938).  Petitioner also argued that the Rule did not violate- the Commerce Clause because it taxed only intrastate activity, namely, the loading and unloading of ships, Record 17-20, and because it levied only a nondiscriminatory tax apportioned to the activity within the State.  Id., at 20-22.

 434 U. S. 815 (1977).  II The Commerce Clause A In Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n , the Court invalidated the Washington business and occupation tax on stevedoring only because it applied directly to interstate commerce.  Stevedoring was interstate commerce, according to the Court, because: “Transportation of a cargo by water is impossible or futile unless the thing to be transported is put Aboard the ship and taken off at destination.  A stevedore who in person or by servants does work so indispensable is as much an agency of commerce as shipowner or master.” 302 U. S., at 92 .  Without further analysis, the Court concluded: “The business of loading and unloading being interstate or foreign commerce, the State of Washington is not at liberty to tax the privilege of doing it by exacting in return therefor a percentage of the gross receipts.  Decisions to that effect are many and controlling.” Id., at 94 .  The petitioners (officers of New York City) in <citedDecision>Joseph</citedDecision> v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., urged the Court to overrule Puget Sound.  They argued that intervening cases 14 had per *744 mitted local taxation of gross proceeds derived from interstate commerce.  They concluded, therefore, that the Commerce Clause did not preclude the application to stevedoring of the New York City business tax on the gross receipts of a stevedoring corporation.  The Court disagreed on the theory that the intervening cases permitted taxation only of local activity separate and distinct from interstate commerce.  <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 430-433</citedDecision> .  This separation theory was necessary, said the Court, because it served to diminish the threat of multiple taxation on commerce; if the tax actually fell on intrastate activity, there was less likelihood that other taxing jurisdictions could duplicate the levy.  <citedDecision>Id., at 429</citedDecision> .  Stevedoring, however, was not separated from interstate commerce because, as previously enunciated in Puget Sound, it was interstate commerce: “Stevedoring, we conclude, is essentially a part of the commerce itself and therefore a tax upon its gross receipts or upon the privilege of conducting the business of stevedoring for interstate and foreign commerce, measured by those gross receipts, is invalid.  We reaffirm the rule of Puget Sound Stevedoring Company.  What makes the *745 tax invalid is the fact that there is interference by a State with the freedom of interstate commerce.’ Freeman v. Hewit [ 329 U. S. 249 ,] 256.” <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 433</citedDecision> .  Because the tax in the present case is indistinguishable from the taxes at issue in Puget Sound and in Carter & Weekes, the Stevedoring Cases control today’s decision on the Commerce Clause issue unless more recent precedent and a new analysis require rejection of their reasoning.  We conclude that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady , where the Court held that a State under appropriate conditions may tax directly the privilege of conducting interstate business, requires such rejection.  In Complete Auto, Mississippi levied a gross-receipts tax on the privilege of doing business within the State.  It applied the tax to the appellant, a Michigan corporation transporting motor vehicles manufactured outside Mississippi.  After the vehicles were shipped into Mississippi by railroad, the appellant moved them by truck to Mississippi dealers.  This Court assumed that appellant’s activity was in interstate commerce.

 But Complete Auto recognized that errors of apportionment that may lead to multiple burdens may be corrected when they occur.  430 U. S., at 288-289, n. 15 .  16 The argument of Carter ■& Weekes was an abstraction.  No multiple burdens were demonstrated.  When a general business tax levies only on the value of services performed within the State, the tax is properly apportioned and multiple bur *747 dens logically cannot occur.  17 The reasoning of Carter & Weekes, therefore, no longer supports automatic tax immunity for stevedoring from a levy such as the Washington business and occupation tax. Third, Carter & Weekes reaffirmed Puget Sound on a basis rejected by Complete Auto and previous cases. Carter & Weekes considered any direct tax on interstate commerce to be unconstitutional because it burdened or interfered with commerce.  <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 433</citedDecision> .  In support of that conclusion, the Court there cited only Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona ex rel. Sullivan, 325 U. S. 761, 767 (1945), the case where Arizona’s limitations on the length of trains were invalidated.  In Southern Pacific, however, the Court had not struck down the legislation merely because it burdened interstate commerce.  Instead, it weighed the burden against the State’s interests in limiting the size of trains: “The decisive question is whether in the circumstances the total effect of the law as a safety measure in reducing accidents and casualties is so slight or problematical as not to outweigh the national interest in keeping interstate commerce free .  .  .  .” Id., at 775-776 .

 The situation was the same in Complete Auto, and that case, thus, is not distinguishable from the present one.  Third, respondents suggest that what they regard as such an important change in Commerce Clause jurisprudence should come from Congress and not from this Court. To begin with, our rejection of the Stevedoring Cases does not effect a significant present change in the law. The primary alteration occurred in Complete Auto. Even if this case did effect an important change, it would not offend the sepa.ration-of-powers principle because it does not restrict the ability of Congress to regulate commerce.  The Commerce Clause does not state a prohibition; it merely grants specific power to Congress.  The prohibitive effect of the Clause on state legislation results from the Supremacy Clause and the decisions of this Court. See, e. g., Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1852); Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824).  If Congress prefers less disruption of interstate commerce, it will act.  18 Consistent with Complete Auto, then, we hold that the Washington business and occupation tax does not violate the *750 Commerce Clause by taxing the interstate commerce activity of stevedoring.  To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n and <citedDecision>Joseph</citedDecision> v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. stand to the contrary, each is overruled.  C With the distinction between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce thus discarded, the constitutionality under the Commerce Clause of the application of the Washington business and occupation tax to stevedoring depends upon the practical effect of the exaction.  As was recognized in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938), interstate commerce must bear its fair share of the state tax burden.  The Court repeatedly has sustained taxes that are applied to activity with a substantial nexus with the State, that are fairly apportioned, that do not discriminate against interstate commerce, and that are fairly related to the services provided by the State.  E. g., General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436 (1964); Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959); Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, 335 U. S. 80 (1948); Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435 (1940); see Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., at 279 , and n. 8.  Respondents proved no facts in the Superior Court that, under the above test, would justify invalidation of the Washington tax. The record contains nothing that minimizes the obvious nexus between Washington and respondents; indeed, respondents conduct their entire stevedoring operations within the State.  Nor have respondents successfully attacked the apportionment of the Washington system.

 Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Board, 329 U. S. 69, 75 (1946).  On the other hand, the Commerce Clause touches all state taxation and regulation of interstate and foreign commerce, whereas the Import-Export Clause bans only “Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports.” Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276, 279, 290-294 (1976).  The resolution of the Commerce Clause issue, therefore, does not dispose of the Import-Export Clause question.  A In Michelin the Court upheld the application of a general ad valorem property tax to imported tires and tubes.  The Court surveyed the history and purposes of the Import-Export-Clause to determine, for the first time, which taxes fell within the absolute ban on “Imposts or Duties.” Id., at 283-286 .  *752 Previous eases had assumed that all taxes on imports and exports and on the importing and exporting processes were banned by the Clause.  See, e. g., Department of Revenue v. James B. Beam Distilling Co., 377 U. S. 341, 343 (1964); Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Board, 329 U. S., at 76 ; <citedDecision>Joseph</citedDecision> v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 445</citedDecision> (Douglas, J., dissenting in part); Anglo-Chilean Corp. v. Alabama, 288 U. S. 218, 226-227 (1933); License Cases, 5 How. 504, 575-576 (1847) (opinion of Taney, C. J.).  Before Michelin, the primary consideration was whether the tax under review reached imports or exports.  With respect to imports, the analysis applied the original-package doctrine of Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419 (1827); see, e. g., Department of Revenue v. James B. Beam Distilling Co.; Anglo-Chilean Corp. v. Alabama; Low v. Austin, 13 Wall. 29 (1872), overruled in Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages .  So long as the goods retained their status as imports by remaining in their import packages, they enjoyed immunity from state taxation.  With respect to exports, the dispositive question was whether the goods had entered the “export stream,” the final, continuous journey out of the country.  Kosydar v. National Cash Register Co., 417 U. S. 62, 70-71 (1974); Empresa Siderurgica v. County of Merced, 337 U. S. 154, 157 (1949); A. G. Spalding & Bros. v. Edwards, 262 U. S. 66, 69 (1923); Coe v. Errol, 116 U. S. 517, 526, 527 (1886).  As soon as the journey began, tax immunity attached.

 As a result, any tax relating to exports can be tested for its conformance with the first and third policies.  If the constitutional interests are not disturbed, the tax should not be considered an “Impost or Duty” any more than should a tax related to imports.  This approach is consistent with Canton R. Co., which permitted taxation of income, from services connected to both imports and exports.  The respondents’ gross receipts from loading exports, therefore, are as subject to the Washington business and occupation tax as are the receipts from unloading imports.  *759 D None of respondents’ additional arguments convinces us that the Michelin approach should not be applied in this case to sustain the tax. First, respondents contend that the Import-Export Clause effects an absolute prohibition on all taxation of imports and exports.  The ban must be absolute, they argue, in order to give the Clause meaning apart from the Commerce Clause.  They support this contention primarily with dicta from Rich-field Oil, 329 U. S., at 75-78, and with the partial dissent in Carter & Weekes, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 444-445</citedDecision> .  Neither, however, provides persuasive support because neither recognized that the term “Impost or Duty” is not self-defining and does not necessarily encompass all taxes.  The partial dissent in Carter & Weekes did not address the term at all. Richfield Oil’s discussion was limited to the question whether the tax fell upon the sale or upon the right to retail.  329 U. S., at 83-84.  The State apparently conceded that the Clause precluded all taxes on exports and the process of exporting.  Id., at 84.  The use of these two cases, therefore, ignores the central holding of Michelin that the absolute ban is only of “Imposts or Duties” and not of all taxes.
