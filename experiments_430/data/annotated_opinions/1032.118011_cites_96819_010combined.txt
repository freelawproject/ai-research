 Jonathan A. Glogau, Assistant Attorney General of Florida, argued the cause for respondents.  With him on the brief was Robert A. Butterworth, Attorney General.  [*] *47 Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court. The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act provides that an Indian tribe may conduct certain gaming activities only in conformance with a valid compact between the tribe and the State in which the gaming activities are located.  102 Stat. 2475 , 25 U. S. C. § 2710 (d)(1)(C).  The Act, passed by Congress under the Indian Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3,imposes upon the States a duty to negotiate in good faith with an Indian tribe toward the formation of a compact, § 2710(d)(3)(A), and authorizes a tribe to bring suit in federal court against a State in order to compel performance of that duty, § 2710(d)(7).  We hold that notwithstanding Congress' clear intent to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity, the Indian Commerce Clause does not grant Congress that power, and therefore § 2710(d)(7) cannot grant jurisdiction over a State that does not consent to be sued.  We further hold that the doctrine of Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 123</citedDecision> (1908), may not be used to enforce § 2710(d)(3) against a state official.  *48 I Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988 in order to provide a statutory basis for the operation and regulation of gaming by Indian tribes.  See 25 U. S. C. § 2702 .  The Act divides gaming on Indian lands into three classesI, II, and IIIand provides a different regulatory scheme for each class.  Class III gamingthe type with which we are here concernedis defined as "all forms of gaming that are not class I gaming or class II gaming," § 2703(8), and includes such things as slot machines, casino games, banking card games, dog racing, and lotteries.  [1] It is the most heavily regulated of the three classes.  The Act provides that class III gaming is lawful only where it is: (1) authorized by an ordinance or resolution that (a) is adopted by the governing body of the Indian tribe, (b) satisfies certain statutorily prescribed requirements, and (c) is approved by the National Indian Gaming Commission; (2) located in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization, or entity; and (3) "conducted in conformance with a Tribal-State compact entered into by the *49 Indian tribe and the State under paragraph (3) that is in effect."

 Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the suit violated the State's sovereign immunity from suit in federal court. The District Court denied respondents' motion, 801 F. Supp. 655 (SD Fla. 1992), and respondents took an interlocutory appeal of that decision.  See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139 (1993) (collateral order doctrine allows immediate appellate review of order denying claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity).  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed the decision of the District Court, holding that the Eleventh Amendment barred petitioner's suit against respondents.  [3] 11 F. 3d 1016 (1994).  The court agreed with the District Court that Congress in § 2710(d)(7) intended to abrogate the States' sovereign immunity, and also agreed that the Act had been passed pursuant to Congress' power under the Indian Commerce Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 3.  The court disagreed with the District Court, however, that the Indian *53 Commerce Clause grants Congress the power to abrogate a State's Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, and concluded therefore that it had no jurisdiction over petitioner's suit against Florida.  The court further held that Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 123</citedDecision> (1908), does not permit an Indian tribe to force good-faith negotiations by suing the Governor of a State.  Finding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, the Eleventh Circuit remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss petitioner's suit.  [4] Petitioner sought our review of the Eleventh Circuit's decision, [5] and we granted certiorari, 513 U. S. 1125 (1995), in order to consider two questions: (1) Does the Eleventh Amendment prevent Congress from authorizing suits by Indian tribes against States for prospective injunctive relief to enforce legislation enacted pursuant to the Indian Commerce Clause? ; and (2) Does the doctrine of Ex parte Young permit suits against a State's Governor for prospective injunctive relief to enforce the good-faith bargaining requirement of the Act?  We answer the first question in the affirmative, the second in the negative, and we therefore affirm the Eleventh Circuit's dismissal of petitioner's suit.  [6] *54 The Eleventh Amendment provides: "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State." Although the text of the Amendment would appear to restrict only the Article III diversity jurisdiction of the federal courts, "we have understood the Eleventh Amendment to stand not so much for what it says, but for the presupposition.

 For over a century we have reaffirmed that federal jurisdiction over suits against unconsenting States "was not contemplated by the Constitution when establishing the judicial power of the United States." Hans, supra, at 15 .  [7] *55 Here, petitioner has sued the State of Florida and it is undisputed that Florida has not consented to the suit.  See Blatchford, supra, at 782 (States by entering into the Constitution did not consent to suit by Indian tribes).  Petitioner nevertheless contends that its suit is not barred by state sovereign immunity.  First, it argues that Congress through the Act abrogated the States' sovereign immunity.  Alternatively, petitioner maintains that its suit against the Governor may go forward under Ex parte <citedDecision>Young, supra</citedDecision> .  We consider each of those arguments in turn.  II Petitioner argues that Congress through the Act abrogated the States' immunity from suit.  In order to determine whether Congress has abrogated the States' sovereign immunity, we ask two questions: first, whether Congress has "unequivocally expresse[d] its intent to abrogate the immunity," Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68 (1985); and second, whether Congress has acted "pursuant to a valid exercise of power," ibid. A Congress' intent to abrogate the States' immunity from suit must be obvious from "a clear legislative statement." Blatchford, supra, at 786 .  This rule arises from a recognition of the important role played by the Eleventh Amendment *56 and the broader principles that it reflects.  See Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 238-239 (1985); Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 345 (1979).

 This sweeping statement ignores the fact that the Nation survived for nearly two centuries without the question of the existence of such power ever being presented to this Court. And Congress itself waited nearly a century before even conferring federal-question jurisdiction on the lower federal courts.  [15] *72 In overruling Union Gas today, we reconfirm that the background principle of state sovereign immunity embodied in the Eleventh Amendment is not so ephemeral as to dissipate when the subject of the suit is an area, like the regulation of Indian commerce, that is under the exclusive control of the Federal Government.  Even when the Constitution vests in Congress complete lawmaking authority over a particular area, the Eleventh Amendment prevents congressional authorization of suits by private parties against unconsenting States.  [16] The Eleventh Amendment restricts the *73 judicial power under Article III, and Article I cannot be used to circumvent the constitutional limitations placed upon federal jurisdiction.  Petitioner's suit against the State of Florida must be dismissed for a lack of jurisdiction.  III Petitioner argues that we may exercise jurisdiction over its suit to enforce § 2710(d)(3) against the Governor notwithstanding the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment.  Petitioner notes that since our decision in Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 123</citedDecision> (1908), we often have found federal jurisdiction over a suit against a state official when that suit seeks only prospective injunctive relief in order to "end a continuing violation of federal law." Green v. Mansour , 474 U. S., at 68 .  The situation presented here, however, is sufficiently different from that giving rise to the traditional Ex parte Young action so as to preclude the availability of that doctrine.  Here, the "continuing violation of federal law" alleged by petitioner is the Governor's failure to bring the State into compliance with § 2710(d)(3).  But the duty to negotiate imposed upon the State by that statutory provision does not stand alone.  Rather, as we have seen, supra, at 49-50, Congress passed § 2710(d)(3) in conjunction with the carefully *74 crafted and intricate remedial scheme set forth in § 2710(d)(7).  Where Congress has created a remedial scheme for the enforcement of a particular federal right, we have, in suits against federal officers, refused to supplement that scheme with one created by the judiciary.  Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412, 423 (1988) ("When the design of a Government program suggests that Congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration, we have not created additional .

 I will explain why the *102 Eleventh Amendment did not affect federal-question jurisdiction, a notion that needs to be understood for the light it casts on the soundness of Hans `s holding that States did enjoy sovereign immunity in federal-question suits.  The Hans Court erroneously assumed that a State could plead sovereign immunity against a noncitizen suing under federal-question jurisdiction, and for that reason held that a State must enjoy the same protection in a suit by one of its citizens.  The error of Hans `s reasoning is underscored by its clear inconsistency with the Founders' hostility to the implicit reception of common-law doctrine as federal law, and with the Founders' conception of sovereign power as divided between the States and the National Government for the sake of very practical objectives.  The Court's answer today to the third question is likewise at odds with the Founders' view that common law, when it was received into the new American legal system, was always subject to legislative amendment.  In ignoring the reasons for this pervasive understanding at the time of the ratification, and in holding that a nontextual common-law rule limits a clear grant of congressional power under Article I, the Court follows a course that has brought it to grief before in our history, and promises to do so again.  Beyond this third question that elicits today's holding, there is one further issue.  To reach the Court's result, it must not only hold the Hans doctrine to be outside the reach of Congress, but must also displace the doctrine of Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 123</citedDecision> (1908), that an officer of the government may be ordered prospectively to follow federal law, in cases in which the government may not itself be sued directly.  None of its reasons for displacing <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> `s jurisdictional doctrine withstand scrutiny.  A The doctrine of sovereign immunity comprises two distinct rules, which are not always separately recognized.  The one rule holds that the King or the Crown, as the font of law, is *103 not bound by the law's provisions; the other provides that the King or Crown, as the font of justice, is not subject to suit in its own courts.  See, e. g., Jaffe, Suits Against Governments and Officers: Sovereign Immunity, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 1 , 3-4 (1963).  [2] The one rule limits the reach of substantive law; the other, the jurisdiction of the courts.  We are concerned here only with the latter rule, which took its common-law form in the high Middle Ages.  "At least as early as the thirteenth century, during the reign of Henry III (1216-1272), it was recognized that the king could not be sued in his own courts."

Id., at 398-399 (emphasis deleted) (opinion dissenting in part).  Later jurisprudence vindicated Justice Iredell's view, and the idea that "first principles" or concepts of "natural justice" might take precedence over the Constitution or other positive law "all but disappeared in American discourse." J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 52 (1980).  It should take more than references to "background principle[s]," ante, at 72, and "implicit limitation[s]," Welch, 483 U. S., at 496 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), to revive the judicial power to overcome clear text unopposed to any other provision, when that clear text is in harmony with an almost equally clear intent on the part of the Framers and the constitutionalists of their generation.  *169 IV The Court's holding that the States' Hans immunity may not be abrogated by Congress leads to the final question in this case, whether federal-question jurisdiction exists to order prospective relief enforcing IGRA against a state officer, respondent Chiles, who is said to be authorized to take the action required by the federal law. Just as with the issue about authority to order the State as such, this question is entirely jurisdictional, and we need not consider here whether petitioner Seminole Tribe would have a meritorious argument for relief, or how much practical relief the requested order (to bargain in good faith) would actually provide to the Tribe.  Nor, of course, does the issue turn in any way on one's views about the scope of the Eleventh Amendment or Hans and its doctrine, for we ask whether the state officer is subject to jurisdiction only on the assumption that action directly against the State is barred.  The answer to this question is an easy yes, the officer is subject to suit under the rule in Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 123</citedDecision> (1908), and the case could, and should, readily be decided on this point alone.  A In Ex parte Young, this Court held that a federal court has jurisdiction in a suit against a state officer to enjoin official actions violating federal law, even though the State itself may be immune.  Under <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> , "a federal court, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, may enjoin state officials to conform their future conduct to the requirements of federal law." Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 337 (1979); see also Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 289 (1977).  The fact, without more, that such suits may have a significant impact on state governments does not count under Young.  Milliken, for example, was a suit, under the authority of <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> , brought against Michigan's Governor, Attorney General, Board of Education, Superintendent of Public Instruction, *170 and Treasurer, which resulted in an order obligating the State of Michigan to pay money from its treasury to fund an education plan.  The relief requested (and obtained) by the plaintiffs effectively ran against the State: state moneys were to be removed from the state treasury, and they were to be spent to fund a remedial education program that it would be the State's obligation to implement.  To take another example, Quern v. Jordan involved a court order requiring state officials to notify welfare beneficiaries of the availability of past benefits.  Once again, the defendants were state officials, but it was the obligation of the State that was really at issue: the notices would be sent from the state welfare agency, to be returned to the state agency, and the state agency would pay for the notices and any ensuing awards of benefits.  Indeed, in the years since <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> was decided, the Court has recognized only one limitation on the scope of its doctrine: under Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974), <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> permits prospective relief only and may not be applied to authorize suits for retrospective monetary relief.  It should be no cause for surprise that <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> itself appeared when it did in the national law. It followed as a matter of course after the Hans Court's broad recognition of immunity in federal-question cases, simply because "[r]emedies designed to end a continuing violation of federal law are necessary to vindicate the federal interest in assuring the supremacy of that law." Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 68 (1985).  <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> provided, as it does today, a sensible way to reconcile the Court's expansive view of immunity expressed in Hans with the principles embodied in the Supremacy Clause and Article III. If <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> may be seen as merely the natural consequence of Hans , it is equally unsurprising as an event in the longer history of sovereign immunity doctrine, for the rule we speak of under the name of <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> isso far inherent in the jurisdictional limitation imposed by sovereign immunity as to have been recognized since the Middle Ages.  For that *171 long it has been settled doctrine that suit against an officer of the Crown permitted relief against the government despite the Crown's immunity from suit in its own courts and the maxim that the King could do no wrong.  See Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 3, 18-19; Ehrlich, No. XII: Proceedings Against the Crown (1216-1377), pp. 28-29, in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History (P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921).  An early example, from "time immemorial" of a claim "affecting the Crown [that] could be pursued in the regular courts [without consent since it]did not take the form of a suit against the Crown," Jaffe, supra, at 1, was recognized by the Statute of Westminster I, 1275, which established a writ of disseisin against a King's officers.  When a King's officer disseised any person in the King's name, the wrongfully deprived party could seek the draconian writ of attaint against the officer, by which he would recover his land.  Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 9.  Following this example forward, we may see how the writ of attaint was ultimately overtaken by the more moderate common-law writs of certiorari and mandamus, "operat[ing] directly on the government; [and commanding] an officer not as an individual but as a functionary."
**Combined Opinion**
 Suits against these officials are consequently barred by neither the Eleventh Amendment nor Hans immunity.  The officer's action "is simply an illegal act upon the part of a state official in attempting *174 by the use of the name of the State to enforce a legislative enactment which is void because unconstitutional.  .  .  .  The State has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States." Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S., at 159-160</citedDecision> .  The decision in Ex parte Young, and the historic doctrine it embodies, thus plays a foundational role in American constitutionalism, and while the doctrine is sometimes called a "fiction," the long history of its felt necessity shows it to be something much more estimable, as we may see by considering the facts of the case. "Young was really and truly about to damage the interest of plaintiffs.  Whether what he was about to do amounted to a legal injury depended on the authority of his employer, the state.  If the state could constitutionally authorize the act then the loss suffered by plaintiffs was not a wrong for which the law provided a remedy.  .  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 But because in practice, in the real world of congressional legislation, such *175 an intent would be exceedingly odd, it would be equally odd for this Court to recognize an intent to block the customary application of Ex parte Young without applying the rule recognized in our previous cases, which have insisted on a clear statement before assuming a congressional purpose to "affec[t] the federal balance," United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971).  See also Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U. S. 58, 65 (1989) ("[I]f Congress intends to alter the `usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government,' it must make its intention to do so `unmistakably clear in the language of the statute' ") (quoting Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 242 ); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U. S. 452, 460-461 (1991).  Our habitual caution makes sense for just the reason we mentioned in Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S., at 230 -231: it is "difficult to believe that .  .  .  Congress, taking careful stock of the state of Eleventh Amendment law, decided it would drop coy hints but stop short of making its intention manifest." C There is no question that by its own terms <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> `s indispensable rule authorizes the exercise of federal jurisdiction over respondent Chiles.  Since this case does not, of course, involve retrospective relief, Edelman `s limit is irrelevant, and there is no other jurisdictional limitation.  Obviously, for jurisdictional purposes it makes no difference in principle whether the injunction orders an official not to act, as in <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> , or requires the official to take some positive step, as in Milliken or Quern .  Nothing, then, in this case renders <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> unsuitable as a jurisdictional basis for determining on the merits whether petitioner is entitled to an order against a state official under general equitable doctrine.  The Court does not say otherwise, and yet it refuses to apply <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> .  There is no adequate reason for its refusal.  No clear statement of intent to displace the doctrine of Ex parte Young occurs in IGRA, and the Court is instead *176 constrained to rest its effort to skirt <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> on a series of suggestions thought to be apparent in Congress's provision of "intricate procedures" for enforcing a State's obligation under the Act.  The procedures are said to implicate a rule against judicial creativity in devising supplementary procedures; it is said that applying <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> would nullify the statutory procedures; and finally the statutory provisions are said simply to reveal a congressional intent to preclude the application of <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> .  1 The Court cites Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U. S. 412, 423 (1988), in support of refraining from what it seems to think would be judicial creativity in recognizing the applicability of <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> .  The Court quotes from Chilicky for the general proposition that when Congress has provided what it considers adequate remedial mechanisms for violations of federal law, this Court should not "creat[e]" additional remedies.  Ante, at 74.  The Court reasons that Congress's provision in IGRA of "intricate procedures" shows that it considers its remedial provisions to be adequate, with the implication that courts as a matter of prudence should provide no "additional" remedy under Ex parte Young.  Ante , at 73-76.  Chilicky `s remoteness from the point of this case is, however, apparent from its facts.  In Chilicky , Congress had addressed the problem of erroneous denials of certain government benefits by creating a scheme of appeals and awards that would make a successful claimant whole for all benefits wrongly denied.  The question was whether this Court should create a further remedy on the model of Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388 (1971), for such harms as emotional distress, when the erroneous denial of benefits had involved a violation of procedural due process.  The issue, then, was whether to create a supplemental remedy, backward looking on the Bivens model, running against a federal official in his personal capacity, and requiring an *177 affirmative justification (as Bivens does).  See Bivens, supra; FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U. S. 471, 484-486 (1994).  The Bivens issue in Chilicky (and in Meyer ) is different from the <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> issue here in every significant respect.  <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> is not an example of a novel rule that a proponent has a burden to justify affirmatively on policy grounds in every context in which it might arguably be recognized; it is a general principle of federal equity jurisdiction that has been recognized throughout our history and for centuries before our own history began.  <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> does not provide retrospective monetary relief but allows prospective enforcement of federal law that is entitled to prevail under the Supremacy Clause.  It requires not money payments from a government employee's personal pocket, but lawful conduct by a public employee acting in his official capacity.  <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> would not function here to provide a merely supplementary regime of compensation to deter illegal action, but the sole jurisdictional basis for an Article III court's enforcement of a clear federal statutory obligation, without which a congressional act would be rendered a nullity in a federal court. One cannot intelligibly generalize from Chilicky `s standards for imposing the burden to justify a supplementary scheme of tort law to the displacement of <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> `s traditional and indispensable jurisdictional basis for ensuring official compliance with federal law when a State itself is immune from suit.  2 Next, the Court suggests that it may be justified in displacing <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> because <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> would allow litigants to ignore the "intricate procedures" of IGRA in favor of a menu of streamlined equity rules from which any litigant could order as he saw fit.  But there is no basis in law for this suggestion, and the strongest authority to reject it.  <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> did not establish a new cause of action and it does not impose any particular procedural regime in the suits it permits.  It stands, instead, for a jurisdictional rule by which paramount *178 federal law may be enforced in a federal court by substituting a nonimmune party (the state officer) for an immune one (the State itself).  <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> does no more and furnishes no authority for the Court's assumption that it somehow pre-empts procedural rules devised by Congress for particular kinds of cases that may depend on <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> for federal jurisdiction.  [61] If, indeed, the Court were correct in assuming that Congress may not regulate the procedure of a suit jurisdictionally dependent on <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> , the consequences would be revolutionary, for example, in habeas law. It is well established that when a habeas corpus petitioner sues a state official alleging detention in violation of federal law and seeking the prospective remedy of release from custody, it is the doctrine identified in Ex parte Young that allows the petitioner to evade the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment (or, more properly, the Hans doctrine).  See Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S., at 167-168</citedDecision> ; Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U. S. 682, 689-690 (1949).  [62] And yet Congress has imposed *179 a number of restrictions upon the habeas remedy, see, e. g., 28 U. S. C. § 2254 (b) (requiring exhaustion of state remedies prior to bringing a federal habeas petition), and this Court has articulated several more, see, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991) (abuse of the writ); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989) (limiting applicability of "new rules" on habeas); Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993) (applying a more deferential harmless-error standard on habeas review).  By suggesting that Ex parte Young provides a free-standing remedy not subject to the restrictions otherwise imposed on federal remedial schemes (such as habeas corpus), the Court suggests that a state prisoner may circumvent these restrictions by ostensibly bringing his suit under <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> rather than 28 U. S. C. § 2254 .  The Court's view implies similar consequences under any number of similarly structured federal statutory schemes.  [63] This, of course, cannot be the law, and the plausible rationale for rejecting the Court's contrary assumption is that Congress has just as much authority to regulate suits when jurisdiction depends on <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> as it has to regulate when <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> is out of the jurisdictional picture.  If <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> does not preclude Congress from requiring state exhaustion in habeas cases (and it clearly does not), then <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> does not bar the application of IGRA's procedures when effective relief is sought by suing a state officer.  3 The Court's third strand of reasoning for displacing Ex parte Young is a supposed inference that Congress so intended.  *180 Since the Court rests this inference in large part on its erroneous assumption that the statute's procedural limitations would not be applied in a suit against an officer for which <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> provided the jurisdictional basis, the error of that assumption is enough to show the unsoundness of any inference that Congress meant to exclude <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> `s application.  But there are further reasons pointing to the utter implausibility of the Court's reading of the congressional mind.  IGRA's jurisdictional provision reads as though it had been drafted with the specific intent to apply to officer liability under <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> .  It provides that "[t]he United States district courts shall have jurisdiction over .  .  .  any cause of action .  .  .  arising from the failure of a State to enter into negotiations .  .  .  or to conduct such negotiations in good faith." 25 U. S. C. § 2710 (d)(7)(A)(i) (emphasis added).  This language does not limit the possible defendants to States and is quite literally consistent with the possibility that a tribe could sue an appropriate state official for a State's failure to negotiate.  [64] The door is so obviously just as open to jurisdiction over an officer under <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> as to jurisdiction over a State directly that it is difficult to see why the statute would have been drafted as it was unless it was done in anticipation that <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> might well be the jurisdictional basis for enforcement action.  But even if the jurisdictional provision had spoken narrowly of an action against the State itself (as it subsequently speaks in terms of the State's obligation), that would be no indication that Congress had rejected the application of <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> .  An order requiring a "State" to comply with federal *181 law can, of course, take the form of an order directed to the State in its sovereign capacity.  But as Ex parte Young and innumerable other cases show, there is nothing incongruous about a duty imposed on a "State" that Congress intended to be effectuated by an order directed to an appropriate state official.  The habeas corpus statute, again, comes to mind.  It has long required "the State," by "order directed to an appropriate State official," to produce the state-court record where an indigent habeas petitioner argues that a state court's factual findings are not fairly supported in the record.  See 28 U. S. C. § 2254 (e) ("the State shall produce such part of the record and the Federal court shall direct the State to do so by order directed to an appropriate State official").  If, then, IGRA's references to "a State's" duty were not enforceable by order to a state official, it would have to be for some other reason than the placement of the statutory duty on "the State." It may be that even the Court agrees, for it falls back to the position, see ante, at 75, n. 17, that only a State, not a state officer, can enter into a compact.  This is true but wholly beside the point.  The issue is whether negotiation should take place as required by IGRA and an officer (indeed, only an officer) can negotiate.  In fact, the only case cited by the Court, State ex rel. Stephan v. Finney, 251 Kan. 559 , 836 P. 2d 1169 (1992), makes that distinction abundantly clear.  Finally, one must judge the Court's purported inference by stepping back to ask why Congress could possibly have intended to jeopardize the enforcement of the statute by excluding application of <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> `s traditional jurisdictional rule, when that rule would make the difference between success or failure in the federal court if state sovereign immunity was recognized.  Why would Congress have wanted to go for broke on the issue of state immunity in the event the State pleaded immunity as a jurisdictional bar?  Why would Congress not have wanted IGRA to be enforced by means of *182 a traditional doctrine giving federal courts jurisdiction over state officers, in an effort to harmonize state sovereign immunity with federal law that is paramount under the Supremacy Clause?  There are no plausible answers to these questions.  D There is, finally, a response to the Court's rejection of <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> that ought to go without saying.  Our long-standing practice is to read ambiguous statutes to avoid constitutional infirmity, Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Florida Gulf Coast Building & Constr. Trades Council, 485 U. S. 568, 575 (1988) ("`every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save a statute from unconstitutionality' ") (quoting Hooper v. California, 155 U. S. 648, 657 (1895)).  This practice alone (without any need for a clear statement to displace <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> ) would be enough to require <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> `s application.  So, too, would the application of another rule, requiring courts to choose any reasonable construction of a statute that would eliminate the need to confront a contested constitutional issue (in this case, the place of state sovereign immunity in federal-question cases and the status of Union Gas ).  NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 500-501 (1979).  Construing the statute to harmonize with <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> , as it readily does, would have saved an Act of Congress and rendered a discussion on constitutional grounds wholly unnecessary.  This case should be decided on this basis alone.  V Absent the application of Ex parte Young, I would, of course, follow Union Gas in recognizing congressional power under Article I to abrogate Hans immunity.  Since the reasons for this position, as explained in Parts IIIII, supra, tend to unsettle Hans as well as support Union Gas, I should add a word about my reasons for continuing to accept Hans `s holding as a matter of stare decisis.  *183 The Hans doctrine was erroneous, but it has not previously proven to be unworkable or to conflict with later doctrine or to suffer from the effects of facts developed since its decision (apart from those indicating its original errors).  I would therefore treat Hans as it has always been treated in fact until today, as a doctrine of federal common law. For, as so understood, it has formed one of the strands of the federal relationship for over a century now, and the stability of that relationship is itself a value that stare decisis aims to respect.  In being ready to hold that the relationship may still be altered, not by the Court but by Congress, I would tread the course laid out elsewhere in our cases. The Court has repeatedly stated its assumption that insofar as the relative positions of States and Nation may be affected consistently with the Tenth Amendment, [65] they would not be modified without deliberately expressed intent.

 .  .  [The Constitution] can have no operation but this: .  .  .  if a state should condescend to be a party, this court may take cognizance of it").  [14]  This argument wholly disregards other methods of ensuring the States' compliance with federal law: The Federal Government can bring suit in federal court against a State, see, e. g., United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621, 644-645 (1892) (finding such power necessary to the "permanence of the Union"); an individual can bring suit against a state officer in order to ensure that the officer's conduct is in compliance with federal law, see, e. g., Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 123</citedDecision> (1908); and this Court is empowered to review a question of federal law arising from a state-court decision where a State has consented to suit, see, e. g., Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264 (1821).  [15]  Justice Stevens, in his dissenting opinion, makes two points that merit separate response.  First, he contends that no distinction may be drawn between state sovereign immunity and the immunity enjoyed by state and federal officials.  But even assuming that the latter has no constitutional foundation, the distinction is clear: The Constitution specifically recognizes the States as sovereign entities, while government officials enjoy no such constitutional recognition.  Second, Justice Stevens criticizes our prior decisions applying the "clear statement rule," suggesting that they were based upon an understanding that Article I allowed Congress to abrogate state sovereign immunity.  His criticism, however, ignores the fact that many of those cases arose in the context of a statute passed under the Fourteenth Amendment, where Congress' authority to abrogate is undisputed.  See, e. g., Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332 (1979).

J. Orth, Judicial Power of the United States: The Eleventh Amendment in American History 9 (1987); see generally id., at 90-109.  Second, at the same time that this Court was articulating broad principles of immunity for States, we refused to recognize similar immunity for municipalities and similar state political subdivisions.  See, e. g., Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529 (1890).  Professor Orth suggests that this seeming inconsistency is traceable to the enforcement difficulties arising from the withdrawal of federal troops from the South. "It just so happened," he points out, "that counties had tended to issue bonds in the West, while in the South, states had usually done the job.  Property in the form of bonds could be defended in the mid-West and West, but similar property in the South had to be sacrificed to the higher politics of the Compromise of 1877." Orth, supra, at 111.  Finally, Professor Orth attributes this Court's recognition (or revival) of the Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 123</citedDecision> (1908), action as a way around state sovereign immunity to the fact that, by 1908, "the problem of repudiated Southern bonds was clearly a specter from an increasingly distant past." Orth, supra, at 128.  See also Gibbons, supra, at 2002 (arguing that the Court's unanimous revival of its power to grant equitable relief against state officers in Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U. S. 1 (1891), was made possible by the fact that the case "did not involve Southern State bonds").  I am reluctant, to be sure, to ascribe these legal developments to a single, extralegal cause, and at least one commentator has suggested that the Southern debt crisis may not have been the only factor driving the Court's Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence during this period.  See generally Collins, The Conspiracy Theory of the Eleventh Amendment, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 212 (1988) (reviewing Orth).  But neither would I ignore the pattern of the cases, which tends to show that the presence or absence of enforcement difficulties significantly influenced the path of the law in this area.  See id., at 243 (acknowledging that "[i]t is perfectly conceivable that Compromise-related politics exerted their influence at the margin in doubtful cases in which the Court might have gone either way").

 When the Constitution has received such general principles into our law, for example, in the Admiralty Clause's adoption of the general "law of nations" or "law of the sea," those principles have always been subject to change by congressional enactment.  See, e. g., Panama R. Co. v. Johnson, 264 U. S. 375, 386 (1924) (noting that although "the principles of the general maritime law, sometimes called the law of the sea," were "embodied" in Art. III, § 2, of the Constitution, they remained "subject to power in Congress to alter, qualify or supplement"); The Nereide, 9 Cranch 388, 423 (1815) (Marshall, C. J.) (stating that the Court would be "bound by the law of nations" until Congress passed a contrary enactment).  [60]  Cf. United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S. 549, 606 (1995) (Souter, J., dissenting) ("The fulcrums of judicial review in [the Lochner cases] were the notions of liberty and property characteristic of laissez-faire economics, whereas the Commerce Clause cases turned on what was ostensibly a structural limit of federal power, but under each conception of judicial review the Court's character for the first third of the century showed itself in exacting judicial scrutiny of a legislature's choice of economic ends and of the legislative means selected to reach them").  [61]  The Court accuses me of misrepresenting its argument.  Ante, at 75, n. 17.  The Court's claim, as I read it, is not that Congress cannot authorize federal jurisdiction under Ex parte Young over a cause of action with a limited remedial scheme, but rather that remedial limitations on the underlying cause of action do not apply to a claim based on Ex parte Young.  Otherwise, the existence of those remedial limitations would provide no reason for the Court to assume that Congress did not intend to permit an action under <citedDecision>Young</citedDecision> ; rather, the limitations would apply regardless of whether the suit was brought against the State or a state officer.  [62]  See also Brennan v. Stewart, 834 F. 2d 1248, 1252, n. 6 (CA5 1988) ("[A]lthough not usually conceptualized as Ex parte Young cases, most of the huge number of habeas claims in the federal courts under 28 U. S. C. § 2254 are effectively suits against the states.  These suits pass muster under the Eleventh Amendment because the habeas theory of a civil suit against the bad jailer fits perfectly with the Ex parte Young fiction"); United States ex rel. Elliott v. Hendricks, 213 F. 2d 922, 926-928 (CA3) (exercising jurisdiction over a habeas suit despite an Eleventh Amendment challenge on the theory that the suit was against a state officer), cert. denied, 348 U. S. 851 (1954).  [63]  Many other federal statutes impose obligations on state officials, the enforcement of which is subject to "intricate provisions" also statutorily provided.  See, e. g., Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U. S. C. § 1365 (a) (citizen-suit provision to enforce States' obligations under federal environmental law); Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, 42 U. S. C. § 11001 (privately enforceable requirement that States form commissions, appointed by the Governor, to generate plans for addressing hazardous material emergencies).  [64]  In order for any person (whether individual or entity) to be a proper defendant under § 2710(d)(7) (and in order for standing to exist, since one of its requirements is redressability), that person, of course, would need to have some connection to the State's negotiations.  See Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S., at 157</citedDecision> ; Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788, 803 (1992).  The obvious candidates are the responsible state officials.  [65]  The scope of the Tenth Amendment's limitations of congressional power remains a subject of debate.  New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), holds that principles of federalism are "violated by a formal command from the National Government directing the State to enact a certain policy." United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 583 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Some suggest that the prohibition extends further than barring the Federal Government from directing the creation of state law. The views I express today should not be understood to take a position on that disputed question.  [66]  See also The Federalist No. 46, at 319 (J. Madison) (explaining that the Federal Government "will partake sufficiently of the spirit [of the States], to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States, or the prerogatives of their governments"); Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government, 54 Colum. L. Rev. 543 (1954).
