 Complaints from competitors about an advertisement placed by 44 Liquormart in a Rhode Island newspaper in 1991 generated enforcement proceedings that in turn led to the initiation of this litigation.  The advertisement did not state the price of any alcoholic beverages.  Indeed, it noted that “State law prohibits advertising liquor prices.” The ad did, however, state the low prices at which peanuts, potato chips, and Schweppes mixers were being offered, identify various brands of packaged liquor, and include the word “WOW” in large letters next to pictures of vodka and rum bottles.  Based on the conclusion that the implied reference to bargain prices for liquor violated the statutory ban on *493 price advertising, the Rhode Island Liquor Control Administrator assessed a $400 fine.  After paying the fine, 44 Liquormart, joined by Peoples, filed this action against the administrator in the Federal District Court seeking a declaratory judgment that the two statutes and the administrator’s implementing regulations violate the First Amendment and other provisions of federal law. The Rhode Island Liquor Stores Association was allowed to intervene as a defendant and in due course the State of Rhode Island replaced the administrator as the principal defendant.  The parties stipulated that the price advertising ban is vigorously enforced, that Rhode Island permits “all advertising of alcoholic beverages excepting references to price outside the licensed premises,” and that petitioners’ proposed ads do not concern an illegal activity and presumably would not be false or misleading.  44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine, <citedDecision>829 F. Supp. 543, 545</citedDecision> (RI 1993).  The parties disagreed, however, about the impact of the ban on the promotion of temperance in Rhode Island.  On that question the District Court heard conflicting expert testimony and reviewed a number of studies.  In his findings of fact, the District Judge first noted that there was a pronounced lack of unanimity among researchers who have studied the impact of advertising on the level of consumption of alcoholic beverages.  He referred to a 1985 Federal Trade Commission study that found no evidence that alcohol advertising significantly affects alcohol abuse.  Another study indicated that Rhode Island ranks in the upper 30% of States in per capita consumption of alcoholic beverages; alcohol consumption is lower in other States that allow price advertising.  After summarizing the testimony of the expert witnesses for both parties, he found “as a fact that Rhode Island’s off-premises liquor price advertising ban has no significant impact on levels of alcohol consumption in Rhode Island.” <citedDecision>Id., at 549</citedDecision> .  *494 As a matter of law, he concluded that the price advertising ban was unconstitutional because it did not “directly advance” the State’s interest in reducing alcohol consumption and was “more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.” <citedDecision>Id., at 555</citedDecision> .  He reasoned that the party seeking to uphold a restriction on commercial speech carries the burden of justifying it and that the Twenty-first Amendment did not shift or diminish that burden.  Acknowledging that it might have been reasonable for the state legislature to “assume a correlation between the price advertising ban and reduced consumption,” he held that more than a rational basis was required to justify the speech restriction, and that the State had failed to demonstrate a reasonable “‘fit’” between its policy objectives and its chosen means.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> The Court of Appeals reversed.  39 F. 3d 5 (CA1 1994).  It found “inherent merit” in the State’s submission that competitive price advertising would lower prices and that lower prices would produce more sales.  Id., at 7 .  Moreover, it agreed with the reasoning of the Rhode Island Supreme Court that the Twenty-first Amendment gave the statutes an added presumption of validity.  Id., at 8 .  Alternatively, it concluded that reversal was compelled by this Court’s summary action in Queensgate Investment Co. v. Liquor Control Comm’n of Ohio, 459 U. S. 807 (1982).

 For that reason, the State bears the burden of showing not merely that its regulation will advance its interest, but also that it will do so “to a material degree.” Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 771 ; see also Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 486-488 .  The need for the State to make such a showing is particularly great given the drastic nature of its chosen means — the wholesale suppression of truthful, non-misleading information.  Accordingly, we must determine whether the State has shown that the price advertising ban will significantly reduce alcohol consumption.  We can agree that common sense supports the conclusion that a prohibition against price advertising, like a collusive agreement among competitors to refrain from such advertising, 15 will tend to mitigate competition and maintain prices at a higher level than would prevail in a completely free market.  Despite the absence of proof on the point, we can even agree with the State’s contention that it is reasonable to assume that demand, and hence consumption throughout the market, is somewhat lower whenever a higher, noncompetitive price level prevails.  However, without any findings of fact, or indeed any evidentiary support whatsoever, we cannot agree with the assertion that the price advertising ban will significantly advance the State’s interest in promoting temperance.  *506 Although the record suggests that the price advertising ban may have some impact on the purchasing patterns of temperate drinkers of modest means, <citedDecision>829 F. Supp., at 546</citedDecision> , the State has presented no evidence to suggest that its speech prohibition will significantly reduce marketwide consumption.  16 Indeed, the District Court’s considered and un-contradicted finding on this point is directly to the contrary.  <citedDecision>Id., at 549</citedDecision> .  17 Moreover, the evidence suggests that the abusive drinker will probably not be deterred by a marginal price increase, and that the true alcoholic may simply reduce his purchases of other necessities.  In addition, as the District Court noted, the State has not identified what price level would lead to a significant reduction in alcohol consumption, nor has it identified the amount *507 that it believes prices would decrease without the ban.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Thus, the State’s own showing reveals that any connection between the ban and a significant change in alcohol consumption would be purely fortuitous.  As is evident, any conclusion that elimination of the ban would significantly increase alcohol consumption would require us to engage in the sort of “speculation or conjecture” that is an unacceptable means of demonstrating that a restriction on commercial speech directly advances the State’s asserted interest.  Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 770 .  18 Such speculation certainly does not suffice when the State takes aim at accurate commercial information for paternalistic ends.  The State also cannot satisfy the requirement that its restriction on speech be no more extensive than necessary.  It is perfectly obvious that alternative forms of regulation that would not involve any restriction on speech would be more likely to achieve the State’s goal of promoting temperance.  As the State’s own expert conceded, higher prices can be maintained either by direct regulation or by increased taxation.  <citedDecision>829 F. Supp., at 549</citedDecision> .  Per capita purchases could be limited as is the case with prescription drugs.  Even educational campaigns focused on the problems of excessive, or even moderate, drinking might prove to be more effective.  As a result, even under the less than strict standard that generally applies in commercial speech cases, the State has failed to establish a “reasonable fit” between its abridgment of speech and its temperance goal.  Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y. v. Fox, 492 U. S. 469, 480 (1989); see also *508 Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 491 (explaining that defects in a federal ban on alcohol advertising are “further highlighted by the availability of alternatives that would prove less intrusive to the First Amendment’s protections for commercial speech”); Linmark, 431 U. S., at 97 (suggesting that the State use financial incentives or counterspeech, rather than speech restrictions, to advance its interests).  It necessarily follows that the price advertising ban cannot survive the more stringent constitutional review that Central Hudson itself concluded was appropriate for the complete suppression of truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech.  447 U. S., at 566, n. 9 .

 Gen. Laws §3-1-5 (1987).  See, e. g., Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp., 485 U. S. 717, 735 (1988) (considering restriction on price advertising as evidence of Sherman Act violation); United States v. Sealy, Inc., 388 U. S. 350, 355 (1967) (same); Blackburn v. Sweeney, 53 F. 3d 825, 828 (CA7 1995) (considering restrictions on the location of advertising as evidence of Sherman Act violation).  Petitioners’ stipulation that they each expect to realize a $100,000 benefit per year if the ban is lifted is not to the contrary.  App. 47.  The stipulation shows only that petitioners believe they will be able to compete more effectively for existing alcohol consumers if there is no ban on price advertising.  It does not show that they believe either the number of alcohol consumers, or the number of purchases by those consumers, will increase in the ban’s absence.  Indeed, the State’s own expert conceded that “plaintiffs’ expectation of realizing additional profits through price advertising has no necessary relationship to increased overall consumption.” <citedDecision>829 F. Supp., at 549</citedDecision> .  Moreover, we attach little significance to the fact that some studies suggest that people budget the amount of money that they will spend on alcohol.  39 F. 3d 5, 7 (CA1 1994).  These studies show only that, in a competitive market, people will tend to search for the cheapest product in order to meet their budgets.  The studies do not suggest that the amount of money budgeted for alcohol consumption will remain fixed in the face of a marketwide price increase.  Although the Court of Appeals concluded that the regulation directly advanced the State’s interest, it did not dispute the District Court’s conclusion that the evidence suggested that, at most, a price advertising ban would have a marginal impact on overall alcohol consumption.  Id., at 7-8 ; cf. Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Assn. v. Attorney General, 142 Mich. App., at 311 , 370 N. W. 2d, at 336 (explaining that “any additional impact on the level of consumption attributable to the absence of price advertisements would be negligible”).
