<p id="b282-5">I wholly agree with the Court’s conclusion that <em>Halper’s </em>test for whether a sanction is “punitive” was ill considered and unworkable. <em>Ante, </em>at 101-102. Indeed, it was the absurdity of trying to force the <em>Halper </em>analysis upon the Montana tax scheme at issue in <em>Department of Revenue of Mont </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>511 U. S. 767 (1994), that prompted me to focus on the prior question whether the Double Jeopardy Clause even contains a multiple-punishments prong. See <em>id., </em>at 802-803. That evaluation led me to the conclusion that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits successive prosecution, not successive punishment, and that we should therefore “put the <em>Halper </em>genie back in the bottle.” <em>Id., </em>at 803-805. Today’s opinion uses a somewhat different bottle than I would, returning the law to its state immediately prior to <em>Halper </em>— which acknowledged a constitutional prohibition of multiple punishments but required successive criminal prosecutions. So long as that requirement is maintained, our multiple-punishments jurisprudence essentially duplicates what I believe to be the correct double jeopardy law, and will be as harmless in the future as it was <em>pre-Halper. </em>Accordingly, I am pleased to concur.</p>
