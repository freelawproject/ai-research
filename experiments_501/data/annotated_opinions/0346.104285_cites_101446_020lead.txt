Mr. Justice Douglas delivered the opinion of the Court. In 1943 petitioner, a native of Canada, filed his petition for naturalization in the District Court of Massachusetts.  He stated in his application that he understood the prin *62 ciples of the government of the United States, believed in its form of government, and was willing to take the oath of allegiance ( 54 Stat. 1157 , 8 U. S. C. § 735 (b)) which reads as follows: “I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion: So help me God.” To the question in the application “If necessary, are you willing to take up arms in defense of this country?” he replied, “No (Non-combatant) Seventh Day Adventist.” He explained that answer before the examiner by saying “it is a purely religious matter with me, I have no political or personal reasons other than that.” He did not claim before his Selective Service board exemption from all military service, but only from combatant military duty.  At the hearing in the District Court petitioner testified that he was a member of the Seventh Day Adventist denomination, of whom approximately 10,000 were then serving in the armed forces of the United States as non-combatants, especially in the medical corps; and that he was willing to serve in the army but would not bear arms.  The District Court admitted him to citizenship.  The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting.  149 F. 2d 760 .  It took that action on the authority of United States v. Schwimmer, <citedDecision>279 U. S. 644</citedDecision> ; United States v. Macintosh, 283 U. S. 605 , and United States v. Bland, 283 U. S. 636 , saying that the facts of the present case brought it squarely within the principle of those cases. The case is here on *63 a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted so that those authorities might be re-examined.  The Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases involved, as does the present one, a question of statutory construction.  At the time of those cases, Congress required an alien, before admission to citizenship, to declare on oath in open court that “he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” 1 It also required the court to be satisfied that the alien had during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of his application “behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.” 2 Those provisions were reenacted into the present law in substantially the same, form.  3 While there are some factual distinctions between this case and the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> and Macintosh cases, the Bland case on its facts is indistinguishable.  But the principle emerging from the three cases obliterates any factual distinction among them.  As we recognized in In re Summers, 325 U. S. 561, 572, 577 , they stand for the same general rule — that an alien who refuses to bear arms will not be admitted to citizenship.  As an original proposition, we could not agree with that rule.  The fallacies underlying *64 it were, we think, demonstrated in the dissents of Mr. Justice Holmes in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case and of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes in the Macintosh case. The oath required of aliens does not in terms require that they promise to bear arms.  Nor has Congress expressly made any such finding a prerequisite to citizenship.  To hold that it is required is to read it into the Act by implication.  But we could not assume that Congress intended to make such an abrupt and radical departure from our traditions unless it spoke in unequivocal terms.  The bearing of arms, important as it is, is not the only way in which our institutions may be supported and defended, even in times of great peril.  Total war in its modern form dramatizes as never before the great cooperative effort necessary for victory.  The nuclear physicists who developed the atomic bomb, the worker at his lathe, the seamen on cargo vessels, construction battalions, nurses, engineers, litter bearers, doctors, chaplains — these, too, made essential contributions.  And many of them made the supreme sacrifice.  Mr. Justice Holmes stated in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case (279 U. S. p. 655) that “the Quakers have done their share to make the country what it is.” And the annals of the recent war show that many whose religious scruples prevented them from bearing arms, nevertheless were unselfish participants in the war effort.  Refusal to bear arms is not necessarily a sign of disloyalty or a lack of attachment to our institutions.  One may serve his country faithfully and devotedly, though his religious scruples make it impossible for him to shoulder a rifle.  Devotion to one’s country can be as real and as enduring among non-combatants as among combatants.  One may adhere to what he deems to be his obligation to God and yet assume all military risks to secure victory.  The effort of war is indivisible; and those whose religious scruples prevent them from killing are no less patriots than those whose special traits or handicaps result in their *65 assignment to duties far behind the fighting front.  Each is making the utmost contribution according to his capacity.

 Can it be that the oath means one thing to one who has served to the extent permitted by his religious scruples and another thing to one equally willing to serve but who has not had the opportunity?  It is not enough to say that petitioner is not entitled to the benefits of the new Act since he did not serve in the armed forces.  He is not seeking the benefits of the expedited procedure and the relaxed requirements.  The oath which he must take is identical with the oath which both non-combatants and combatants must take.  It would, indeed, be a strange construction to say that “support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic” demands something more from some than it does from others.  That oath can hardly be adequate for one who is unwilling to bear arms because of religious scruples and yet exact from another a promise to bear arms despite religious scruples.  Mr. Justice Holmes stated in the <citedDecision>Schwimmer</citedDecision> case (279 U. S. pp. 654-55): “if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought — not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.  I think that we should adhere to that principle with regard to admission into, as well as to life within this country.” The struggle for religious liberty has through the centuries been an effort to accommodate the demands of the State to the conscience of the individual.  The victory for freedom of thought recorded in our Bill of Rights recognizes that in the domain of conscience there is a moral power higher than the State.  Throughout the ages, men have suffered death rather than subordinate their allegiance to God to the authority of the State.  Freedom of religion guaranteed by the First Amendment is the product of that struggle.  As we *69 recently stated in United States v. Ballard, 322 U. S. 78, 86 , “Freedom of thought, which includes freedom of religious belief, is basic in a society of free men.  Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U. S. 624 .” The test oath is abhorrent to our tradition.
