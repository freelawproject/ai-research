CHIEF Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court. The Government administratively imposed monetary penalties and occupational debarment on petitioners for violation of federal banking statutes, and later criminally indicted them for essentially the same conduct.  We hold that the *96 Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not a bar to the later criminal prosecution because the administrative proceedings were civil, not criminal.  Our reasons for so holding in large part disavow the method of analysis used in United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448 (1989), and reaffirm the previously established rule exemplified in United States v. Ward, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 242, 248-249</citedDecision> (1980).  During the early and mid-1980’s, petitioner John Hudson was the chairman and controlling shareholder of the First National Bank of Tipton (Tipton) and the First National Bank of Hammon (Hammon).  1 During the same period, petitioner Jack Rackley was president of Tipton and a member of the board of directors of Hammon, and petitioner Larry Baresel was a member of the board of directors of both Tipton and Hammon.  An examination of Tipton and Hammon led the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to conclude that petitioners had used their bank positions to arrange a series of loans to third parties in violation of various federal banking statutes and regulations.  According to the OCC, those loans, while nominally made to third parties, were in reality made to Hudson in order to enable him to redeem bank stock that he had pledged as collateral on defaulted loans.  On February 13,1989, OCC issued a “Notice of Assessment of Civil Money Penalty.” The notice alleged that petitioners had violated 12 U. S. C. §§ 84 (a)(1) and 375b (1982 ed.) and 12 CFR §§ 31.2 (b) and 215.4(b) (1986) by causing the banks with which they were associated to make loans to nominee borrowers in a maimer that unlawfully allowed Hudson to receive the benefit of the loans.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a.

 The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no “person [shall] be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” We have long recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the imposition of *99 all additional sanctions that could, “‘in common parlance,’” be described as punishment.  United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 549 (1943) (quoting Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, 19 (1852)).  The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense, Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938); see also Hess, supra, at 548-549 (“Only” “criminal punishment” “subjeet[s] the defendant to ‘jeopardy 3 within the constitutional meaning”); Breed v. Jones, 421 U. S. 519, 528 (1975) (“In the constitutional sense, jeopardy describes the risk that is traditionally associated with a criminal prosecution”), and then only when such occurs in successive proceedings, see Missouri v. Hunter, 459 Ú.  S. 359, 366 (1983).  Whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is, at least initially, a matter of statutory construction.  Helvering, supra, at 399 .  A court must first ask whether the legislature, “in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.” Ward, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 248</citedDecision> .  Even in those eases where the legislature “has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect,” <citedDecision>id., at 248-249</citedDecision> , as to “transfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty,” Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956).  In making this latter determination, the factors listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), provide useful guideposts, including: (1) “[wjhether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint”; (2) “whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment”; (3) “whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter (4) “whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment — retribution and deterrence”; (5) “whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime”; (6) “whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it”; and (7) “whether it appears *100 excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.” It is important to note, however, that “these factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face,” id., at 169 , and “only the clearest proof” will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty, <citedDecision>Ward, supra, at 249</citedDecision> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Our opinion in United States v. Halper marked the first time we applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to a sanction without first determining that it was criminal in nature.  In that case, Irwin Halper was convicted of, inter alia, violating the criminal false claims statute, 18 U. S. C. § 287 , based on his submission of 65 inflated Medicare claims each of which overcharged the Government by $9.  He was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and fined $5,000.  The Government then brought an action against Halper under the civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3731 (1982 ed., Supp. II).  The remedial provisions of the False Claims Act provided that a violation of the Act rendered one “liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $2,000, an amount equal to 2 times the amount of damages the Government sustains because of the act of that person, and costs of the civil action.” Id., § 3729.  Given Halper’s 65 separate violations of the Act, he appeared to be liable for a penalty of $130,000, despite the fact he actually defrauded the Government of less than $600.

 Applying traditional double jeopardy principles to the facts of this ease, it is clear that the criminal prosecution of these petitioners would not.  violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  It is evident that Congress intended the OCC money penalties and debarment sanctions imposed for violations of 12 U. S. C. §§ 84 and 375b to be civil in nature.  As for the money penalties, both §§ 93(b)(1) and 504(a), which authorize the imposition of monetary penalties for violations of §§ 84 and 375b respectively, expressly provide that such penalties are “civil.” While the provision authorizing debarment contains no language explicitly denominating the sanction as civil, we think it significant that the authority to issue debarment orders is conferred upon the “appropriate Federal banking agencies].” §§ 1818(e)(1)-(3).  That such authority was conferred upon administrative agencies is prima facie evidence that Congress intended to provide for a civil sanction.  See Helvering, supra, at 402 ; United States v. Spector, 343 U. S. 169, 178 (1952) (Jackson, J., dissenting) (“Administrative determinations of liability to deportation have been sustained as constitutional only by considering them to be-exclusively civil in nature, with no criminal consequences or connotations”); Wong Wing v. United States, 163 U. S. 228, 235 (1896) (holding that quintessential criminal punishments may be imposed only “by a judicial trial”).  *104 Turning to the second stage of the <citedDecision>Ward</citedDecision> test, we find-that there is little evidence, much less the clearest proof that we require, suggesting that either OCC money penalties or debarment sanctions are “so punitive in form and effect as to render them criminal despite Congress’ intent to the contrary.” Ursery, supra, at 290 .  First, neither money penalties nor debarment has historically been viewed as punishment.  We have long recognized that “revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted,” such as a debarment, “is characteristically free of the punitive criminal element.” Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399 , and n. 2.  Similarly, “the payment of fixed or variable sums of money [is a] sanction which ha[s] been recognized as enforeible by civil proceedings since the original revenue law of 1789.” Id., at 400 .  Second, the sanctions imposed not an tive disability or restraint,” as that term is normally understood.  While petitioners have been prohibited from further participating in the banking industry, this is “certainly nothing approaching the 'infamous punishment’ of imprisonment.” Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960).  Third, neither sanction comes into play “only” on a finding of scienter.

 But the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence “may serve civil as well as criminal goals.” Ursery, supra, at 292 ; see also Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 452 (1996) (“[Forfeiture .  .  .  serves a deterrent purpose distinct from any punitive purpose”).  For example, the sanctions at issue here, while intended to deter future wrongdoing, also serve to promote the stability of the banking industry.  To hold that the mere presence of a deterrent purpose renders such sanctions “criminal” for double jeopardy purposes would severely undermine the Government’s ability to engage in effective regulation of institutions sueh as banks.  In sum, there simply is very little showing, to say nothing of the “clearest proof ” required by <citedDecision>Ward</citedDecision> , that OCC money penalties and debarment sanctions are criminal.. The Double Jeopardy Clause is therefore no obstacle to their trial on the pending indictments, and it may proceed.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is accordingly Affirmed.  Tipton and Hammon are two very small towns in western Oklahoma.  The consent orders also contained language providing that they did not constitute "a waiver of any right, power, or authority of any other representatives of the United States, or agencies thereof, to bring other actions deemed appropriate.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 133a, 143a, 138a.  The Court of Appeals ultimately held that this provision was not a waiver of petitioners’ double jeopardy claim.  14 F. 3d 536, 539 (CA10 1994).  Only petitioner Raekley was indicted for making false bank entries in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 1005 .

*115 Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring in the judgment.  I agree with the majority and with Justice Souter that United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), does not provide proper guidance for distinguishing between criminal and noncriminal sanctions and proceedings.  I also agree that United States v. Ward, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 242, 248</citedDecision> (1980), and Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), set forth the proper approach.  I do not join the Court’s opinion, however, because I disagree with its reasoning in two respects.  First, unlike the Court I would not say that “‘only the clearest proof will “transform” into a criminal punishment what a legislature calls a “civil remedy.” Ante, at 100.  I understand that the Court has taken this language from earlier cases. See <citedDecision>Ward, supra, at 249</citedDecision> .  But the limitation that the language suggests is not consistent with what the Court has actually done.  Rather, in fact if not in theory, the Court has simply applied factors of the Kennedy variety to the matter at hand. In Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767 (1994), for example, the Court held that the collection of a state tax imposed on the possession and storage of drugs was “the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution” because, among other things, the tax was “remarkably high”; it had “an obvious deterrent purpose”; it was “conditioned on the commission of a crime”; it was “exacted only after the taxpayer ha[d] been arrested for the precise conduct that gives rise to the tax obligation”; its alternative function of raising revenue could be equally well served by increasing the fine imposed on the activity; and it departed radically from “normal revenue laws” by taxing contraband goods perhaps destroyed before the tax was imposed.  Id., at 781-784 .  This reasoning tracks the nonexclusive list of factors set forth in Kennedy , and it is, I believe, the proper approach.  The “clearest proof” language *116 is consequently misleading, and I would consign it to the same legal limbo where Halper now rests.  Second, I would not decide now that a ate a statute only “ ‘on its face,’ ” ante, at 100 (quoting Kennedy, supra, at 169 ), rather than “assessing the character of the actual sanctions imposed,” Halper, supra, at 447 ; ante, at 101.
