 “It is the peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government of society; the application of those rules to individuals in society would seem to be the duty of other departments.” Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136 .  20 *447 II.  It is in this spirit that the Bill of Attainder Clause was consistently interpreted by this Court — until the decision in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382 , which we shall consider hereafter.  In 1810, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138 , stated that “[a] bill of attainder may affect the life of an individual, or may confiscate his property, or may do both.” This means, of course, that what were known at common law as bills of pains and penalties ar.e outlawed by the Bill of Attainder Clause.  The Court’s pronouncement therefore served notice that the Bill of Attainder Clause was not to be given a narrow historical reading (which would exclude bills of pains and penalties), but was instead to be read in light of the evil the Framers had sought to bar: legislative punishment, of any form or severity, of specifically designated persons or groups.  See also Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 286 .  The approach which Chief Justice Marshall had suggested was followed in the twin post-Civil War cases of Cummings v. Missouri, <citedDecision>4 Wall. 277</citedDecision> , and Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333 .  <citedDecision>Cummings</citedDecision> involved the constitutionality of amendments to the Missouri Constitution of 1865 which provided that no one could engage in a number of specified professions (Cummings was a priest) unless he first swore that he had taken no part in the rebellion against the Union.  At issue in Garland was a federal statute which required attorneys to take a similar oath before they could practice in federal courts.  This Court struck down both provisions as bills of attainder on the ground that they were legislative acts inflicting punishment on a specific group: clergymen and lawyers who had taken part in the rebellion and therefore could not truthfully take the oath.  In reaching its result, the Court emphatically rejected the argument that the con *448 stitutional prohibition outlawed only a certain class of legislatively imposed penalties: “The deprivation of any rights, civil or political, previously enjoyed, may be punishment, the circumstances attending and the causes of the deprivation determining this fact.  Disqualification from office may be punishment, as in cases of conviction upon impeachment.  Disqualification from the pursuits of a lawful avocation, or from positions of trust, or from the privilege of appearing in the courts, or acting as an executor, administrator, or guardian, may also, and often has been, imposed as punishment.” 4 Wall., at 320.  The next extended discussion of the Bill of Attainder Clause 21 came in 1946, in United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303 , where the Court invalidated § 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, 1943, 57 Stat. 431 , 450, which prohibited payment of further salary to three named federal employees, 22 as a bill of attainder.

 .  clearly was to ‘purge’ the then existing and all future lists of government employees of those whom Congress deemed guilty of ‘subversive activities’ and therefore ‘unfit’ to hold a federal job.” Id., at 314.  Similarly, the purpose of the statute before us is to purge the governing boards of labor unions of' those whom Congress regards as guilty of subversive acts and associations and therefore unfit to fill positions which might affect interstate commerce.  36 *461 The Solicitor General urges us to distinguish Lovett on the ground that the statute struck down there “singled out three identified individuals.” It is of course true that § 504 does not contain the words “Archie Brown,” and that-it inflicts its deprivation upon more than three people.  However, the decisions of this Court, as well as the historical background of the Bill of Attainder Clause, make it crystal clear that these are distinctions without a difference.  It was not uncommon for English acts of attainder to inflict their deprivations upon relatively large groups of people, 37 sometimes by description rather than name.  38 Moreover, the statutes voided in <citedDecision>Cummings</citedDecision> and Garland were of this nature.  39 We cannot agree that the fact that § 504 inflicts its deprivation upon the membership of the Communist Party rather than upon a list of named individuals takes it out of the category of bills of attainder.  We do not hold today that Congress cannot weed dangerous persons out of the labor movement, any more than the Court held in Lovett that subversives must be permitted to hold sensitive government positions.  Rather, we make again the point made in Lovett : that Congress must accomplish such results by rules of general applicability.  It cannot specify the people upon whom the sanction it prescribes is to be levied.  Under our Constitution, Congress possesses full legislative authority, but the task of adjudication must be left to other tribunals.  *462 This Court is always reluctant to declare that an Act of Congress violates the Constitution, but in this case we have no alternative.

 .. the legislature assumes executive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be made; nor, if made, can it be effectual; because in that case they may put their proceedings into the form of an act of assembly, which will render them obligatory on the other branches.  They have accordingly in many instances, decided rights which should have been left to judiciary controversy .  .  .  .” Jefferson, Notes on the State of Virginia, pp. 157-158 (Ford ed. 1894).  (Emphasis supplied.) In 1872, in Pierce v. Carskadon, 16 Wall. 234 , the Court voided as a bill of attainder a West Virginia statute conditioning access to the courts upon the taking of an oath similar to those involved in <citedDecision>Cummings</citedDecision> and Garland.  In Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114 , this Court upheld a West Virginia statute requiring that physicians obtain a license in order to practice.  Appellant argued, inter alia, that the statute was a bill of attainder because the granting of a license was conditioned upon graduating from medical school, practicing for 10 years, or passing a special examination.  The Court rejected the argument on the ground that the statute set forth general qualifications applicable to all persons who wanted to practice medicine, id., at 124 , and did not single out a specific person or group for deprivation.  See also Drehman v. Stifle, 8 Wall. 595 .  Section 304 provided: “No part of any appropriation, allocation, or fund (1) which is made available under or pursuant to this Act, or (2) which is now, or which *449 is hereafter made, available under or pursuant to any other Act, to any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, shall be used, after November 15, 1943, to pay any part of the salary, or other compensation for the personal services, of Goodwin B. Watson, William E. Dodd, Junior, and Robert Morss Lovett, unless prior to such date such person has been appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate: Provided, That this section shall not operate to deprive any such person of payment for leaves of absence or salary, or of any refund or reimbursement, which have accrued prior to November 15, 1943 Although it may be that underinelusiveness is a characteristic of most bills of attainder, we doubt that it is a necessary feature.  We think it clear from the Lovett opinion that § 304 would have been voided even if it could have been demonstrated that no one other than Lovett, Watson and Dodd possessed the characteristics which Congress was trying to reach.

 In enacting a statute to achieve this goal, the legislature could name the disease instead of listing the symptoms, for in doing so it would merely be substituting a shorthand phrase which conveys the same meaning.  To the same effect, see Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 299-300 ; Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 190 .  We rely on the “overbroadness” cases only to buttress our conclusion that § 604 cannot be rationalized on the ground-that membership in the Communist Party is merely an equivalent, shorthand way of expressing those characteristics which render likely the incitement of political strikes.  We of course do not hold that overbroadness is a necessary characteristic of a bill of attainder.  The Court’s opinion in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U. S. 1, 88 , also referred to the fact that the members of the class affected by the statute could extricate themselves from the class at will. However, whereas the factor of escapability was considered in Douds to be probative of whether or not the statute was punitive, in the Communist Party case it was considered only as one factor tending to show that the Act in question was not directed at a specific group of persons but rather set forth a generally applicable definition.  See note 26, supra. We do not read either opinion to have set up inescapability as an absolute prerequisite to a finding of attainder.  Such an absolute rule would have flown in the face of explicit precedent, Cummings v. Missouri, <citedDecision>4 Wall. 277, 324</citedDecision> , as well as the historical background of the constitutional prohibition.  A number of ante-Constitution bills of attainder inflicted their deprivations upon named or described persons or groups, but offered them the option of avoiding the deprivations, e. g., by swearing allegiance to the existing government.  See, e. g., Del. Laws 1778, c. 29b; Mass. Acts of September 1778, c. 13; III Hamilton, History of the Republic of the United States, p. 25 (1859); see generally Note, 72 Yale L. J. 330, 339-340.  American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 389 ; see note 2, supra. See Ex parte Law, 15 Fed. Cas. 3, 9-10 (No. 8126) (D. C. S. D. Ga. 1866).  Professor Chafee has pointed out that even the death penalty was often inflicted largely for preventive purposes: “There was no good middle ground between beheading and doing nothing.  If the ousted adviser were left at liberty, he could readily turn his resentment into coercion or rebellion and make a magnificent comeback to the utter ruin of those who had driven him from his high place.  Therefore, the usual object of Parliamentary proceedings against an important minister was to put him to death.” Chafee, Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787, pp. 103-104 (1956).  The preventive purpose of the “Act for the Attainder of the pretended Prince of Wales of High Treason” of 1700, 13 Will. 3 , c. 3, is demonstrated by the parliamentary declaration that anyone corresponding with the Prince or his followers would be subject to prosecution for treason.  See also Chafee, supra, pp. 109-113 (impeachment and attainder of the Earl of Strafford), 115-118 (bill against the Earl of Clarendon).  III Hamilton, History of the Republic of the United States, p. 25 (1859); see, e. g., Mass. Acts of September 1778, c. 13 (“An Act to Prevent the Return of Tories”); cf. Md. Laws February 1777, c. 20 (“An Act to punish certain crimes and misdemeanors, and to prevent the growth of toryism”); see also II Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, p. 211, n. 1 (4th ed. 1873); authorities cited note 15, supra. Nor do the deprivations imposed by the two statutes differ in any meaningful way.  Section 304 cut off the salary of the specified individuals, thereby effectively barring them from government serv *461 ice, 328 U. S., at 316 ; §504 provides that specified persons cannot serve as officers of, or engage in moét kinds of employment with, labor unions.  Compare Del. Laws 1778, c. 29b; Cummings v.
