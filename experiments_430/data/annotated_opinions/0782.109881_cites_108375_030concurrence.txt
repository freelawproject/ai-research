**Concurrence Opinion**
 8 Moreover, the rationale of Kenosha would have to be disturbed to avoid closing all avenues under § 1983 to injunctive relief against constitutional violations by local government.  The Court of Appeals in this case suggested that we import, by analogy, the Eleventh Amendment fiction of Ex parte Young into § 1983, 532 F. 2d 259 , 264—266 (CA2 1976).  That approach, however, would create tension with Kenosha because it would require “a bifurcated application” of “the generic word ‘person’ in § 1983” to public officials “depending on the nature of the relief sought against them.” 412 U. S., at 513 .  A public official sued in his official capacity for carrying out official policy would be a “person” for purposes of injunctive relief, but a non-“person” in an action for damages.  The Court’s holding avoids this difficulty.  See ante, at 690 n. 55.  Finally, if we continued to adhere to a rule of absolute municipal immunity under § 1983, we could not long avoid the question whether “we should, by analogy to our decision in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, <citedDecision>403 U. S. 388</citedDecision> (1971), imply a cause of action directly from the Fourteenth Amendment which would not be subject to the limitations contained in § 1983 .  .  .  .” Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 278 (1977).  One aspect of that inquiry would be whether there are any “special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,” Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, <citedDecision>403 U. S. 388, 396</citedDecision> (1971), such as an “explicit congressional declaration *713 that persons injured by a [municipality] may not recover money damages .  .  .  , but must instead be remitted to another remedy, equally effective in the view of Congress,” <citedDecision>id., at 397</citedDecision> .  In light of the Court’s persuasive re-examination in today’s decision of the 1871 debates, I would have difficulty inferring from § 1983 “an explicit congressional declaration” against municipal liability for the implementation of official policies in violation of the Constitution.  Rather than consti-tutionalize a cause of action against local government that Congress intended to create in 1871, the better course is to confess error and set the record straight, as the Court does today.  9 Ill Difficult questions nevertheless remain for another day. There are substantial line-drawing problems in determining “when execution of a government’s policy or custom” can be said to inflict constitutional injury such that “government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.” Ante, at 694.  This case, however, involves formal, written policies of a municipal department and school board; it is the clear case. The Court also reserves decision on the availability of a qualified municipal immunity.  Ante, at 701.  Initial resolution of the question whether the protection available at common law for municipal corporations, see post, at 720-721, or other principles support a *714 qualified municipal immunity in the context of the § 1983 damages action, is left to the lower federal courts.
