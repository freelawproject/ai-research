 Cf. United States v. Carotene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144 , 152, n. 4 (1938).  Rather, South Carolina argues that the political process failed here because § 310(b)(1) was “imposed by the vote of an uninformed Congress relying upon incomplete information.” Brief for Plaintiff 101.  7 But nothing in Garcia or the Tenth Amendment authorizes courts to second-guess the substantive basis for congressional legislation.  Cf. Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 464 (1981).  Where, as here, the national political process did not operate in a defective manner, the Tenth Amendment is not implicated.  B The NGA argues that § 310 is invalid because it commandeers the state legislative and administrative process by coercing States into enacting legislation authorizing bond registration and into administering the registration scheme.  They cite FERC v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 742</citedDecision> (1982), which left open the possibility that the Tenth Amendment might set some limits on Congress’ power to compel States to regulate on behalf of federal interests, <citedDecision>id., at 761-764</citedDecision> .  The extent to which the Tenth Amendment claim left open in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> survives Garcia or poses constitutional limitations independent of those discussed in Garcia is far from clear.  We need not, however, address that issue because we find the claim discussed in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> inapplicable to § 310.  *514 The federal statute at issue in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> required state utility commissions to do the following: (1) adjudicate and enforce federal standards, (2) either consider adopting certain federal standards or cease regulating public utilities, and (3) follow certain procedures.  The Court in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> first distinguished National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), noting that the statute in National League of Cities presented questions concerning “the extent to which state sovereignty shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations,” whereas the statute in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> “attempts to use state regulatory machinery to advance federal goals.” FERC, <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 759</citedDecision> .  The Court in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> then concluded that, whatever constitutional limitations might exist on the federal power to compel state regulatory activity, Congress had the power to require that state adjudicative bodies adjudicate federal issues and to require that States regulating in a pre-emptible field consider suggested federal standards and follow federally mandated procedures.  <citedDecision>Id., at 759-767</citedDecision> .  Because, by hypothesis, § 310 effectively prohibits issuing unregistered bonds, it presents the very situation <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> distinguished from a commandeering of state regulatory machinery: the extent to which the Tenth Amendment “shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations.” <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 759</citedDecision> .  Section 310 regulates state activities; it does not, as did the statute in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> , seek to control or influence the manner in which States regulate private parties.  The NGA nonetheless contends that § 310 has commandeered the state legislative and administrative process because many state legislatures had to amend a substantial number of statutes in order to issue bonds in registered form and because state officials had to devote substantial effort to determine how best to implement a registered bond system.  Such “commandeering” is, however, an inevitable consequence of regulating a state activity.  Any federal regulation demands compliance.  That a State washing to engage in cer *515 tain activity must take administrative and sometimes legislative action to comply with federal standards regulating that activity is a commonplace that presents no constitutional defect.  After Garcia , for example, several States and municipalities had to take administrative and legislative action to alter the employment practices or raise the funds necessary to comply with the wage and overtime provisions of the Federal Labor Standards Act.  8 Indeed, even the pre-Garcia line of Tenth Amendment cases recognized that Congress could constitutionally impose federal requirements on States that States could meet only by amending their statutes.
