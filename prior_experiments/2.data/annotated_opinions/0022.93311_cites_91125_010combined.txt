**Combined Opinion**
Justice Field delivered a dissenting opinion, in which his three associates concurred, and which stated, as to the authority of the city to issue the bonds, that there was no such authority, either in the charter of the city or in any other legislation of the State; that the authority conferred was to borrow money; that no money was borrowed, but the bonds of the city were loaned; and that borrowing money and loaning credit were not convertible terms. In Mitchell v. Burlington, 4 Wall. 270 , the case of Rogers v. Burlington, supra , was affirmed. But in Police Jury v. Britton, 15 Wall. 566 , (when Justices Wayne, Nelson and Grier had left the bench, and Justices Strong, Bradley and Hunt had come upon it, Chief Justice Chase and Justices Clifford, Swayne, Miller, Davis and Field *184 remaining,) it was held that the trustees or representative officers of a parish, county or other local jurisdiction, invested with the usual powers of administration in specific matters, and the power of levying taxes to defray the necessary expenditures of the jurisdiction, have no implied authority to issue negotiable securities, payable in future, of such a character as to be unimpeachable in the hands of bona fide holders, for the purpose of raising money or funding a previous indebtedness. In the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Bradley, it is stated that the police jury of the parish of Tensas, Louisiana, which issued the negotiable bonds in question in that case, had no express authority to issue them; that the power could not be implied from the ordinary powers of local administration and police which were conferred upon the boards and trustees of political districts; that it was one thing for county and parish trustees to have the power to incur obligations for work actually done in behalf of the county or parish, and to give proper vouchers therefor, and a totally different thing to have the power of issuing unimpeachable paper obligations, which might be multiplied to an indefinite extent; and that, although the authority for such bodies to issue negotiable paper might be implied in some cases from other and express powers granted, those implications should not be extended beyond the fair inferences to be gathered from the circumstances of each case. In Claiborne County v. Brooks, <targetCase>111 U.S. 400</targetCase> , it was held that the power to issue commercial paper was foreign to the objects of the creation of the political divisions of counties and townships, and was not to be conceded to such organizations unless by virtue of express legislation or by very strong implication from such legislation; and that the power conferred by statutes of Tennessee upon a county, to erect a court-house, jail and other necessary county buildings, did not authorize the issue of commercial paper as evidence of or security for a debt contracted for the construction of such a building. The opinion in the case was delivered by Mr. Justice Bradley; and the case of Police Jury v. Britton, 15 Wall. 566 , was cited and approved, although the unsuccessful *185 party cited as authority the case of Rogers v. Burlington, 3 Wall. 654 . In Concord v. Robinson, 121 U.S. 165 , it was held that a grant to a municipal corporation of power to appropriate moneys in aid of the construction of a railroad, accompanied by a provision directing the levy and collection of taxes to meet such appropriation, and prescribing no other mode of payment, did not authorize the issuing of negotiable bonds in payment of such appropriation. The opinion of this court was delivered by Mr. Justice Harlan, and the case of Claiborne County v. Brooks, <targetCase>111 U.S. 400</targetCase> , was cited and approved. In Kelley v. Milan, 127 U.S. 139 , and Norton v. Dyersburg, 127 U.S. 160 , it was held that the power granted to a municipal corporation to become a stockholder in a railroad company did not carry with it the power to issue negotiable bonds in payment of the subscription, unless the latter power was expressly or by reasonable implication conferred by statute. In the opinion in the case of Norton v. Dyersburg , the case of Claiborne County v. Brooks, <targetCase>111 U.S. 400</targetCase> , was cited with approval. In Young v. Clarendon Township, 132 U.S. 340 , it was held to be settled law that a municipality has no power to issue its bonds in aid of a railroad, except by legislative permission; and in the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Lamar, the cases of Claiborne County v. <targetCase>Brooks</targetCase> and of Kelley v. Milan were cited and approved. In Hill v. Memphis, 134 U.S. 198 , 203, the opinion of the court being delivered by Mr. Justice Field, it was held that the power conferred by a statute on a municipal corporation to subscribe for the stock of a railroad company did not include the power to issue negotiable bonds representing a debt, in order to pay for that subscription; and it was said that that rule was well settled. It was added: "The inability of municipal corporations to issue negotiable paper for their indebtedness, however incurred, unless authority for that purpose is expressly given or necessarily implied for the execution of other express powers, has been affirmed in repeated decisions of this court;" and the cases of Police Jury v. Britton , *186 Claiborne County v. <targetCase>Brooks</targetCase> , Kelley v. Milan and Young v. Clarendon Township were cited with approval. In Merrill v. Monticello, 138 U.S. 673 , 687, 691, it was held that the implied power of a municipal corporation to borrow money to enable it to execute the powers expressly conferred upon it by law, if existing at all, did not authorize it to create and issue negotiable securities to be sold in the market and to be taken by the purchaser freed from the equities that might be set up by the maker; and that to borrow money, and to give a bond or obligation therefor which might circulate in the market as a negotiable security, freed from any equities that might be set up by the maker of it, were essentially different transactions in their nature and legal effect. In the opinion of the court, which was delivered by Mr. Justice Lamar, the cases of Police Jury v. Britton , Claiborne County v. <targetCase>Brooks</targetCase> , Kelley v. Milan , Young v. Clarendon Township and Hill v. Memphis were cited with approval. It was added: "It is admitted that the power to borrow money, or to incur indebtedness, carries with it the power to issue the usual evidences of indebtedness, by the corporation, to the lender or other creditor. Such evidences may be in the form of promissory notes, warrants, and, perhaps, most generally, in that of a bond. But there is a marked legal difference between the power to give a note to a lender for the amount of money borrowed, or to a creditor for the amount due, and the power to issue for sale, in open market, a bond, as a commercial security, with immunity, in the hands of a bona fide holder for value, from equitable defences. The plaintiff in error contends that there is no legal or substantial difference between the two; that the issuing and disposal of bonds in market, though in common parlance, and sometimes in legislative enactment, called a sale, is not so in fact; and that the so-called purchaser who takes the bond and advances his money for it is actually a lender, as much so as a person who takes a bond payable to him in his own name." The opinion then stated that the logical result of the doctrines announced in the five cases which it cited clearly showed that the bonds sued on in the case of Merrill v. Monticello *187 were invalid, and added: "It does not follow that, because the town of Monticello had the right to contract a loan, it had, therefore, the right to issue negotiable bonds and put them on the market as evidences of such loan. To borrow money, and to give a bond or obligation therefor which may circulate in the market as a negotiable security, freed from any equities that may be set up by the maker of it, are, in their nature and in their legal effect, essentially different transactions.
**Combined Opinion**
Borrowing money and lending credit are not convertible terms. The two things which they indicate are essentially distinct and different." Mr. Justice Miller, *191 in a separate dissenting opinion, called attention to the fact that the Supreme Court of Iowa had then recently held the bonds, involved in that suit, to be void, upon the ground that the transaction "was a loan of credit, and not a borrowing of money." The principle announced in Rogers v. Burlington was applied in Mitchell v. Burlington, 4 Wall. 270 . The cases, decided since Rogers v. Burlington , which have been cited, in the opinion of the court, as announcing the doctrine that an express power given to a municipal corporation to borrow money does not authorize the execution of negotiable instruments for the money so borrowed, are: Police Jury v. Britton, 15 Wall. 566 , 570, 572; Claiborne County v. Brooks, <targetCase>111 U.S. 400</targetCase> , 406; Concord v. Robinson, 121 U.S. 165 , 167; Kelley v. Milan, 127 U.S. 139 , 150; Norton v. Dyersburg, 127 U.S. 160 , 175; Young v. Clarendon, 132 U.S. 340 ; Hill v. Memphis, 134 U.S. 198 , 203; and Merrill v. Monticello, 138 U.S. 673 , 686, 687. In Police Jury v. Britton , it appeared that a police jury, in a parish of Louisiana, charged with the supervision and repair of roads, bridges, causeways, dikes, levees and other highways, was prohibited by statute from contracting any debt or pecuniary liability without fully providing in the ordinance creating the debt the means of paying the principal and interest of the debt so contracted. And the question arose as to whether it could rightfully issue negotiable bonds to take the place of certain orders previously given by it for work done on levees in the parish. The case involved no question as to the scope and effect of an express power in the parish to borrow money. Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, after observing that the police jury had no express authority to issue bonds, and that, if it existed, it must be implied from the general powers of local administration with which they were invested, said: "We have, therefore, the question directly presented in this case whether the trustees or representative officers of a parish, county or other local jurisdiction, invested with the usual powers of administration in specific matters, and the power of levying taxes to defray the necessary expenditures of the jurisdiction, have an implied authority to *192 issue negotiable securities, payable in future, of such a character as to be unimpeachable in the hands of bona fide holders, for the purpose of raising money or funding a previous indebtedness?" This question was answered in the negative. But, to prevent any possible misapplication of the principles announced, the court said: "We do not mean to be understood that it requires, in all cases, express authority for such bodies to issue negotiable paper. The power has frequently been implied from other express powers granted. Thus, it has been held that the power to borrow money implies the power to issue the ordinary securities for its repayment, whether in the form of notes or bonds payable in future. " It thus appears that Police Jury v. Britton distinctly declares that case not to be within the rule that an express power to borrow money carries with it authority to issue negotiable securities for the amount borrowed. In Claiborne County v. <targetCase>Brooks</targetCase> , the question was whether the power in a county to contract for the erection of a court-house implied authority to issue negotiable bonds of a commercial character in payment for the work. The court, speaking again by Mr. Justice Bradley, held that it did not, and said: "Our opinion is, that mere political bodies, constituted as counties are, for the purpose of local police and administration, and having the power of levying taxes to defray all public charges created, whether they are or are not formally invested with corporate capacity, have no power or authority to make and utter commercial paper of any kind, unless such power is expressly conferred upon them by law, or clearly implied from some other power expressly given, which cannot be fairly exercised without it "  referring to the same clauses in the opinion in Police Jury v. Britton , above quoted, as embodying a distinct expression of the views of the court. In Concord v. Robinson , it was decided that "the grant to a municipal corporation of power to appropriate moneys in aid of the construction of a railroad, accompanied by a provision directing the levy and collection of taxes to meet such appropriation, and prescribing no other mode of payment," did not imply authority to issue negotiable bonds on account of such *193 appropriation; in Kelley v. Milan , that "a municipal corporation, in order to exercise the power of becoming a stockholder in a railroad corporation, must have such power expressly conferred upon it by a grant from the legislature, and that even the power to subscribe for such stock does not carry with it the power to issue negotiable bonds in payment of the subscription, unless the power to issue such bonds is expressly or by reasonable implication conferred by statute;" in Norton v. Dyersburg , that "the mere authority given to a municipality to subscribe for stock in a railroad company did not carry with it the implied power to issue bonds therefor, especially where, as in the present case, special provisions were made for paying the subscription by taxation;" in Young v. Clarendon Township , authority to make the municipal bonds there involved was conceded, and the case turned upon the question, whether their execution was not subject to the restrictions and directions of the act which authorized them to be issued; and in Hill v. Memphis , that "the power to subscribe for stock does not of itself include the power to issue bonds of a town in payment of it," and that "the inability of municipal corporations to issue negotiable paper for their indebtedness, however incurred, unless authority for that purpose is expressly given or necessarily implied for the execution of other express powers, has been approved in repeated decisions of this court." It thus appears that in no one of the above cases, decided since Rogers v. Burlington ; was there any question as to negotiable securities being issued under an express power to borrow money; and that some of them concede that such a power carries with it authority to give a negotiable paper for money borrowed. The case which seems to be much relied upon to support the present judgment is Merrill v. Monticello . But we submit that it does not sustain the broad doctrine that negotiable securities may not be issued in execution of an express power to borrow money. What could or could not be done, under such a power, was not a question involved in that case.
