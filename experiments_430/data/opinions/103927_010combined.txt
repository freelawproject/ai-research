  Me. Chief Justice Stone

  delivered the opinion of the Court.
 </p>
<p id="b155-4">
  Petitioner, a seaman on respondent’s vessel, the “Wichita Falls,” was injured, while at sea, by a fall from a staging, which gave way when a piece of defective rope supporting it parted. The rope was supplied by the mate when there was ample sound rope available for use in rigging the staging. The question is whether the defect in the staging was a breach of the warranty of seaworthiness rendering the owner liable to indemnify the seaman for his injury.
 </p>
<p id="b155-5">
  Petitioner brought this suit in personam in admiralty in the District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania, to recover indemnity and maintenance and cure. On the trial the evidence showed that the mate ordered petitioner to paint the bridge and to stand on the staging for that purpose. The staging consisted of a board supported at both ends by rope which, if sound, was sufficient in strength to sustain the stage and its load. The boatswain, by direction of the mate, had cut the rope for the staging from a coil, which had been stored for two years in the Lyle gun box. The rope, intended for use with the Lyle life-saving apparatus, had never been used. There was testimony that it had been examined and tested by the boatswain and the mate, and that it was generally sound in appearance. After the accident, examination of the rope at the point where it broke showed that it was so rotten as to be inadequate to support the strain imposed upon it.
 </p>
<p id="b155-6">
  The trial judge concluded from the evidence that there was sound rope on board available for rigging the staging. He found that there was no fault in the manner in which the stage had been rigged, but that the rope selected by the mate was defective and that petitioner’s injury was attributable to the negligence of the boatswain and the
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="98"> 
   *98
   </span>
  mate in failing to observe the defect.
  <a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">

  </a>
  He held that the proceeding was brought too late to recover for the negligence under the Jones Act, and that the “Wichita Falls” was not unseaworthy by reason of the defective rope used in rigging the staging, citing

  Until the enactment of the Jones Act, <span class="citation no-link">41 Stat. 1007</span>, <span class="citation no-link">46 U. S.

  In thus refusing to limit, by application of the fellow servant rule, the liability of the vessel and owner for unseaworthiness, this Court was but applying the familiar and then well established rule of non-maritime torts, that the employer’s duty to furnish the employee with safe appliances and a safe place to work, is nondelegable and not qualified by the fellow servant rule.

  The staging from which petitioner fell was an appliance appurtenant to the ship. It was unseaworthy in the sense that it was inadequate for the purpose for which it was ordinarily used, because of the defective rope with which it was rigged. Its inadequacy rendered it unseaworthy, whether the mate’s failure to observe the defect was negligent or unavoidable. Had it been adequate, petitioner would not have been injured and his injury was the proximate and immediate consequence of the unseaworthiness. See

  Respondent’s argument that the defective rope was a consumable supply of the vessel, not falling within the requirement that the owner must furnish seaworthy equipment appurtenant to the vessel, is inappropriate here because, as we have said, it was the stage which was unseaworthy, by reason of the use of the defective rope in its construction.

  I think the judgment is wrong. The case does not present a situation calling for liberalizing the maritime law in favor of seamen by abolishing the defense of a fellow seaman’s negligence. Congress did that in 1920 (<span class="citation no-link">41 Stat. 1007</span>). But it required actions in such situations to be brought within two years, which it subsequently extended to three years. The sole question is whether recovery should be permitted beyond the time when Congress said action must be instituted. I should say nothing further on this question save that the method of reaching the decision seems to me contrary to right exercise of the judicial function.

  The petitioner has undoubtedly obtained care and cure to which, as a seaman, he was entitled irrespective of fault on the part of owner or master.

  v.
  <em>
   Pinar Del Rio is
  </em>
  important. The libellant, a seaman on a British ship lying in United States waters, was ordered by a mate to repair a stack. A sling was used, for which the mate selected a piece of rope. The rope broke and the seaman was injured. He filed a libel
  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  against the vessel. The owner gave bond and released the ship.
 </p>
<p id="b164-6">
  The libel, after reciting the facts, alleged that the injuries were due “to the fault or neglect of the said steamship or those in charge of her in that the said rope was old, worn and not suitable for use.” The libel failed to refer to § 33 of the Jones Act, but, at the trial, the libellant’s proctor stated that he relied upon it. The claimant in its answer asserted that the vessel was of British registry and, as the only redress open to the libellant was under the British Workmen’s Compensation Law, the Admiralty Court should decline jurisdiction. The claimant amended its answer to deny liability on the ground that the ship was provided with proper tackle but, through the negligence of an officer, bad tackle was selected.
 </p>
<p id="b164-7">
  The District Court held that the British law,—the law of the flag,—afforded no action
  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  nor any action for indemnity since there was an ample supply of good rope on board and the mate chose an insufficient rope for use.
 </p>
<p id="b164-8">
  On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the libellant’s pleadings were inadequate but, as no point had
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="107"> 
   *107
   </span>
  been made of their infirmity, went on to consider “whether, on the facts proven and under any applicable law, libellant has a case.”
  <a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">
   1
  </a>
  It said the libellant must make out a case of maritime tort; that, under the law of England, there could be no recovery and that if the applicable law were the maritime law of the United States the libellant could not recover for the improvident or negligent act of the mate, adding: “If the vessel had been unsupplied with good and proper rope, a different question would arise.”
 </p>
<p id="b165-4">
  That court further held that, although, under the Jones Act, libellant could have sued at law or filed a libel
  <em>
   in personam,
  </em>
  the statute gave no right to a libel
  <em>
   in rem.
  </em>
  The decree dismissing the libel was, therefore, affirmed.
 </p>
<p id="b165-5">
  Petitioner sought review in this court and, in his petition and briefs, asserted the right to maintain a libel
  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  under the Jones Act but, in the alternative, insisted that, under the general maritime law, independent of the Jones Act, the libellant was entitled to recover for the failure to supply, and keep in order, proper appliances, properly rigged, and for the unseaworthiness of the vessel in this respect.
 </p>
<p id="b165-6">
  It will be noted how closely that case parallels the instant one. In both, though for differing reasons, the libellant was precluded from relying on the Jones Act which would have avoided all question of a fellow servant’s negligence. In both, the libellant then sought to resort to his claim for indemnity for a maritime tort. In the
  <em>
   Pinar Del Rio
  </em>
  case it was held that he had made no case on the latter theory, and in the present case it is held that he has made out such a case. This court, in the earlier case, held two things: first, that a libel
  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  cannot be maintained under the Jones Act, and, second; that, if the case were treated as the Circuit Court of Appeals had treated it,—as one for
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="108"> 
   *108
   </span>
  recovery of indemnity for a maritime tort,—the record would not support the claim. The court said:
 </p>
<p id="b166-5">
<em>
   “The record does not support the suggestion that the ‘Pinar Del Big’ was unseaworthy. The mate selected a bad rope when good ones were available.
  </em>
</p>
<p id="b166-6">
<em>
   “We
  </em>
  must treat the proceeding as one to enforce the liability prescribed by Sec. 33. It was so treated by petitioner’s proctor at the original trial; and the application for certiorari here spoke of it as based upon that section.
  <em>
   The evidence would not support a recovery upon any other ground.”
  </em>
  (Italics added.)
 </p>
<p id="b166-7">
  These holdings were made in answer to extended argument in the briefs, the petitioner on the one hand contending that the vessel should be treated as an American vessel and as being unseaworthy, respondent contending that, whether British or American, she was not unseaworthy under the law of either nation and that the libellant’s injuries were due to the negligence of a fellow servant. What the court said, therefore, was clearly responsive to the contentions of the parties. The present decision does not merely disapprove language used in the earlier case. It overrules the case and alters long-established law without adequate reason.

  this court, after the fullest consideration, recapitulated the admiralty law respecting the rights of injured seamen,
  <em>
   inter alia,
  </em>
  as follows (p. 175):
 </p>
<p id="b167-5">
  “That the vessel and her owner are, both by English and American law, liable to an indemnity for injuries received by seamen
  <em>
   in consequence
  </em>
  of the unseaworthiness of the ship, or a failure to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship. . . .” (Italics supplied.)
 </p>
<p id="b167-6">
  “That all the members of the crew, except perhaps the master, are, as between themselves, fellow servants, and hence seamen cannot recover for injuries sustained through the negligence of another member of the crew beyond the expense of their maintenance and cure.”
 </p>
<p id="b167-7">
  Unseaworthiness in the abstract does not afford a cause of action. An injury must be “in consequence” of the unseaworthiness,—must be connected with and result from it. And “unseaworthiness” covers a variety of situations variously affecting the work and risks of seamen. Unseaworthiness of the kind on which the court bases its opinion is very different from that due to a faulty mechanism which is an inherent risk to life and limb. If the doctrine now announced is right, a vessel supplied with the newest charts would be unseaworthy if the owner failed to remove old charts from the pilot house; it would make the owner an insurer that, no matter how
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="110"> 
   *110
   </span>
  many adequate facilities were at hand, no insufficient one” was anywhere on the ship. Here the so-called unseaworthiness did not consist in want of adequate ropes for the seaman’s need. His injury was due entirely to the negligent selection by the mate of a piece of bad rope when ample good rope was at hand. The District Court found that the mate was negligent, the Circuit Court of Appeals accepted the finding, and the disposition of the case in this court is on the assumption of the correctness of this finding.
 </p>
<p id="b168-5">
  The question, therefore, is whether the ship is liable for the mate’s negligent choice of a defective piece of rope when there was plenty of good rope aboard. Under the principles announced in
  <em>
   <span class="citation" data-id="95840"><a href="/opinion/95840/the-osceola/" aria-description="Citation for case: The Osceola">The Osceola</a></span>,
  </em>
  recovery in admiralty for a maritime tort is barred by the mate’s negligence. It was to avoid the interposition of such a defense of a fellow servant’s act that the Jones Act made the Federal Employers’ Liability Act applicable to the claims of injured seamen.
 </p>
<p id="b168-6">
  . The court professes to have to choose between the doctrine it reads into the decision in

  <em>
   Pinar Del Rio

 </p>
<p id="b168-7">
  That was an action brought in a state court by an injured seaman against the owner of a motor boat. When the boat left on her voyage a can intended for the use of the crew, supposed to contain coal oil, and so labeled, had been filled with gasoline and the seaman, without notice of this fact, attempted to use the contents and was
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="111"> 
   *111
   </span>
  burned. The supply of life preservers was insufficient and his injuries were aggravated by his having to search for one before he could jump overboard and extinguish the flames consuming his clothing. A verdict and judgment for the seaman was sustained. This court found that erroneous instructions had been given the jury but held the error harmless since the record showed that, without regard to the owner’s negligence, the vessel was unseaworthy when she left the dock, and the court held (p.
  <em>
   259): “. . .
  </em>
  if thus unseaworthy and one of the crew received damage
  <em>
   as the direct result thereof,
  </em>
  he was entitled to recover compensatory damages.” (Italics supplied.) The court cited, amongst other cases,

  I am at a loss to understand the citation of this case as authority for the present decision. The reasoning of the court’s opinion seems to be this: In the
  <em>
   Carlisle Packing Co.

  case recovery was permitted because the injury was the direct result of unseaworthiness. That decision, therefore, requires that the owner be held liable in the instant case although the seaman’s injury was not the direct result of unseaworthiness, but of the mate’s negligence. It must be upon the basis of such reasoning that the

  Indeed, if in the
  <em>
   Socony
  </em>
  case, the suit had involved a fellow servant’s negligence instead of the seaman’s assumption of the risk involved in the use of an unsafe appliance supplied by the vessel, the case would have been so plainly ruled by earlier decisions
  <a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref">

  that it would have merited no consideration, much less an opinion, by this court.

<p id="b170-7">
  The statement in the opinion that the defense of a fellow servant’s negligence had never been deemed applicable to the owner’s obligation to the seaman under the warranty of seaworthiness ignores the point that if the seaman is to recover the unseaworthiness must, under the authorities cited, be the direct cause of the injury. If it is not, but a fellow servant’s negligence is the cause, the seaman could not recover,

  The evil resulting from overruling earlier considered decisions must be evident. In the present case, the court below naturally felt bound to follow and apply the law as clearly announced by this court. If litigants and lower federal courts are not to do so, the law becomes not a chart to govern conduct but a game of chance; instead of settling rights and liabilities it unsettles them. Counsel and
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="113">

   </span>
  parties will bring and prosecute actions in the teeth of the decisions that such actions are not maintainable on the not improbable chance that the asserted rule will be thrown overboard. Defendants will not know whether to litigate or to settle for they will have no assurance that a declared rule will be followed. But the more deplorable consequence will inevitably be that the administration of justice will fall into disrepute. Respect for tribunals must fall when the bar and the public come to understand that nothing that has been said in prior adjudication has force in a current controversy.

<p id="b171-4">
  Of course the law may grow to meet changing conditions. I do not advocate slavish adherence to authority where new conditions require new rules of conduct. But this is not such a case. The tendency to disregard precedents in the decision of cases like the present has become so strong in this court of late as, in my view, to shake confidence in the consistency of decision and leave the courts below on an uncharted sea of doubt and difficulty without any confidence that what was said yesterday will hold good tomorrow, unless indeed a modern instance grows into a custom of members of this court to make public announcement of a change of views and to indicate that they will change their votes on the same question when another case comes before the court.
