 In doing so, it disregards constitutional language and principles of stare decisis in its singleminded determination to subject members of our Armed Forces to the unrestrained control of the military in the area of criminal justice.  I dissent.  I The majority begins by assuming that the limitation on court-martial jurisdiction enunciated in O’Callahan was based on the power of Congress, contained in Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, “[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces.” It then rejects this asserted limitation of congressional power on the ground that the Framers intended to give Congress plenary authority over the *453 government of the military.  But the Court in O’Callahan did not simply address whether Art. I, §8, el.  14, granted Congress the authority to create court-martial jurisdiction over all crimes committed by members of the Armed Forces.  Congress’ Article I power to regulate the Armed Forces is limited by the Fifth Amendment right to indictment or presentment by a grand jury and the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.  1 “[T]he constitutional grant of power to Congress to regulate the armed forces,” this Court has previously stated, “itself does not empower Congress to deprive people of trials under Bill of Rights safeguards, and we are not willing to hold that power to circumvent those safeguards should be inferred through the Necessary and Proper Clause.” United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, <citedDecision>350 U. S. 11, 21-22</citedDecision> (1955).  The majority simply disregards the limitations the Bill of Rights imposes on the reach of Art. I, §8, cl. 14.  The rights to grand jury process and to trial by jury are, of course, of restricted application in military cases. The Fifth Amendment excepts from the grand jury requirement “cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger,” 2 and the *454 Court has held this exception applicable to the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury as well.  Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 123 (1867).  But the text of the exception is inconsistent with the majority’s conclusion that the only relevant factor in determining whether a court-martial has jurisdiction over a case is the status of the defendant as a member of the Armed Services.  3 The Fifth Amendment’s exception covers only “cases arising in the land and naval forces” (emphasis added).  It makes no reference to the status of the individual committing the crime.  Had that been the Framers’ intent, it would have been easy to have said so, given that the grand jury provision of the Amendment, which states that “[n]o Person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury,” speaks not in terms of “crimes” or “cases,” but of individual defendants.  Nonetheless, the exception contained in the Fifth Amendment is expressed — and applies by its terms — only to cases arising in the Armed Forces.  O’Callahan addressed not whether Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, empowered Congress to create court-martial jurisdiction over all crimes committed by service members, but rather whether Congress, in exercising that power, had encroached upon the rights of members of Armed Forces whose cases did not “arise in” the Armed Forces.  This is clear from the Court’s statement of its holding in O’Callahan : “We have concluded that the crime to be under military jurisdiction must be service connected, lest ‘cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger,’ as used in the Fifth Amendment, be expanded to deprive every *455 member of the armed services of the benefits of an indictment by a grand jury and a trial by a jury of his peers.” 395 U. S., at 272-273 (footnote omitted).  4 *456 The protections afforded individuals by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are central to our constitutional scheme of justice.  The right to trial by jury, in particular, “ranks very high in our catalogue of constitutional safeguards.” <citedDecision>United States ex rel. Toth</citedDecision> v. Quarles, <citedDecision>350 U. S., at 16</citedDecision> .  These protections should not be lightly abrogated.  Consequently, the exception in the Fifth Amendment for cases arising in the Armed Forces must be strictly construed.  This was the basis for the Court’s conclusion, in Toth, that the power to authorize trial by court-martial should be limited to “‘the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.’ ” <citedDecision>Id., at 23</citedDecision> (emphasis omitted), quoting Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, 231 (1821).  The historical evidence considered by the Court in O’Callahan is therefore relevant, not to what the Framers intended to include in the scope of the congressional power to regulate the Armed Forces in Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, but to what the Framers, wary of military jurisdiction and familiar with strong restrictions on the scope of that jurisdiction, considered “cases arising in the armed forces.” Even assuming that they intended to assign control over the scope of the Article I power to the Legislature, this does not imply that the meaning of the Fifth Amendment’s “arising in” exception can be interpreted without reference to the practices of that time.  In that respect it is significant that the British political and legal writing of the 17th and 18th centuries demonstrates a longstanding suspicion of broad court-martial jurisdiction.  This suspicion was well known in colonial America, and was based on familiar history.  5 British writers and legislators *457 took a narrow view of the appropriate scope of court-martial jurisdiction, which manifested itself in a very limited grant of authority to try offenses by court-martial during the period of which the Framers would have been most acutely aware.  See, e. g., M. Hale, The History of the Common Law of England 42-43 (6th ed. 1820).  Not only was.

 “This Court has constantly reiterated that the language of the Constitution where clear and unambiguous must be given its plain evident meaning.” Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 8, n. 7 (1957) (plurality opinion).  See also Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, 401 U. S. 355, 362-363 (1971); Gosa v. Mayden, 413 U. S. 665, 672-673 (1973).  The majority contends that, before O’Callahan , this Court had held consistently that status as a member of the Armed Forces was an adequate basis for the assertion of court-martial jurisdiction.  Ante, at 439.  But a number of the precedents cited dealt with the assertion of court-martial jurisdiction over individuals who were not members of the Armed Forces and therefore, this Court ruled, did not come within the reach of Art. I, § 8, el.  14.  See Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234, 246-248 (1960) (military dependent in noncapital case); Reid v. Covert, supra, at 19-23 (plurality opinion) (military dependent in capital case); United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, <citedDecision>350 U. S. 11, 14-15</citedDecision> (1955) (discharged veteran); see also Grisham v. Hagan, 361 U. S. 278 (1960) (civilian military employee in capital case); McElroy v. United States ex rel. Guagliardo, 361 U. S. 281, 286 (1960) (civilian military employee in noncapital case).  Having disposed of these cases on the threshold issue of the reach of the congressional power created by Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, the Court did not consider the limits imposed on the Article I power by the Fifth Amendment.  Several of the remaining cases cited involved crimes committed in the course of the performance of military duties that therefore clearly arose in the Armed Forces.  See Grafton v. United States, supra (murder by Army private serving sentry duty on post); Johnson v. Sayre, supra (embezzlement of United States funds intended for the Naval service); Smith v. Whitney, 116 U. S. 167 (1886) (fraud on Navy contracts).  In Smith , the Court concluded that “such conduct of a naval officer is a case arising in the naval forces, and therefore punishable by court martial under the articles and regulations made or approved by Congress in the exercise of the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, to provide and maintain a navy, and to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces, without indictment or trial by jury.” Id., at 186 .  The remaining cases cited by the majority are similarly inapposite.  Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509 (1879), dealt with a murder committed by a soldier in time of war.
