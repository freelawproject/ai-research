**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting.  I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois on the basis of Cicenia v. Lagay, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 504</citedDecision> , *493 decided by this Court only six years ago.  Like my Brother White, post, p. 495, I think the rule announced today is most ill-conceived and that it seriously and unjustifiably fetters perfectly legitimate methods of criminal law enforcement.  Mr. Justice Stewart, dissenting.  I think this case is directly controlled by Cicenia v. Lagay, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 504</citedDecision> , and I would therefore affirm the judgment.  Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 , is not in point here.  In that case a federal grand jury had indicted Massiah.  He had retained a lawyer and entered a formal plea of not guilty.  Under our system of federal justice an indictment and arraignment are followed by a trial, at which the Sixth Amendment guarantees the defendant the assistance of counsel.  * But Massiah was released on bail, and thereafter agents of the Federal Government deliberately elicited incriminating statements from him in the absence of his lawyer.  We held that the use of these statements against him at his trial denied him the basic protections of the Sixth Amendment guarantee.
