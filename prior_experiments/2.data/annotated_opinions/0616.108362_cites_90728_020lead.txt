A century of Fourteenth Amendment adjudication has, in other words, made it understandably difficult to conceive of what might constitute a deprivation of the equal protection of the laws by private persons. Yet there is nothing inherent in the phrase that requires the action working the deprivation to come from the State. See, e. g., United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629, 643. Indeed, the failure to mention any such requisite can be viewed as an important indication of congressional intent to speak in § 1986 (3) of all deprivations of “equal protection of the laws” and “equal privileges and immunities under the laws,” whatever their source. The approach of this Court to other Reconstruction civil rights statutes in the years since Collins has been to “accord [them] a sweep as broad as [their] language.” United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 801; Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S. 409, 437. Moreover, very similar language in cffisely related statutes has early and late received an interpretation quite inconsistent with that given to § 1986 (3) in Collins. In construing the exact criminal counterpart of § 1986 (3), the Court in United States v. <targetCase>Harris, supra</targetCase>, observed that the statute- was “not limited to take effect only in case- [of state action] ,” id., at 639, but “was framed to protect from invasion by private persons, the equal privileges *98 and immunities under the laws, of all persons and classes of persons,” id., at 637. In United States v. Williams, 341 U. S. 70, the Court considered the closest remaining criminal analogue to § 1985 (3), 18 U. S. C. § 241. 4 Mr. Justice Frankfurter’s plurality opinion, without contravention from the concurrence or dissent, con-clhded that “if language is to carry any meaning at all it must be clear that the principal purpose of [§ 241], unlike [18 U. S. C. § 242], was to reach private action rather than officers of a State acting under its authority. Men who 'go in disguise upon 'the public highway, or upon the premises of another’ are not likely to be acting in official capacities.” 341 U. S., at 76. “Nothing in [the] terms [of § 241] indicates that color of State law was to be relevant to prosecution under it.” Id., at 78 (footnote omitted). A like construction of § 1985 (3) is reinforced when examination is broadened to take in its companion statutory -provisions. There appear to be three possible forms for a state action limitation on § 1985 (3) — that there must be action under color of state law, that there must be interference with or influence upon state authorities, or that there must be a private conspiracy so massive and effective that it supplants those authorities and thus satisfies the state action requirement.
