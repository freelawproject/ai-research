**Dissenting Opinion**
 The Judicial Interpretation, 2 Stan.  L. Rev. 140 (1949).  Davidson v. New Orleans, 96 U. S. 97, 104 .  Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366, 389 .  Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 529 .  Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U. S. 22, 31 .  Gideon v. Wainwright, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 335</citedDecision> .  The right to counsel was found in the Fourteenth Amendment because, the Court held, it was essential to a fair trial. See <citedDecision>372 U. S., at 342-345</citedDecision> .  Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213 .  Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400 .  Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717 .  The same illogical way of dealing with a Fourteenth Amendment problem was employed in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 , which held that the Due Process Clause guaranteed the protection of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment against state action.  I disagreed at that time both with the way the question was framed and with the result the Court reached.  See my dissenting opinion, id., at 14 .
