**Combined Opinion**
This Court, while protecting individual rights, has always given ample latitude to law enforcement agencies in the legitimate exercise of their duties. The limits we have placed on the interrogation process should not constitute an undue interference with a proper system of law enforcement. As we have noted, our decision does not in any way preclude police from carrying out their traditional investigatory functions. Although confessions may play an important role in some convictions, the cases before us present graphic examples of the overstatement of the "need" for confessions. In each case authorities conducted interrogations ranging up to five days in duration despite the presence, through standard investigating practices, of considerable evidence against each defendant. [51] Further examples are chronicled in our prior cases. See, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 , 518-519 (1963); Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534 , 541 (1961); Malinski v. New York, <targetCase>324 U. S. 401</targetCase> , 402 (1945). [52] *482 It is also urged that an unfettered right to detention for interrogation should be allowed because it will often redound to the benefit of the person questioned. When police inquiry determines that there is no reason to believe that the person has committed any crime, it is said, he will be released without need for further formal procedures. The person who has committed no offense, however, will be better able to clear himself after warnings with counsel present than without. It can be assumed that in such circumstances a lawyer would advise his client to talk freely to police in order to clear himself. Custodial interrogation, by contrast, does not necessarily afford the innocent an opportunity to clear themselves. A serious consequence of the present practice of the interrogation alleged to be beneficial for the innocent is that many arrests "for investigation" subject large numbers of innocent persons to detention and interrogation.

A variant on the technique of creating hostility is one of engendering fear. This is perhaps best described by the prosecuting attorney in Malinski v. New York, <targetCase>324 U. S. 401</targetCase> , 407 (1945): "Why this talk about being undressed? Of course, they had a right to undress him to look for bullet scars, and keep the clothes off him. That was quite proper police procedure. That is some more psychologyÂ—let him sit around with a blanket on him, humiliate him there for a while; let him sit in the corner, let him think he is going to get a shellacking."

See generally, Hogan & Snee, The McNabb-Mallory Rule: Its Rise, Rationale and Rescue, 47 Geo. L. J. 1 (1958). [33] The decisions of this Court have guaranteed the same procedural protection for the defendant whether his confession was used in a federal or state court. It is now axiomatic that the defendant's constitutional rights have been violated if his conviction is based, in whole or in part, on an involuntary confession, regardless of its truth or falsity. Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534 , 544 (1961); Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1 (1924). This is so even if there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction, e. g., Malinski v. New York, <targetCase>324 U. S. 401</targetCase> , 404 (1945); Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532 , 540-542 (1897). Both state and federal courts now adhere to trial procedures which seek to assure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession offered at trial, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964); United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36 , 38 (1951); see also Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613 , 624 (1896). Appellate review is exacting, see Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199 (1960). Whether his conviction was in a federal or state court, the defendant may secure a post-conviction hearing based on the alleged involuntary character of his confession, provided he meets the procedural requirements, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963). In addition, see Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U. S. 52 (1964). [34] See Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219 , 241 (1941); Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 (1944); Malinski v. New York, <targetCase>324 U. S. 401</targetCase> (1945); Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315 (1959); Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 (1963); Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963). [35] The police also prevented the attorney from consulting with his client. Independent of any other constitutional proscription, this action constitutes a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel and excludes any statement obtained in its wake. See People v. Donovan, 13 N. Y. 2d 148, 193 N. E. 2d 628 , 243 N. Y. S. 2d 841 (1963) (Fuld, J.). [36] In re Groban, 352 U. S. 330 , 340-352 (1957) (BLACK, J., dissenting); Note, 73 Yale L.
