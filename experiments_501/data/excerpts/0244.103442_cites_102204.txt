 Currin v. Wallace, supra, 11 , and see to the like effect United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., supra, 568, note 37.  We think also that § 15 (a) (2), now under consideration, is sustainable independently of § 15 (a) (1), which prohibits shipment or transportation of the proscribed goods.  As we have said the evils aimed at by the Act are the spread of substandard labor conditions through the use of the facilities of interstate commerce for competition by the goods so produced with those produced under the prescribed or better labor conditions; and the consequent dislocation of the commerce itself caused by the impairment or destruction of local businesses by competition made effective through interstate commerce.  The Act' is thus directed at the suppression of a method or kind of competition in interstate commerce which it has in effect condemned as “unfair,” as the Clayton Act has condemned other “unfair methods of competition” made effective through interstate commerce.  See Van Camp & Sons Co. v. American Can Co., 278 U. S. 245 ; Federal Trade Comm’n v. Keppel & Bro., 291 U. S. 304 .  The Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act are familiar examples of the exertion of the commerce power to prohibit or control activities wholly intrastate because of their effect on interstate commerce.  See as to the Sherman Act, Northern Securities Co. v. United States, 193 U. S. 197 ; Swift & Co. v. United States, 196 U. S. 375 ; United States v. Patten, 226 U. S. 525 ; United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Co., 259 U. S. 344 ; Local *123 No. 167 v. United States, <citedDecision>291 U. S. 293</citedDecision> ; Stevens Co. v. Foster & Kleiser Co., 311 U. S. 255 .  As to the National Labor Relations Act, see National Labor Relations Board v. Fainblatt, supra, and cases cited.  The means adopted by § 15 (a) (2) for the protection of interstate commerce by the suppression of the production of the condemned goods for interstate commerce is so related to the commerce and so affects it as to be within the reach of the commerce power.  See Currin v. Wallace, supra, 11 .  Congress, to attain its objective in the suppression of nationwide competition in interstate commerce by goods produced under substandard’labor conditions, has made no distinction as to the volume or amount of shipments in the commerce or of production for commerce by any particular shipper or producer.  It recognized that in present day industry, competition by a small part may affect the whole and that the total effect of the competition of many small producers may be great.  See H. Rept. No. 2182, 75th Cong. 1st Sess., p. 7.

 Nash v. United States, 229 U. S. 373, 377 .  We have considered, but find it unnecessary to discuss other contentions.  Reversed.  1 Sec. 2.  (a) The Congress hereby finds that the existence, in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers (1) causes commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of commerce to be used to spread and perpetuate such labor conditions among the workers of the several States; (2) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; (3) constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce; (4) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and (5) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce.  Section 3 (b) defines “commerce” as “trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or from any State to any place outside thereof,” 2 Cf. Administrator’s Opinion, Interpretative Bulletin No. 5, 1940 Wage and Hour Manual, p. 131 et seq. 3 It may prohibit wholly intrastate activities which, if permitted, would result in restraint of interstate commerce.  Coronado Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, 268 U. S. 295, 310 ; Local 167 v. United States, <citedDecision>291 U. S. 293, 297</citedDecision> .  It may regulate the activities of a local grain exchange shown to have an injurious effect on interstate commerce.  Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, 262 U. S. 1 .  It may regulate intrastate rates of interstate carriers where the effect of the rates is to burden interstate commerce.  Houston, E. & W. Texas Ry. Co. v. United States, 234 U. S. 342 ; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563 ; United States v. Louisiana, 290 U. S. 70, 74 ; Florida v. United States, 292 U. S. 1 .  It may compel the adoption of safety appliances on rolling stock moving intrastate because of the relation to and effect of such appliances upon interstate traffic moving over the same railroad.
