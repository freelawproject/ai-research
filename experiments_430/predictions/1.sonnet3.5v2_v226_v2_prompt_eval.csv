Determine whether the Acting Decision (Lear, Inc. v. Adkins) overruled the Cited Decision (Wilson v. Cook) by identifying any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions.

2. I'll identify the Cited Decision:
Wilson v. Cook is referenced in the concurrence opinion and combined opinion, with citation number 327 U.S. 474.

3. Analyzing the treatment of Wilson v. Cook:
- The Cited Decision is mentioned only as a supporting precedent for the principle that the Court should not consider questions not raised or decided in state courts.
- The Acting Decision cites Wilson v. Cook as an example of the Court following this principle, not to criticize or overrule it.
- There are no Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions taken against the Cited Decision.

I arrived at this conclusion because:

1. The Cited Decision (Anderson v. United States) is not mentioned or discussed in any of the provided passages from the Acting Decision.

2. While the Acting Decision does overrule some prior cases related to Eleventh Amendment issues, Anderson v. United States is not one of them.

3. Without any discussion of or reference to the Cited Decision, there cannot be any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions taken against it by the Acting Decision.

4. The absence of any mention of the Cited Decision means there is no basis to conclude it was overruled.

Therefore, the answer must be ""no"" - the Acting Decision did not overrule the Cited Decision."

I arrived at this conclusion because:

1. The Cited Decision (Helvering v. Gerhardt) is primarily referenced in the dissenting opinions, not in the majority opinion that would have the power to overrule it.

2. When the Cited Decision is mentioned, it is used to discuss principles of state immunity from federal taxation, rather than being criticized or overruled.

3. The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Maryland v. Wirtz, but makes no similar statement about overruling Helvering v. Gerhardt.

4. There are no Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions taken against the Cited Decision that would constitute overruling it.

5. The discussion of the Cited Decision is primarily used to support arguments rather than to overturn its holdings."

The determination is based on:

1. Clear identification of Explicit Negative Action: The Acting Decision directly states that it ""disavows"" LaRue's reasoning regarding the Twenty-first Amendment's effect on First Amendment analysis.

2. While the Court preserved LaRue's ultimate holding, it explicitly rejected the constitutional reasoning that supported that holding, which constitutes overruling of the legal principle established in LaRue.

3. The Court's language is unequivocal in rejecting LaRue's precedential value regarding the interaction between the Twenty-first and First Amendments, replacing it with a new constitutional interpretation.

4. This comes from the majority opinion section of the case, representing the Court's authoritative position.

The overruling is limited to LaRue's Twenty-first Amendment reasoning but is nonetheless a clear example of the Acting Decision overruling an aspect of the Cited Decision through Explicit Negative Action."

}
```

The key points supporting this analysis are:

1. The passages show that Poarch Creek Indians v. Alabama was consolidated with another case at the appellate level, but was not overruled by the Acting Decision.

2. The Court of Appeals dismissed both cases on Eleventh Amendment grounds, and the Supreme Court affirmed those dismissals, but did not overrule either case.

3. The discussion of Poarch Creek Indians appears primarily in footnotes as procedural background, not as a case being overturned or overruled.

4. While the Supreme Court's decision impacted the outcome of Poarch Creek Indians by affirming its dismissal, this does not constitute overruling the case itself.

Therefore, based on the passages provided, there is no evidence that the Acting Decision explicitly or implicitly overruled the Cited Decision. The relationship between the cases appears to be one of procedural consolidation and affirmance rather than overruling."

The key points in my analysis:

1. The passages contain a Supreme Court decision analyzing treaty rights, but do not show the Acting Decision overruling any Cited Decision.

2. While the Court discusses and distinguishes some prior cases (like Race Horse), it does not explicitly or implicitly overrule them. The dissent argues the majority effectively overrules Race Horse ""sub silentio"", but this is the dissent's characterization rather than the majority's holding.

3. The case focuses on interpreting treaties, executive orders and statehood implications rather than overruling prior court decisions.

4. The absence of a Cited Decision name in the metadata (""nan"") further confirms this is not a case about one decision overruling another.

Therefore, I conclude there is no overruling of a Cited Decision by the Acting Decision in this case."
