**Dissenting Opinion**
As to ordinary insurance contracts, the forum has had a much wider scope. The Court has balanced the interests of the competing jurisdictions, including factors such as the residence of the insured, where premiums were paid or payable, where the policy was applied for and delivered, where the insured died, what law the policy itself provided should govern, and whether loan agreements and new policies were ancillary to the initial policy. The forum has been permitted to protect its residents against insurance companies, but the Court has required the forum to have more than a casual interest. It has not been sufficient, for example, that the forum was the State of initial issue of the policy on which a defaulted loan was obtained, New York Life Insurance Co. v. Head, supra, or the place of issue of a converted policy and the residence at death of the insured, Aetna Life Insurance Co. v. Dunken, supra, or the place where suit has been brought, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Yates, supra. On the other hand, the forum would succeed if it asserted a strong local policy requiring an insur *419 able interest, see Griffin v. McCoach, supra, or a reserve requirement more stringent than that of the State of incorporation, State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Duel, supra. (c) In workmen’s compensation cases the Court has likewise adopted an interests-weighing approach. The relevant considerations have been: the place of the employment contract; the residence of the parties; the place of injury; the possibility of the workman becoming a public charge in the State seeking to award compensation, see Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, supra; the interest of a State in securing prompt payment of medical fees to its residents, see Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, supra; the aspect of exclusiveness of the foreign statute, see Industrial Commission v. McCartin, supra; the State’s interest in the bodily safety and economic protection of workers within it; the difference between a defense (which if rejected results in irremediable liability) and a cause of action (which if not allowed in one State can be pursued in another), see Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, supra; the amount of work to be performed in a State, see Cardillo v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., supra; and the policy of determinate liability and prompt remedy underlying workmen’s compensation acts. The Court first enunciated the rule that the forum must permit a defense based on the exclusiveness of the sister-state statute where the only contact of the forum was that it was the place of injury. Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, supra. Conversely, the Court held that the place of contract could award compensation though the injury occurred elsewhere. Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, supra. Subsequently, the Court held that the forum could prevail, even though the parties resided and the contract was entered in another State whose statute was exclusive, if *420 the injury occurred in the forum and enforcement of the defense of the outside statute was deemed “obnoxious” to the forum’s policy. Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, supra. In applying to the immediate situation the fair guidance offered by the past decisions of the Court regarding full faith and credit, a number of considerations become apparent: 2 (1) Unlike the other workmen’s compensation cases — or, for that matter, any of the cases in which the forum has prevailed in a conflict between the forum and the outside law — the interest of the forum here is solely dependent on the occurrence of the injury within its borders. No rights of Arkansas residents are involved, since none of the parties is an Arkansan; the workman was removed immediately to a Missouri hospital and has, so far as appears, remained in Missouri.

Rev. Stat., 1949, §§ 287.380, 287.400. While provision is made for an adjudication of disputes between an employee and his employer ( id., §§ 287.400, 287.450), no adjudication was sought or obtained here. Nor do we have a case where an employee, knowing of two remedies which purport to be mutually exclusive, chooses one as against the other and therefore is precluded a second choice by the law of the forum. Rather we have the naked question whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause makes Missouri's statute a bar to Arkansas' common-law remedy. A statute is a "public act" within the meaning of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. See Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U.S. 145 , 154-155, and cases cited; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Commission, 294 U.S. 532 . It was indeed held in the Clapper case that a Vermont Compensation Act, which purported to give an exclusive remedy, barred a common-law action on the same claim in the New Hampshire courts by a Vermont employee against a Vermont employer, even though the injury occurred in New Hampshire. The Clapper case allowed a State to fix one exclusive remedy for personal injuries involving its residents, and required the other States to refuse to enforce any inconsistent remedy. Thus, as respects persons residing or businesses located in a State, a remedy was provided employees that was "both expeditious and independent of proof of fault," and a liability was imposed on employers that was "limited and determinate." 286 U.S. , at 159 . *412 Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission, 306 U.S. 493 , departed, however, from the Clapper decision. There a resident of Massachusetts regularly employed in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts corporation was injured while doing temporary duty in California. The Massachusetts Compensation Act purported to give an exclusive remedy, even for injuries incurred beyond its borders. But California also had a Compensation Act which undertook to fix liability on employers, irrespective of any contract, rule, or regulation, a provision which the California courts strictly enforced. The Court, therefore, held that the exclusive nature of the Massachusetts Act was "obnoxious" to the policy of California. The Court proceeded on the premise, repeated over and again in the cases, that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require a State to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the statute of another State reflecting a conflicting and opposed policy. Id., at 502.

See also Bonaparte v. Tax Court, 104 U.S. 592 ; American Fire Insurance Co. v. King Lumber & Mfg. Co., 250 U.S. 2 . These cases prove that, where the statute of either the forum or the outside State is not found to be exclusive regarding remedies or rights elsewhere, the statute need not be accorded exclusive effect. Further, the Court has stated that, in the area of workmen's compensation, "unmistakable language" is required before exclusiveness will be attributed. See Industrial Commission v. McCartin, 330 U. S., at 628. *416 (3) Those in which the forum applied its own substantive law, statutory or judicial, when clearly in conflict with the out-of-state statute.

Conversely, the Court held that the place of contract could award compensation though the injury occurred elsewhere. Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra . Subsequently, the Court held that the forum could prevail, even though the parties resided and the contract was entered in another State whose statute was exclusive, if *420 the injury occurred in the forum and enforcement of the defense of the outside statute was deemed "obnoxious" to the forum's policy. Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, supra . In applying to the immediate situation the fair guidance offered by the past decisions of the Court regarding full faith and credit, a number of considerations become apparent: [2] (1) Unlike the other workmen's compensation casesor, for that matter, any of the cases in which the forum has prevailed in a conflict between the forum and the outside lawthe interest of the forum here is solely dependent on the occurrence of the injury within its borders. No rights of Arkansas residents are involved, since none of the parties is an Arkansan; the workman was removed immediately to a Missouri hospital and has, so far as appears, remained in Missouri. What *421 might be regarded as the societal interest of Arkansas in the protection of the bodily safety of workers within its borders is an interest equally true of any jurisdiction where a workman is injured and exactly the sort of interest which New Hampshire had in Clapper. (2) Thus, the Court is squarely faced with the Clapper problem. [3] To make the interest of Arkansas prevail over the interest of Missouri on the basis of the Full Faith and Credit Clause would require that Clapper be explicitly overruled and that, in the area of workmen's compensation law, the place of injury be decisive. And if Clapper is to be overruled, on which I and those who join me express no opinion, it should be done with reasons making manifest why Mr. Justice Brandeis' long-matured, weighty opinion in that *422 case was ill-founded. It should not be cast aside on the presupposition that full faith and credit need not be given to a sister-state workmen's compensation statute if the law of the forum happens to be more favorable to the claimant. (3) Furthermore, the new provision of 28 U.S. C . § 1738 cannot be disregarded. In 1948 Congress for the first time dealt with the full faith and credit effect to be given statutes. [4] The absence of such a provision was used by Mr. Justice Stone to buttress the Court's opinions both in Alaska Packers, 294 U. S., at 547, and Pacific Employers, 306 U. S., at 502. Hence, if § 1738 has any effect, it would seem to tend toward respecting Missouri's legislation. See Reese, Full Faith and Credit to Statutes: The Defense of Public Policy, 19 U. of Chi. L. Rev. 339, 343 et seq. There is, however, a readily available alternative short of overruling Clapper which dispenses with the difficulties inherent in applying the Full Faith and Credit Clause. This alternative proceeds along the following lines: Missouri's workmen's compensation statute is in terms applicable and exclusive as to workmen injured outside the State under Missouri employment contracts. [5] Hogan *423 (the subcontractor here) was a Missouri employer and had a Missouri employment contract with Carroll (the injured workman). Thus when Carroll sought workmen's compensation in Arkansas (where he was hurt), Hogan and his insurer could have relied on the Missouri statute and the Clapper case as a defense. They did not, presumably since Arkansas workmen's compensation cost them no more than Missouri's and they had an opportunity to recoup from the prime contractor as a third party under Arkansas law. [6] But Lanza (the prime contractor) was not a Missouri employer, nor does the record disclose that he had a Missouri employment contract either with Hogan or Carroll. The basic contract between Lanza and Hogan was on a Louisiana letterhead and is a contract for work apparently to be performed exclusively in Arkansas. Hogan promised to furnish workmen and "It is further understood that . . .

The court rejected this contention and rendered an $18,000 judgment for Carroll. 116 F. Supp. 491 . The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, relying on Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, 320 U.S. 430 , reversed on the ground that full faith and credit required Arkansas to give effect to what the court treated as a final and exclusive award in the payments received under the Missouri statute. 216 F.2d 808 . This dissent agrees with the Court that the Court of Appeals misapplied Magnolia to the facts of this case. [3] Concededly the Pacific Employers case narrowed what was said in Clapper. The Court there found the conjunction of four factors decisive in upholding the California Supreme Court's determination that the Massachusetts statute was "obnoxious" to the public policy of California: (1) medical services were rendered in California and directly reimbursable from the California award; if California could not make an award, its residents would be remitted to Massachusetts and Massachusetts remedies to recover for their services; (2) bodily safety and economic protection of workers within its boundaries is a relevant interest of the forum; (3) the California statute provided: "No contract, rule, or regulation shall exempt the employer from liability . . . . "; (4) Congress had not yet passed legislation prescribing the full faith and credit effect to be given to statutes. The distinctions between that case and the one now at bar are to be noted.
