This clear statement appears in the lead opinion, representing the majority view of the Court.",Determine whether the Acting Case overruled the Target Case.,Hodges v. United States,"Let me analyze this step by step.

1. First, I'll summarize the task:
- I need to determine if Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. overruled Hodges v. United States
- I should focus only on explicit or implicit negative actions against Hodges

2. Looking at the passages:
- The Court directly addresses Hodges v. United States
- The Court explicitly states that Hodges is being overruled
- The key quote is: ""Insofar as Hodges is inconsistent with our holding today, it is hereby overruled.""

3. Analysis:
- This is a clear example of an explicit negative action
- The Court specifically uses the word ""overruled""
- The overruling comes in the lead opinion, which represents the majority view
- The dissenting opinions do not contradict this specific point

4. Here's my response in the required format:

The case is ultimately remanded for consideration under Babcock & Wilcox's statutory criteria.",Determine whether the Acting Case overruled the Target Case.,NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co.,"Let me analyze this step by step.

1. First, I'll summarize the task:
- I need to determine if the Acting Case (Hudgens v. NLRB) overruled the Target Case (NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co.)
- I need to look for Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions in the passages

2. Key findings from reviewing the passages:
- The Acting Case repeatedly cites and relies on Babcock & Wilcox as valid precedent
- The court uses Babcock & Wilcox's principles as ""the guiding principle""
- Rather than overruling Babcock & Wilcox, the court reaffirms its test for accommodating §7 rights and property rights
- The case is remanded for consideration under Babcock & Wilcox's statutory criteria

3. Output determination:
The Acting Case clearly does not overrule the Target Case. Instead, it repeatedly affirms and relies on the Target Case's principles.

1. First, I'll summarize the task:
- I need to determine if the Acting Case (United States v. Dixon) overruled the Target Case (Nielsen).
- I should look for explicit or implicit negative actions in the passages that indicate overruling.

2. Analyzing the passages:
- The case extensively discusses Nielsen and its interpretation.
- While there is significant debate about Nielsen's meaning and application, there is no explicit statement overruling it.
- The majority opinion actually relies on Nielsen as valid precedent, though interpreting it differently than the dissent.
- The discussion centers on how to properly interpret Nielsen rather than whether to overrule it.

3. Key evidence:
- The case uses Nielsen as supporting precedent
- There are no explicit statements overruling Nielsen
- The debate is about interpretation, not validity
- Nielsen continues to be treated as valid law

1. First, I'll summarize the task:
- I need to determine if United States v. Dixon overruled Harris v. Oklahoma
- I need to focus on explicit or implicit negative actions that would constitute overruling

2. Looking at the passages:
- The case extensively discusses Harris
- Harris is cited and analyzed multiple times
- The discussion is primarily about how to interpret and apply Harris, not about overruling it

3. Key observations:
- The court continues to rely on Harris as valid precedent
- The court uses Harris to support its reasoning in multiple instances
- There are debates about how to interpret Harris, but not about its validity
- The court distinguishes between overruling Grady (which it explicitly does) and interpreting Harris (which it continues to use)

4. Conclusion:
The Acting Case does not overrule the Target Case. While there is extensive discussion and debate about how to interpret Harris, there are no explicit or implicit negative actions that would constitute overruling. In fact, the court continues to rely on Harris as valid precedent.

}
```

The key points supporting this determination:

1. The passages repeatedly cite Allen as valid precedent and use it as a basis for analyzing aid to religious schools.

2. When discussing overruling precedents, the Court explicitly states it is overruling Meek and Wolman, but makes no such statement about Allen.

3. The Court actively reaffirms Allen's principles throughout the opinion, treating it as good law.

4. The passages show that Allen's holding regarding textbook programs has been consistently upheld and distinguished from other types of aid programs that were found unconstitutional.

Therefore, with high confidence, Mitchell v. Helms did not overrule Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, but rather reinforced and built upon its precedent."
