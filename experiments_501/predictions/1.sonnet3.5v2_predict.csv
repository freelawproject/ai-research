I arrived at this conclusion because:

1. The Lead Opinion directly addresses Union Gas and explicitly states they are overruling it. This constitutes an Explicit Negative Action.

2. The majority opinion provides clear reasoning for overruling Union Gas:
- It was a ""solitary departure from established law""
- It created confusion among lower courts
- It deviated from established federalism jurisprudence
- The original decision lacked a majority rationale

3. While there are dissenting opinions that disagree with overruling Union Gas, the Lead Opinion represents the majority view and is what determines whether a case is overruled.

4. The language used in the Lead Opinion is unambiguous about overruling Union Gas, making this a clear example of an Explicit Negative Action to overrule the Cited Decision.","The Acting Decision name is: ""Seminole Tribe of Florida v.

The key points supporting this analysis are:

1. The Acting Decision affirmed the Eleventh Circuit's dismissal of the Cited Decision on jurisdictional grounds, finding lack of subject matter jurisdiction.

2. While the Court made important constitutional rulings about state sovereign immunity and congressional power, it did not overrule any holding from the Cited Decision.

3. The Court's ruling was focused on jurisdiction and did not address or overturn the substantive merits of the Cited Decision.

4. The language used indicates affirmance rather than overruling of the Cited Decision.

Therefore, while the Acting Decision had significant implications for federal Indian law and state sovereign immunity doctrine, it did not explicitly or implicitly overrule the Cited Decision itself.","The Acting Decision name is: ""Seminole Tribe of Florida v.
