 Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 11 (1984); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129 (1982).  In McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), we held that the same standard used to excuse state procedural defaults should be applied in habeas corpus cases where abuse of the writ is claimed by the government.  Id., at 493 .  This conclusion rested on the fact that the two doctrines are similar in purpose and design and implicate similar concerns.  Id., at 493-494 .  The writ strikes at finality of a state criminal conviction, a matter of particular importance in a federal system.  Id., at 491 , citing Murray v. Carrier, <citedDecision>477 U. S. 478, 487</citedDecision> (1986).  Federal habeas litigation also places a heavy burden on scarce judicial resources, may give litigants incentives to withhold claims for manipulative purposes, and may create disincentives to present claims when evidence is fresh.  499 U. S., at 491-492 .  See also Reed v. Ross, supra, at 13 ; Wainwright, supra, at 89 .  Again addressing the issue of state procedural default in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), we described Fay as based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules, 501 U. S., at 750 , and went on to hold that the cause-and-prejudice standard applicable to failure to raise a particular claim should apply as well to failure to appeal at all. Ibid. “All of the State’s interests — in channeling the resolution of claims to the most appropriate forum, in finality, and in having an opportunity to correct its own errors — are implicated whether a prisoner defaults one claim or all of them.” Id., at 750 .  We therefore applied the cause-and-prejudice standard uniformly to state procedural defaults, eliminating the “irrational” distinction between Fay and subsequent cases. 501 U. S., at 751 .  In light of these decisions, it is similarly *8 irrational to distinguish between failing to properly assert a federal claim in state court and failing in state court to properly develop such a claim, and to apply to the latter a remnant of a decision that is no longer upheld with regard to the former.

 Finally, it is worth noting that applying the cause-and-prejudice standard in this case also advances uniformity in the law of habeas corpus.  There is no good reason to maintain in one area of habeas law a standard that has been rejected in the area in which it was principally enunciated.  And little can be said for holding a habeas petitioner to one standard for failing to bring a claim in state court and excusing the petitioner under another, lower standard for failing to develop the factual basis of that claim in the same forum.  A different rule could mean that a habeas petitioner would not be excused for negligent failure to object to the introduction of the prosecution’s evidence, but nonetheless would be excused for negligent failure to introduce any evidence of his own to support a constitutional claim.  5 *11 Respondent Tamayo-Reyes is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if he can show cause for his failure to develop the facts in state-court proceedings and actual prejudice resulting from that failure.  We also adopt the narrow exception *12 to the cause-and-prejudice requirement: A habeas petitioner’s failure to develop a claim in state-court proceedings will be excused and a hearing mandated if he can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from failure to hold a federal evidentiary hearing.  Cf. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S., at 494 ; <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> v. Carrier, <citedDecision>477 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> .  The State concedes that a remand to the District Court is appropriate in order to afford respondent the opportunity to bring forward evidence establishing cause and prejudice, Brief for Petitioner 21, and we agree that respondent should have that opportunity.  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  So ordered.  With respect to respondent’s claim that the plea form and plea proceeding were not adequately translated, the Court of Appeals concluded that state postconviction proceedings afforded petitioner ample opportunity to *5 contest the translations, that the material facts surrounding these issues were adequately developed, and that the state court’s findings were adequately supported by the record.  The Court of Appeals therefore held that a federal evidentiary hearing on that claim was not required.  926 F. 2d, at 1602 .

 Section 2254(d), however, does not purport to govern the question of when hearings are required; rather, it lists exceptions to the normal presumption of correctness of state-court *11 findings and deals with the burden of proof where hearings are held.  The two issues are distinct, and the statute indicates no assumption that the presence or absence of any of the statutory exceptions will determine whether a hearing is held.  Second, to the extent that it even considered the issue of default, Congress sensibly could have read Townsend as holding that the federal habeas corpus standard for cases of default under Townsend’s fifth circumstance and cases of procedural default should be the same.  Third, § 2254(d) does not mention or recognize any exception for inexcusable neglect, let alone reflect the specific standard of deliberate bypass.  In the face of this silence, it should not be assumed that if there is to be a judicially created standard for equitable default, it must be no other than the deliberate bypass standard borrowed by Townsend from a decision that has since been repudiated.  We agree with Justice O’Connor that under our holding a claim invoking the fifth circumstance of Townsend will be unavailing where the cause asserted is attorney error.  Murray v. <citedDecision>Carrier, 477 U. S. 478</citedDecision> (1986), and Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), dictate as much.  Such was the intended effect of those cases, but this does not make that circumstance a dead letter, for cause may be shown for reasons other than attorney error.  We noted in <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> , a procedural default case, that objective factors external to the defense may impede counsel’s efforts to comply and went on to say: “Without attempting an exhaustive catalog of such objective impediments to compliance with a procedural rule, we note that a showing that the factual or legal basis for a claim was not reasonably available to counsel, see Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S., at 16 , or that ‘some interference by officials,’ Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443, 486 (1953), made compliance impracticable, would constitute cause under this standard.” <citedDecision>477 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> .  Much of the same may be said of cases where the petitioner has defaulted on the development of a claim.  Nor, to the extent it is relevant to our decision in this case, is Justice O’Connor’s argument that many forms of cause would fall under other Townsend circumstances persuasive.  For example, the third and sixth circumstances of Townsend speak to the denial by a court of full and fair hearing; however, a situation where facts were inadequately developed because of interference from officials would fall naturally into the fifth circumstance.

 The Court today holds that even when the reliability of state factfinding is doubtful because crucial evidence was not presented to the state trier of fact, a habeas petitioner is ordinarily not entitled to an opportunity to prove the facts necessary to his claim.  This holding, of course, directly overrules a portion of Townsend , but more than that, I think it departs significantly from the pre-Townsend law of habeas corpus.  Even before Townsend , when a habeas petitioner’s claim was properly before a federal court, and when the accurate resolution of that claim depended on proof of facts that had been resolved against the petitioner in an unreliable state proceeding, the petitioner was entitled to his day in federal court. As Justice Holmes wrote for the Court, in a case where the state courts had rejected — under somewhat suspicious circumstances — the petitioner’s allegation that his trial had been dominated by an angry mob: “[I]t does not seem to us sufficient to allow a Judge of the United States to escape the duty of examining the facts for himself when if true as alleged they make the trial absolutely void.” Moore, 261 U. S., at 92 .  The class of petitioners eligible to present claims on habeas may have been narrower in days gone by, and the class of claims one might present may have *19 been smaller, but once the claim was properly before the court, the right to a hearing was not construed as narrowly as the Court construes it today.  B Instead of looking to the history of the right to an eviden-tiary hearing, the Court simply borrows the cause and prejudice standard from a series of our recent habeas corpus cases. Ante, at 5-8.  All but one of these cases address the question of when a habeas claim is properly before a federal court despite the petitioner’s procedural default.  See Coleman v. Thompson, supra; Murray v. <citedDecision>Carrier, 477 U. S. 478</citedDecision> (1986); Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1 (1984); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107 (1982); Wainwright v. Sykes, supra; Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976).  The remaining case addresses the issue of a petitioner’s abuse of the writ.  See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991).  These cases all concern the question whether the federal court will consider the merits of the claim, that is, whether the court has the authority to upset a judgment affirmed on direct appeal.  So far as this threshold inquiry is concerned, our respect for state procedural rules and the need to discourage abuse of the writ provide the justification for the cause and prejudice standard.  As we have said in the former context: “[T]he Great Writ imposes special costs on our federal system.  The States possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law. In criminal trials they also hold the initial responsibility for vindicating constitutional rights.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 In enacting a statute that so closely parallels Townsend , Congress established a procedural framework that relies upon Townsend’s continuing validity.  In general, therefore, overruling Townsend would frustrate the evident intent of Congress that the question of when a hearing is to be held should be governed by the same standards as the question of when a federal court should defer to state court factfind-ing.  In particular, the Court’s adoption of a “cause and prejudice” standard for determining whether the material facts were adequately developed in state proceedings will frustrate Congress’ intent with respect to that Townsend circumstance’s statutory analog, § 2254(d)(3).  For a case to fit within this Townsend circumstance but none of Townsend’s other circumstances, the case will very likely be like this one, where the material facts were not *22 developed because of attorney error.  Any other reason the material facts might not have been developed, such as that they were unknown at the time or that the State denied a full and fair opportunity to develop them, will almost certainly be covered by one of Townsend’s, other circumstances.  See Townsend, 372 U. S., at 313 .  We have already held that attorney error short of constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel does not amount to “cause.” See <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Carrier, 477 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> .  As a result, the practical effect of the Court’s ruling today will be that for a case to fall within Townsend’s fifth circumstance but no other — for a petitioner to be entitled to a hearing on the ground that the material facts were not adequately developed in state court but on no other ground — the petitioner’s attorney must have rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance in presenting facts to the state factfinder.  This effect is more than a little ironic.  Where the state factfinding occurs at the trial itself, counsel’s ineffectiveness will not just entitle the petitioner to a hearing — it will entitle the petitioner to a new trial. Where, as in this case, the state factfinding occurs at a postconviction proceeding, the petitioner has no constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel, so counsel’s poor performance can never constitute “cause” under the cause and prejudice standard.  Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S., at 752 .  After today’s decision, the only petitioners entitled to a hearing under Townsend’s fifth circumstance are the very people who do not need one, because they will have already obtained a new trial or because they will already be entitled to a hearing under one of the other circumstances.  The Court has thus rendered unusable the portion of Townsend requiring hearings where the material facts were not adequately developed in state court. As noted above, the fact that § 2254(d)(3) uses language identical to the language we used in Townsend strongly suggests that Congress presumed the continued existence of this *23 portion of Townsend .

Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Blackmun, Justice Stevens, and Justice Kennedy join, dissenting.  Under the guise of overruling "a remnant of a decision," ante, at 8, and achieving "uniformity in the law," ante, at 10, the Court has changed the law of habeas corpus in a fundamental way by effectively overruling cases decided long before Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963).  I do not think this change is supported by the line of our recent procedural default cases upon which the Court relies: In my view, the balance of state and federal interests regarding whether a federal court will consider a claim raised on habeas cannot be simply lifted and transposed to the different question whether, once the court will consider the claim, it should hold an evidentiary hearing.
