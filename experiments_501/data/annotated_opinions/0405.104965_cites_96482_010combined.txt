**Combined Opinion**
 The vessels were registered in Cincinnati, Ohio, but only stopped in Ohio for occasional fuel or repairs.  These stops were made at Cincinnati; but none of them involved loading or unloading cargo.  The Tax Commissioner of Ohio, acting under §§ 5325 and 5328 of the Ohio General Code, levied an ad valorem personal property tax on all of these vessels.  The Board of Tax Appeals affirmed (with an exception not material here), and the Supreme Court of Ohio sustained the Board, 155 Ohio St. 61 , 98 N. E. 2d 8 , over the objection that the tax violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The case is here on appeal.  28 U. S. C. § 1257 (2).  Under the earlier view governing the taxability of vessels moving in the inland waters ( St. Louis v. Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423 ; Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, <citedDecision>202 U. S. 409</citedDecision> ; cf. Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia, 198 U. S. 299 ), Ohio, the state of the domicile, would have a strong claim to the whole of the tax that has been levied.  But the rationale of those cases was rejected in Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co., 336 U. S. 169 , where we held that vessels moving in interstate operations along the inland waters were taxable by the same standards as those which Pullman's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, 141 U. S. 18 , first applied to railroad cars in interstate commerce.  The formula approved was one which fairly apportioned the tax to the commerce carried on within the state.  In that way we *384 placed inland water transportation on the same constitutional footing as other interstate enterprises.  The Ott case involved a tax by Louisiana on vessels of a foreign corporation operating in Louisiana waters.  Louisiana sought to tax only that portion of the value of the vessels represented by the ratio between the total number of miles in Louisiana and the total number of miles in the entire operation.  The present case is sought to be distinguished on the ground that Ohio is the domiciliary state and therefore may tax the whole value even though the boats and barges operate outside Ohio.
**Combined Opinion**
 Seagoing vessels have always been taxable at the domicile of the owner.  Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, 222 U. S. 63 ; Morgan v. Parham, 16 Wall. 471 ; Hays v. Pacific Mail S. S. Co., 17 How. 596 .  This same rule has been applied to vessels engaged in commerce between the different states.  Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, 99 U. S. 273 ; St. Louis v. Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423 .  The only exception to the rule until today was that where vessels had acquired a situs for taxation in some other state, that other state might tax them.  Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia, 198 U. S. 299 .  In Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, <citedDecision>202 U. S. 409, 421</citedDecision> , this Court said: "The general rule has long been settled as to vessels plying between the ports of different States, engaged in the coastwise trade, that the domicil of the owner is the situs of a vessel for the purpose of taxation, wholly irrespective of the place of enrollment, subject, however, to the exception that where a vessel *386 engaged in interstate commerce has acquired an actual situs in a State other than the place of the domicil of the owner, it may there be taxed because within the jurisdiction of the taxing authority." In the case at hand, the vessels had not acquired a situs for taxation in any other state.  They were at large in the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, touching ports therein from time to time.  There was no showing as to how much time any of the vessels spent in any state.  Indeed, the time spent in any state by the vessels plying the Mississippi River could not be shown with any accuracy, as the states on each side own to the middle of the stream.  [*] The navigation channel might be on either side of the center line or right on the center line. Who is to say what state the vessels were in?  The doctrine of apportionment applied in Ott v. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., 336 U. S. 169 , is not in point.
