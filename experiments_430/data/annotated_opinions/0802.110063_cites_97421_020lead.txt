 They would have affirmed the State’s power to provide for the protection of wild game, but only “so far as such protection .  .  .  does not contravene the power of Congress in the regulation of inter *329 state commerce.” 7 Their view was that “[w]hen any animal ... is lawfully killed for the purposes of food or other uses of man, it becomes an article of commerce, and its use cannot be limited to the citizens of one State to the exclusion of citizens of another State.” 8 B The view of the Geer dissenters increasingly prevailed in subsequent cases. Indeed, not only has the Geer analysis been rejected when natural resources other than wild game were involved, but even state regulations of wild game have been held subject to the strictures of the Commerce Clause under the pretext of distinctions from Geer .  The erosion of Geer began only 15 years after it was decided.  A Commerce Clause challenge was addressed to an Oklahoma statute designed to prohibit the transportation beyond the State of natural gas produced by wells within the State.  West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., <citedDecision>221 U. S. 229</citedDecision> (1911).  Based on reasoning parallel to that in Geer , Oklahoma urged its right to “conserve” the gas for the use of its own citizens, stressing the limited supply and the absence of alternative sources of fuel within the State.  Nevertheless, the Court, in a passage reminiscent of the dissents in Geer , condemned the obvious protectionist motive in the Oklahoma statute and rejected the State’s arguments with a powerful reaffirmation of the vision of the Framers: “The statute of Oklahoma recognizes [gas] to be a subject of intrastate commerce, but seeks to prohibit it from being the subject of interstate commerce, and this is the purpose of its conservation.  ... If the States have such power a singular situation might result.  Pennsylvania might keep its coal, the Northwest its timber, the mining *330 States their minerals.  And why may not the products of the field be brought within the principle?  Thus enlarged, or without that enlargement, its influence on interstate commerce need not be pointed out.  To what consequences does such power tend?  If one State has it, all States have it; embargo may be retaliated by embargo, and commerce will be halted at state lines.  And yet we have said that 'in matters of foreign and interstate commerce there are no state lines.’ In such commerce, instead of the States, a new power appears and a new welfare, a welfare which transcends that of any State.  But rather let us say it is constituted of the welfare of all of the States and that of each State is made the greater by a division of its resources, natural and created, with every other State, and those of every other State with it.  This was the purpose, as it is the result, of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States.  If there is to be a turning backward it must be done by the authority of another instrumentality than a court.” <citedDecision>221 U. S., at 255-256</citedDecision> .  The Court distinguished discriminatory or prohibatory regulations offensive to the Commerce Clause, such as the Oklahoma statute, from a valid "exercise of the police power to regulate the taking of natural gas” that was "universal in its application and justified by the nature of the gas and which allowed its transportation to other states.” <citedDecision>Id., at 257</citedDecision> ; see <citedDecision>id., at 252-254</citedDecision> (distinguishing Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana, 177 U. S. 190 (1900)).  In subsequent Commerce Clause challenges to state regulation of exports of natural resources, the <citedDecision>West</citedDecision> analysis emerged as the dominant approach.  See, e. g., Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553, 598-600 (1923); 9 H. P. Hood & Sons, *331 Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525 (1949).  Today’s principle is that stated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970): “Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.  ... If a legitimate local purpose is found, then the question becomes one of degree.  And the extent of the burden that will be tolerated will of course depend on the nature of the local interest involved, and on whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities.” (Citations omitted.) This formulation was employed only last Term to strike down New Jersey’s attempt to “conserve” the natural resource of landfill areas within the State for the disposal of waste generated within the State.  Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978).

 161 U. S., at 541 (Field, J., dissenting); see id., at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting).  Id., at 538, 541-542 (Field, J., dissenting); see id., at 543-544 (Harlan, J., dissenting).  The inconsistency between the result in this case and that in Geer was not overlooked by the dissenting Justices.  See Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S., at 601 (Holmes, J., dissenting).  Significantly, *331 our Brother BjehNquist relies on this dissent in his discussion of the “alternative basis” of Geer — the “preservation of a valuable natural resource” rationale.  See n. 6, supra; post, at 340-341, n. 3.  The Court opinion in Pennsylvania v. West Virginia , like that in <citedDecision>West</citedDecision> , expressly rejected this argument along with the “no interstate commerce” rationale.  262 U. S., at 599-600 .  The law challenged in Foster-Fountain Packing Co. was passed in July 1926.  The state legislature may have been encouraged to take such action by certain language in Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545 (1924), language also relied on by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in this case. Lacoste upheld a Louisiana “severance” tax on the skins of all wild furbearing animals and alligators taken in the State.  The Court cited Geer for the proposition that: “The wild animals within its borders are, so far as capable of ownership, owned by the State in its sovereign capacity for the common benefit of all of its people.  Because of such ownership, and in the exercise of its police power the State may regulate and control the taking, subsequent use and property rights that may be acquired therein.” 263 U. S., at 549 .  Nevertheless, Lacoste expressly declined to uphold the tax “by virtue of the power of the State to prohibit, and therefore to condition, the removal of wild game from the State.” Ibid. Rather than reach this issue, the Court upheld the measure as a valid police regulation designed to conserve and protect wild animals, noting that the tax applied to all skins taken within the State, whether kept within the State or shipped out.

 Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm’n, 334 U. S. 410, 420-421 (1948), decided the same day as Toomer , reviewed the cases distinguishing and questioning Geer and found the State's claim to “ownership” inadequate to justify a ban on commercial fishing by alien residents.  “In more recent years .  .  .  the Court has recognized that the States’ interest in regulating and controlling those things they claim to 'own,’ including wildlife, is by no means absolute.  States may not compel the confinement of the benefits of their resources, even .their wildlife, to their own people whenever such hoarding and confinement impedes interstate commerce.  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 1 (1928) ; Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923); West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., <citedDecision>221 U. S. 229</citedDecision> (1911).” Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, 436 U. S. 371, 385-386 (1978).  See, e. g., Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 , 285 n. 21 (1977).  “ [W] hatever [a State’s] ultimate purpose, it may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently.” Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 626-627 .  See n. 1, supra. Section 4-115 (B) does not apply to persons transporting three dozen or less natural minnows outside the State.  See n. 1, supra. In its brief, Oklahoma argues, apparently for the first time, that the discrimination against out-of-state sales of natural minnows is justified because minnows purchased in the State are more likely to be used for bait in state waters.  Brief for Appellee 3.  The State contends that minnows “returned” to state waters as bait do not upset the ecological balance as much as those that never “return.” The late appearance of this argument and the total absence of any record support for the questionable factual assumptions that underlie it give it the flavor of a post hoc rationalization.
