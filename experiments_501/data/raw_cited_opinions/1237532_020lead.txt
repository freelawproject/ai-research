<p id="AEn">Defendant and 15 other persons were charged with conspiring to engage in horse-race bookmaking and related offenses in violation of section 337a of the Penal Code. Six of the defendants pleaded guilty. After a trial without a jury, the court found one defendant not guilty and each of the other defendants guilty as charged. Charles H. Cahan, one of the defendants found guilty, was granted probation for a period of five years on the condition that he spend the first 90 days of his probationary period in the county jail and pay a $2,000 fine. He appeals from the order granting him probation and the order denying his motion for a new trial.</p>
<p id="b460-6">Most of the incriminatory evidence introduced at the trial was obtained by officers of the Los Angeles Police Department in flagrant violation of the United States Constitution (4th and 14th Amendments), the California Constitution (art. I, § 19), and state and federal statutes. (Pen. Code, §§146, 602; <span class="citation no-link">18 U.S.C.A. §§ 241</span>, 242; <span class="citation no-link">42 U.S.C.A. § 1983</span>.) Gerald Wooters, an officer attached to the intelligence unit of that department testified that after securing the permission of the chief of police to make microphone installations<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> at two places occupied by defendants, he, Sergeant Keeler, and Officer Phillips one night at about 8:45 entered one “house through the side window of the first floor,” and that he 1 ‘ directed the officers to place a listening device under a chest of drawers.” Another officer made recordings and transcriptions of the conversations that came over wires from the listening device to receiving equipment installed in a nearby garage. About a month later, at Officer Wooters’ direction, <page-number citation-index="1" label="437">*437</page-number>a similar device was surreptitiously installed in another house and receiving equipment was also set up in a nearby garage. Such methods of getting evidence have been caustically censured by the United States Supreme Court: “That officers of the law would break and enter a home, secrete such a device, even in a bedroom, and listen to the conversations of the occupants for over a month would be almost incredible if it were not admitted. Few police measures have come to our attention that more flagrantly, deliberately and persistently violate the fundamental principle declared by the Fourth Amendment. ...” <em>(Irvine </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105194"><a href="/opinion/105194/irvine-v-california/#132" aria-description="Citation for case: Irvine v.

California">74 S.Ct. 381</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">98 L.Ed. 561</span>].)  Section 653h of the Penal Code does not and could not authorize violations of the Constitution, and the proviso under which the officers purported to act at most prevents their conduct from constituting a violation of that section itself.</p>
<p id="b461-6">The evidence obtained from the microphones was not the only unconstitutionally obtained evidence introduced at the trial over defendants’ objection. In addition there was a mass of evidence obtained by numerous forcible entries and seizures without search warrants.</p>
<p id="b461-7">The forcible entries and seizures were candidly admitted by the various officers. For example, Officer Fosnocht identified the evidence that he seized, and testified as to his means of entry: “. . . and how did you gain entrance to the particular place ? I forced entry through the front door and Officer Farquarson through the rear door. You say you forced the front door <em>1 </em>. . . Yes. And how? I kicked it open with my foot. ...” Officer Sehlocker testified that he entered the place where he seized evidence “through a window located I believe it was west of the front door. . . . [W]hen you tried to force entry in other words, you tried to knock it [the door] down is that right? We tried to knock it down, yes, sir. What with? A shoe, foot. Kick it? Tried to kick it in, yes. And then you moved over and broke the window to gain entrance, is that right? We did.” Officer Scherrer testified that he gained entry into one of the places where he seized evidence by kicking the front door in. He also entered another place, accompanied by Officers Hilton and Horral, by breaking through a window. Officer Harris “just walked up and kicked the door in” to gain entry to the place assigned to him.</p>
<p id="b461-8">Thus, without fear of criminal punishment or other discipline, law enforcement officers, sworn to support the <page-number citation-index="1" label="438">*438</page-number>Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of California, frankly admit their deliberate, flagrant- acts in violation of both Constitutions and the laws enacted thereunder. It is clearly apparent from their testimony that they casually regard such acts as nothing more than the performance of their ordinary duties for which the city employs and pays them.</p>
<p id="b462-5">The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.” Although this amendment, like each of the other provisions of the original Bill of Rights, applies only to the federal government <em>(Barron </em>v. <em>Baltimore, </em>7 Pet.

<p id="b462-8">Thus both the United States Constitution and the California Constitution make it emphatically clear that important as efficient law enforcement may be, it is more important that the right of privacy guaranteed by these constitutional provisions be respected.  Since in <em>no </em>case shall the right of the people to be secure against unreasonable searches and seizures be violated, the contention that unreasonable searches and seizures are justified by the necessity of bringing criminals to justice cannot be accepted. It was rejected when the constitutional provisions were adopted and the choice was made that all the people, guilty and innocent alike, should be secure from unreasonable police intrusions, even though some criminals should escape.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>
<page-number citation-index="1" label="439">*439</page-number>Moreover, the constitutional provisions make no distinction between the guilty and the innocent, and it would be manifestly impossible to protect the rights of the innocent if the police were permitted to justify unreasonable searches and seizures on the ground that they assumed their victims were criminals. Thus, when consideration is directed to the question of the admissibility of evidence obtained in violation of the constitutional provisions, it bears emphasis that the court is not concerned solely with the rights of the defendant before it, however guilty he may appear, but with the constitutional right of all of the people to be secure in their homes, persons, and effects.</p>
<p id="b463-6">The constitutional provisions themselves do not expressly answer the question whether evidence obtained in violation thereof is admissible in criminal actions. Neither Congress nor the Legislature has given an answer, and the courts of the country are divided on the question. The federal courts and those of some of the states<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> exclude such evidence. <em>(Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="98094"><a href="/opinion/98094/weeks-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Weeks v.

J The exclusionary rule is not “an essential ingredient” ofthe right of privacy guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, but simply a means of enforcing that right, which the states can accept or reject: “Granting that in practice the exclusion of evidence may be <em>an </em>effective way of deterring unreasonable searches, it is not for this Court to condemn as falling below the minimal standards assured by the Due Process Clause a State’s reliance upon other methods which <em>if </em>consistently enforced <em>would le </em>equally effective.” (Italics added. <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado, supra, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104709"><a href="/opinion/104709/wolf-v-colorado/#31" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolf v. Colorado">338 U.S. 25 at p. 31</a></span>.) The court did not state that the other methods of deterring unreasonable searches and seizures must be “consistently enforced” and be “equally effective.” Except in extreme cases (see <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104943"><a href="/opinion/104943/rochin-v-california/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rochin v.

<p id="b465-6">The rule of the Wolf ease that the Fourteenth Amendment does not require the exclusion of evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure was reaffirmed recently in <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="9421039"><a href="/opinion/105194/irvine-v-california/" aria-description="Citation for case: Irvine v.

California">74 S.Ct. 381</a></span>, <span class="citation no-link">98 L.Ed. 561</span>]. The decision, as in the Wolf case, was by a divided court. Justice Douglas dissented as he did in the Wolf case, and Justice Clark declared: <em>‘ ‘ </em>Had I been here in 1949 when Wolf was decided I would have applied the doctrine of <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1914), <span class="citation" data-id="98094"><a href="/opinion/98094/weeks-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Weeks v.

Thus Wolf remains the law and, as such, is entitled to the respect of this Court’s membership. . . . Perhaps strict adherence to the tenor of that decision may produce needed converts for its extinction.” Justices Frankfurter and Burton, who were among the majority in the Wolf ease, would hold that the methods employed in the Irvine case are so repulsive that evidence so obtained must be excluded as a matter of due process of law. Not only was the court closely divided, but Justice Jackson felt it appropriate to declare for the majority: “Now that the Wolf doctrine [the guarantee of the Fourth Amendment is enforceable against the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth] is known to them, state courts may wish further to reconsider their evidentiary rules. But to upset state convictions even before the states have had adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the [exclusionary] rule would be an unwarranted use of federal power.” (347 U.S. at p. 134.) Thus, after states that rely on methods other than the exclusionary rule to deter unreasonable searches and seizures have had an opportunity to reconsider their rules in the light of the Wolf doctrine, the way is left open for the United States Supreme Court to conclude that if these other methods are not “consistently enforced” and are therefore not “equally effective” (see <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado, supra, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104709"><a href="/opinion/104709/wolf-v-colorado/#31" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolf v.

<p id="b466-5">The rule admitting the evidence has been strongly supported by both scholars and judges.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> * Their arguments may be briefly summarized as follows: <page-number citation-index="1" label="443">*443</page-number>to those accused of crime. Evidence obtained by an illegal search and seizure is ordinarily just as true and reliable as evidence lawfully obtained. The court needs all reliable evidence material to the issue before it, the guilt or innocence of the accused, arid how such evidence is obtained is immaterial to that issue. It should not be excluded unless strong considerations of public policy demand it. There are no such considerations.</p>
<blockquote id="b466-6"><page-number citation-index="1" label="442">*442</page-number>The rules of evidence are designed to enable courts to reach the truth and, in criminal cases, to secure a fair trial</blockquote>
<p id="b467-6"><page-number citation-index="1" label="443">*443</page-number>Exclusion of the evidence cannot be justified as affording protection or recompense to the defendant or punishment to the officers for the illegal search and seizure. It does not protect the defendant from the search and seizure, since that illegal act has already occurred. If he is innocent or if there is ample evidence to convict him without the illegally obtained evidence, exclusion of the evidence gives him no remedy at all. Thus the only defendants who benefit by the exclusionary rule are those criminals who could not be convicted without the illegally obtained evidence. Allowing such criminals to escape punishment is not appropriate recompense for the invasion of their constitutional rights; it does not punish the officers who violated the constitutional <em>provisions; </em>and it fails to protect society from known criminals who should not be left at large. For his crime the defendant should be punished. For his violation of the constitutional provisions the offending officer should be punished. As the exclusionary rule operates, liowever, the defendant’s crime and the officer’s flouting of .constitutional guarantees both go unpunished. “The criminal is to go free because the constable has blundered” (Cardozo, J., in <em>People </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="3580565"><a href="/opinion/3599253/people-v-defore/" aria-description="Citation for case: People v.

' Instead of adding to the security of <page-number citation-index="1" label="444">*444</page-number>legitimate individual rights, its principal contribution has been to add further technicalities to the law of criminal procedure. A district attorney who is willing to pay the price may easily circumvent its limitations. And the price to be paid is by no means high. ’’ (Grant, <em>Circumventing the Fourth Amendment, </em>14 So.Cal.L.Rev. 359.) Thus, the rule as applied in the federal courts has been held to protect only defendants whose own rights have been invaded by federal officers. If the illegal search and seizure have been conducted by a state officer or a private person not acting in cooperation with federal officers, or if the property seized is not defendant’s the rule does not apply. <em>(Burdeau </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em><span class="citation" data-id="99820"><a href="/opinion/99820/burdeau-v-mcdowell/" aria-description="Citation for case: Burdeau v.

<p id="b468-5">Finally it has been pointed out that there is no convincing evidence that the exclusionary rule actually tends to prevent unreasonable searches and seizures (see Comment, 47 Nw. L.Rev. 493, <em>497; cf. </em>Allen, <em>The Wolf Case, </em>45 Ill.L.Rev. 1, 20; 42 Cal.L.Rev. 120) and that the 1 ‘ disciplinary or educational effect of the court’s releasing the defendant for police misbehavior is so indirect as to be no more than a mild deterrent <page-number citation-index="1" label="445">*445</page-number>at best.” (Jackson, J., in <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105194"><a href="/opinion/105194/irvine-v-california/#136" aria-description="Citation for case: Irvine v.

<p id="b469-8">When, as in the present case, the very purpose of an illegal search and seizure is to get evidence to introduce at a trial, the success of the lawless venture depends entirely on the court’s lending its aid by allowing the evidence to be introduced. It is no answer to say that a distinction should be drawn between the government acting as law enforcer and the gatherer of evidence and the government acting as judge. ‘ ‘ [N] o distinction can be taken between the Government as prosecutor and the Government as judge.

Out of regard for its own dignity as an agency of justice and custodian of liberty the court should not have a hand in such “dirty business.” (See <em>MacNabb </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103791"><a href="/opinion/103791/mcnabb-v-united-states/#345" aria-description="Citation for case: McNabb v.

The end that the state seeks may be a laudable one, but it no more justifies unlawful acts than a laudable end justifies unlawful action by any member of the public. Moreover, any process of law that sanctions the imposition of penalties upon an individual through the use of the fruits of official lawlessness tends to the destruction of the whole system of restraints on the exercise of the public force that are inherent in the “concept of ordered liberty.” (See Allen, <em>The Wolf Case, </em>45 Ill.L.Rev. 1, 20.) “Decency, security, and liberty alike demand that government officials shall be subjected to the same rules of conduct that are commands to the citizen. In a government of laws, existence of the government will be imperilled if it fails to observe the law scrupulously. Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example. Crime is contagious. If the Government becomes a law-breaker, it breeds contempt for law, it invites everyman to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end justifies the means—to declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal—would bring terrible retributibn. Against that pernicious doctrine this Court should resolutely set its face.” (Brandeis, J., dissenting in <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101320"><a href="/opinion/101320/olmstead-v-united-states/#485" aria-description="Citation for case: Olmstead v.

<p id="b470-5">If the unconstitutional conduct of the law enforcement officers were more flagrant or more closely connected with the conduct of the trial, it is clear that the foregoing principles would compel the reversal of any conviction based thereon. Thus, no matter how guilty a defendant might be or how <page-number citation-index="1" label="447">*447</page-number>outrageous his crime, he must not be deprived of a fair trial, and any action, official or otherwise, that would have that effect would not be tolerated. Similarly, he may not be convicted on the basis of evidence obtained by the use of the rack or the screw or other brutal means no matter how reliable the evidence obtained may be. <em>(Rochin </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104943"><a href="/opinion/104943/rochin-v-california/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rochin v.

Today one of the foremost public concerns is the police state, and recent history has demonstrated all too clearly how short the step is from lawless although efficient enforcement of the law to the stamping out of human rights. This peril has been recognized and dealt with when its challenge has been obvious; it cannot be forgotten when it strikes further from the courtroom by invading the privacy__of homes.</p>
<p id="b471-6">If the, uncbnstitutional guarantees against unreasonable searches and seizures are to have significance they must be enforced, and if courts are to discharge their duty to support the state and federal Constitutions they must be willing to aid in their enforcement. If those guarantees were being effectively enforced by other means than excluding evidence obtained by their violation, a different problem would be presented. If such were the case there would be more force to the argument that a particular criminal should not be redressed for a past violation of his rights by excluding the evidence against him. Experience has demonstrated, however, that neither administrative, criminal nor civil remedies are effective in suppressing lawless searches and seizures. The innocent suffer with the guilty, and we cannot close our eyes to the effect the rule we adopt will have on the rights of those not before the court. “Alternatives [to the exclusionary rule] are deceptive. Their very statement conveys the impression that one possibility is as effective as the next. For there is but one alternative to the rule of exclusion. That is no sanction at all.”- (Murphy, J., dissenting in <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Colorado, supra, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104709"><a href="/opinion/104709/wolf-v-colorado/#41" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolf v.

No matter what an illegal raid turns up, police are unlikely to inform on themselves or each other. If it turns up nothing incriminating, the innocent victim usually does not care to take steps which will air the fact that he has been under suspicion.” (Jackson, J., in <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105194"><a href="/opinion/105194/irvine-v-california/#137" aria-description="Citation for case: Irvine v.

Moreover, even when it becomes generally known <page-number citation-index="1" label="448">*448</page-number>that the police conduct illegal searches and seizures, public opinion is not aroused as it is in the case of other violations of constitutional rights. Illegal searches and seizures lack the obvious brutality of coerced confessions and the third degree and do not so clearly strike at the very basis of our civil liberties as do unfair trials or the lynching of even an admitted murderer. “Freedom of speech, of the press, of religion, easily summon powerful support against encroachment. The prohibition against unreasonable search and seizure is normally invoked by those accused of crime, and criminals have few friends.” (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in Harris v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104422"><a href="/opinion/104422/harris-v-united-states/#156" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v.

There is thus all the more necessity for courts to be vigilant in protecting these constitutional rights if they are to be protected at all. <em>People </em>v. <em>Mayen, </em><span class="citation" data-id="3307559"><a href="/opinion/3307673/people-v-mayen/" aria-description="Citation for case: People v.

Mayen">205 P. 435</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="3307559"><a href="/opinion/3307673/people-v-mayen/" aria-description="Citation for case: People v. Mayen">24 A.L.R. 1383</a></span>], was decided over thirty years ago. Since then case after case has appeared in our appellate reports describing unlawful searches and seizures against the defendant on trial, and those cases undoubtedly reflect only a small fraction of the violations of the constitutional provisions that have actually occurred. On the other hand, reported cases involving civil actions against police officers are rare, and those involving successful criminal prosecutions against officers are nonexistent. In short, the constitutional provisions are not being enforced.</p>
<p id="b472-5">Granted that the adoption of the exclusionary rule will not prevent all illegal searches and seizures, it will discourage them. Police officers and prosecuting officials are primarily interested in convicting criminals. Given the exclusionary rule and a choice between securing evidence by legal rather than illegal means, officers will be impelled to obey the law \themselves since not to do so will jeopardize their objectives. Moreover, the same considerations that justify the privilege against self-incrimination are not irrelevant here. As Wig-more pointed out, that privilege, just as the prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, is primarily for the protection of the innocent. “The real objection is that <em>any system, of administration which permits the prosecution to trust habitually to compulsory self-disclosure as a source of proof must itself morally suffer thereby. </em>The inclination develops to rely mainly upon such evidence, and to be satisfied with an incomplete investigation of the other sources. The exercise of the power to extract answers begets a forgetfulness of the just limitations of that power. The simple and peaceful <page-number citation-index="1" label="449">*449</page-number>process of questioning breeds a readiness to resort to bullying and to physical force and torture. If there is a right to an answer, there soon seems to be a right to the expected answer,'—that is, to a confession of guilt. Thus the legitimate use grows into the unjust abuse; ultimately, the innocent are jeopardized by the encroachments of a bad system. Such seems to have been the course of experience in those legal systems where the privilege was not recognized.” (8 Wigmore on Evidence [3d ed.] § 2251, p. 309.)  Similarly, a system that permits the prosecution to trust habitually to the use of illegally obtained evidence cannot help but encourage violations of the Constitution at the expense of lawful means of enforcing the law. (See Frankfurter, J., dissenting in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104422"><a href="/opinion/104422/harris-v-united-states/#172" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v. United States">331 U.S. 145, 172</a></span>.) On the other hand, if courts respect the constitutional provisions by refusing to sanction their violation, they will not only command the respect of law-abiding citizens for themselves adhering to the law, they will also arouse public opinion as a deterrent to lawless enforcement of the law by bringing just criticism to bear on law enforcement officers who allow criminals to escape by pursuing them in lawless ways.</p>
<p id="b473-6">It is contended, however, that the police do not always have a choice of securing evidence by legal means and that in many cases the criminal will escape if illegally obtained evidence cannot be used against him. This contention is not properly directed at the exclusionary rule, but at the constitutional provisions themselves. It was rejected when those provisions were adopted. In such cases had the Constitution been obeyed, the criminal could in no event be convicted. He does not go free because the constable blundered, but because the Constitutions prohibit securing the evidence against him. Their very provisions contemplate that it is preferable that some criminals go free than that the right of privacy of all the people be set at naught. “It is vital, no doubt, that criminals should be detected, and that all relevant evidence should be secured and used. On the other hand, it cannot be said too often that what is involved far transcends the fate of some sordid offender. Nothing less is involved than that which makes for an atmosphere of freedom as against a feeling of fear and repression for society as a whole.” (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104422"><a href="/opinion/104422/harris-v-united-states/#173" aria-description="Citation for case: Harris v. United States">331 U.S. 145, 173</a></span>.) The situation presented differs only in degree from other situations where the choice must be made between securing convictions by illegal means <page-number citation-index="1" label="450">*450</page-number>or allowing criminals to go free. Cases undoubtedly arise where a violation of the privilege against self-incrimination, a coerced confession, the testimony of defendant’s spouse, a violation of the attorney-client privilege or other privileges is essential to the conviction of the criminal, but the choice has been made that he go unpunished. Arguments against the wisdom of these rights and privileges, just as arguments against the wisdom of the prohibitions against unreasonable searches and seizures, should be addressed to the question whether they should exist at all, but arguments against the wisdom of the constitutional provisions may not be invoked to justify a failure to enforce them while they remain the law of the land.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b474-5">We are not unmindful of the contention that the federal exclusionary rule has been arbitrary in its application and has introduced needless confusion' into the law of criminal procedure. The validity of this contention need not be considered now. Even if it is assumed that it is meritorious, it does not follow that the exclusionary rule should be rejected.  In developing a rule of evidence applicable in the state courts, this court is not bound by the decisions that have applied the federal rule, and if it appears that those decisions have developed needless refinements and distinctions, this court need not follow them. Similarly, if the federal cases indicate needless limitations on the right to conduct reason<page-number citation-index="1" label="451">*451</page-number>able searches and seizures or to secure warrants, this court is free to reject them. Under these circumstances the adoption of the exclusionary rule need not introduce confusion into the law of criminal procedure. Instead it opens the door to the development of workable rules governing searches and seizures and the issuance of warrants that will protect both the rights guaranteed by the constitutional provisions and the interest of society in the suppression of crime.</p>

It is now settled that such confessions <page-number citation-index="1" label="442">*442</page-number>are excluded, not because they may lack evidential trustworthiness (“a coerced confession is inadmissible under the Due Process Clause even though statements in it may be independently established as true.” <em>Watts </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="104710"><a href="/opinion/104710/watts-v-indiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Watts v.

(See McCormick, <em>Developments in Admissibility of Confessions, </em>24 Tex.L.Rev. 239, 245.) Lawlessness of state officials in obtaining evidence is common to both coerced confessions and unreasonable searches and seizures. Illegality, alone, of the means of getting confessions cannot be the reason the Due Process Clause compels their exclusion, for consistency would demand exclusion of evidence obtained by unreasonable searches and seizures. The difference in treatment of these two problems may arise from the fact that ordinarily coerced confessions are associated with physical coercion against the defendant’s person. This element is usually not present in cases of unreasonable searches and seizures, (but see <em>Rochin </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104943"><a href="/opinion/104943/rochin-v-california/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rochin v.

California">25 A.L.R.2d 1396</a></span>]) which may involve only minor intrusions of privacy or result from good-faith mistakes of judgment on the part of police officers. There is no reason, of course, why, if the exclusionary rule is adopted, appropriate exceptions could not be developed to govern these latter situations. On the other hand, deliberate, flagrant violations of the constitutional guarantees like those in the present case and in <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105194"><a href="/opinion/105194/irvine-v-california/" aria-description="Citation for case: Irvine v.

<p id="b474-6">"Finally, I have no fear that the exclusionary rule will handicap the detection or prosecution of crime. All the arguments that have been made on that score seem to me properly directed not against the exclusionary rule but against the substantive guarantee itself. The exclusion of the evidence is the only sanction which makes the rule effective. It is the rule, not the sanction, which imposes limits on the operation of the police. If the rule is obeyed as it should be, and as we declare it should be, there will be no illegally obtained evidence to be excluded by the operation of the sanction.</p>
<p id="b474-7">"It seems to me inconsistent to challenge the exclusionary rule on the ground that it will hamper the police, while making no challenge to the fundamental rules to which the police are required to conform. If those rules, defining the scope of the search which majo-be made without a warrant and the scope of a search under a warrant are sound, there is no reason why they should be violated or why a prosecuting attorney should seek to avail himself of the fruits of their violation. If. those fundamental rules are open to challenge . . ., the burden is on those who challenge them to specify the modifications they deem to be desirable. I think that is a far better course than to object to the inclusion in this amendment of the one sanction which will give the constitutional provision, however it is defined, genuine meaning." Senator Robert F. Wagner speaking before the New York Constitutional Convention of 1938. (Record of the New York State Constitutional Convention 559-560, reprinted in Allen, <em>The Wolf Case, </em>45 Ill.L.Rev. 1, <em>19.)</em></p>
