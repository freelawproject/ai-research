 2 The facts are not in dispute.  The petitioner is a union official who, with another person, embezzled in excess of $738,000 during the years 1951 through 1954 from his employer union and from an insurance company with which the union was doing business.  3 Petitioner failed to report these amounts in his gross income in those years and was convicted for willfully attempting to evade the federal income tax due for each of the years 1951 through 1954 in violation of § 145 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 4 and § 7201 of the Internal Rev *215 enue Code of 1954.  5 He was sentenced to a total of three years’ imprisonment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  273 F. 2d 5 .  Because of a conflict with this Court’s decision in Commissioner v. Wilcox, <citedDecision>327 U. S. 404</citedDecision> , a case whose relevant facts are concededly the same as those in the case now before us, we granted certiorari.  362 U. S. 974 .  In <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> , the Court held that embezzled money does not constitute taxable income to the embezzler in the year of the embezzlement under § 22 (a) of the internal Revenue Code of 1939, Six years later, this Court held, in Rutkin v. United States, 343 U. S. 130 , that extorted money does constitute taxable income to the extortionist in the year that the money is received under § 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.  In Rutkin , the Court did not overrule <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> , but stated: “Wé do not reach in this case the factual situation involved in Commissioner v. Wilcox, <citedDecision>327 U. S. 404</citedDecision> .  We limit that case to its facts.  There embezzled funds were held not to constitute taxable income to the embezzler under § 22 (a).” Id., at 138.  6 However, examination of the reasoning used in Rutkin leads us inescapably to the conclusion that <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> was thoroughly devitalized.  The basis for the <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> decision was “that a taxable gain is conditioned upon (1) the presence of a claim of right to the alleged gain and (2) the absence of a definite, *216 unconditional obligation to repay or return that which would otherwise constitute a gain.  Without some bona fide legal or equitable claim, even though it be contingent or contested in nature, the taxpayer cannot be said to have received any gain or profit within the reach of §22 (a).” <citedDecision>Commissioner</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wilcox, supra, at p. 408</citedDecision> .  Since Wilcox embezzled the money, held it “without any semblance of a bona fide claim of right,” ibid., and therefore “was at all times under an unqualified duty and obligation to repay the money to his employer,” ibid., the Court found that the money embezzled was not includible within “gross income.” But, Rutkin’s legal claim was no greater than that of Wilcox.  It was specifically found “that petitioner had no basis for his claim .  .  .  and that he obtained it by extortion.” Rutkin v. United States, supra, at p. 135.  Both Wilcox and Rutkin obtained the money by means of a criminal act; neither had a bona fide claim of right to the funds.

 The victim of an extortion, like the victim of an embezzlement, has a right to restitution.  Furthermore, it is inconsequential that an embezzler may lack title to the sums he appropriates while an extortionist may gain a voidable title.  Questions of federal income taxation are not determined by .such “attenuated subtleties.” Lucas v. Earl, 281 U. S. 111, 114 ; Corliss v. *217 Bowers, 281 U. S. 376, 378 .  Thus, the fact that Rutkin secured the money with the consent of his victim, Rutkin v. United States, supra, at p. 138, is irrelevant.  Likewise unimportant is the fact that the sufferer of an extortion is less likely to seek restitution than one whose funds are embezzled.  What is important is that the right to recoupment exists in both situations.  Examination of the relevant cases in the courts of appeals lends credence to our conclusion that the <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> rationale was effectively vitiated by this Court’s decision in Rutkin, 8 Although this case appears to be the first to arise that is “on all fours” with <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> , the lower federal courts, in deference to the undisturbed <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> holding, have earnestly endeavored to find distinguishing facts in the cases before them which would enable them to include sundry unlawful gains within “gross income.” 9 *218 It had been a well-established principle, long before either Rutkin or <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> , that unlawful, as well as lawful, gains are comprehended within the term “gross income.” Section II B of the Income Tax Act of 1913 provided that “the net income of a taxable person shall include gains, profits, and income .  .  .  from ... the transaction of any lawful business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever .  .  .  .” (Emphasis supplied.)

 Under these broad principles, we believe that petitioner’s contention, that all unlawful gains are taxable except those resulting from embezzlement, should fail.  When a taxpayer acquires earnings, lawfully or unlawfully, without the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay and without restriction as to their disposition, “he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the, money, and even though he may still be adjudged hable to restore its equivalent.” North American Oil v. Burnet, supra, at p. 424.  In such case, the taxpayer has “actual command over the property taxed — the actual benefit for which the tax is paid,” Corliss v. Bowers, supra. This standard brings wrongful appropriations within the broad sweep of “gross income”; it excludes loans.  When a law-abiding taxpayer mistakenly receives income in one year, which receipt is assailed and found to be invalid in a subsequent *220 year, the taxpayer must nonetheless report the amount as “gross income” in the year received.  United States v. Lewis, supra; Healy v. Commissioner, supra. We do not believe that Congress intended to treat a law-breaking taxpayer differently.  Just as the honest taxpayer may deduct any amount repaid in the year in which the repayment is made, the Government points out that, “If, when, and to the extent that the victim recovers back the misappropriated funds, there is of course a reduction in the embezzler’s income.” Brief for the United States, p. 24.  10 Petitioner contends that the <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> rule has been in existence since 1946; that if Congress had intended to change the rule, it would have done so; that there was a general revision of the income tax laws in 1954 without mention of the rule; that a bill to change it 11 was introduced in the Eighty-sixth Congress but was not acted upon; that, therefore, we may not change the rule now.  But the fact that Congress has remained silent or has re-enacted a statute which we have construed, or that congressional attempts to amend a rule announced by this Court have failed, does not necessarily debar us from re-examining and correcting the Court’s own errors.  Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 69-70 ; Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119-122 .  There may have been any number of reasons why Congress acted as it did.  Helvering v. Hallock, supra. One of the reasons could well *221 be our subsequent decision in Rutkin which has been thought by many to have repudiated <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> .  Particularly might this be true in light of the decisions of the Courts of Appeals which have been riding a narrow rail between the two cases and further distinguishing them to the disparagement of <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> .  See notes 8 and 9, supra. We believe that <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> was wrongly decided and we find nothing in congressional history since then to persuade us that Congress intended to legislate the rule.  Thus, we believe that we should now correct the error and the confusion resulting from it, certainly if we do so in a manner that will not prejudice those who might have relied on it.  Cf. Helvering v. Hallock, supra, at 119 .  We should not continue to confound confusion, particularly when the result would be to perpetuate the injustice of relieving embezzlers of the duty of paying income taxes on the money they enrich themselves with through theft while honest people pay their taxes on every conceivable type of income.  But, we are dealing here with a felony conviction under statutes which apply to any person who “willfully” fails to account for his tax or who “willfully” attempts to evade his obligation.  In Spies v. United States, 317 U. S. 492, 499 , the Court said that § 145 (b) of the 1939 Code embodied “the gravest of offenses against the revenues,” and stated that willfulness must therefore include an evil motive and want of justification in view of all the circumstances.  Id., at 498.  Willfulness “involves a specific intent which must be proven by independent evidence and which cannot be inferred from the mere understatement of income.” Holland v. United States, 348 U. S. 121, 139 .  We believe that the element of willfulness could not be proven in a criminal prosecution for failing to include embezzled funds in gross income in the year of misappropriation so long as the statute contained the gloss placed upon it by <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> at the time the alleged crime was *222 committed.  Therefore, we feel that petitioner’s conviction may not stand and that the indictment against him must be dismissed.  Since Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Frank- ' eurter, and Mr. Justice Clark agree with us concerning <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> , that case is overruled.  Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice ' Douglas, and Mr. Justice Whittaker believe that petitioner’s conviction must be reversed and the case dismissed for the reasons stated in their opinions.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the indictment.  It is so ordered.  § 22.  Gross Income.  “(a) General Definition.

Petitioner has pleaded guilty to the offense of conspiracy to embezzle in the-Court of Essex County, New Jersey.  § 145.  Penalties.  “ (b) Failure to Collect and Pay Over Tax, or Attempt to Defeat or Evade Tax. — Any person required under this chapter to collect, account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this chapter, who willfully fails to collect or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, and any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this chapter or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than five years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.” (26 U. S. C. (1952 ed.) § 145 (b).) § 7201.  Attempt to Evade or Defeat Tax. “Any person who willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any tax imposed by this title or the payment thereof shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a felony and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not more than HOjOOO, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both, together with the costs of prosecution.” (26 U, S. C. § 7201.) The dissenters in Rutkin stated that the Court had rejected the <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> interpretation of § 22 (a).  Id., at 140.  The Government contends that the adoption in <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> of a claim of right test as a touchstone of taxability had no support in the prior cases of this Court; that the claim of right test was a doctrine invoked by the Court in aid of the concept of annual accounting, to determine when, not whether, receipts constituted income.  See North American Oil v. Burnet, 286 U. S. 417 ; United States v. Lewis, 340 U. S. 590 ; Nealy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 .  In view of our reasoning set forth below, we need not pass on this contention.  The use to which we put the claim of right test here is only to demonstrate that, whatever its validity as a test of whether certain receipts constitute income, it calls for no distinction between <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> and Rutkin .  In Marienfeld v. United States, 214 F. 2d 632 , the Eighth Circuit stated, “We find it difficult to reconcile the Wilcox case with the later opinion of the Supreme Court in Rutkin .  .  .  .” Id., at 636 .  The Second Circuit announced, in United States v. Bruswitz, 219 F. 2d 59 , “It is difficult to perceive what, if anything, is left of the Wilcox holding after Rutkin ....’’ Id., at 61 .  The Seventh Circuit’s prior decision in Macias v. Commissioner, 255 F. 2d 23 , observed, “If this reasoning [of Rutkin] had been employed in Wilcox, we see no escape from the conclusion that the decision in that case would have been different.

 .  .  .” It has long been settled that Congress’ broad statutory definitions of taxable income were intended' “to use the full measure of [the Sixteenth Amendment’s] taxing power.” Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U. S. 331, 334 ; Douglas v. Willcuts, 296 U. S. 1, 9 .  Equally well settled is the principle that the Sixteenth Amendment “is to be taken as written and is not to be extended beyond the meaning clearly indicated by the language used.” Edwards v. Cuba R. Co., 268 U. S. 628, 631 .  1 The language of the Sixteenth Amendment, as well as our prior controlling decisions, *249 compels me to conclude that the question now before us— whether an embezzler receives taxable income at the time of his unlawful taking — must be answered negatively.  Since the prevailing opinion reaches an opposite conclusion, I must respectfully dissent from that holding, although I concur in the Court’s judgment reversing petitioner’s conviction.  I am convinced that Commissioner v. Wilcox, <citedDecision>327 U. S. 404</citedDecision> , which is today overruled, was correctly decided on the basis of every controlling principle used in defining taxable income since the Sixteenth Amendment’s adoption.  The Chief Justice’s opinion, although it correctly recites Wilcox’s holding that “embezzled money does not constitute taxable income to the embezzler in the year of the embezzlement” (emphasis added), fails to explain or to answer the true basis of that holding.  <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> did not hold that embezzled funds may never constitute taxable income to the embezzler.  To the contrary, it expressly recognized that an embezzler may realize a taxable gain to the full extent of the amount taken, if and when it ever becomes his.  The applicable test of taxable income, i.  e., the “presence of a claim of right to the alleged gain,” of which <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> spoke, was but a correlative statement of the factor upon which the decision placed its whole emphasis throughout, namely, the “absence of a definite, unconditional obligation to repay or return [the money].” <citedDecision>327 U. S., at 408</citedDecision> .  In holding that this test was not met at the time of the embezzlement, the <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> opinion repeatedly stressed that the embezzler had no “bona fide legal or equitable claim” to the embezzled funds, ibid.; that the victim never “condoned or forgave the taking of the money and still holds him liable to restore it,” <citedDecision>id., at 406</citedDecision> ; and that the “debtor-creditor relationship was definite and unconditional.” <citedDecision>Id., at 409</citedDecision> .  These statements all express the same basic fact — the fact which is emphasized most strongly in the opinion’s conclusion explaining *250 why the embezzler had not yet received taxable income: “Sanctioning a tax under the circumstances before us would serve only to give the United States an unjustified preference as to part of the money which rightfully and completely belongs to the taxpayer’s employer.” Id., at 410.  (Emphasis added.) However, <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> plainly stated that “if the unconditional indebtedness is cancelled or retired, taxable income may adhere, under certain circumstances, to the taxpayer.” <citedDecision>327 U. S., at 408</citedDecision> .  More specifically,.it recognized that had the embezzler’s victim “condoned or forgiven any part of the [indebtedness], the [embezzler] might have been subject to tax liability to that extent,” <citedDecision>id., at 410</citedDecision> , i.  e., in the tax year of such forgiveness.  These statements reflect an understanding of, and regard for, substantive tax law concepts solidly entrenched in our prior decisions.  Since our landmark case of United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., 284 U. S. 1 , it has been settled that, upon a discharge of indebtedness by an event other than full repayment, the debtor realizes a taxable gain in the year of discharge to the extent of the indebtedness thus extinguished.  Such gains are commonly referred to as ones realized through “bargain cancellations” of indebtedness, and it was in this area, and indeed, in Kirby Lumber Co. itself, that the “accession” theory or “economic gain” concept of taxable income, upon which The Chief Justice’s opinion today mistakenly, relies, found its genesis.  In that case, the taxpayer, a corporation, had reduced a portion of its debt, with a corresponding gain in assets, by purchasing its bonds in the open market at considerably less than their issue price.  Mr. Justice Holmes, who wrote the Court’s opinion, found it unnecessary to state the elementary principle that, so long as the bonds remained a fully enforceable debt obligation of the taxpayer, there could be no taxable gain.  However, when the taxpayer retired the debt by purchasing *251 the bonds for less than their face, value, it “made a clear [taxable] gain” and “realized within the year an accession to income” in the amount of its bargain.  284 U. S., at 3 .  This doctrine has since been reaffirmed and strengthened by us, see, e. g., Helvering v. American Chicle Co., 291 U. S. 426 ; Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U. S. 28 , and by the lower federal courts in numerous decisions involving a variety of “bargain cancellations” of indebtedness, as by a creditor’s release condoning or forgiving the indebtedness in whole or in part, 2 or by the running of a Statute of Limitations barring the legal enforceability of the obligation.  3 In none of these cases has it been suggested that a taxable gain might be realized by the debtor at any time prior to the effective date of discharge, and as <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> recognized, there is no rational basis on which to justify such a rule where the debt arises through embezzlement.  An embezzler, like a common thief, acquires not a semblance of right, title, or interest in his plunder, and whether he spends it or not, he is indebted to his victim in the full amount taken as surely as if he had left a signed promissory note at the scene of the crime.  Of no consequence from any standpoint is the absence of such formalities as (in the words of the prevailing opinion) “the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay.” The law readily implies whatever “consensual recognition” is needed for the rightful owner to assert an immediately ripe and enforceable obligation of *252 repayment against the wrongful taker.  These principles are not “attenuated subtleties” but are among the clearest and most easily applied rules of our law. They exist to protect the rights of the innocent victim, and we should accord them full recognition and respect.  The fact that an embezzler’s victim may have less chance of success than other creditors in seeking repayment from his debtor is not a valid reason for us further to diminish his prospects by adopting a rule that would allow the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assert and enforce a prior federal tax lien against that which “rightfully and completely belongs” to the victim.  Commissioner v. <citedDecision>Wilcox, supra, at 410</citedDecision> .  The Chief Justice’s opinion quite understandably expresses much concern for “honest taxpayers,” but it attempts neither to deny nor justify the manifest injury that its holding will inflict on those honest taxpayers, victimized by embezzlers, who will find their claims for recovery subordinated to federal tax liens.  Statutory provisions, by which we are bound, clearly and unequivocally accord priority to federal tax liens over the claims of others, including “judgment creditors.” 4 *253 However, if it later happens that the debtor-creditor relationship between the embezzler and his victim is discharged by something other than full repayment, such as-by the running of a Statute of Limitations against the victim’s claim, or by a release given for less than the full amount owed, the embezzler at that time, but not before, will have made a clear taxable gain and realized “an accession to income” which he will be required under full penalty of the law to report in his federal income tax return for that year.  No honest taxpayer could be harmed by this rule.  The inherent soundness of this rule could not be more clearly demonstrated than as applied to the facts of the case before us.  Petitioner, a labor union official, concededly embezzled sums totaling more than $738,000 from the union’s funds, over a period extending from 1951 to 1954.  When the shortages were discovered in 1956, the union at once filed civil actions against petitioner to compel repayment.

 U. S. 417, is the case which introduced the principle since used to facilitate uniformity and certainty in annual tax accounting procedure, i.  e., that a taxpayer must report in gross income, in the year in which received, money or property acquired under a ''claim of right” — a colorable claim of the right to exclusive possession of the money or property.  Thus, in its complete form, the sentence in North American Oil from which the above-quoted fragment was extracted reads: “If a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without *257 restriction as to its [sic] disposition, he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.” Id., at 424.  (Emphasis added.) But embezzled funds, like stolen property generally, are not “earnings” in any sense and are held without a vestige of a colorable claim of right; they constitute the principal of a debt.  Of no significance whatever is the formality of “consensual recognition, express or implied” of an obligation to repay.  By substituting this meaningless abstraction in place of the omitted portion of the North American Oil test of when a receipt constitutes taxable income, the prevailing opinion today goes far beyond overruling <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> — it reduces a substantial body of tax law into uncertainty and confusion.  The above-cited case of United States v. Lewis, 340 U. S. 590 , decided 19 years after North American Oil, demonstrates the truth of this.  For there we said: “The ‘claim of right’ interpretation of the tax laws has long been used to give finality to [the accounting] period, and is now deeply rooted in the federal tax system.  .  .  .  We see no reason why the Court should depart from this well-settled interpretation merely because it results in an advantage or disadvantage to a taxpayer.” 340 U. S., at 592 .  The same principle was reiterated and applied in Healy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 .  The supposed conflict between <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> and Rutkin, upon which The Chief Justice’s opinion seeks to justify its repudiation of Wilcox, 7 has been adequately treated in *258 the opinion of Mr. Justice Black, and I agree with him that those cases were fully intended to be, and are, reconcilable, both on their controlling facts and applicable law. If the unnecessarily broad language used in the Rutkin opinion has misled any of the lower federal courts in their understanding of the principles underlying <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> , we should clarify their understanding at this time, and continue our adherence to “a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 .  “A proper regard for its genesis, as well as its very clear language, requires also that [the Sixteenth] Amendment shall not be extended by loose construction .... Congress cannot by any definition [of income] it may adopt conclude the matter, since it cannot by legislation alter the Constitution, from which alone it derives its power to legislate, and within whose limitations alone that power can be lawfully exercised.” Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 206 .  See, e. g., Spear Box Co. v. Commissioner, 182 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Helvering v. Jane Holding Corp., 109 F. 2d 933 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Pacific Magnesium, Inc., v. Westover, 86 F. Supp. 644 (D. C. S. D. Cal.).  See, e. g., Schweppe v. Commissioner, 168 F. 2d 284 (C. A. 9th Cir.); North American Coal Corp. v. Commissioner, 97 F. 2d 325 (C.

S. §3466 (1876), now codified in 31 U. S. C. § 191 , pertaining to state insolvency proceedings against debtors, commands that “the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.” We long ago established that the term “debts” in this statute' includes delinquent federal taxes.

Peelle, 159 F. Supp. 45 (D. C. E. D. N. Y., 1958).  There the Government sought to enforce liens for federal income taxes claimed to be due on items of “income” aggregating *258 $678,461.22, which the taxpayer had embezzled from his corporate employer during the years 1945 through 1949.  The items in question consisted of customers’ payments intended for the corporation, and had been embezzled by the taxpayer and kept by him in secret bank accounts.  In 1951 and 1952, he discharged his indebtedness by making full restitution of the embezzled funds to the corporation.  The corporation, which used the accrual method of accounting, paid deficiencies which the Government determined in its 1945-1949 income tax returns, based on its accrued right to receive the embezzled customers’ payments in those years.  Not satisfied with this, the Government took the position that the payments were taxable twice during the same years — once to the corporation when it accrued the right to receive them, and again to the embezzler when he diverted them into the secret bank accounts.  Had this effort at double taxation succeeded, the Government’s combined tax claims would have been far in excess of the amount being taxed.  In rejecting the Government’s argument that the embezzler received taxable income at the time of the embezzlements, the District Court relied wholly upon the decision which the Court today overrules, Commissioner v. <citedDecision>Wilcox, supra.</citedDecision>

More specifically,.it recognized that had the embezzler’s victim “condoned or forgiven any part of the [indebtedness], the [embezzler] might have been subject to tax liability to that extent,” <citedDecision>id., at 410</citedDecision> , i.  e., in the tax year of such forgiveness.  These statements reflect an understanding of, and regard for, substantive tax law concepts solidly entrenched in our prior decisions.  Since our landmark case of United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., 284 U. S. 1 , it has been settled that, upon a discharge of indebtedness by an event other than full repayment, the debtor realizes a taxable gain in the year of discharge to the extent of the indebtedness thus extinguished.  Such gains are commonly referred to as ones realized through “bargain cancellations” of indebtedness, and it was in this area, and indeed, in Kirby Lumber Co. itself, that the “accession” theory or “economic gain” concept of taxable income, upon which The Chief Justice’s opinion today mistakenly, relies, found its genesis.  In that case, the taxpayer, a corporation, had reduced a portion of its debt, with a corresponding gain in assets, by purchasing its bonds in the open market at considerably less than their issue price.  Mr. Justice Holmes, who wrote the Court’s opinion, found it unnecessary to state the elementary principle that, so long as the bonds remained a fully enforceable debt obligation of the taxpayer, there could be no taxable gain.  However, when the taxpayer retired the debt by purchasing *251 the bonds for less than their face, value, it “made a clear [taxable] gain” and “realized within the year an accession to income” in the amount of its bargain.  284 U. S., at 3 .  This doctrine has since been reaffirmed and strengthened by us, see, e. g., Helvering v. American Chicle Co., 291 U. S. 426 ; Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U. S. 28 , and by the lower federal courts in numerous decisions involving a variety of “bargain cancellations” of indebtedness, as by a creditor’s release condoning or forgiving the indebtedness in whole or in part, 2 or by the running of a Statute of Limitations barring the legal enforceability of the obligation.  3 In none of these cases has it been suggested that a taxable gain might be realized by the debtor at any time prior to the effective date of discharge, and as <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> recognized, there is no rational basis on which to justify such a rule where the debt arises through embezzlement.  An embezzler, like a common thief, acquires not a semblance of right, title, or interest in his plunder, and whether he spends it or not, he is indebted to his victim in the full amount taken as surely as if he had left a signed promissory note at the scene of the crime.  Of no consequence from any standpoint is the absence of such formalities as (in the words of the prevailing opinion) “the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay.” The law readily implies whatever “consensual recognition” is needed for the rightful owner to assert an immediately ripe and enforceable obligation of *252 repayment against the wrongful taker.  These principles are not “attenuated subtleties” but are among the clearest and most easily applied rules of our law. They exist to protect the rights of the innocent victim, and we should accord them full recognition and respect.  The fact that an embezzler’s victim may have less chance of success than other creditors in seeking repayment from his debtor is not a valid reason for us further to diminish his prospects by adopting a rule that would allow the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assert and enforce a prior federal tax lien against that which “rightfully and completely belongs” to the victim.  Commissioner v. <citedDecision>Wilcox, supra, at 410</citedDecision> .  The Chief Justice’s opinion quite understandably expresses much concern for “honest taxpayers,” but it attempts neither to deny nor justify the manifest injury that its holding will inflict on those honest taxpayers, victimized by embezzlers, who will find their claims for recovery subordinated to federal tax liens.  Statutory provisions, by which we are bound, clearly and unequivocally accord priority to federal tax liens over the claims of others, including “judgment creditors.” 4 *253 However, if it later happens that the debtor-creditor relationship between the embezzler and his victim is discharged by something other than full repayment, such as-by the running of a Statute of Limitations against the victim’s claim, or by a release given for less than the full amount owed, the embezzler at that time, but not before, will have made a clear taxable gain and realized “an accession to income” which he will be required under full penalty of the law to report in his federal income tax return for that year.  No honest taxpayer could be harmed by this rule.  The inherent soundness of this rule could not be more clearly demonstrated than as applied to the facts of the case before us.  Petitioner, a labor union official, concededly embezzled sums totaling more than $738,000 from the union’s funds, over a period extending from 1951 to 1954.  When the shortages were discovered in 1956, the union at once filed civil actions against petitioner to compel repayment.

 U. S. 417, is the case which introduced the principle since used to facilitate uniformity and certainty in annual tax accounting procedure, i.  e., that a taxpayer must report in gross income, in the year in which received, money or property acquired under a ''claim of right” — a colorable claim of the right to exclusive possession of the money or property.  Thus, in its complete form, the sentence in North American Oil from which the above-quoted fragment was extracted reads: “If a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without *257 restriction as to its [sic] disposition, he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.” Id., at 424.  (Emphasis added.) But embezzled funds, like stolen property generally, are not “earnings” in any sense and are held without a vestige of a colorable claim of right; they constitute the principal of a debt.  Of no significance whatever is the formality of “consensual recognition, express or implied” of an obligation to repay.  By substituting this meaningless abstraction in place of the omitted portion of the North American Oil test of when a receipt constitutes taxable income, the prevailing opinion today goes far beyond overruling <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> — it reduces a substantial body of tax law into uncertainty and confusion.  The above-cited case of United States v. Lewis, 340 U. S. 590 , decided 19 years after North American Oil, demonstrates the truth of this.  For there we said: “The ‘claim of right’ interpretation of the tax laws has long been used to give finality to [the accounting] period, and is now deeply rooted in the federal tax system.  .  .  .  We see no reason why the Court should depart from this well-settled interpretation merely because it results in an advantage or disadvantage to a taxpayer.” 340 U. S., at 592 .  The same principle was reiterated and applied in Healy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 .  The supposed conflict between <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> and Rutkin, upon which The Chief Justice’s opinion seeks to justify its repudiation of Wilcox, 7 has been adequately treated in *258 the opinion of Mr. Justice Black, and I agree with him that those cases were fully intended to be, and are, reconcilable, both on their controlling facts and applicable law. If the unnecessarily broad language used in the Rutkin opinion has misled any of the lower federal courts in their understanding of the principles underlying <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> , we should clarify their understanding at this time, and continue our adherence to “a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 .  “A proper regard for its genesis, as well as its very clear language, requires also that [the Sixteenth] Amendment shall not be extended by loose construction .... Congress cannot by any definition [of income] it may adopt conclude the matter, since it cannot by legislation alter the Constitution, from which alone it derives its power to legislate, and within whose limitations alone that power can be lawfully exercised.” Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 206 .  See, e. g., Spear Box Co. v. Commissioner, 182 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Helvering v. Jane Holding Corp., 109 F. 2d 933 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Pacific Magnesium, Inc., v.

S. §3466 (1876), now codified in 31 U. S. C. § 191 , pertaining to state insolvency proceedings against debtors, commands that “the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.” We long ago established that the term “debts” in this statute' includes delinquent federal taxes.

Peelle, 159 F. Supp. 45 (D. C. E. D. N. Y., 1958).  There the Government sought to enforce liens for federal income taxes claimed to be due on items of “income” aggregating *258 $678,461.22, which the taxpayer had embezzled from his corporate employer during the years 1945 through 1949.  The items in question consisted of customers’ payments intended for the corporation, and had been embezzled by the taxpayer and kept by him in secret bank accounts.  In 1951 and 1952, he discharged his indebtedness by making full restitution of the embezzled funds to the corporation.  The corporation, which used the accrual method of accounting, paid deficiencies which the Government determined in its 1945-1949 income tax returns, based on its accrued right to receive the embezzled customers’ payments in those years.  Not satisfied with this, the Government took the position that the payments were taxable twice during the same years — once to the corporation when it accrued the right to receive them, and again to the embezzler when he diverted them into the secret bank accounts.  Had this effort at double taxation succeeded, the Government’s combined tax claims would have been far in excess of the amount being taxed.  In rejecting the Government’s argument that the embezzler received taxable income at the time of the embezzlements, the District Court relied wholly upon the decision which the Court today overrules, Commissioner v. <citedDecision>Wilcox, supra.</citedDecision>

 .  .  .” It has long been settled that Congress’ broad statutory definitions of taxable income were intended' “to use the full measure of [the Sixteenth Amendment’s] taxing power.” Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U. S. 331, 334 ; Douglas v. Willcuts, 296 U. S. 1, 9 .  Equally well settled is the principle that the Sixteenth Amendment “is to be taken as written and is not to be extended beyond the meaning clearly indicated by the language used.” Edwards v. Cuba R. Co., 268 U. S. 628, 631 .  1 The language of the Sixteenth Amendment, as well as our prior controlling decisions, *249 compels me to conclude that the question now before us— whether an embezzler receives taxable income at the time of his unlawful taking — must be answered negatively.  Since the prevailing opinion reaches an opposite conclusion, I must respectfully dissent from that holding, although I concur in the Court’s judgment reversing petitioner’s conviction.  I am convinced that Commissioner v. Wilcox, <citedDecision>327 U. S. 404</citedDecision> , which is today overruled, was correctly decided on the basis of every controlling principle used in defining taxable income since the Sixteenth Amendment’s adoption.  The Chief Justice’s opinion, although it correctly recites Wilcox’s holding that “embezzled money does not constitute taxable income to the embezzler in the year of the embezzlement” (emphasis added), fails to explain or to answer the true basis of that holding.  <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> did not hold that embezzled funds may never constitute taxable income to the embezzler.  To the contrary, it expressly recognized that an embezzler may realize a taxable gain to the full extent of the amount taken, if and when it ever becomes his.  The applicable test of taxable income, i.  e., the “presence of a claim of right to the alleged gain,” of which <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> spoke, was but a correlative statement of the factor upon which the decision placed its whole emphasis throughout, namely, the “absence of a definite, unconditional obligation to repay or return [the money].” <citedDecision>327 U. S., at 408</citedDecision> .  In holding that this test was not met at the time of the embezzlement, the <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> opinion repeatedly stressed that the embezzler had no “bona fide legal or equitable claim” to the embezzled funds, ibid.; that the victim never “condoned or forgave the taking of the money and still holds him liable to restore it,” <citedDecision>id., at 406</citedDecision> ; and that the “debtor-creditor relationship was definite and unconditional.” <citedDecision>Id., at 409</citedDecision> .  These statements all express the same basic fact — the fact which is emphasized most strongly in the opinion’s conclusion explaining *250 why the embezzler had not yet received taxable income: “Sanctioning a tax under the circumstances before us would serve only to give the United States an unjustified preference as to part of the money which rightfully and completely belongs to the taxpayer’s employer.” Id., at 410.

Mr. Justice Holmes, who wrote the Court’s opinion, found it unnecessary to state the elementary principle that, so long as the bonds remained a fully enforceable debt obligation of the taxpayer, there could be no taxable gain.  However, when the taxpayer retired the debt by purchasing *251 the bonds for less than their face, value, it “made a clear [taxable] gain” and “realized within the year an accession to income” in the amount of its bargain.  284 U. S., at 3 .  This doctrine has since been reaffirmed and strengthened by us, see, e. g., Helvering v. American Chicle Co., 291 U. S. 426 ; Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U. S. 28 , and by the lower federal courts in numerous decisions involving a variety of “bargain cancellations” of indebtedness, as by a creditor’s release condoning or forgiving the indebtedness in whole or in part, 2 or by the running of a Statute of Limitations barring the legal enforceability of the obligation.  3 In none of these cases has it been suggested that a taxable gain might be realized by the debtor at any time prior to the effective date of discharge, and as <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> recognized, there is no rational basis on which to justify such a rule where the debt arises through embezzlement.  An embezzler, like a common thief, acquires not a semblance of right, title, or interest in his plunder, and whether he spends it or not, he is indebted to his victim in the full amount taken as surely as if he had left a signed promissory note at the scene of the crime.  Of no consequence from any standpoint is the absence of such formalities as (in the words of the prevailing opinion) “the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay.” The law readily implies whatever “consensual recognition” is needed for the rightful owner to assert an immediately ripe and enforceable obligation of *252 repayment against the wrongful taker.  These principles are not “attenuated subtleties” but are among the clearest and most easily applied rules of our law. They exist to protect the rights of the innocent victim, and we should accord them full recognition and respect.  The fact that an embezzler’s victim may have less chance of success than other creditors in seeking repayment from his debtor is not a valid reason for us further to diminish his prospects by adopting a rule that would allow the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assert and enforce a prior federal tax lien against that which “rightfully and completely belongs” to the victim.  Commissioner v. <citedDecision>Wilcox, supra, at 410</citedDecision> .  The Chief Justice’s opinion quite understandably expresses much concern for “honest taxpayers,” but it attempts neither to deny nor justify the manifest injury that its holding will inflict on those honest taxpayers, victimized by embezzlers, who will find their claims for recovery subordinated to federal tax liens.  Statutory provisions, by which we are bound, clearly and unequivocally accord priority to federal tax liens over the claims of others, including “judgment creditors.” 4 *253 However, if it later happens that the debtor-creditor relationship between the embezzler and his victim is discharged by something other than full repayment, such as-by the running of a Statute of Limitations against the victim’s claim, or by a release given for less than the full amount owed, the embezzler at that time, but not before, will have made a clear taxable gain and realized “an accession to income” which he will be required under full penalty of the law to report in his federal income tax return for that year.  No honest taxpayer could be harmed by this rule.  The inherent soundness of this rule could not be more clearly demonstrated than as applied to the facts of the case before us.  Petitioner, a labor union official, concededly embezzled sums totaling more than $738,000 from the union’s funds, over a period extending from 1951 to 1954.  When the shortages were discovered in 1956, the union at once filed civil actions against petitioner to compel repayment.

 U. S. 417, is the case which introduced the principle since used to facilitate uniformity and certainty in annual tax accounting procedure, i.  e., that a taxpayer must report in gross income, in the year in which received, money or property acquired under a ''claim of right” — a colorable claim of the right to exclusive possession of the money or property.  Thus, in its complete form, the sentence in North American Oil from which the above-quoted fragment was extracted reads: “If a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without *257 restriction as to its [sic] disposition, he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.” Id., at 424.  (Emphasis added.) But embezzled funds, like stolen property generally, are not “earnings” in any sense and are held without a vestige of a colorable claim of right; they constitute the principal of a debt.  Of no significance whatever is the formality of “consensual recognition, express or implied” of an obligation to repay.  By substituting this meaningless abstraction in place of the omitted portion of the North American Oil test of when a receipt constitutes taxable income, the prevailing opinion today goes far beyond overruling <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> — it reduces a substantial body of tax law into uncertainty and confusion.  The above-cited case of United States v. Lewis, 340 U. S. 590 , decided 19 years after North American Oil, demonstrates the truth of this.  For there we said: “The ‘claim of right’ interpretation of the tax laws has long been used to give finality to [the accounting] period, and is now deeply rooted in the federal tax system.  .  .  .  We see no reason why the Court should depart from this well-settled interpretation merely because it results in an advantage or disadvantage to a taxpayer.” 340 U. S., at 592 .  The same principle was reiterated and applied in Healy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 .  The supposed conflict between <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> and Rutkin, upon which The Chief Justice’s opinion seeks to justify its repudiation of Wilcox, 7 has been adequately treated in *258 the opinion of Mr. Justice Black, and I agree with him that those cases were fully intended to be, and are, reconcilable, both on their controlling facts and applicable law. If the unnecessarily broad language used in the Rutkin opinion has misled any of the lower federal courts in their understanding of the principles underlying <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> , we should clarify their understanding at this time, and continue our adherence to “a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 .  “A proper regard for its genesis, as well as its very clear language, requires also that [the Sixteenth] Amendment shall not be extended by loose construction .... Congress cannot by any definition [of income] it may adopt conclude the matter, since it cannot by legislation alter the Constitution, from which alone it derives its power to legislate, and within whose limitations alone that power can be lawfully exercised.” Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 206 .  See, e. g., Spear Box Co. v. Commissioner, 182 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Helvering v. Jane Holding Corp., 109 F. 2d 933 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Pacific Magnesium, Inc., v. Westover, 86 F. Supp. 644 (D. C. S. D. Cal.).  See, e. g., Schweppe v. Commissioner, 168 F. 2d 284 (C. A. 9th Cir.); North American Coal Corp. v. Commissioner, 97 F. 2d 325 (C. A. 6th Cir.); Securities Co. v. United States, 85 F. Supp. 532 (D. C. S. D. N.Y.).  26 U. S. C. §§ 6321-6323 , 6331; Bankruptcy Act, § 64 (a), 11 U. S. C. § 104 (a).  Moreover, R. S. §3466 (1876), now codified in 31 U. S. C. § 191 , pertaining to state insolvency proceedings against debtors, commands that “the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.” We long ago established that the term “debts” in this statute' includes delinquent federal taxes.

 See Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, § 12.103, note 67; id., §§ 54.10-54.56.  See cases cited in Rutkin v. United States, 343 U. S. 130, 137, note 8 .  See also United States v.

Patterson, Essentials of Insurance Law (2d ed. 1957), § 43, at 186.  I cannot agree with The Chief Justice's assertion that <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> has been “thoroughly devitalized” by Rutkin .  See, e. g., the recent case of United States v. Peelle, 159 F. Supp. 45 (D. C. E. D. N. Y., 1958).  There the Government sought to enforce liens for federal income taxes claimed to be due on items of “income” aggregating *258 $678,461.22, which the taxpayer had embezzled from his corporate employer during the years 1945 through 1949.  The items in question consisted of customers’ payments intended for the corporation, and had been embezzled by the taxpayer and kept by him in secret bank accounts.  In 1951 and 1952, he discharged his indebtedness by making full restitution of the embezzled funds to the corporation.  The corporation, which used the accrual method of accounting, paid deficiencies which the Government determined in its 1945-1949 income tax returns, based on its accrued right to receive the embezzled customers’ payments in those years.  Not satisfied with this, the Government took the position that the payments were taxable twice during the same years — once to the corporation when it accrued the right to receive them, and again to the embezzler when he diverted them into the secret bank accounts.  Had this effort at double taxation succeeded, the Government’s combined tax claims would have been far in excess of the amount being taxed.  In rejecting the Government’s argument that the embezzler received taxable income at the time of the embezzlements, the District Court relied wholly upon the decision which the Court today overrules, Commissioner v. <citedDecision>Wilcox, supra.</citedDecision>
