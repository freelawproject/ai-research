IV, ยง 1 and the Act of May 26, 1790 require that "not some, but full" faith and credit be given judgments of a state court. Davis v. Davis, 305 U.S. 32 , 40. Thus, even though the cause of action could not be entertained in the state of the forum, either because it had been barred by the local statute of limitations or contravened local policy, the judgment thereon obtained in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit. See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290 ; Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra ; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 252 U.S. 411 ; Titus v. Wallick, 306 U.S. 282 , 291. Some exceptions have been engrafted on the rule laid down by Chief Justice Marshall. But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U.S. 629 , 642, "the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one." So far as judgments are concerned, the decisions, [5] as distinguished from dicta, [6] show that the *295 actual exceptions have been few and far between, apart from Haddock v. Haddock . For this Court has been reluctant to admit exceptions in case of judgments rendered by the courts of a sister state, since the "very purpose" of Art. IV, ยง 1 was "to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation." Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, pp. 276-277. This Court, to be sure, has recognized that in case of statutes, "the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed," some "accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states" is necessary.

But where a state adopts, as it has the power to do, a less strict rule, it is quite another thing to say that its decrees affecting the marital status of its domiciliaries are not entitled to full faith and credit in sister states. Certainly if decrees of a state altering the marital status of its domiciliaries are not valid throughout the Union even though the requirements of procedural due process are wholly met, a rule would be fostered which could not help but bring "considerable disaster to innocent persons" and "bastardize children hitherto supposed to be the offspring of lawful marriage" (Mr. Justice Holmes dissenting in Haddock v. Haddock, supra , p. 628), or else encourage collusive divorces. Beale, Constitutional Protection of Decrees for Divorce, 19 Harv. L. Rev. 586, 596. These intensely practical considerations emphasize for us the essential function of the full faith and credit clause in substituting a command for the former principles of comity ( Broderick v. Rosner, supra, p. 643) and in altering the "status of the several states as independent foreign *302 sovereignties" by making them "integral parts of a single nation." Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, p. 277. It is objected, however, that if such divorce decrees must be given full faith and credit, a substantial dilution of the sovereignty of other states will be effected. For it is pointed out that under such a rule one state's policy of strict control over the institution of marriage could be thwarted by the decree of a more lax state. But such an objection goes to the application of the full faith and credit clause to many situations. It is an objection in varying degrees of intensity to the enforcement of a judgment of a sister state based on a cause of action which could not be enforced in the state of the forum. Mississippi's policy against gambling transactions was overridden in Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra , when a Missouri judgment based on such a Mississippi contract was enforced by this Court.

[4] Thus we have here no question as to extraterritorial effect of a divorce decree insofar as it affects property in another State. See the cases cited, infra, note 5. [5] Fall v. Eastin, 215 U.S. 1 ; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U.S. 386 ; Hood v. McGehee, 237 U.S. 611 . These decisions refuse to require courts of one state to allow acts or judgments of another to control the disposition or devolution of realty in the former. They seem to rest on the doctrine that the state where the land is located is "sole mistress" of its rules of real property. See Hood v. McGehee, supra, p. 615; and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in Fall v. Eastin, supra, p. 14. That the case of Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., 191 U.S. 373 , is not an exception but only an appropriate application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens, see Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U.S. 629 , 642-643. [6] It has been repeatedly stated that the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to enforce the penal laws of another. See, for example, Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U.S. 657 , 666; Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U.S. 243 , 260; Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U.S. 145 , 160. But the question of whether a judgment based on a penalty is entitled to full faith and credit was reserved in Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U.S. 268 , 279. For other dicta that the application of the full faith and credit clause may be limited by the policy of the law of the forum, see Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, supra, p. 160; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 294 U.S. 532 , 546; Broderick v. Rosner, supra, note 5, p. 642. [7] Grover & Baker Machine Co. v. Radcliffe, 137 U.S. 287 ; National Exchange Bank v. Wiley, 195 U.S. 257 ; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 U.S. 394 ; Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 U.S. 25 , 29; Flexner v. Farson, 248 U.S. 289 . [8] Sec. 9460, Nev. Comp. L. 1929, as amended L. 1931, p. 161, supra, note 3. [9] The fact that a stay in a state is not for long is not necessarily fatal to the existence of a domicil.
