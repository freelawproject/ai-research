**Dissenting Opinion**
 .  .  .” New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 280, 311 (dissenting opinion).  This Court, other courts, and the political process are available to correct any experiments in criminal procedure that prove fundamentally unfair to defendants.  That is not what is being done today: instead, and quite without reason, the Court has chosen to impose upon every State one means of trying criminal cases; it is a good means, but it is not the only fair means, and it is not demonstrably better than the alternatives States might devise.  I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.  See, e. g., my opinions in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 672 (dissenting); Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 44 (concurring); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 14 (dissenting); Pointer v. Texas, <citedDecision>380 U. S. 400, 408</citedDecision> (concurring); Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 615 (concurring); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226 (concurring).  Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), held that the first eight Amendments restricted only federal action.  The locus classicus for this viewpoint is The Federalist No. 51 (Madison).  The Bill of Rights was opposed by Hamilton and other proponents of a strong central government.  See The Federalist No. 84; see generally C. Rossiter, 1787: The Grand Convention 284, 302-303.  In Barron v. Baltimore, supra, at 250 , Chief Justice Marshall said, “These amendments demanded security against the apprehended encroachments of the general government — not against those of the local governments.” Jaffe, Was Brandéis an Activist?

**Dissenting Opinion**
 Holden v. Hardy, 169 U. S. 366, 389 .  Hurtado v. California, 110 U. S. 516, 529 .  Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U. S. 22, 31 .  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 .  The right to counsel was found in the Fourteenth Amendment because, the Court held, it was essential to a fair trial. See 372 U. S., at 342-345 .  Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213 .  Pointer v. Texas, <citedDecision>380 U. S. 400</citedDecision> .  Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717 .  The same illogical way of dealing with a Fourteenth Amendment problem was employed in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 , which held that the Due Process Clause guaranteed the protection of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment against state action.  I disagreed at that time both with the way the question was framed and with the result the Court reached.  See my dissenting opinion, id., at 14 .  I consider myself bound by the Court’s holding in Malloy with respect to self-incrimination.  See my concurring opinion in Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 615 .
