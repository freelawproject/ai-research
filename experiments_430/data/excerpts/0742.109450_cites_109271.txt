 brings into the transaction a commercial feature,” and it distinguished Martin v. Struthers, supra, where it had reversed a conviction for door-to-door distribution of leaflets publicizing a religious meeting, as a case involving “no element of the commercial.” 341 U. S., at 642-643 .  Moreover, the Court several times has stressed that communications to which First Amendment protection was given were not “purely commercial.” New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 266 *759 (1964); Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S., at 533 ; Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, 111 (1943); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413, 417 (1943).  Since the decision in Breará, however, the Court has never denied protection on the ground that the speech in issue was "commercial speech.” That simplistic approach, which by then had come under criticism or was regarded as of doubtful validity by Members of the Court, 16 was avoided in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm’n, 413 U. S. 376 (1973).  There the Court upheld an ordinance prohibiting newspapers from listing employment advertisements in columns according to whether male or female employees were sought to be hired.  The Court, to be sure, characterized the advertisements as “classic examples of commercial speech,” id., at 385 , and a newspaper’s printing of the advertisements as of the same character.  The Court, however, upheld the ordinance on the ground that the restriction it imposed was permissible because the discriminatory hirings proposed by the advertisements, and by their newspaper layout, were themselves illegal.  Last Term, in Bigelow v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 809</citedDecision> (1975), the notion of unprotected “commercial speech” all but passed from the scene.  We reversed a conviction for violation of a Virginia statute that made the circulation of any publication to encourage or promote the *760 processing of an abortion in Virginia a misdemeanor.  The defendant had published in his newspaper the availability of abortions in New York. The advertisement in question, in addition to announcing that abortions were legal in New York, offered the services of a referral agency in that State.  We rejected the contention that the publication was unprotected because it was commercial.  Chrestenserís continued validity was questioned, and its holding was described as “distinctly a limited one” that merely upheld “a reasonable regulation of the manner in which commercial advertising could be distributed.” <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 819</citedDecision> .  We concluded that “the Virginia courts erred in their assumptions that advertising, as such, was entitled to no First Amendment protection,” and we observed that the “relationship of speech to the marketplace of products or of services does not make it valueless in the marketplace of ideas.” <citedDecision>Id., at 825-826</citedDecision> .  Some fragment of hope for the continuing validity of a “commercial speech” exception arguably might have persisted because of the subject matter of the advertisement in Bigelow, We noted that in announcing the availability of legal abortions in New York, the advertisement “did more than simply propose a commercial transaction.  It contained factual material of clear ‘public interest.’ ” <citedDecision>Id., at 822</citedDecision> .  And, of course, the advertisement related to activity with which, at least in some respects, the State could not interfere.  See Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179 (1973).  Indeed, we observed: “We need not decide in this case the precise extent to which the First Amendment permits regulation of advertising that is related to activities the State may legitimately regulate or even prohibit.” <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 825</citedDecision> .  Here, in contrast, the question whether there is a First Amendment exception for “commercial speech” is *761 squarely before us.  Our pharmacist does not wish to editorialize on any subject, cultural, philosophical, or political.  He does not wish to report any particularly newsworthy fact, or to make generalized observations even about commercial matters.  The “idea” he wishes to communicate is simply this: “I will sell you the X prescription drug at the Y price.” Our question, then, is whether this communication is wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment.  V We begin with several propositions that already are settled or beyond serious dispute.  It is clear, for example, that speech does not lose its First Amendment protection because money is spent to project it, as in a paid advertisement of one form or another.

 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra; NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 429 (1963); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S., at 417 ; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 306-307 (1940).  If there is a kind of commercial speech that lacks all First Amendment protection, therefore, it must be distinguished by its content.  Yet the speech whose content deprives it of protection cannot simply be speech on a commercial subject.  No one would contend that our pharmacist may be prevented from being heard on *762 the subject of whether, in general, pharmaceutical prices should be regulated, or their advertisement forbidden.  Nor can it be dispositive that a commercial advertisement is noneditorial, and merely reports a fact.  Purely factual matter of public interest may claim protection.  <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 822</citedDecision> ; Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 102 (1940).  Our question is whether speech which does “no more than propose a commercial transaction,” Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S., at 385 , is so removed from any “exposition of ideas,” Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572 (1942), and from “ ‘truth, science, morality, and arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on the administration of Government,’ ” Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957), that it lacks all protection.  Our answer is that it is not.  Focusing first on the individual parties to the transaction that is proposed in the commercial advertisement, we may assume that the advertiser’s interest is a purely economic one.  That hardly disqualifies him from protection under the First Amendment.  The interests of the contestants in a labor dispute are primarily economic, but it has long been settled that both the employee and the employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome.  See, e. g., NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575, 617-618 (1969); NLRB v. Virginia Electric & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477 (1941); AFL v. Swing, 312 U. S. 321, 325-326 (1941); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S., at 102 .

 Those whom the suppression of prescription drug price information hits the hardest are the poor, the sick, and particularly the aged.  A disproportionate amount of their income tends to be spent on prescription drugs; yet they are the least able to learn, by shopping from pharmacist to pharmacist, where their scarce dollars are best spent.  18 When drug prices *764 vary as strikingly as they do, information as to who is charging what becomes more than a convenience.  It could mean the alleviation of physical pain or the enjoyment of basic necessities.  Generalizing, society also may have a strong interest in the free flow of commercial information.  Even an individual advertisement, though entirely “commercial,” may be of general public interest.  The facts of decided cases furnish illustrations: advertisements stating that referral services for legal abortions are available, <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> v. Virginia, supra; that a manufacturer of artificial furs promotes his product as an alternative to the extinction by his competitors of fur-bearing mammals, see Fur Information & Fashion Council, Inc. v. E. F. Timme & Son, 364 F. Supp. 16 (SDNY 1973); and that á domestic producer advertises his product as an alternative to imports that tend to deprive American residents of their jobs, cf. Chicago Joint Board v. Chicago Tribune Co., 435 F. 2d 470 (CA7 1970), cert. denied, 402 U. S. 973 (1971).  Obviously, not all commercial messages contain the same or even a very great public interest element.  There are few to which such an element, however, could not be added.  Our pharmacist, for example, could cast himself as a commentator on store-to-store dispari *765 ties in drug prices, giving his own and those of a competitor as proof.  We see little point in requiring him to do so, and little difference if he does not.  Moreover, there is another consideration that suggests that no line between publicly “interesting” or “important” commercial advertising and the opposite kind could ever be drawn.  Advertising, however tasteless and excessive it sometimes may seem, is nonetheless dissemination of information as to who is producing and selling what product, for what reason, and at what price.

 Finally, the special problems of the electronic broadcast media are likewise not in this case. Cf. Capitol Broadcasting Co. v. Mitchell, 333 F. Supp. 582 (DC 1971), aff’d sub nom. Capitol Broadcasting Co. v. Acting Attorney General, 405 U. S. 1000 (1972).  What is at issue is whether a State may completely suppress the dissemination of concededly truthful information about entirely lawful activity, fearful of that information’s effect upon its disseminators and its recipients.  Reserving other questions, 25 we conclude that the answer to this one is in the negative.  The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.  It is so ordered.  Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. The First Amendment is applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See, e. g., Bigelow v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 809, 811</citedDecision> (1975); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147, 160 (1939).  Section 54-524.35 provides in full: "Any pharmacist shall be considered guilty of unprofessional conduct who (1) is found guilty of any crime involving grave moral turpitude, or is guilty of fraud or deceit in obtaining a certificate of registration; or (2) issues, publishes, broadcasts by radio, or otherwise, or distributes or uses in any way whatsoever advertising matter in which statements are made about his professional service which have a tendency to deceive' or defraud the public, contrary to the public health and welfare; or (3) publishes, advertises or promotes, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, any amount, price, fee, premium, discount, rebate or credit terms for professional services or for drugs containing narcotics or for any drugs which may be dispensed only by prescription.” The parties, also, have stipulated that pharmacy “is a profession.” Stipulation of Facts ¶ 11, App. 11.  Id., ¶8, App. 11.  See generally id., ¶¶ 6-16, App. 10-12.  Exception is made for “legally qualified” practitioners of medicine, dentistry, osteopathy, chiropody, and veterinary medicine.  § 54-524.53.  Stipulation of Facts ¶ 25, App. 15.

 We are aware of no general principle that freedom of speech may be abridged when the speaker’s listeners could come by his message by some other means, such as seeking him out and asking him what it is.  Nor have we recognized any such limitation on the independent right of the listener to receive the information sought to be communicated.  Certainly, the recipients of the political publications in Lamont could have gone abroad and thereafter disseminated them *758 themselves.  Those in Kleindienst who organized the lecture tour by a foreign Marxist could have done the same.  And the addressees of the inmate correspondence in Procunier could have visited the prison themselves.  As for the recipients' great need for the information sought to be disseminated, if it distinguishes our prior cases at all, it makes the appellees' First Amendment claim a stronger rather than a weaker one.  See <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 820</citedDecision> n. 6, citing Mr. Justice Douglas’ observation in Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S. 498, 514 (1959) (concurring opinion), that the Chrestensen ruling “was casual, almost offhand.  And it has not survived reflection”; the similar observation of four Justices in dissent in Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298 , 314 n. 6 (1974); and expressions of three Justices in separate dissents in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm’n, 413 U. S., at 393, 398 , and 401.  See also Mr. Justice Douglas’ comment, dissenting from the denial of certiorari in Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (1971).  The speech of labor disputants, of course, is subject to a number of restrictions.  The Court stated in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S., at 618 , for example, that an employer’s threats of retaliation for the labor actions of his employees are “without the protection of the First Amendment.” The constitutionality of restrictions upon speech in the special context of labor disputes is not before us here.  We express no views on that complex subject, and advert to cases in the labor field only to note that in some circumstances speech of an entirely private and economic character enjoys the protection of the First Amendment.  The point hardly needs citation, but a few figures are illustrative.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Chief Justice Burger, concurring. The Court notes that roughly 95% of all prescriptions are filled with dosage units already prepared by the manufacturer and sold to the pharmacy in that form. These are the drugs that have a market large enough to make their preparation profitable to the manufacturer; for the same reason, they are the drugs that it is profitable for the pharmacist to advertise. In dispensing *774 these prepackaged items, the pharmacist performs largely a packaging rather than a compounding function of former times. Our decision today, therefore, deals largely with the State's power to prohibit pharmacists from advertising the retail price of prepackaged drugs. As the Court notes, ante, at 773 n. 25, quite different factors would govern were we faced with a law regulating or even prohibiting advertising by the traditional learned professions of medicine or law. “The interest of the States in regulating lawyers is especially great since lawyers are essential to the primary governmental function of administering justice, and have historically been ‘officers of the courts.’ ” Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, 421 U. S. 773, 792 (1975). See also Cohen v. Hurley, 366 U. S. 117, 123-124 (1961). We have also recognized the State’s substantial interest in regulating physicians. See, e. g., United States v. Oregon Medical Society, 343 U. S. 326, 336 (1952); Semler v. Oregon-State Board of Dental Examiners, 294 U. S. 608, 612 (1935). Attorneys and physicians are engaged primarily in providing services in which professional judgment is a large component, a matter very different from the retail sale of labeled drugs already prepared by others. MR. Justice Stewart aptly observes that the “differences between commercial price and product advertising . . . and ideological communication” allow the State a scope in regulating the former that would be unacceptable under the First Amendment with respect to the latter. I think it important to note also that the advertisement of professional services carries with it quite different risks from the advertisement of standard products. The Court took note of this in Semler, supra, at 612 , in upholding a state statute prohibiting entirely certain types of advertisement by dentists: “The legislature was not dealing with traders in *775 commodities, but with the vital interest of public health, and with a profession treating bodily ills and demanding different standards of conduct from those which are traditional in the competition of the market place. The community is concerned with the maintenance of professional standards which will insure not only competency in individual practitioners, but protection against those who would prey upon a public peculiarly susceptible to imposition through alluring promises of physical relief. And the community is concerned in providing safeguards not only against deception, but against practices which would tend to demoralize the profession by forcing its members into an unseemly rivalry which would enlarge the opportunities of the least scrupulous.” I doubt that we know enough about evaluating the quality of medical and legal services to know which claims of superiority are “misleading” and which are justifiable. Nor am I sure that even advertising the price of certain professional services is not inherently misleading, since what the professional must do will vary greatly in individual cases. It is important to note that the Court wisely leaves these issues to another day.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, dissenting. The logical consequences of the Court's decision in this case, a decision which elevates commercial intercourse between a seller hawking his wares and a buyer seeking to strike a bargain to the same plane as has been previously reserved for the free marketplace of ideas, are far reaching indeed. Under the Court’s opinion the way will be open not only for dissemination of price information but for active promotion of prescription drugs, liquor, cigarettes, and other products the use of which it has previously been thought desirable to discourage. Now, however, such promotion is protected by the First Amendment so long as it is not misleading or does not promote an illegal product or enterprise. In coming to this conclusion, the Court has overruled a legislative determination that such advertising should not be allowed and has done so on behalf of a consumer group which is not directly disadvantaged by the statute in question. This effort to reach a result which the Court obviously considers desirable is a troublesome one, for two reasons. It extends standing to raise First Amendment claims beyond the previous decisions of this Court. It also extends the protection of that Amendment to purely commercial endeavors which its most vigorous champions on this Court had thought to be beyond its pale. I I do not find the question of the appellees’ standing to urge the claim which the Court decides quite as easy *782 as the Court does. The Court finds standing on the part of the consumer appellees based upon a “right to 'receive information.’ ” Ante, at 757. Yet it has been stipulated in this case that the challenged statute does not prohibit anyone from receiving this information either in person or by phone. Ante, at 752, and n. 6. The statute forbids “only publish [ing], advertís [ing] or promot[ing]” prescription drugs. While it may be generally true that publication of information by its source is essential to effective communication, it is surely less true, where, as here, the potential recipients of the information have, in the Court’s own words, a “keen, if not keener by far,” interest in it than “in the day’s most urgent political debate.” Ante, at 763. Appellees who have felt so strongly about their right to receive information as to litigate the issue in this lawsuit must also have enough residual interest in the matter to call their pharmacy and inquire. The statute, in addition, only forbids pharmacists to publish this price information. There is no prohibition against a consumer group, such as appellees, collecting and publishing comparative price information as to various pharmacies in an area. Indeed they have done as much in their briefs in this case. Yet, though appellees could both receive and publish the information in question the Court finds that they have standing to protest that pharmacists are not allowed to advertise. Thus, contrary to the assertion of the Court, appellees are not asserting their “right to receive information” at all but rather the right of some third party to publish. In the cases relied upon by the Court, ante, at 756-757, the plaintiffs asserted their right to receive information which would not be otherwise reasonably available to them. * They did not seek to assert the right of a third *783 party, not before the Court, to disseminate information. Here, the only group truly restricted by this statute, the pharmacists, have not even troubled to join in this litigation and may well feel that the expense and competition of advertising is not in their interest. II Thus the issue on the merits is not, as the Court phrases it, whether “[o]ur pharmacist” may communicate the fact that he “will sell you the X prescription drug at the Y price.” No pharmacist is asserting any such claim to so communicate. The issue is rather whether appellee consumers may override the legislative determination that pharmacists should not advertise even though the pharmacists themselves do not object. In deciding that they may do so, the Court necessarily adopts a rule which cannot be limited merely to dissemination of price alone, and which cannot possibly be confined to pharmacists but must likewise extend to lawyers, doctors, and all other professions. The Court speaks of the consumer’s interest in the free flow of commercial information, particularly in the case of the poor, the sick, and the aged. It goes on to observe that “society also may have a strong interest in the free flow of commercial information.” Ante, at 764. One need not disagree with either of these statements in order to feel that they should presumptively be the concern of the Virginia Legislature, which sits to balance these and other claims in the process of making laws such as the one here under attack. The Court speaks of the *784 importance in a “predominantly free enterprise economy” of intelligent and well-informed decisions as to allocation of resources. Ante, at 765. While there is again much to be said for the Court’s observation as a matter of desirable public policy, there is certainly nothing in the United States Constitution which requires the Virginia Legislature to hew to the teachings of Adam Smith in its legislative decisions regulating the pharmacy profession. E. g., Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502 (1934); Olsen v. Nebraska, 313 U. S. 236 (1941). As Mr. Justice Black, writing for the Court, observed in Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 730 (1963): “The doctrine . . . that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely — has long since been discarded. We have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies who are elected to pass laws.” Similarly in Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483 (1955), the Court, in dealing with a state prohibition against the advertisement of eyeglass frames, held: “We see no constitutional reason why a State may not treat all who deal with the human eye as members of a profession who should use no merchandising methods for obtaining customers.” Id., at 490 . The Court addresses itself to the valid justifications which may be found for the Virginia statute, and apparently discounts them because it feels they embody a “highly paternalistic approach.” Ante, at 770. It concludes that the First Amendment requires that channels of advertising communication with respect to prescription drugs must be opened, and that Virginia may not *785 keep “the public in ignorance of the entirely lawful terms that competing pharmacists are offering.” Ibid. The Court concedes that legislatures may prohibit false and misleading advertisements, and may likewise prohibit advertisements seeking to induce transactions which are themselves illegal. In a final footnote the opinion tosses a bone to the traditionalists in the legal and medical professions by suggesting that because they sell services rather than drugs the holding of this case is not automatically applicable to advertising in those professions. But if the sole limitation on permissible state proscription of advertising is that it may not be false or misleading, surely the difference between pharmacists' advertising and lawyers' and doctors’ advertising can be only one of degree and not of kind. I cannot distinguish between the public’s right to know the price of drugs and its right to know the price of title searches or physical examinations or other professional services for which standardized fees are charged. Nor is it apparent how the pharmacists in this case are less engaged in a regulatable profession than were the opticians in Williamson, supra. Nor will the impact of the Court’s decision on existing commercial and industrial practice be limited to allowing advertising by the professions. The Court comments that in labor disputes “it has long been settled that both the employee and the employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome.” Ante, at 762. But the first case cited by the Court in support of this proposition, NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575, 617-618 (1969), falls a good deal short of supporting this general statement. The Court there said that “an employer is free to communicate to his employees any of his general views about unionism or any of his specific views about a particular union, so long as the *786 communications do not contain a ‘threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.’ ” Id., at 618 . This carefully guarded language is scarcely a ringing endorsement of even the second-class First Amendment rights which the Court has today created in commercial speech. It is hard to see why an employer’s right to publicize a promise of benefit may be prohibited by federal law, so long as the promise is neither false nor deceptive, if pharmacists’ price advertising may not be prohibited by the Virginia Legislature. Yet such a result would be wholly inconsistent with established labor law. Both the Courts of Appeals and the National Labor Relations Board have not hesitated to set aside representation elections in which the employer made statements which were undoubtedly truthful but which were found to be implicitly coercive. For instance, in NLRB v. Realist, Inc., 328 F. 2d 840 (CA7 1964), an election was set aside when the employer, in a concededly nonthreatening manner, raised the specter of plant closings which would result from unionism. In Oak Mfg. Co., 141 N. L. R. B. 1323, 1328-1330 (1963), the Board set aside an election where the employer stated “categorically” that the union “cannot and will not obtain any wage increase for you,” and with respect to seniority said that it could “assure” the employees that the union’s program “will be worse” than the present system. In Freeman Mfg. Co., 148 N. L. R. B. 577 (1964), the employer sent letters to employees in which he urged that unionization might cause customers to cease buying the company’s product because of delays and higher prices. The Board found this to be ground for invalidating the election. Presumably all of these holdings will require re-evaluation in the fight of today’s decision with a view toward allowing the employer’s speech because it is now protected by the First Amendment, as expanded by this decision. *787 There are undoubted difficulties with an effort to draw a bright line between “commercial speech” on the one hand and “protected speech” on the other, and the Court does better to face up to these difficulties than to attempt to hide them under labels. In this case, however, the Court has unfortunately substituted for the wavering line previously thought to exist between commercial speech and protected speech a no more satisfactory line of its own — that between “truthful” commercial speech, on the one hand, and that which is “false and misleading” on the other. The difficulty with this line is not that it wavers, but on the contrary that it is simply too Procrustean to take into account the congeries of factors which I believe could, quite consistently with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, properly influence a legislative decision with respect to commercial advertising. The Court insists that the rule it lays down is consistent even with the view that the First Amendment is “primarily an instrument to enlighten public decisionmaking in a democracy.” Ante, at 765, I had understood this view to relate to public decisionmaking as to political, social, and other public issues, rather than the decision of a particular individual as to whether to purchase one or another kind of shampoo. It is undoubtedly arguable that many people in the country regard the choice of shampoo as just as important as who may be elected to local, state, or national political office, but that does not automatically bring information about competing shampoos within the protection of the First Amendment. It is one thing to say that the line between strictly ideological and political commentaries and other kinds of commentary is difficult to draw, and that the mere fact that the former may have in it an element of commercialism does not strip it of First Amendment protection. See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 (1964). But it is another thing to say that because that *788 line is difficult to draw, we will stand at the other end of the spectrum and reject out of hand the observation of so dedicated a champion of the First Amendment as Mr. Justice Black that the protections of that Amendment do not apply to a “ ‘merchant’ who goes from door to door ‘selling pots.’ ” Breard v. City of Alexandria, 341 U. S. 622, 650 (1951) (dissenting). In the case of “our” hypothetical pharmacist, he may now presumably advertise not only the prices of prescription drugs, but may attempt to energetically promote their sale so long as he does so truthfully. Quite consistently with Virginia law requiring prescription drugs to be available only through a physician, “our” pharmacist might run any of the following representative advertisements in a local newspaper: “Pain getting you down? Insist that your physician prescribe Demerol. You pay a little more than for aspirin, but you get a lot more relief.” “Can’t shake the flu? Get a prescription for Tetracycline from your doctor today.” “Don’t spend another sleepless night. Ask your doctor to prescribe Seconal without delay.” Unless the State can show that these advertisements are either actually untruthful or misleading, it presumably is not free to restrict in any way commercial efforts on the part of those who profit from the sale of prescription drugs to put them in the widest possible circulation. But such a line simply makes no allowance whatever for what appears to have been a considered legislative judgment in most States that while prescription drugs are a necessary and vital part of medical care and treatment, there are sufficient dangers attending their widespread use that they simply may not be promoted in the same manner as hair creams, deodorants, and toothpaste. The very real dangers that general advertising for such drugs *789 might create in terms of encouraging, even though not sanctioning, illicit use of them by individuals for whom they have not been prescribed, or by generating patient pressure upon physicians to prescribe them, are simply not dealt with in the Court's opinion. If prescription drugs may be advertised, they may be advertised on television during family viewing time. Nothing we know about the acquisitive instincts of those who inhabit every business and profession to a greater or lesser extent gives any reason to think that such persons will not do everything they can to generate demand for these products in much the same manner and to much the same degree as demand for other commodities has been generated. Both Congress and state legislatures have by law sharply limited the permissible dissemination of information about some commodities because of the potential harm resulting from those commodities, even though they were not thought to be sufficiently demonstrably harmful to warrant outright prohibition of their sale. Current prohibitions on television advertising of liquor and cigarettes are prominent in this category, but apparently under the Court’s holding so long as the advertisements are not deceptive they may no longer be prohibited. This case presents a fairly typical First Amendment problem — that of balancing interests in individual free speech against public welfare determinations embodied in a legislative enactment. As the Court noted in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 399 (1950): “[Ilegitímate attempts to protect the public, not from the remote possible effects of noxious ideologies, but from the present excesses of direct, active conduct, are not presumptively bad because they *790 interfere with and, in some of its manifestations, restrain the exercise of First Amendment rights.” Here the rights of the appellees seem to me to be marginal at best. There is no ideological content to the information which they seek and it is freely available to them — they may even publish it if they so desire. The only persons directly affected by this statute are not parties to this lawsuit. On the other hand, the societal interest against the promotion of drug use for every ill, real or imaginary, seems to me extremely strong. I do not believe that the First Amendment mandates the Court’s “open door policy” toward such commercial advertising. The Court contends, ante, at 757-758, n. 15, that this case is indistinguishable from Procunier, Kleindienst, and Lament, in that in all *783 of those cases it was possible for the parties to obtain the information on their own. In Procunier this would have entailed traveling to a state prison; in Kleindienst and Lamont, traveling abroad. Obviously such measures would limit access to information in a way that the requirement of a phone call or a trip to the comer drag-store would not.

New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 , 266 *759 (1964); Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S., at 533 ; Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, 111 (1943); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413, 417 (1943).  Since the decision in Breard , however, the Court has never denied protection on the ground that the speech in issue was "commercial speech." That simplistic approach, which by then had come under criticism or was regarded as of doubtful validity by Members of the Court, [16] was avoided in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S. 376 (1973).  There the Court upheld an ordinance prohibiting newspapers from listing employment advertisements in columns according to whether male or female employees were sought to be hired.  The Court, to be sure, characterized the advertisements as "classic examples of commercial speech," id., at 385 , and a newspaper's printing of the advertisements as of the same character.  The Court, however, upheld the ordinance on the ground that the restriction it imposed was permissible because the discriminatory hirings proposed by the advertisements, and by their newspaper layout, were themselves illegal.  Last Term, in Bigelow v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 809</citedDecision> (1975), the notion of unprotected "commercial speech" all but passed from the scene.  We reversed a conviction for violation of a Virginia statute that made the circulation of any publication to encourage or promote the *760 processing of an abortion in Virginia a misdemeanor.  The defendant had published in his newspaper the availability of abortions in New York. The advertisement in question, in addition to announcing that abortions were legal in New York, offered the services of a referral agency in that State.  We rejected the contention that the publication was unprotected because it was commercial.  Chrestensen 's continued validity was questioned, and its holding was described as "distinctly a limited one" that merely upheld "a reasonable regulation of the manner in which commercial advertising could be distributed." <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 819</citedDecision> .  We concluded that "the Virginia courts erred in their assumptions that advertising, as such, was entitled to no First Amendment protection," and we observed that the "relationship of speech to the marketplace of products or of services does not make it valueless in the marketplace of ideas." <citedDecision>Id., at 825-826</citedDecision> .  Some fragment of hope for the continuing validity of a "commercial speech" exception arguably might have persisted because of the subject matter of the advertisement in <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> .  We noted that in announcing the availability of legal abortions in New York, the advertisement "did more than simply propose a commercial transaction.  It contained factual material of clear `public interest.' " <citedDecision>Id., at 822</citedDecision> .  And, of course, the advertisement related to activity with which, at least in some respects, the State could not interfere.  See Roe v. Wade, 410 U. S. 113 (1973); Doe v. Bolton, 410 U. S. 179 (1973).  Indeed, we observed: "We need not decide in this case the precise extent to which the First Amendment permits regulation of advertising that is related to activities the State may legitimately regulate or even prohibit." <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 825</citedDecision> .  Here, in contrast, the question whether there is a First Amendment exception for "commercial speech" is *761 squarely before us.  Our pharmacist does not wish to editorialize on any subject, cultural, philosophical, or political.  He does not wish to report any particularly newsworthy fact, or to make generalized observations even about commercial matters.  The "idea" he wishes to communicate is simply this: "I will sell you the X prescription drug at the Y price." Our question, then, is whether this communication is wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment.  V We begin with several propositions that already are settled or beyond serious dispute.

 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra ; NAACP v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 429 (1963); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S., at 417 ; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 306-307 (1940).  If there is a kind of commercial speech that lacks all First Amendment protection, therefore, it must be distinguished by its content.  Yet the speech whose content deprives it of protection cannot simply be speech on a commercial subject.  No one would contend that our pharmacist may be prevented from being heard on *762 the subject of whether, in general, pharmaceutical prices should be regulated, or their advertisement forbidden.  Nor can it be dispositive that a commercial advertisement is noneditorial, and merely reports a fact.  Purely factual matter of public interest may claim protection.  <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 822</citedDecision> ; Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 102 (1940).  Our question is whether speech which does "no more than propose a commercial transaction," Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S., at 385 , is so removed from any "exposition of ideas," Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572 (1942), and from " `truth, science, morality, and arts in general, in its diffusion of liberal sentiments on the administration of Government,' " Roth v. United States, 354 U. S. 476, 484 (1957), that it lacks all protection.  Our answer is that it is not.  Focusing first on the individual parties to the transaction that is proposed in the commercial advertisement, we may assume that the advertiser's interest is a purely economic one.  That hardly disqualifies him from protection under the First Amendment.  The interests of the Contestants in a labor dispute are primarily economic, but it has long been settled that both the employee and the employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome.  See e. g., NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575, 617-618 (1969); NLRB v. Virginia Electric & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477 (1941); AFL v. Swing, 312 U. S. 321, 325-326 (1941); Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S., at 102 .
**Combined Opinion**
 Those whom the suppression of prescription drug price information hits the hardest are the poor, the sick, and particularly the aged.  A disproportionate amount of their income tends to be spent on prescription drugs; yet they are the least able to learn, by shopping from pharmacist to pharmacist, where their scarce dollars are best spent.  [18] When drug prices *764 vary as strikingly as they do, information as to who is charging what becomes more than a convenience.  It could mean the alleviation of physical pain or the enjoyment of basic necessities.  Generalizing, society also may have a strong interest in the free flow of commercial information.  Even an individual advertisement, though entirely "commercial," may be of general public interest.  The facts of decided cases furnish illustrations: advertisements stating that referral services for legal abortions are available, <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> v. Virginia, supra ; that a manufacturer of artificial furs promotes his product as an alternative to the extinction by his competitors of fur-bearing mammals, see Fur Information & Fashion Council, Inc. v. E. F. Timme & Son, 364 F. Supp. 16 (SDNY 1973); and that a domestic producer advertises his product as an alternative to imports that tend to deprive American residents of their jobs, cf. Chicago Joint Board v. Chicago Tribune Co., 435 F. 2d 470 (CA7 1970), cert. denied, 402 U. S. 973 (1971).  Obviously, not all commercial messages contain the same or even a very great public interest element.  There are few to which such an element, however, could not be added.  Our pharmacist, for example, could cast himself as a commentator on store-to-store disparities *765 in drug prices, giving his own and those of a competitor as proof.  We see little point in requiring him to do so, and little difference if he does not.  Moreover, there is another consideration that suggests that no line between publicly "interesting" or "important" commercial advertising and the opposite kind could ever be drawn.  Advertising, however tasteless and excessive it sometimes may seem, is nonetheless dissemination of information as to who is producing and selling what product, for what reason, and at what price.

 See ante, at 771-772, n. 24.  Ideological expression, be it oral, literary, pictorial, or theatrical, is integrally related to the exposition of thoughtthought that may shape our concepts of the whole universe of man.  Although such expression may convey factual information relevant to social and individual decisionmaking, it is protected by *780 the Constitution, whether or not it contains factual representations and even if it includes inaccurate assertions of fact.  Indeed, disregard of the "truth" may be employed to give force to the underlying idea expressed by the speaker.  [6] "Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea," and the only way that ideas can be suppressed is through "the competition of other ideas," Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S., at 339-340 .  Commercial price and product advertising differs markedly from ideological expression because it is confined to the promotion of specific goods or services.  [7] The First Amendment protects the advertisement because of the "information of potential interest and value" conveyed, Bigelow v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 809, 822</citedDecision> , rather than because of any direct contribution to the interchange of ideas.  See ante, at 762-765, 770.  [8] Since the factual claims contained in commercial price or product advertisements relate to tangible goods or services, they may be tested empirically and corrected to reflect the truth without in any manner jeopardizing the free dissemination *781 of thought.  Indeed, the elimination of false and deceptive claims serves to promote the one facet of commercial price and product advertising that warrants First Amendment protectionits contribution to the flow of accurate and reliable information relevant to public and private decisionmaking.  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.  The logical consequences of the Court's decision in this case, a decision which elevates commercial intercourse between a seller hawking his wares and a buyer seeking to strike a bargain to the same plane as has been previously reserved for the free marketplace of ideas, are far reaching indeed.  Under the Court's opinion the way will be open not only for dissemination of price information but for active promotion of prescription drugs, liquor, cigarettes, and other products the use of which it has previously been thought desirable to discourage.
**Combined Opinion**
Here the rights of the appellees seem to me to be marginal at best.  There is no ideological content to the information which they seek and it is freely available to themthey may even publish it if they so desire.  The only persons directly affected by this statute are not parties to this lawsuit.  On the other hand, the societal interest against the promotion of drug use for every ill, real or imaginary, seems to me extremely strong.  I do not believe that the First Amendment mandates the Court's "open door policy" toward such commercial advertising.  NOTES [*]  Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed by Alfred Miller and Stephen L. Solomon for the American Association of Retired Persons et al.; by Gilbert H. Weil, Philip B. Kurland, and Alan L. Unikel for the Association of National Advertisers, Inc.; and by Harold Rosenwald for Osco Drug, Inc. [1]  The First Amendment is applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See, e. g., Bigelow v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 809, 811</citedDecision> (1975); Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147, 160 (1939).  [2]  Section 54-524.35 provides in full: "Any pharmacist shall be considered guilty of unprofessional conduct who (1) is found guilty of any crime involving grave moral turpitude, or is guilty of fraud or deceit in obtaining a certificate of registration; or (2) issues, publishes, broadcasts by radio, or otherwise, or distributes or uses in any way whatsoever advertising matter in which statements are made about his professional service which have a tendency to deceive or defraud the public, contrary to the public health and welfare; or (3) publishes, advertises or promotes, directly or indirectly, in any manner whatsoever, any amount, price, fee, premium, discount, rebate or credit terms for professional services or for drugs containing narcotics or for any drugs which may be dispensed only by prescription." [3]  The parties, also, have stipulated that pharmacy "is a profession." Stipulation of Facts ¶ 11, App. 11.  [4] Id., ¶ 8, App. 11.  See generally id., ¶¶ 6-16, App. 10-12.  [5]  Exception is made for "legally qualified" practitioners of medicine, dentistry, osteopathy, chiropody, and veterinary medicine.
**Combined Opinion**
 We are aware of no general principle that freedom of speech may be abridged when the speaker's listeners could come by his message by some other means, such as seeking him out and asking him what it is.  Nor have we recognized any such limitation on the independent right of the listener to receive the information sought to be communicated.  Certainly, the recipients of the political publications in Lamont could have gone abroad and thereafter disseminated them themselves.  Those in Kleindienst who organized the lecture tour by a foreign Marxist could have done the same.  And the addressees of the inmate correspondence in Procunier could have visited the prison themselves.  As for the recipients' great need for the information sought to be disseminated, if it distinguishes our prior cases at all, it makes the appellees' First Amendment claim a stronger rather than a weaker one.  [16]  See <citedDecision>Bigelow</citedDecision> v. Virginia, 421 U. S., at 820 n. 6, citing Mr. Justice Douglas' observation in Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S. 498, 514 (1959) (concurring opinion), that the Chrestensen ruling "was casual, almost offhand.  And it has not survived reflection"; the similar observation of four Justices in dissent in Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298 , 314 n. 6 (1974); and expressions of three Justices in separate dissents in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S., at 393, 398 , and 401.  See also Mr. Justice Douglas' comment, dissenting from the denial of certiorari in Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (1971).  [17]  The speech of labor disputants, of course, is subject to a number of restrictions.  The Court stated in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S., at 618 , for example, that an employer's threats of retaliation for the labor actions of his employees are "without the protection of the First Amendment." The constitutionality of restrictions upon speech in the special context of labor disputes is not before us here.  We express no views on that complex subject, and advert to cases in the labor field only to note that in some circumstances speech of an entirely private and economic character enjoys the protection of the First Amendment.
**Combined Opinion**
 They may also make inapplicable the prohibition against prior restraints.  Compare New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U. S. 713 (1971), with Donaldson v. Read Magazine, 333 U. S. 178, 189-191 (1948); FTC v. Standard Education Society, 302 U. S. 112 (1937); E. F. Drew & Co. v. FTC, 235 F. 2d 735, 739-740 (CA2 1956), cert. denied, 352 U. S. 969 (1957).  [25]  We stress that we have considered in this case the regulation of commercial advertising by pharmacists.  Although we express no opinion as to other professions, the distinctions, historical and functional, between professions, may require consideration of quite different factors.  Physicians and lawyers, for example, do not dispense standardized products; they render professional services of almost infinite variety and nature, with the consequent enhanced possibility for confusion and deception if they were to undertake certain kinds of advertising.  [1]  In recent years the soundness of the sweeping language of the Chrestensen opinion has been repeatedly questioned.  See Bigelow v. Virginia, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 809, 819-821</citedDecision> ; Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 314-315 , and n. 6 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S. 376, 398 (Douglas, J., dissenting); id., at 401 , and n. 6 (STEWART, J., dissenting); Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (Douglas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  [2] Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 .  See, e. g., Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U. S. 507, 520 ; Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 209 ; Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 828 ; Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 115 .  [3]  Speech by an employer or a labor union organizer that contains material misrepresentations of fact or appeals to racial prejudice may form the basis of an unfair labor practice or warrant the invalidation of a certification election.  See, e. g., Sewell Mfg. Co., 138 N. L. R. B. 66; United States Gypsum Co., 130 N. L. R. B. 901; Gummed Products Co., 112 N. L. R. B. 1092.  Such restrictions would clearly violate First Amendment guarantees if applied to political expression concerning the election of candidates to public office.  See Vanasco v. Schwartz, 401 F. Supp. 87 (EDNY) (three-judge court), summarily aff'd sub nom. Schwartz v. Postel, 423 U. S. 1041 .
