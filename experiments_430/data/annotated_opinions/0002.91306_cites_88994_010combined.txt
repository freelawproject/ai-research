**Combined Opinion**
Mr. Justice Matthews delivered the opinion of the court. He recited the facts, as above' stated, and continued : The conclusions of law reached by the Court of Claims, on which its judgments are founded, and which are stated and supported in its opinion by the late learned Chief Justice of that court, are comprised in these propositions: that if the claimants, J. S. Morgan & Co., and L. Voh Hoffman & Co., or any other party from whom they are shown to have bought, had purchased the bonds in good faith for value before maturity, their “title would prevail against that of the Manhattan Savings Institution, from whom they had been stolen; that, on the face of these bonds, the United States, while fixing a day of ultimate payment, after which they would certainly be overdue, had also reserved the right of redemption at an earlier time, at its pleasure after five years from date; that, as this option could be exercised only by the United States, and not by any officer or department of the government of its mere motion, it could be declared only by law, as was done in the act of Congress of July 14, 1870 ; that this right of redemption, being expressly reserved on the face of the bonds, was part of the contract, of which every holder had notice by its terms, and, as it could be exercised only by a public law, every holder sub *491 sequent to the passage of such law must be held to know that it might be, and when it had been, exercised; that, consequently, the contract is to be read, after the passage of the act of July 14, 1870, as though the time of redemption fixed and declared in pursuance of it by the call of the Secretary of the Treasury had been originally written in it as the final day of payment; and that, by way of conclusion, it must therefore be adjudged that the claimants, against whom the judgment was passed, were purchasers of overdue paper, and not entitled to the protection of the rule which otherwise would shield their title against impeachment.  And it is insisted in argument that this conclusion is anticipated.  and required by the decisions of this court in the cases of Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700 , and Vermilye v. Adams Express Co., <citedDecision>21 Wall. 138, 142</citedDecision> .  It becomes necessary, therefore, at the outset, to examine those cases with particularity.  The bonds in controversy in the first of them were United States coupon bonds, dated January 1, 1851, payable, by their terms, to the State of Texas or bearer, with interest at five per cent., payable semi-annually, and “redeemable after the 31st day of December, 1864.” Each bond contained a statement on its face that the debt was authorized by act of Congress, and was “ transferable on delivery,” and to each were attached six-month coupons, extending to December 31, 1864.  White and Chiles acquired their title on March 15, 1865, The rules established in Murray v. Lardner, 2 Wall. 110 , 118 — “ that the purchaser of coupon bonds, before due, without notice and in good faith, is unaffected by want of title in the seller, and that the burden of proof in respect-to notice and" want of good faith is on,the claimant of the bonds as against the purchaser” — were repeated and reaifirmed, but it was added: “ These rules have never been applied to matured obligations.  Purchasers of notes or bonds past due take nothing but the actual right and title of the vendors.  The bonds in question were dated January 1,1851, and were redeemable after the 3.1st of December, 1864.  In strictness, it is true they were not payable on the day when they became redeemable, but the known usage of the United States to pay all bonds as soon as *492 the right of payment accrues, except when a distinction between redeemability and payability is made by law and shown on the face of the bonds, requires the application of the rule respecting overdue obligations to bonds of thé United States which, have become redeemable, and in respect to which no such distinction has been made.” It appeared in the case that the bonds were the property of the State of Texas on January 11, 1862, having come into her possession and ownership — so the court declares — “through public acts of the general government and of the "State, which gavenotice to all the world of the transaction consummated by them; ” and the State, while thus their owner, in 1851, passed a legislative act declaring that the bonds should be disposed of “ as may be provided by law,” but that no bond should be “ available in the hands of any holder until the same shall have been indorsed, in the city of Austin, by the governor of the State.
**Combined Opinion**
 On the contrary, it may be fairly inferred from what was said in Texas v. White, that if the bonds were issued and used for a lawful purpose, the title passed to the holder unaffected by any claim of the State.' Title to the bonds issued to White and Chiles was held not to be divested out of the State, because of the unlawful purpose with which they were issued, and because the holders were, in our opinion, chargeable with notice of the invalidity of their issue and of their unlawful use.” Some 'of the same issue of bonds were in litigation before this court in National Bank of Washington v. Texas, 20 Wall. 72 .  In that case the title of the appellant was acquired after the 31st day of December, 1864, when they became redeemable, and they were not indorsed by the governor.  It was alleged that.they were issued and used in aid of the rebellion, but the fact, and all knowledge of it on the part of the appellant, was denied, and the court found the allegations were not sustained by the proof.  The question “ whether the bonds were overdue.  *494 in the sense which puts a purchaser of dishonored negotiable paper on the inquiry as to defences which may be set up against it,” was expressly waived, in the opinion of the court, because, it being “ quite clear that they were transferable by delivery after due, the same as before,” it followed that, “ to invalidate the title so acquired by a purchaser, it is necessary to make out some defect in that title,” which the court decided had not been done.  In answer to the point that the title of the appellant failed for want of an indorsement by the governor, in support of which Texas v. White and Texas v. Hardenberg were cited, the court said: “ On an examination of the report of that case it will be seen that the court was of opinion that it was established, both in evidence and by the answers of some of the parties, that the bonds then in controversy were all of them issued to White and Chiles, and the illegal contract on which they were issued was in evidence, and the court was further of opinion that the parties had notice of these facts.” As to what was said in Texas v. White , that the indorsement of the governor was essential to the title of a purchaser, on the ground that the State could, by statute, while the bonds were in its possession, limit their negotiability by requiring as one of its conditions the indorsement of the governor, and that the repeal of that statute, in view of its supposed treasonable purpose, was void, it is remarked by the court: “ All of this, however, was unnecessary to the decision of that case, a,nd the soundness of the proposition may be doubted.” In the case of Vermilye v. Adams Express Co., <citedDecision>21 Wall. 138</citedDecision> , the controversy involved the title to treasury notes issued under the act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 468 , payable to the holder three years after date, and dated July 15, 1865, bearing interest payable semi-annually, for which coupons were attached, except for the interest of the last six months; that Avas to be paid with the principal when the notes were presented.  On the back of each note was this statement: “ At maturity, convertible at the option of the holder into bonds, redeemable at the pleasure of the government at any time after five years, and payable twenty years from June 15th, *495 1868, with, interest at six per cent, per annum payable semi?  annually in coin.” The notes in question were stolen from the Express Company and subsequently bought by Yermilye & Co., bankers in New York; but, at the time of the purchase, more than three years had elapsed from the .date of their issue, and the Secretary of the Treasury had given notice that they would be paid or converted into bonds at the option of the holder on presentation to the department, and that they had ceased to bear interest.  The judgment of the court sustaining the title of the Express Company was founded on the fact, that the purchase was made after the maturity of the obligations.  Mr. Justice Miller, delivering the opinion of the court, said: “They had the ordinary form of negotiable instruments, payable at a definite time, and that time had passed and they were unpaid.  This was obvious on the face of the paper.” It was further shown that the fact that the holder had an option to convert them into other bonds did not change their character in this respect; and “ that the simple fact that they were the obligations of the government ” did not take them “ out of the rule which subjects the purchaser of overdue paper to an inquiry into the circumstances under which it was made, as regards the rights of antecedent holders.” ■ And referring to the case of Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700 , where the bonds were redeemable after the 31st day of December, 1864, it was stated that the court had there held “ that after that date they were to be considered as overdue paper, in regard to their negotiability, observing that in strictness it is true they were not payable on the day when they became redeemable, but the known usage of the United States to pay all bonds as soon as the right of payment accrues, except when a distinction between redeemability and payability is made by law and shown on the face of the bonds, requires the application oí the rule respecting overdue obligations to bonds of the United States which have become redeemable and in respect to which no such distinction is made.” Mr. Justice Miller then added: “ We have not quoted the language from the opinion m that case with any view of affirming it.  It may admit of grave *496 doubt whether such bonds, redeemable but not payable at a certain day, except at the option of the government, do become overdue in the sense of being dishonored if not paid or redeemed on that day. But the notes in the case before us have no such feature.
