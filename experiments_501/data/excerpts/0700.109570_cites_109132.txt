 Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, § 1101 (a) (Supp. 1976).  In 1972, 18 also was established as the age of majority for males and females in civil matters, Okla. Stat., Tit. 15, § 13 (1972 and Supp. 1976), except that §§241 and 245 of the 3.2% beer statute were simultaneously codified to create an exception to the gender-free rule.  Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that Reed emphasized that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are “subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.” 404 U. S., at 75 .  To withstand constitutional challenge, previous cases establish that classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives.  Thus, in Reed , the ob *198 jectives of “reducing the workload on probate courts,” id., at 76 , and “avoiding intrafamily controversy,” id., at 77 , were deemed of insufficient importance to sustain use of an overt gender criterion in the appointment of administrators of intestate decedents’ estates.  Decisions following Reed similarly have rejected administrative ease and convenience as sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-based classifications.  See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 656 (1972); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 690 (1973); cf. Schlesinger v. Ballard, <citedDecision>419 U. S. 498, 506-507</citedDecision> (1975).  And only two Terms ago, Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7 (1975), expressly stating that Reed v. Reed was “controlling,” 421 U. S., at 13 , held that Reed required invalidation of a Utah differential age-of-majority statute, notwithstanding the statute’s coincidence with and furtherance of the State’s purpose of fostering “old notions” of role typing and preparing boys for their expected performance in the economic and political worlds.  421 U. S., at 14-15 .  6 Reed v. Reed has also provided the underpinning for decisions that have invalidated statutes employing gender as an inaccurate proxy for other, more germane bases of classification.  Hence, “archaic.  and overbroad” generalizations, <citedDecision>Schlesinger</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Ballard, supra, at 508</citedDecision> , concerning the financial position of servicewomen, Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 689 n. 23, and working women, Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636, 643 (1975), could not justify use of a gender line in determining eligibility for certain governmental entitlements.  Similarly, increasingly outdated *199 misconceptions concerning the role of females in the home rather than in the “marketplace and world of ideas” were rejected as loose-fitting characterizations incapable of supporting state statutory schemes that were premised upon their accuracy.  Stanton v. Stanton, supra; Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U. S. 522 , 535 n. 17 (1975).  In light of the weak congruence between gender and the characteristic or trait that gender purported to represent, it was necessary that the legislatures choose either to realign their substantive laws in a gender-neutral fashion, or to adopt procedures for identifying those instances where the sex-centered generalization actually comported with fact.  See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, supra, at 658 ; cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U. S. 632, 650 (1974).  In this case, too, “Reed, we feel, is controlling ...,” Stanton v. Stanton, supra, at 13 .  We turn then to the question whether, under Reed , the difference between males and females with respect to the purchase of 3.2% beer warrants the differential in age drawn by the Oklahoma statute.

 Thus, a successful suit against Raines did not threaten to impair or diminish the independent private rights of others, and consequently, consideration of those third-party rights properly was deferred until another day. Of course, the Raines principle has also been relaxed where legal action *196 against the claimant threatens to “chill” the First Amendment rights of third parties.  See, e. g., Lewis v. New Orleans, 415 U. S. 130 (1974).  The fact that Baird chose to disobey the legal duty imposed upon him by the Massachusetts anticontraception statute, resulting in his criminal conviction, 405 U. S., at 440, does not distinguish the standing inquiry from that pertaining to the anticipatory attack in this case. In both Eisenstadt and here, the challenged statutes compel jus tertii claimants either to cease their proscribed activities or to suffer appropriate sanctions.  The existence of Art.. Ill “injury in fact” and the structure of the claimant’s relationship to the third parties are not altered by the litigative posture of the suit.  And, certainly, no suggestion will be heard that Whitener’s anticipatory challenge offends the normal requirements governing such actions.  See generally Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452 (1974); Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66 (1971); Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) and Schlesinger v. Ballard, <citedDecision>419 U. S. 498</citedDecision> (1975), upholding the use of gender-based classifications, rested upon the Court’s perception of the laudatory purposes of those laws as remedying disadvantageous conditions suffered by women in economic and military life. See 416 U. S., at 353-354; 419 U. S., at 508.  Needless to say, in this case Oklahoma does not suggest that the age-sex differential was enacted to ensure the availability of 3.2% beer for women as compensation for previous deprivations.  That this was the true purpose is not at all self-evident.  The pur *200 pose is not apparent from the face of the statute and the Oklahoma Legislature does not preserve statutory history materials capable of clarifying the objectives served by its legislative enactments.  The District Court acknowledged the nonexistence of materials necessary “to reveal what the actual purpose of the legislature was,” but concluded that “we feel it apparent that a major purpose of the legislature was to promote the safety of the young persons affected and the public generally.” 399 F. Supp., at 1311 n. 6.  Similarly, the attorney for Oklahoma, while proposing traffic safety as a legitimate rationale for the 3.2% beer law, candidly acknowledged at oral argument that he is unable to assert that traffic safety is “indeed the reason" for the gender line contained in § 245.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.

 Id., at 357 (Brennan, J., joined by Marshall, J., dissenting).  In Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S. 636 (1975), the Court invalidated § 202 (g) of the Social Security Act, which allowed benefits to mothers but not fathers of minor children, who survive the wage earner.  This statute was treated, in the opinion of the Court, as a discrimination against female wage earners, on the ground that it minimizes the financial security which their work efforts provide for their families.  420 U. S., at 645 .  I am not unaware of the argument from time to time advanced, that all discriminations between the sexes ultimately redound to the detriment of females, because they tend to reinforce “old notions” restricting the roles and opportunities of women.  As a general proposition applying equally to all sex categorizations, I believe that this argument was implicitly found to carry little weight in our decisions upholding gender-based differences.  See Schlesinger v. Ballard, <citedDecision>419 U. S. 498</citedDecision> (1975); Kahn v. Shevin, supra. Seeing no assertion that it has special applicability to the situation at hand, I believe it can be dismissed as an insubstantial consideration.
