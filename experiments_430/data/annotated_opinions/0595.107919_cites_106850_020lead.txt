 While the majority cited Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549 , as their authority for denying relief and while a few who took part in Colegrove put this type of question in the “political” as distinguished from the “justiciable” category, 328 U. S., at 552 , that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 202 .  When a State makes classifications of voters which favor residents of some counties over residents of other counties, a justiciable controversy is presented.  369 U. S., at 198-204 .  When we struck down the Georgia county-unit system in statewide primary elections, we said: “How then can one person be given twice or ten times the voting power of another person in a statewide election merely because he lives in a rural area or because he lives in the smallest rural county?  Once the geographical unit for which a representative is to be chosen is designated, all who participate in the election are to have an equal vote — whatever their race, whatever their sex, whatever their occupation, whatever their income, and wherever their home may be in that geographical unit.  This is required by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Gray v. Sanders, 372 U. S. 368, 379 .  Reynolds v. Sims, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 533</citedDecision> , held that a State in an apportionment of state representatives and senators among districts and counties could not deprive voters in *818 the more populous counties of their proportionate share of representatives and senators.  “The right to vote freely for the candidate of one’s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.  And the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.” <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 555</citedDecision> .  We have said enough to indicate why MacDougall v. Green is out of line with our recent apportionment cases. The use of nominating petitions by independents to obtain a place on the Illinois ballot is an integral part of her elective system.  See People v. Election Commissioners, 221 Ill. 9, 18 , 77 N. E. 321 , 323.  All procedures used by a State as an integral part of the election process must pass muster against the charges of discrimination or of abridgment of the right to vote.  United States v. Classic, 313 U. S. 299, 314-318 ; Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 664 .  Dusch v. Davis, 387 U. S. 112 , is not relevant to the problem of this case. There each councilman was required to be a resident of the borough from which he was elected.  Like the residence requirement for state senators from a multi-district county (Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U. S. 433 ), the place of residence did not mark the voting unit; for in Dusch all the electors in the city voted for each councilman.
