[18] *445 Thus the Bill of Attainder Clause not only was intended as one implementation of the general principle of fractionalized power, but also reflected the Framers' belief that the Legislative Branch is not so well suited as politically independent judges and juries to the task of ruling upon the blameworthiness of, and levying appropriate punishment upon, specific persons.  "Every one must concede that a legislative body, from its numbers and organization, and from the very intimate dependence of its members upon the people, which renders them liable to be peculiarly susceptible to popular clamor, is not properly constituted to try with coolness, caution, and impartiality a criminal charge, especially in those cases in which the popular feeling is strongly excited,the very class of cases most likely to be prosecuted by this mode." [19] *446 By banning bills of attainder, the Framers of the Constitution sought to guard against such dangers by limiting legislatures to the task of rule-making.  "It is the peculiar province of the legislature to prescribe general rules for the government of society; the application of those rules to individuals in society would seem to be the duty of other departments." Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 136 .  [20] *447 II.  It is in this spirit that the Bill of Attainder Clause was consistently interpreted by this Courtuntil the decision in American Communications Assn. v. Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 382</citedDecision> , which we shall consider hereafter.  In 1810, Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the Court in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 87, 138 , stated that "[a] bill of attainder may affect the life of an individual, or may confiscate his property, or may do both." This means, of course, that what were known at common law as bills of pains and penalties are outlawed by the Bill of Attainder Clause.  The Court's pronouncement therefore served notice that the Bill of Attainder Clause was not to be given a narrow historical reading (which would exclude bills of pains and penalties), but was instead to be read in light of the evil the Framers had sought to bar: legislative punishment, of any form or severity, of specifically designated persons or groups.  See also Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 286 .  The approach which Chief Justice Marshall had suggested was followed in the twin post-Civil War cases of Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277 , and Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333 .  Cummings involved the constitutionality of amendments to the Missouri Constitution of 1865 which provided that no one could engage in a number of specified professions (Cummings was a priest) unless he first swore that he had taken no part in the rebellion against the Union.

329 U. S., at 447 .  In designating bank officers, directors and employees as those persons in position (a), and officers, directors, partners and employees of underwriting houses as those persons in position (b), Congress merely expressed the characteristics it was trying to reach in an alternative, shorthand way.  [29] That Congress was legislating with *455 respect to general characteristics rather than with respect to a specific group of men is well demonstrated by the fact that § 32 provides that the prescribed disqualification should not obtain whenever the Board of Governors determined that "it would not unduly influence the investment policies of such member bank or the advice it gives its customers regarding investments." We do not suggest that such an escape clause is essential to the constitutionality of § 32, but point to it only further to underscore the infirmity of the suggestion that § 32, like § 504, incorporates an empirical judgment of, and inflicts its deprivation upon, a particular group of men.  It is argued, however, that in § 504 Congress did no more than it did in enacting § 32: it promulgated a general rule to the effect that persons possessing characteristics which make them likely to incite political strikes should not hold union office, and simply inserted in place of a list of those characteristics an alternative, shorthand criterionmembership in the Communist Party.  Again, we cannot agree.  The designation of Communists as those persons likely to cause political strikes is not the substitution of a semantically equivalent phrase; on the contrary, it rests, as the Court in <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> explicitly recognized, <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 389</citedDecision> , upon an empirical investigation by Congress of the acts, characteristics and propensities of Communist Party members.  In a number of decisions, this Court has pointed out the fallacy of the suggestion that membership in the Communist Party, or any other political organization, can be regarded as an alternative, but equivalent, expression for a list of undesirable characteristics.  For, as the Court noted in Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U. S. 118, 136 , "under our traditions beliefs are personal and not a matter of mere association, and .  .  .  men in adhering to a political party or other organization notoriously do not subscribe unqualifiedly *456 to all of its platforms or asserted principles." [30] Just last Term, in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500 , we held § 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act to violate the Constitution because it "too broadly and indiscriminately" restricted constitutionally protected freedoms.

 These cases are relevant to the question before us.  Even assuming that Congress had reason to conclude that some Communists would use union positions to bring about political strikes, "it cannot automatically be inferred that all members shar[e] their evil purposes or participat[e] in their illegal conduct." Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232, 246 .  In utilizing the term "members of the Communist Party" to designate those persons who are likely to incite political strikes, it plainly is not the case that Congress has merely substituted a convenient shorthand term for a list of the characteristics it was trying to reach.  [31] IV. The Solicitor General argues that § 504 is not a bill of attainder because the prohibition it imposes does not constitute "punishment." In support of this conclusion, he urges that the statute was enacted for preventive rather *457 than retributive reasonsthat its aim is not to punish Communists for what they have done in the past, but rather to keep them from positions where they will in the future be able to bring about undesirable events.  He relies on American Communications Assn. v. Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 382</citedDecision> , which upheld § 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, the predecessor of the statute presently before us.  In <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> the Court distinguished Cummings, Garland and Lovett on the ground that in those cases "the individuals involved were in fact being punished for past actions; whereas in this case they are subject to possible loss of position only because there is substantial ground for the congressional judgment that their beliefs and loyalties will be transformed into future conduct." Id., at 413 .  This case is not necessarily controlled by <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> .  For to prove its assertion that § 9 (h) was preventive rather than retributive in purpose, [32] the Court in <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> focused *458 on the fact that members of the Communist Party could escape from the class of persons specified by Congress simply by resigning from the Party: "Here the intention is to forestall future dangerous acts; there is no one who may not, by a voluntary alteration of the loyalties which impel him to action, become eligible to sign the affidavit.  We cannot conclude that this section is a bill of attainder." <citedDecision>Id., at 414</citedDecision> .  Section 504, unlike § 9 (h), disqualifies from the holding of union office not only present members of the Communist Party, but also anyone who has within the past five years been a member of the Party.  However, even if we make the assumption that the five-year provision was inserted not out of desire to visit retribution but purely out of a belief that failure to include it would lead to pro forma resignations from the Party which would not decrease the threat of political strikes, it still clearly appears that § 504 inflicts "punishment" within the meaning of the Bill of Attainder Clause.  It would be archaic to limit the definition of "punishment" to "retribution." Punishment serves several purposes: retributive, rehabilitative, deterrentand preventive.  One of the reasons society imprisons those convicted of crimes is to keep them from inflicting future harm, but that does not make imprisonment any the less punishment.  Historical considerations by no means compel restriction of the bill of attainder ban to instances of retribution.

 In the same humane spirit, as the contest approached its close, and the necessity of these severities diminished, many of the states passed laws offering pardons *460 to those who had been disfranchised, and restoring them to the enjoyment of their property .  .  .  ." [35] Thus Justice Iredell was on solid historical ground when he observed, in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 399-400 , that "attainders, on the principle of retaliation and proscription, have marked all the vicissitudes of party triumph." (Emphasis supplied.) We think that the Court in <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> misread United States v. Lovett when it suggested, <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 413</citedDecision> , that that case could be distinguished on the ground that the sanction there imposed was levied for purely retributive reasons.  In Lovett the Court, after reviewing the legislative history of § 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, 328 U. S., at 308-313 , concluded that the statute was the product of a congressional drive to oust from government persons whose (congressionally determined) "subversive" tendencies made their continued employment dangerous to the national welfare: "the purpose of all who sponsored § 304 .  .  .  clearly was to `purge' the then existing and all future lists of government employees of those whom Congress deemed guilty of `subversive activities' and therefore `unfit' to hold a federal job." Id., at 314.  Similarly, the purpose of the statute before us is to purge the governing boards of labor unions of those whom Congress regards as guilty of subversive acts and associations and therefore unfit to fill positions which might affect interstate commerce.

 The legislature may focus on a particular group or class only when the group designation is a "shorthand phrase" for the feared characteristic i.  e., when it is common knowledge that all, not just some, members of the group possess the feared characteristic and thus such legislative designation would require no legislative fact-finding about individuals.  [1] In the Court's view, therefore, § 504 is too narrow in specifying the particular class; but it is also too broad in treating all members of the class alike.  On both counts underinclusiveness and overinclusiveness§ 504 is invalid as a bill of attainder because Congress has engaged in forbidden fact-finding about individuals and groups and has thus strayed into the area reserved to the judiciary by the Constitution.  I.  It is not difficult to find some of the cases and statutes which the necessary implications of the Court's approach will overrule or invalidate.  American Communications Assn. v. Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 382</citedDecision> , which upheld the predecessor statute to § 504 is obviously *465 overruled.  In that case the Court accepted the congressional findings about the Communist Party and about the propensity of Party members "to subordinate legitimate trade union objectives to obstructive strikes when dictated by Party leaders, often in support of the policies of a foreign government." <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 388</citedDecision> .  Moreover, Congress was permitted to infer from a person's "political affiliations and beliefs" that such a person would be likely to instigate political strikes.  <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 391-392</citedDecision> .  Like § 504, the statute there under consideration did not cover all persons who might be likely to call political strikes.  Nevertheless, legislative findings that some Communists would engage in illegal activities were sufficient to sustain the exercise of legislative power.  The Bill of Attainder Clause now forbids Congress to do precisely what was validated in <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> .  Similarly invalidated are statutes denying positions of public importance to groups of persons identified by their business affiliations, commonly known as conflict-of-interest statutes.  In the <citedDecision>Douds</citedDecision> case the Court found in such statutes support for its conclusion that Congress could rationally draw inferences about probable conduct on the basis of political affiliations and beliefs, which it considered comparable to business affiliations.  The majority in the case now before us likewise recognizes the pertinency of such statutes and, in its discussion of Board of Governors v. Agnew, 329 U. S. 441 , strenuouslyand unsuccessfullyattempts to distinguish them.  The statute involved in Agnew , § 32 of the Banking Act of 1933, 48 Stat. 194 , as amended, 12 U. S. C. § 78 (1964 ed.), forbade any partner or employee of a firm primarily engaged in underwriting securities from being a director of a national bank. The Court expressly recognized that the statute was directed to the "probability or likelihood" that a bank director who was also a partner or employee of an underwriting firm " may use his influence in the bank *466 to involve it or its customers in securities which his underwriting house has in its portfolio or has committed itself to take." 329 U. S., at 447 .  (Emphasis added.) And, as we noted in Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 392</citedDecision> , "[t]here was no showing, nor was one required, that all employees of underwriting firms would engage in such conduct." See also Agnew, 329 U. S., at 449 .  In terms of the Court's analysis of the Bill of Attainder Clause, no meaningful distinction may be drawn between § 32 of the Banking Act and § 504.  Both sections disqualify a specifically described group, officers and employees of underwriting firms in the one case and members of the Communist Party in the other.  Both sections may be said to be underinclusive: others besides underwriters may have business interests conflicting with the duties of a bank director and others than Communists may call political strikes.  Equally, both sections may be deemed overinclusive: neither section finds that all members of the group affected would violate their obligations to the office from which they are disqualified; some members would and perhaps others would not.  Both sections are based on a probability or likelihood that this would occur.

 And § 504 applies to any man who occupies the two positions of labor union leader and member of the Communist Party.  If based upon "its general knowledge of human psychology" Congress may make findings about a group including members and employees of underwriting firms which disqualify such persons from a certain office, why may not Congress on a similar basis make such a finding about members of the Communist Party?  "Because of their business connections, carrying as they do certain loyalties, interests and disciplines," § 32 disqualifies members and employees of underwriting firms as posing "a continuing threat of participation in the harmful activities .  .  .  ." Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 392</citedDecision> .  The same might be said about § 504, as was said about its predecessor: "Political affiliations of the kind here involved, no less than business affiliations, provide rational ground for the legislative judgment that those persons proscribed by § 9 (h) would be subject to `tempting opportunities' to commit acts deemed harmful to the national economy.  In this respect, § 9 (h) is not unlike a host of other statutes which prohibit specified groups of persons from holding positions of power and public interest because, in the legislative judgment, they threaten to abuse the trust that is a necessary concomitant of the power of office." Id., at 392.  Conflict-of-interest statutes are an accepted type of legislation.  [2] Indeed, our Constitution contains a conflict-of-interest *468 provision in Art. I, § 6, cl. 2, which prohibits any Congressman from simultaneously holding office under the United States.  If the Court would save the conflict-of-interest statutes, which apparently it would, it is difficult to understand why § 504 is stricken down as a bill of attainder.

"(b) Any person who willfully violates this section shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both." [2]  In American Communications Assn. v.

S. 382, 388</citedDecision> , this Court found that "the purpose of § 9 (h) of the [National Labor Relations] Act [was] to remove .  .  .  the so-called `political strike'." Section 504 was designed to accomplish the same purpose as § 9 (h), but in a more direct and effective way.  H. R. Rep. No. 741, 86th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 33; H. R. Rep.

 We of course do not hold that overbroadness is a necessary characteristic of a bill of attainder.  [32]  The Court's opinion in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U. S. 1, 88 , also referred to the fact that the members of the class affected by the statute could extricate themselves from the class at will. However, whereas the factor of escapability was considered in Douds to be probative of whether or not the statute was punitive, in the Communist Party case it was considered only as one factor tending to show that the Act in question was not directed at a specific group of persons but rather set forth a generally applicable definition.  See note 26, supra. We do not read either opinion to have set up inescapability as an absolute prerequisite to a finding of attainder.  Such an absolute rule would have flown in the face of explicit precedent, Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 324 , as well as the historical background of the constitutional prohibition.  A number of ante-Constitution bills of attainder inflicted their deprivations upon named or described persons or groups, but offered them the option of avoiding the deprivations, e. g., by swearing allegiance to the existing government.  See, e. g., Del. Laws 1778, c. 29b; Mass. Acts of September 1778, c. 13; III Hamilton, History of the Republic of the United States, p. 25 (1859); see generally Note, 72 Yale L. J. 330, 339-340.  [33] American Communications Assn. v. Douds, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 382, 389</citedDecision> ; see note 2, supra. [34]  See Ex parte Law, 15 Fed. Cas. 3, 9-10 (No. 8126) (D. C. S. D. Ga. 1866).  Professor Chafee has pointed out that even the death penalty was often inflicted largely for preventive purposes: "There was no good middle ground between beheading and doing nothing.  If the ousted adviser were left at liberty, he could readily turn his resentment into coercion or rebellion and make a magnificent comeback to the utter ruin of those who had driven him from his high place.  Therefore, the usual object of Parliamentary proceedings against an important minister was to put him to death." Chafee, Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787, pp. 103-104 (1956).  The preventive purpose of the "Act for the Attainder of the pretended Prince of Wales of High Treason" of 1700, 13 Will. 3 , c. 3, is demonstrated by the parliamentary declaration that anyone corresponding with the Prince or his followers would be subject to prosecution for treason.  See also Chafee, supra, pp. 109-113 (impeachment and attainder of the Earl of Strafford), 115-118 (bill against the Earl of Clarendon).
