  to operate a private employment agency for. the year commencing May 1, 1940. The license was withheld because of relator’s refusal to limit its maximum compensation, as provided by the statute, to ten per cent of the first month’s salary or wages of the person for whom employment was'obtained. The petition in mandamus challenged the constitutionality of those provisions of the act.

  The answer sought to sustain them by alleging that the business of a private employment agency is “vitally affected with a public interest” and subject to such regulation under'the police power of the state. The relator’s motion for judgment on the pleadings was sustained and it was ordered that a peremptory writ of mandamus should issue.

  case, freed from'.the test which it employed, can no longer survive. But respondents maintain that the statute here in question is invalid for other reasons. They insist that special circumstances must be shown to support the validity of such drastic legislation as price-fixing, that the executive, technical and professional workers which respondents serve have not been shown to be in need of special protection from exploitation, that legislative limitation of maximum fees for employment agencies is certain to react unfavorably upon those members- of the community for whom it is most difficult, to obtain jobs, that the increasing competition of public employment agencies and of charitable, labor union and employer association employment agencies have curbed excessive fees by private agencies, and that there is nothing in thisi record to overcome the presumption as to the résult of the operation of such competitive, economic forces. And in the latter connéction respondents urge that, since no circumstances are shown which curb competition between the, private agencies and the other types of agencies, there are no conditions which the legislature might reasonably believe would redound to the public injury unless corrected by such legislation.

  We are not concerned, however-, with the wisdom, need, or appropriateness of the legislation. Differences of opinion on that score suggest a choice which “should be' left where . . . it was left by the Constitution — to the States and to Congress.”
