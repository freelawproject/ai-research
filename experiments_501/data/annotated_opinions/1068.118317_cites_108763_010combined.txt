 .  .  Congress conditioned the right to operate a railroad in interstate commerce upon amenability to suit in federal court as provided by the Act; by thereafter operating a railroad in interstate commerce, Alabama must be taken to have accepted that condition and thus to have consented to suit." 377 U. S., at 192 .  The four dissenting Justices in Parden refused to infer a waiver because Congress had not "expressly declared" that a State operating in commerce would be subject to liability, but they went on to acknowledgein a concession that, strictly speaking, was not necessary to their analysisthat Congress possessed the power to effect such a waiver of the State's constitutionally protected immunity so long as it did so with clarity.  Id., at 198-200 (opinion of White, J.).  Only nine years later, in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., <citedDecision>411 U. S. 279</citedDecision> (1973), we began to retreat from Parden .  That case heldin an opinion written by one of the Parden dissenters over the solitary dissent of Parden 's authorthat the State of Missouri was immune from a suit brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act by employees of its state health facilities.  Although the statute specifically covered the state hospitals in question, see 29 U. S. C. § 203 (d) (1964 ed.), and such coverage was unquestionably enforceable in federal court by the United States, <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 285-286</citedDecision> , we did not think that the statute expressed with clarity Congress's intention to supersede the States' immunity from suits brought by individuals.  We "put to one side" the Parden case, which we characterized as involving "dramatic circumstances" and "a rather isolated state activity," *678 <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 285</citedDecision> , unlike the provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act in question that applied to a broad class of state employees.  We also distinguished the railroad in Parden on the ground that it was "operated for profit" "in the area where private persons and corporations normally ran the enterprise." <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 284</citedDecision> .  Justice Marshall, joined by Justice Stewart, went even further, concluding that although, in their view, Congress had clearly purported to subject the States to suits by individuals in federal courts, it lacked the constitutional authority to do so. <citedDecision>Id., at 287, 289-290</citedDecision> (opinion concurring in result).  The next year, we observed (in dictum) that there is "no place" for the doctrine of constructive waiver in our sovereign-immunity jurisprudence, and we emphasized that we would "find waiver only where stated by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction." Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 673 (1974) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Several Terms later, in Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468 (1987), although we expressly avoided addressing the constitutionality of Congress's conditioning a State's engaging in Commerce Clause activity upon the State's waiver of sovereign immunity, we said there was "no doubt that Parden 's discussion of congressional intent to negate Eleventh Amendment immunity is no longer good law," and overruled Parden "to the extent [it] is inconsistent with the requirement that an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity by Congress must be expressed in unmistakably clear language," 483 U. S., at 478 , and n. 8.  [2] *679 College Savings and the United States concede, as they surely must, that these intervening decisions have seriously limited the holding of Parden .  They maintain, however, that Employees and Welch are distinguishable, and that a core principle of Parden remains good law. A Parden -style waiver of immunity, they say, is still possible after Employees and Welch so long as the following two conditions are satisfied: First, Congress must provide unambiguously that the State will be subject to suit if it engages in certain specified conduct governed by federal regulation.  Second, the State must voluntarily elect to engage in the federally regulated conduct that subjects it to suit.

 See id., at 5 (Federal Government provided over $21 billion to States for education in 1998).  The distinction that the majority seeks to makedrawn in terms of gifts and entitlementsdoes not exist.  The majority is also wrong to say that this Court has "narrowed" Parden in its "subsequent opinion[s]," ante, at 680, at least in any way relevant to today's decision.  Parden considered two separate issues: (1) Does Congress have the power to require a State to waive its immunity?  (2) How clearly must Congress speak when it does so?  The Court has narrowed Parden only in respect to the second issue, not the first; but today we are concerned only with the first.  The Court in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., <citedDecision>411 U. S. 279</citedDecision> (1973), for example, discussed whether Congress had, or had not, "lift[ed]" sovereign immunity, not whether it could, or could not, have done so. <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 285 *698 ("Congress did not lift the sovereign immunity of the States" (emphasis added)).  And Employees' limitation of Parden , to "the area where private persons and corporations normally ran the enterprise," took place in the context of clarity, not power.  <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 284</citedDecision> (specifying that "Congress can act" outside the limited area (emphasis added)).  Although two Justices would have limited Parden 's holding in respect to power, that limitation would simply have required Congress to give the States advance notice of the consequence (loss of sovereign immunity), which, as they noted, happened in Parden.  <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 296-297</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring in result).  The remaining cases the majority mentions offer it no greater support.  One said, "We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment." Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468, 475 (1987).  Two others also considered legislative clarity, not power.  Atascadero State Hospital, supra, at 247 (Rehabilitation Act "falls far short" of clearly indicating a waiver by a State accepting funds under the Act); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 674 (1974) (same for Social Security Act).  Even Seminole Tribe carefully avoided calling Parden into question.

 These cases, however, have only the most tenuous relation to Parden 's actual holdingas one might suspect from the dissent's soft-pedaled description of them as "roughly comparable" and involving (in quotation marks) "`waivers.'" Post, at 696.  The first two, United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), and California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), involved neither state immunity from suit nor waiver, but the entirely different question whether substantive provisions of Commerce Clause legislation applied to the States.  The former concerned a suit brought against a State by the United States (a situation in which state sovereign immunity does not exist, see United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892)), and the latter expressly acknowledged that "the Eleventh Amendment" was "not before us," 353 U. S., at 568, n. 16 .  The last case, Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565 (1947), which held that a bankruptcy court can entertain a trustee's objections to a claim filed by a State, stands for the unremarkable proposition that a State waives its sovereign immunity by voluntarily invoking the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  See supra, at 675-676.  In sum, none of these cases laid any foundation for Parden  whose author was quite correct in acknowledging that it "presented a question of first impression," Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., <citedDecision>411 U. S. 279, 299</citedDecision> (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  [4]  As for the suggestion of Justice Breyer that we limit state sovereign immunity to noncommercial state activities because Congress has so limited foreign sovereign immunity, in accord with the "modern trend," see post, at 699 (dissenting opinion) (citing the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U. S. C. § 1605 (a)(2)), see also Justice Stevens's dissent, post, at 692: This proposal ignores the fact that state sovereign immunity, unlike foreign sovereign immunity, is a constitutional doctrine that is meant to be both immutable by Congress and resistant to trends.  The text of the Eleventh Amendment, of course, makes no distinction between commercial and noncommercial state activitiesand so if we were to combine Justice Breyer's literalistic interpretation of that Amendment with his affection for FSIA, we would have a "commercial activities" exception for all suits against States except those commenced in federal court by citizens of another State, a disposition that hardly "makes sense," post, at 699.  [5]  Justice Breyer purports to "accept this Court's pre- Seminole Tribe sovereign immunity decisions," post, at 699 (dissenting opinion), but by that he could not mean Hans , but rather only the distorted view of Hans that prevailed briefly between Parden and Seminole Tribe.  Parden was the first case to suggest that the sovereign immunity announced in Hans was so fragile a flower that it could be abrogated under Article Ia suggestion contrary to the reality that Hans itself involved a congressional conferral of jurisdiction enacted under Article I.  See Pennsylvania v. Union Gas, 491 U. S. 1, 36-37 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Moreover, that conferral of jurisdiction was combined, in Hans , with a substantive claim under the Contracts Clause of the Constitution itself, which one would think to have greater, rather than lesser, abrogative force than a substantive statute enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause.  Justice Breyer would apparently interpose that the statute in Hans did not expressly "`purpor[t] to pierce state immunity,'" post, at 700, quoting Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 119 (Souter, J., dissenting)but the opinion in Hans did not allude to that refinement, nor did Parden think it made any difference.  The so-called "clear statement rule" was not even adumbrated until nine years after Parden , in Employees, <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 284-285</citedDecision> .  It is difficult to square Justice Breyer's reliance upon the distinction that the present case involves a federal question (and is therefore not explicitly covered by the Eleventh Amendment), see post, at 700-701, with its professed fidelity to Hans , the whole point of which was that the sovereign immunity reflected in (rather than created by) the Eleventh Amendment transcends the narrow text of the Amendment itself.  Or to put it differently, the "pre- Seminole Tribe sovereign immunity decisions" to which Justice Breyer pledges allegiance appear to include Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793).  But see U. S. Const., Amdt. 11.  [1]  See 28 U. S. C. § 1605 (a)(2) (commercial activity exception to foreign sovereign immunity).  The statute provides the following definition of "commercial activity": "either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act.  The commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose."
