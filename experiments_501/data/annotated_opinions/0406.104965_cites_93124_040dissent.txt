**Dissenting Opinion**
 * The navigation channel might be on either side of the center line or right- on the center line. Who is to say what state the.  vessels were in?  The doctrine of apportionment applied in Ott v. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., 336 U. S. 169 , is not in point.  In that case the domiciliary state had not sought to- tax thé vessels.  The tax was approved in the Ott case only ón the assurance of the Louisiana Attorney General that the taxing statute “was intended to cover and actually covers here, an average portion of property permanently within the State — -and by permanently is meant throughout the taxing year.” Ibid., at 175.  Without such assurance there would have been no basis fqr applying the apportionment rule.  New York Central R. Co. v. Miller, 202 U. S. 584 ; Pullman’s Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania, <citedDecision>141 U. S. 18, 26</citedDecision> ; Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194, 206 .  The record in this case is silent as to whether any proportion of the vessels were in any one state for the whole *387 of a taxable year.  The record does show that no other state collected taxes on the vessels for the years in question or any other year.  Until this case, it has not been the law that the state of the owner’s domicile is prohibited from taxing under such circumstances.  Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, supra, is a case in point.  There the owner of the vessels was á Kentucky corporation which operated between various coastal ports.  None of the vessels were ever near Kentucky, but Kentucky was allowed to tax them because it was the state of the owner’s domicile.
