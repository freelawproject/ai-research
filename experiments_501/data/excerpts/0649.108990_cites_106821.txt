 The subsequent year brought the institution of additional suits against other States, and caused considerable alarm and consternation in the country.  The issue was squarely presented to the Court in a suit brought at the August 1792 Term by two citizens of South Carolina, executors of a British creditor, against the State of Georgia.  After a year's postponement for preparation on the part of the State of Georgia, the Court, after argument, rendered in February 1793, its short-lived decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 .  The decision in that case, that a State was liable to suit by a citizen of another State or of a foreign country, literally shocked the Nation.  Sentiment for passage of a constitutional amendment to override the decision rapidly gained momentum, and five years after Chisholm the Eleventh Amendment was officially announced by President John Adams.  Unchanged since then, the Amendment provides: “The judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” While the Amendment by its terms does not bar suits against a State by its own citizens, this Court has con *663 sistently held that an unconsenting State is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by citizens of another State.  Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890); Duhne v. New Jersey, 251 U. S. 311 (1920); Great Northern Life Insurance Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47 (1944); Barden v. Terminal R. Co., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964); Employees v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973).  It is also well established that even though a State is not named a party to the action, the suit may nonetheless be barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  In Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, 323 U. S. 459 (1945), the Court said: “[W]hen the action is in essence one for the recovery of money from the state, the state is the real, substantial party in interest and is entitled to invoke its sovereign immunity from suit even though individual officials are nominal defendants.” Id., at 464 .  Thus the rule has evolved that a suit by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury is barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  Great Northern Life Insurance Co. v. Read, supra; Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm’n, 327 U. S. 573 (1946).  The Court of Appeals in this case, while recognizing that the Hans line of cases permitted the State to raise the Eleventh Amendment as a defense to suit by its own citizens, nevertheless concluded that the Amendment did not bar the award of retroactive payments of the statutory benefits found to have been wrongfully withheld.  The Court of Appeals held that the above-cited cases, when read in light of this Court's landmark decision in Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908), do not preclude *664 the grant of such a monetary award in the nature of equitable restitution.

 This Court, while affirming the judgment, did not in its opinion refer to or substantively treat the Eleventh Amendment argument.  Nor, of course, did the summary dispositions of the three District Court cases contain any substantive discussion of this or any other issues raised by the parties.  This case, therefore, is the first opportunity the Court has taken to fully explore and treat the Eleventh Amend *671 ment aspects of such relief in a written opinion.  Shapiro v. Thompson and these three summary affirmances obviously are of precedential value in support of the contention that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the relief awarded by the District Court in this case. Equally obviously, they are not of the same precedential value as would be an opinion of this Court treating the question on the merits.  Since we deal with a constitutional question, we are less constrained by the principle of stare decisis than we are in other areas of the law. 14 Having now had an opportunity to more fully consider the Eleventh Amendment issue after briefing and argument, we disapprove the Eleventh Amendment holdings of those cases to the extent that they are inconsistent with our holding today.  The Court of Appeals held in the alternative that even if the Eleventh Amendment be deemed a bar to the retroactive relief awarded respondent in this case, the State of Illinois had waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity and consented to the bringing of such a suit by participating in the federal AABD program.  The Court of Appeals relied upon our holdings in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964), and Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm’n, 359 U. S. 275 (1959), *672 and on the dissenting opinion of Judge Bright in Employees v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 452 F. 2d 820, 827 (CA8 1971).  While the holding in the latter case was ultimately affirmed by this Court in 411 U. S. 279 (1973), we do not think that the answer to the waiver question turns on the distinction between <citedDecision>Parden, supra,</citedDecision> and Employees, supra. Both <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> and Employees involved a congressional enactment which by its terms authorized suit by designated plaintiffs against a general class of defendants which literally included States or state instrumentalities.  Similarly, Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm’n, supra, involved congressional approval, pursuant to the Compact Clause, of a compact between Tennessee and Missouri, which provided that each compacting State would have the power “to contract, to sue, and be sued in its own name." The question of waiver or consent under the Eleventh Amendment was found in those cases to turn on whether Congress had intended to abrogate the immunity in question, and whether the State by its participation in the program authorized by Congress had in effect consented to the abrogation of that immunity.  But in this case the threshold fact of congressional authorization to sue a class of defendants which literally includes States is wholly absent.  Thus respondent is not only precluded from relying on this Court’s holding in Employees, but on this Court’s holdings in <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> and Petty as well.  15 *673 The Court of Appeals held that as a matter of federal law Illinois had “constructively consented” to this suit by participating in the federal AABD program and agreeing to administer federal and state funds in compliance with federal law. Constructive consent is not a doctrine commonly associated with the surrender of constitutional rights, and we see no place for it here.  In deciding whether a State has waived its constitutional protection under the Eleventh Amendment, we will find waiver only where stated “by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.” Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U. S. 151, 171 (1909).  We see no reason to retreat from the Court's statement in Great Northern Life Insurance Co. v. Read, 322 U. S., at 54 (footnote omitted): “[W]hen we are dealing with the sovereign exemption from judicial interference in the vital field of financial administration a clear declaration of the state’s intention to submit its fiscal problems to other courts than those of its own creation must be found.” The mere fact that a State participates in a program through which the Federal Government provides assistance for the operation by the State of a system of public aid is not sufficient to establish consent on the part of the State to be sued in the federal courts.  And while this Court has, in cases such as J. I.  Case Co. v. Borak, 377 *674 U. S. 426 (1964), authorized suits by one private party against another in order to effectuate a statutory purpose, it has never done so in the context of the Eleventh Amendment and a state defendant.  Since Employees, supra, where Congress had expressly authorized suits against a general class of defendants and the only thing left to implication was whether the described class of defendants included States, was decided adversely to the putative plaintiffs on the waiver question, surely this respondent must also fail on that issue.

Me. Justice Marshall, with whom Mr. Justice Blackmun joins, dissenting.  The Social Security Act’s categorical assistance programs, including the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD) program involved here, are fundamentally different from most federal legislation.  Unlike the Fair Labor Standards Act involved in last Term’s decision in Employees v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973), or the Federal Employers’ Liability Act-at issue in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964), the Social Security Act does not impose federal standards and liability upon all who engage in certain regulated activities, including often-unwilling state agencies.  Instead, the Act seeks to induce state participation in the federal welfare programs by offering federal matching funds in exchange for the State’s voluntary assumption of the Act’s requirements.  I find this basic distinction crucial: it leads me to conclude that by participation in the programs, the States waive whatever immunity they might otherwise have from federal court *689 orders requiring retroactive payment of welfare benefits.  1 In its contacts with the Social Security Act’s assistance programs in recent years, the Court has frequently described the Act as a “scheme of cooperative federalism.” See, e. g., King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309, 316 (1968); Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U. S. 535, 542 (1972).  While this phrase captures a number of the unique characteristics of these programs, for present purposes it serves to emphasize that the States’ decision to participate in the programs is a voluntary one.  In deciding to participate, however, the States necessarily give up their freedom to operate assistance programs for the needy as they see fit, and bind themselves to conform their programs to the requirements of the federal statute and regulations.  As the Court explained in King v. Smith, supra, at 316-317 (citations omitted): “States are not required to participate in the program, but those which desire to take advantage of the substantial federal funds available for distribution to needy children [or needy aged, blind or disabled] are required to submit an AFDC [or AABD] plan for the approval of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).

 .  .” Id., at 296 .  A finding of waiver here is also consistent with the reasoning of the majority in Employees , which relied on a distinction between “governmental” and “proprietary” functions of state government.  Id., at 284-285 .  This distinction apparently recognizes that if sovereign immunity is to be at all meaningful, the Court must be reluctant to hold a State to have waived its immunity simply by acting in its sovereign capacity — i.  e., by merely performing its “governmental” functions.  On the other hand, in launching a profitmaking enterprise, “a State leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own,” <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> v. Terminal R. Co., <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 196</citedDecision> , and a voluntary waiver of sovereign immunity can more easily be found. While conducting an assistance program for the needy is surely a “governmental” function, the State here has done far more than operate its own program in its sovereign capacity.  It has voluntarily subordinated its sovereignty in this matter to that of the Federal Government, and agreed to comply with the conditions imposed *696 by Congress upon the expenditure of federal funds.  In entering this federal-state cooperative program, the State again “leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own,” and similarly may more readily be found to have voluntarily waived its immunity.  Indeed, this is the lesson to be drawn from this Court’s decision in Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm’n, 359 U. S. 275 (1959), where the Court found that the States had waived the sovereign immunity of the Commission by joining in an interstate compact subject to the approval of Congress.  The Court in Petty emphasized that it was “called on to interpret not unilateral state action but the terms of a consensual agreement” between the States and Congress, id., at 279 ; and held that the States who join such a consensual agreement, “by accepting it and acting under it assume the conditions that Congress under the Constitution attached.” Id., at 281-282 .  Although the congressional intent regarding the sue-and-be-sued clause was by no means certain, the Court held that the surrounding conditions made it clear that the States accepting it waived their sovereign immunity, id., at 280 , especially since this interpretation was necessary to keep the compact “a living interstate agreement which performs high functions in our federalism.” Id., at 279 .  I find the approach in Petty controlling here.
