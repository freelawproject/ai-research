**Dissenting Opinion**
Me. Justice Reed, dissenting: These cases present for solution the problem of the constitutionality of certain municipal ordinances levying a tax for the production of revenue on the sale of books *118 and pamphlets in the streets or from door to door.  Decisions sustaining the particular ordinances were entered in the three cases first listed at the last term of this Court. In that opinion the ordinances were set out and the facts and issues stated.  Jones v. Opelika, <citedDecision>316 U. S. 584</citedDecision> .  A rehearing has been granted.  The present judgments vacate the old and invalidate the ordinances.  The eight cases of this term involve canvassing from door to door only under similar ordinances, which are in the form stated in the Court’s opinion.  By a per curiam opinion of this day, the Court affirms its acceptance of the arguments presented by the dissent of last term in <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Opelika</citedDecision> .  The Court states its position anew in the Jeannette cases. This dissent does not deal with an objection which theoretically could be made in each case, to wit, that the licenses are so excessive in amount as to be prohibitory.  This matter is not considered because that defense is not relied upon in the pleadings, the briefs or at the bar.  No evidence is offered to show the amount is oppressive.  An unequal tax, levied on the activities of distributors of informatory publications, would be a phase of discrimination against the freedom of speech, press or religion.  Nor do we deal with discrimination against the petitioners, as individuals or as members of the group, calling themselves Jehovah’s Witnesses.  There is no contention in any of these cases that such discrimination is practiced in the application of the ordinances.

 The evidence is conclusive that the Witnesses normally approach a prospect with an offer of a book for twenty-five cents.  Sometimes, apparently rarely, a book is left with a prospect without payment.  The quid pro quo is demanded.  If the profit was greater, twenty cents or even one dollar, no difference in principle would emerge.  The Witness sells books to raise money for propagandizing his faith, just as other religious groups might sponsor bazaars, or peddle tickets to church suppers, or sell Bibles or prayer books for the same object.  However high the purpose or noble the aims of the Witness, the transaction has been found by the state courts to be a sale under their ordinances and, though our doubt was greater than it is, the state's conclusion would influence us to follow its determination.  1 *120 In the opinion in Jones v. Opelika, <citedDecision>316 U. S. 584</citedDecision> , on the former hearing, attention was called to the differentiation between these cases of taxation and those of forbidden censorship, prohibition or discrimination.  There is no occasion to repeat what has been written so recently as to the constitutional right to tax the money-raising activities of religious or didactic groups.  There are, however, other reasons, not fully developed in that opinion, that add to our conviction that the Constitution does not prohibit these general occupational taxes.  The real contention of the Witnesses is that there can be no taxation of the occupation of selling books and pamphlets because to do so would be contrary to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which now is held to have drawn the contents of the First Amendment into the category of individual rights protected *121 from state deprivation.  Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, 666 ; Near v. Minnesota, 283 U. S. 697, 707 ; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 303 .  Since the publications teach a religion which conforms to our standards of legality, it is urged that these ordinances prohibit the free exercise of religion and abridge the freedom of speech and of the press.  The First Amendment reads as follows: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.” It was one of twelve proposed on September 25, 1789, to the States by the First Congress after the adoption of the Constitution.

 The distributors of religious literature, possibly of all informatory publications, become today privileged to carry on their occupations without contributing their share to the support of the government which provides the opportunity for the exercise of their liberties.  Nor do we think it can be said, properly, that these sales of religious books are religious exercises.  The opinion of the Court in the Jeannette cases emphasizes for the first time the argument that the sale of books and pamphlets is in itself a religious practice.  The Court says the Witnesses “spread their interpretations of the Bible and their religious beliefs largely through the hand distribution of literature by full or part time workers.” “The hand distribution of religious tracts is an age-old form of missionary evangelism — as old as the history of printing presses.” “It is more than preaching; it is more than distribution of religious literature.  It is a combination of both.  Its purpose is as evangelical as the revival meeting.  This form of religious activity occupies the same high estate under the First Amendment as do worship in the churches and preaching from the pulpits.” “Those who can tax the exercise of this religious practice can make its exercise so costly as to deprive it of the resources necessary for its maintenance.” “The judgment in <citedDecision>Jones</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Opelika</citedDecision> has this day been vacated.  Freed from that controlling precedent, we can restore to their high, constitutional position the liberties of itinerant evangelists who disseminate their religious beliefs and the tenets of their faith through distribution of literature.” The record shows that books entitled “Creation” and “Salvation,” as well as Bibles, were offered for sale.  We shall assume the first two publications, also, are religious books.  Certainly there can be no dissent from the statement that *132 selling religious books is an age-old practice, or that it is evangelism in the sense that the distributors hope the readers will be spiritually benefited.  That does not carry us to the conviction, however, that when distribution of religious books is made at a price, the itinerant colporteur is performing a religious rite, is worshipping his Creator in his way.  Many sects practice healing the sick as an evidence of their religious faith or maintain orphanages or homes for the aged or teach the young.  These are, of course, in a sense, religious practices but hardly such examples of religious rites as are encompassed by the prohibition against the free exercise of religion.  And even if the distribution of religious books was a religious practice protected from regulation by the First Amendment, certainly the affixation of a price for the articles would destroy the sacred character of the transaction.  The evangelist becomes also a book agent.  The rites which are protected by the First Amendment are in essence spiritual — prayer, mass, sermons, sacrament — not sales of religious goods.  The card furnished each Witness to identify him as an ordained minister does not go so far as to say the sale is a rite.  It states only that the Witnesses worship by exhibiting to people “the message of said gospel in printed form, such as the Bible, books, booklets and magazines, and thus afford the people the opportunity of learning of God’s gracious provision for them.” On the back of the card appears: “You may contribute twenty-five cents to the Lord’s work and receive a copy of this beautiful book.” The sale of these religious books has, we think, relation to their religious exercises, similar to the “information march,” said by the Witnesses to be one of their “ways of worship” and by this Court to be subject to regulation by license in Cox v. New Hampshire, 312 U. S. 569, 572, 573, 576 .  The attempted analogy in the dissenting opinion in Jones v. Opelika, <citedDecision>316 U. S. 584, 609, 611</citedDecision> , which now be *133 comes the decision of this Court, between the forbidden burden of a state tax for the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce and a state tax on the privilege of engaging in the distribution of religious literature is wholly irrelevant.  A state tax on the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce is held invalid because the regulation of commerce between the states has been delegated to the Federal Government.  This grant includes' the necessary means to carry the grant into effect and forbids state burdens without Congressional consent.  16 It is not the power to tax interstate commerce which is interdicted, but the exercise of that power by an unauthorized sovereign, the individual state.  Although the fostering of commerce was one of the chief purposes for organizing the present Government, that commerce may be burdened with a tax by the United States.  Internal Revenue Code, § 3469.  Commerce must pay its way.
