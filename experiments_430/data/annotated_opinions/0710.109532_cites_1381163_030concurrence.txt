 “In each of the comparison cases cited, the records show that the accused was found guilty of murder of the victim of the robbery or burglary committed in the course of such robbery or burglary.  In each of those cases, the jury imposed the sentence of death.  In Pass v. State, supra, the murder took place in the victim’s home, as occurred in the case under consideration.  “We find that the sentence of death in this case is not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.  Code Ann. § 27-2537 (c) (3).  Notwithstanding the fact that there have been cases in which robbery victims were murdered and the juries imposed life sentences (see Appendix), the cited cases show that juries faced with similar factual situations have imposed death sentences.  Compare Coley v. State, 231 Ga. 829, 835 , supra. Thus the sentence here was not ‘wantonly and freakishly imposed’ (see above).” Moore v.

Apparently the State of Georgia wishes to supply a substantial incentive to those engaged *222 in robbery to leave their guns at home and to persuade their co-conspirators to do the same in the hope that fewer victims of robberies will be killed.  Petitioner states several times without citation that the only cases considered by the Georgia Supreme Court are those in which an appeal was taken either from a sentence of death or life imprisonment.  This view finds no support in the language of the relevant statutes.  Moore v. State, 233 Ga., at 863-864, <citedDecision>213 S. E. 2d, at 832</citedDecision> .
