**Concurrence Opinion**
 In its examination of Rhode Island’s statute, the Court of Appeals erroneously concluded that the Twenty-first Amendment provided an “added presumption in favor of the validity of the state regulation.” 39 F. 3d, at 7-9 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Twenty-first Amendment cannot save an otherwise invalid restriction on speech.  Nothing in the Amendment’s text or history justifies its use to alter the application of the First Amendment.  “[0]ur prior cases have made clear that the [Twenty-first] Amend *533 ment does not license the States to ignore their obligations under other provisions of the Constitution.” Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 712 (1984).  See also Larkin v. Grendel's Den, Inc., 459 U. S. 116, 122, n. 5 (1982) (“The State may not exercise its power under the Twenty-first Amendment in a way which impinges upon the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment”); Craig, supra, at 206 (“Neither the text nor the history of the Twenty-first Amendment suggests that it qualifies individual rights protected by the Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment where the sale or use of liquor is concerned” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The Twenty-first Amendment does not trump First Amendment rights or add a presumption of validity to a regulation that cannot otherwise satisfy First Amendment requirements.  The Court of Appeals relied on California v. LaRue, <citedDecision>409 U. S. 109, 118-119</citedDecision> (1972), for its determination that the Twenty-first Amendment provided an “added presumption” of the regulation’s validity.  There, this Court upheld a State’s regulations prohibiting establishments licensed to sell liquor by the drink from offering explicitly sexual entertainment.  As we recently explained in Coors, “LaRue did not involve commercial speech about alcohol, but instead concerned the regulation of nude dancing in places where alcohol was served.” 514 U. S., at 483, n. 2 .  The cases following <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> similarly involved the regulation of nude or nearly nude dancing in establishments licensed to serve alcohol.  New York State Liquor Authority v. Bellanca, 452 U. S. 714 (1981) (per curiam); Newport v. Iacobucci, 479 U. S. 92 (1986) (per curiam).  Nothing in <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> suggested that the Twenty-first Amendment would permit a State to prohibit the kind of speech at issue here, and as discussed above, the text and history of the Twenty-first Amendment clearly indicate that the Amendment was not intended to supplant the general application of constitutional provisions, except for its limited exception to the Commerce Clause’s normal *534 operation.  Indeed, <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> notes that prior decisions “did not go so far as to hold or say that the Twenty-first Amendment supersedes all other provisions of the United States Constitution in the area of liquor regulations,” <citedDecision>409 U. S., at 115</citedDecision> , and <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> certainly does not stand for that proposition.  The Court of Appeals’ reliance on <citedDecision>LaRue</citedDecision> was misplaced.  Rhode Island’s prohibition on alcohol-price advertising, as a means to keep alcohol prices high and consumption low, cannot survive First Amendment scrutiny.  The Twenty-first Amendment cannot save this otherwise invalid regulation.  While I agree with the Court’s finding that the regulation is invalid, I would decide that issue on narrower grounds.  I therefore concur in the judgment.
