 .  .  the trial by jury ever has been, and I trust ever will be, looked upon as the glory of the English law. And if it has so great an advantage over others in regulating civil property, how much must that advantage be heightened when it is applied to criminal cases!  ... [I]t is the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy, or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his *10 liberty, or his person, but by the unanimous consent of twelve of his neighbours and equals.” 13 Trial by jury in a court of law and in accordance with traditional modes of procedure after an indictment by grand jury has served and remains one of our most vital barriers to governmental arbitrariness.  These elemental procedural safeguards were embedded in our Constitution to.  secure their inviolateness and sanctity against the passing demands of expediency or convenience.  The keystone of supporting authorities mustered by the Court’s opinion last June to justify its holding that Art. Ill, § 2, and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not apply abroad was In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> .  The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case is one of those cases that cannot be understood except in its peculiar setting; even then, it seems highly unlikely that a similar result would be reached today.  Ross was serving as a seaman on an American ship in Japanese waters.  He killed a ship’s officer, was seized and tried before a consular “court” in Japan.  At that time, statutes authorized American consuls to try American citizens charged with committing crimes in Japan and certain other “non-Christian” countries.  14 These *11 statutes provided that the laws of the United States were to govern the trial except: “.  .  .  where such laws are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies, the common law and the law of equity and admiralty shall be extended in like manner over such citizens and others in those countries; and if neither the common law, nor the law of equity or admiralty, nor the statutes of the United States, furnish appropriate and sufficient remedies, the ministers in those countries, respectively, shall, by decrees and regulations which shall have the force of law, supply such defects and deficiencies.” 15 The consular power approved in the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case was about as extreme and absolute as that of the potentates of the “non-Christian” countries to which the statutes applied.  Under these statutes consuls could and did make the criminal laws, initiate charges, arrest alleged offenders, try them, and after conviction take away their liberty or their life — sometimes at the American consulate.  Such a blending of executive, legislative, and judicial powers in one person or even in one branch of the Government is ordinarily regarded as the very acme of absolutism.  16 Nevertheless, the Court sustained Ross’ conviction by the consul.  It stated that constitutional *12 protections applied “only to citizens and others within the United States, or who are brought there for trial for alleged offences committed elsewhere, and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad.” 17 Despite the fact that it upheld Ross’ conviction under United States laws passed pursuant to asserted constitutional authority, the Court went on to make a sweeping declaration that “[t]he Constitution can have no operation in another country.” 18 The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> approach that the Constitution has no applicability abroad has long since been directly repudiated by numerous cases. 19 That approach is obviously erroneous if the United States Government, which has no power except that granted by the Constitution, can and does try citizens for crimes committed abroad.  20 Thus the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case rested, at least in substantial part, on a fundamental misconception and the most that can be said in support of the result reached there is that the consular court jurisdiction had a long history antedating the adoption of the Constitution.  The Congress has recently buried the consular system of trying Americans.  21 We are not willing to jeopardize the lives and liberties of Americans by disinterring it.  At best, the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case should be left as a relic from a different era.  The Court’s opinion last Term alsp relied on the “Insular Cases” to support its conclusion that Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were not applicable *13 to the trial of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert.  22 We believe that reliance was misplaced.  The “Insular Cases,” which arose at the turn of the century, involved territories which had only recently been conquered or acquired by the United States.  These territories, governed and regulated by Congress under Art. IV, § 3, 23 had entirely different cultures and customs from those of this country.  This Court, although closely divided, 24 ruled that certain constitutional safeguards were not applicable to these territories since they had not been “expressly or impliedly incorporated” into the Union by Congress.  While conceding that “fundamental” constitutional rights applied everywhere, 25 the majority found that it would disrupt long-established practices and would be inexpedient to require a jury trial after an indictment by a grand jury in the insular possessions.

 the real master of society.  ... All the sovereigns who have chosen to govern by their own authority, and to direct society instead of obeying its directions, have destroyed or enfeebled the institution of the jury.” 1 De Tocqueville, Democracy in America (Reeve trans. 1948 ed.), 282-283.  Rev. Stat. §§ 4083-4130 (1878).  Id., §4086.
