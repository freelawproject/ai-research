No warrant was obtained. Ross was charged with possession of heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U. S. C. § 841(a). Prior to trial, he moved to suppress the heroin found in the paper bag and the currency found in the leather pouch. After an eviden-tiary hearing, the District Court denied the motion to suppress. The heroin and currency were introduced in evidence at trial and Ross was convicted. A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction. It held that the police had probable cause to stop and search Ross’ car and that, under Carroll v. United <targetCase>States, supra</targetCase>, and Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42, the officers lawfully could search the automobile — including its trunk — without a warrant. The court considered separately, however, the warrantless search of the two containers found in the trunk. On the basis of Arkansas v. Sanders, *802 442 U. S. 753, the court concluded that the constitutionality of a warrantless search of a container found in an automobile depends on whether the owner possesses a reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents. Applying that test, the court held that the warrantless search of the paper bag was valid but the search of the leather pouch was not. The court remanded for a new trial at which the items taken from the paper bag, but not those from the leather pouch, could be admitted. 2 The entire Court of Appeals then voted to rehear the case en banc. A majority of the court rejected the panel’s conclusion that a distinction of constitutional significance existed between the two containers found in respondent’s trunk; it held that the police should not have opened either container without first obtaining a warrant.

The rules as applied in particular cases may appear unsatisfactory. They reflect, however, a reasoned application of the more general rule that if an individual gives the police probable cause to believe a vehicle is transporting contraband, he loses the right to proceed on his way without official interference. After reviewing the relevant authorities at some length, the Court concluded that the probable-cause requirement was satisfied in the case before it. The Court held that “the facts and circumstances within [the officers’] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief *809 that intoxicating liquor was being transported in the automobile which they stopped and searched.” 267 U. S., at 162. Cf. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176-177; Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98, 102. See Husty v. United States, 282 U. S. 694; Scher v. United States, 305 U. S. 251; Brinegar v. United <targetCase>States, supra</targetCase>; Henry v. United <targetCase>States, supra</targetCase>; Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U. S. 216; Chambers v. Maroney, supra; Texas v. White, supra; Colorado v. Bannister, 449 U. S. 1. Warrantless searches of automobiles have been upheld in a variety of factual contexts quite different from that presented in Carroll. Cf. Cooper v. California, 386 U. S. 58; Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U. S. 433; South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364. Many of these searches do not require a showing of probable cause that the vehicle contains contraband. We are not called upon to — and do not — consider in this case the scope of the war-rantless search that is permitted in those cases.
