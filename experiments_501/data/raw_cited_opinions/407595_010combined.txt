      <p class="indent">On January 20, 1977, an assortment<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a> of firearms was seized by agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.  Following an indictment under <span class="citation no-link">18 U.S.C. &#167; 922</span>(a)(1), Mulcahey was tried by a jury and on March 16, 1977 was acquitted of the charge.  The present action in rem against the same assortment of firearms was initiated on March 31, 1977 by service of a complaint seeking forfeiture pursuant to <span class="citation no-link">18 U.S.C. &#167; 924</span>(d).  Mulcahey, as claimant, filed a claim for recovery of the firearms and also filed an answer to the complaint.  The parties entered into a stipulation that the transcript in the criminal trial of United States v. Mulcahey, No. 77-00013, would be submitted to the court in lieu of testimony.  Upon motion of the United States prior to trial, the district court struck Mulcahey's second defense of collateral estoppel, res judicata and the bar to the present proceedings of the jury verdict in No. 77-00013.  Upon trial of the forfeiture the same firearms which had been seized by the ATF and used by the United States Attorney as evidence in the criminal action were again introduced into evidence.  The district court ordered a forfeiture of 80 of the firearms.  The court concluded:</p>

      <p>Yet, where an issue raised as to the existence of the act or fact denounced has been tried in a criminal proceeding, instituted by the United States, and a judgment of acquittal has been rendered in favor of a particular person, that judgment is conclusive in favor of such person, on subsequent trial of a suit in rem by the United States, where, as against him, the existence of the same act or fact is the matter in issue, as a cause for the forfeiture of the property prosecuted in such suit in rem.  It is urged as a reason for not allowing such effect to the judgment, that the acquittal in the criminal case may have taken place because of the rule requiring guilt to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt; and that, on the same evidence, on the question of preponderance of proof, there might be a verdict for the United States, in the suit in rem.  Nevertheless, the fact or act has been put in issue and determined against the United States; and all that is imposed by the statute, as a consequence of guilt, is a punishment therefor.  There could be no new trial of the criminal prosecution after the acquittal in it; and a subsequent trial of the civil suit amounts to substantially the same thing, with a difference only in the consequences following a judgment adverse to the claimant.</p>

Coffey involved a forfeiture action commenced after an acquittal.  This Court noted, in holding the forfeiture barred, that "(t)he information (for forfeiture) is founded on &#167;&#167; 3257, 3450 and 3453; and there is no question, on the averments in the answer, that the fraudulent acts and attempts and intents to defraud, alleged in the prior criminal information, and covered by the verdict and judgment of acquittal, embraced all of the acts, attempts and intents averred in the information in this suit."  Id., at 442, 6 S.Ct., at 440.  The Court specifically distinguished the situation where "a certain intent must be proved to support the indictment, which need not be proved to support the civil action."

      <p class="indent">The present case is not controlled by One Lot Emerald Cut Stones.  The stones which were the subject of the forfeiture in that case became contraband and subject to seizure once they came into the United States without payment of the required duty.  The criminal action for alleged smuggling of these stones proved only that the holder of the stones did not knowingly with the intent to defraud the United States smuggle the articles into the country.  Intent to defraud was not an issue in the later forfeiture proceeding and did not need to be proved, because the stones were admittedly in the United States without being subjected to required customs proceedings and as a result were contraband, subject to seizure.  Firearms are not contraband and are not subject to seizure unless they are used or intended to be used in violation of the Gun Control Act.  This issue of whether the firearms were used or intended to be used in violation of the Act was tried in No. 77-00013 and conclusively decided.

The forfeiture provision is merely a way of disposing of the firearms which have been used in violation of the Act, after there is a conviction of such violation.  Forfeiture is a penalty suffered by a defendant in addition to a fine and/or imprisonment.  If Mulcahey had been convicted, he could have been fined and/or imprisoned and would have lost all of his firearms under &#167; 924(d).  But he was acquitted on the charge of being a gun dealer without a license.  However, the government still wishes to invoke the penalty of &#167; 924(d).

      <p class="indent">In oral argument before us, counsel for Mulcahey conceded that he asserted entrapment as a defense in his trial for violation of <span class="citation no-link">18 U.S.C. &#167; 922</span>(a)(1), and that defense was submitted to the jury.  Of course, in returning a verdict of not guilty, the jury did not specify the grounds of acquittal, but it is as equally possible that the jury found that Mulcahey was engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license, but had been entrapped into committing an illegal sale, as found that Mulcahey was not so engaged.  Thus in our view, the majority errs when it confidently asserts that the jury verdict in the criminal action conclusively settled the issue that Mulcahey was not engaged in the business of dealing in firearms without a license.</p>

      <p class="indent">But irrespective of the factual issue of Mulcahey's guilt or innocence, we remain convinced that the forfeiture provisions of <span class="citation no-link">18 U.S.C. &#167; 924</span>(d) are civil in nature so that any determination in the criminal prosecution is irrelevant to a decision of forfeiture.  Our conclusion is reinforced by the language of that subsection.  It states disjunctively that "(a)ny firearm involved in or used or intended to be used in, any violation of this chapter ... shall be subject to seizure and forfeiture ..." (emphasis added).  <span class="citation no-link">Id.</span>  Nothing in the provision of &#167; 922 under which Mulcahey was prosecuted renders an intention to engage in the business of dealing in firearms without a license illegal.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a>  Only the completed act of engaging in the prohibited business is rendered unlawful.  It is at once apparent that the forfeiture provisions of the Act were intended by Congress to be broader in scope than the criminal sanctions.  This is persuasive evidence that Congress did not intend forfeitures to be an additional penalty for the commission of a criminal act but rather that they be a separate civil sanction, remedial in nature,</p>

        <p> While the majority asserts that the "issue of whether the firearms were used or intended to be used in violation of the Act was tried ... and conclusively decided" (emphasis added) in the earlier criminal case, the emphasized portion of that statement lacks record support.  Mulcahey was indicted and acquitted for a violation of <span class="citation no-link">18 U.S.C. &#167; 922</span>(a)(1) which provides:</p>
        <p>(a) It shall be unlawful-</p>
        <p>(1) for any person, except a licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer, to engage in the business of importing, manufacturing, or dealing in firearms or ammunition, or in the course of such business to ship, transport, or receive any firearm or ammunition in interstate or foreign commerce.</p>
        <p>Manifestly the question of whether Mulcahey intended to use the firearms he possessed in violation of the statute was neither an issue nor was it decided in his criminal trial.</p>
