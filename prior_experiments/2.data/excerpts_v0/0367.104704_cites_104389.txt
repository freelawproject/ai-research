Passage 1:
as a customs inspector suing for injuries sustained when a ship's ladder broke. The opinion said. 317 U.S. at 577, "The sole question here is whether the Suits in Admiralty Act makes private operators such as respondent nonsuable for their torts."[9] Cf. Caldarola v. Eckert, 332 U.S. at 159-160.
As to the second conclusion, we are unable to perceive in the statutes relating to sailors' rights or the history *790 behind their enactment any legislative purpose to create in seamen employees of the United States through the War Shipping Administration a right to enforce tort claims under the Jones Act against others than their employers or any recognition that such right ever existed. The Jones Act was welfare legislation that created new rights in seamen for damages arising from maritime torts. As welfare legislation, this statute is entitled to a liberal construction to accomplish its beneficent purposes. Compare Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 318 U.S. 724; American Stevedores v. Porello, <targetCase>330 U.S. 446</targetCase>. In considering similar legislation in other fields, we have concluded that Congress intended that the purposes of such enactments should not be restricted by common-law concepts of control so as to bar from welfare legislation as independent contractors persons who were as a matter of economic reality a part of the processes and dependent upon the businesses to which they rendered service.[10]
The issue in this case is whether a construction of the Jones Act carrying out the intention of Congress to grant those new rights to seamen against their employers requires or permits a holding that the general agent under the contract here in question is an employer under the Jones Act. The decision depends upon the interpretation of the contract between respondent and Cosmopolitan on one hand and that between Cosmopolitan and the United States on the other. We assume, without deciding, that the rule of the Hearst case applies, that is, the word "employment" should be construed so as to give

[11]  But compare Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 237 U.S. 84, 94:

"We are of the opinion that Congress used the words `employe' and `employed' in the statute in their natural sense, and intended to describe the conventional relation of employer and employe."
Hull v. Philadelphia & Reading R. Co., 252 U.S. 475.
[12]  It is much the same type of problem as was presented in Bartels v. Birmingham, 332 U.S. 126. There we concluded that the leader and organizer of a traveling orchestra was the employer of the band members rather than the various dance hall proprietors for whom the orchestra performed.

For the background of the statutory distinctions drawn between public vessels and merchant vessels, see Canadian Aviator, Ltd. v. United States, 324 U.S. 215, 218-22; American Stevedores v. Porello, <targetCase>330 U.S. 446</targetCase>, 450-54.
[14]  Although Congress has not enacted legislation to make entirely clear the remedies of W.S.A. seamen against the United States for torts, there has been an effort to do so. H.R. 4873, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., sought to do so by amending the Suits in Admiralty Act, ยง 5, 41 Stat. 525, 526, so as to make the remedy in admiralty of that act exclusive as to the same subject matter so as to protect the general agent from suits such as Hust or Caldarola. The bill was passed by the House June 8, 1948, 94 Cong. Rec. 7388-89, but was not passed by the Senate. H.R. 483 and 4051 of the 81st Cong., 1st Sess., to the same effect, are now pending. In H.R. Rep. No. 2060 on H.R. 4873, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., the Committee on the Judiciary said, p. 2:

"Then the Supreme Court on June 23, 1947, handed down its decision in Caldarola v. Eckert (332 U.S. 155), which clarified, in the opinion of the committee, the rule previously announced so as to make it plain that the agent while liable for the n
