 The record does not reveal how Gonzales obtained its certification as a small disadvantaged business.  After losing the guardrail subcontract to Gonzales, Ada-rand filed suit against various federal officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, claiming that the race-based presumptions involved in the use of subcontracting compensation clauses violate Adarand’s right to equal protection.  The District Court granted the Government’s motion for summary judgment.  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner, 790 F. Supp. 240 (1992).  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  16 F. 3d 1637 (1994).  It understood our decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448</citedDecision> (1980), to have adopted “a lenient standard, resembling intermediate scrutiny, in assessing” the constitutionality of federal race-based action.  16 F. 3d, at 1544.  Applying that “lenient standard,” as further developed in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 647 (1990), the Court of Appeals upheld the use of subcontractor compensation clauses.  16 F. 3d, at 1547.  We granted certiorari.  512 U. S. 1288 (1994).  II Adarand, in addition to its general prayer for “such other and further relief as to the Court seems just and equitable,” specifically seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against any future use of subcontractor compensation clauses.

 In a passage joined by Justice White, Justice Powell wrote that “[t]he guarantee of equal protection cannot mean one thing when applied to one individual and something else when applied to a person of another color.” 438 U. S., at 289-290 .  He concluded that “[r]acial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination.” Id., at 291 .  On the other hand, four Justices in Bakke would have applied a less stringent standard of review to racial classifications “designed to further remedial purposes,” see id., at 359 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  And four Justices thought the case should be decided on statutory grounds.  Id., at 411-412, 421 (Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart and Rehn *219 quist, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Two years after Bakke , the Court faced another challenge to remedial race-based action, this time involving action undertaken by the Federal Government.  In Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448</citedDecision> (1980), the Court upheld Congress’ inclusion of a 10% set-aside for minority-owned businesses in the Public Works Employment Act of 1977.  As in Bakke , there was no opinion for the Court. Chief Justice Burger, in an opinion joined by Justices White and Powell, observed that “[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination to make sure that it does not conflict with constitutional guarantees.” <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 491</citedDecision> .  That opinion, however, “d[id] not adopt, either expressly or implicitly, the formulas of analysis articulated in such cases as <citedDecision>[Bakke] ” Id., at 492</citedDecision> .  It employed instead a two-part test which asked, first, “whether the objectives of th[e] legislation are within the power of Congress,” and second, “whether the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria, in the context presented, is a constitutionally permissible means for achieving the congressional objectives.” <citedDecision>Id., at 473</citedDecision> .  It then upheld the program under that test, adding at the end of the opinion that the program also “would survive judicial review under either ‘test’ articulated in the several Bakke opinions.” Id., at 492.  Justice Powell wrote separately to express his view that the plurality opinion had essentially applied “strict scrutiny” as described in his Bakke opinion — i.  e., it had determined that the set-aside was “a necessary means of advancing a compelling governmental interest” — and had done so correctly.  <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> (concurring opinion).  Justice Stewart (joined by then-Justice Rehnquist) dissented, arguing that the Constitution required the Federal Government to meet the same strict standard as the States when enacting racial classifications, <citedDecision>id., at 523</citedDecision> , and n. 1, and that the program before the Court failed that standard.  Justice Stevens also dis *220 sented, arguing that “[rjacial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification,” <citedDecision>id., at 537</citedDecision> , and that the program before the Court could not be characterized “as a ‘narrowly tailored’ remedial measure.” <citedDecision>Id., at 541</citedDecision> .  Justice Marshall (joined by Justices Brennan and Blackmun) concurred in the judgment, reiterating the view of four Justices in Bakke that any race-based governmental action designed to “remed[y] the present effects of past racial discrimination” should be upheld if it was “substantially related” to the achievement of an “important governmental objective”— i.  e., such action should be subjected only to what we now call “intermediate scrutiny.” <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 518-519</citedDecision> .  In Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), the Court considered a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to another form of remedial racial classification.  The issue in Wygant was whether a school board could adopt race-based preferences in determining which teachers to lay off.  Justice Powell’s plurality opinion observed that “the level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification operates against a group that historically has not been subject to governmental discrimination,” id., at 273 , and stated the two-part inquiry as “whether the layoff provision is supported by a compelling state purpose and whether the means chosen to accomplish that purpose are narrowly tailored.” Id., at 274 .  In other words, “racial classifications of any sort must be subjected to ‘strict scrutiny.’” Id., at 285 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  The plurality then concluded that the school board’s interest in “providing minority role models for its minority students, as an attempt to alleviate the effects of societal discrimination,” id., at 274 , was not a compelling interest that could justify the use of a racial classification.  It added that “[sjocietal discrimination, without more, is too amorphous a basis for imposing a racially classified remedy,” id., at 276 , and insisted instead that “a public employer ... must *221 ensure that, before it embarks on an affirmative-action program, it has convincing evidence that remedial action is warranted.
**Lead Opinion**
 Justice White concurred only in the judgment, although he agreed that the school board’s asserted interests could not, “singly or together, justify this racially discriminatory layoff policy.” Id., at 295 .  Four Justices dissented, three of whom again argued for intermediate scrutiny of remedial race-based government action.  Id., at 301-302 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting).  The Court’s failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove, and Wygant left unresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-based governmental action.  See United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S., at 166 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.) (“[Although this Court has consistently held that some elevated level of scrutiny is required when a racial or ethnic distinction is made for remedial purposes, it has yet to reach consensus on the appropriate constitutional analysis”); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 480 (1986) (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.).  Lower courts found this lack of guidance unsettling.  See, e. g., Kromnick v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 739 F. 2d 894 , 901 (CA3 1984) (“The absence of an Opinion of the Court in either Bakke or <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> and the concomitant failure of the Court to articulate an analytic framework supporting the judgments makes the position of the lower federal courts considering the constitutionality of affirmative action programs somewhat vulnerable”), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1107 (1985); Williams v. New Orleans, 729 F. 2d 1554, 1567 (CA5 1984) (en banc) (Hig-ginbotham, J., concurring specially); South Florida Chapter of Associated General Contractors of America, Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., 723 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA11), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 871 (1984).  The Court resolved the issue, at least in part, in 1989.  Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), concerned a *222 city’s determination that 30% of its contracting work should go to minority-owned businesses.  A majority of the Court in Croson held that “the standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification,” and that the single standard of review for racial classifications should be “strict scrutiny.” Id., at 493-494 (opinion of O’Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (“I agree ... with Justice O’Connor’s conclusion that strict scrutiny must be applied to all governmental classification by race”).  As to the classification before the Court, the plurality agreed that “a state or local subdivision .  .  .  has the authority to eradicate the effects of private discrimination within its own legislative jurisdiction,” id., at 491-492 , but the Court thought that the city had not acted with “a ‘strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary,’” id., at 500 (majority opinion) (quoting Wygant, supra, at 277 (plurality opinion)).  The Court also thought it “obvious that [the] program is not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination.” 488 U. S., at 508 .  With Croson, the Court finally agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict scrutiny of all race-based action by state and local governments.  But Croson of course had no occasion to declare what standard of review the Fifth Amendment requires for such action taken by the Federal Government.  Croson observed simply- that the Court’s “treatment of an exercise of congressional power in Fulli-love cannot be dispositive here,” because Croson’s facts did not implicate Congress’ broad power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id., at 491 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 522 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (“[Wjithout revisiting what we held in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> ... , I do not believe our decision in that case controls the one before us here”).  On the other hand, the Court subsequently indicated that Croson had at least some bearing on federal race-based ac *223 tion when it vacated a decision upholding such action and remanded for further consideration in light of Croson.  H. K. Porter Co. v. Metropolitan Dade County, 489 U. S. 1062 (1989); see also Shurberg Broadcasting of Hartford, Inc. v. FCC, 876 F. 2d 902, 915, n. 16 (CADC 1989) (opinion of Silber-man, J.) (noting the Court’s action in H. K. Porter Co.), rev’d sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990).  Thus, some uncertainty persisted with respect to the standard of review for federal racial classifications.  See, e. g., Mann v. Albany, 883 F. 2d 999, 1006 (CA11 1989) (Cro-son “may be applicable to race-based classifications imposed by Congress”); Shurberg, 876 F. 2d, at 910 (noting the difficulty of extracting general principles from the Court’s fractured opinions); id., at 959 (Wald, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (“Croson certainly did not resolve the substantial questions posed by congressional programs which mandate the use of racial preferences”); Winter Park Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 873 F. 2d 347 , 366 (CADC 1989) (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“The unresolved ambiguity of <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> and Croson leaves it impossible to reach a firm opinion as to the evidence of discrimination needed to sustain a congressional mandate of racial preferences”), aff’d sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, supra. Despite lingering uncertainty in the details, however, the Court’s cases through Croson had established three general propositions with respect to governmental racial classifications.  First, skepticism: “Any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination,’ ” Wygant, 476 U. S., at 273 (plurality opinion of Powell, J.); Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 491</citedDecision> (opinion of Burger, C. J.); see also <citedDecision>id., at 523</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., dissenting) (“[A]ny official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect”); McLaughlin, 379 U. S., at 192 (“[R]acial classifications [are] ‘constitutionally suspect’ ”); Hirabayashi, 320 U. S., at 100 (“Distinctions *224 between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people”).  Second, consistency: “[T]he standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification,” Croson, 488 U. S., at 494 (plurality opinion); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289-290 (opinion of Powell, J.), i.  e., all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized.  And third, congruence: “Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment,” Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 93 ; see also Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 638, n. 2 ; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S., at 500 .  Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the.  Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.  Justice Powell’s defense of this conclusion bears repeating here: “If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather than the individual only because of his membership in a particular group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently.
**Lead Opinion**
 Ibid. He also allows that “[n]othing is inherently wrong with applying a single standard to fundamentally different situations, as long as that standard takes relevant differences into account.” Post, at 246.  What he fails to recognize is that strict scrutiny does take “relevant differences” into account — indeed, that is its fundamental purpose.  The point of carefully examining the interest asserted by the government in support of a racial classification, and the evidence offered to show that the classification is needed, is precisely to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of race in governmental decisionmaking.  See supra, at 226.  And Justice Stevens concedes that “some cases may be difficult to classify,” post, at 245, and n. 4; all the more reason, in our view, to examine all racial classifications carefully.  Strict scrutiny does not “trea[t] dissimilar race-based decisions as though they were equally objectionable,” post, at 245; to the contrary, it evaluates carefully all governmental race-based decisions in order to decide which are constitutionally objectionable and which are not.  By requiring strict scrutiny of racial classifications, we require courts to make sure that a governmental classification based on race, which “so seldom provide[s] a relevant basis for disparate treatment,” Fulli-love, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 534</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., dissenting), is legitimate, before permitting unequal treatment based on race to proceed.  Justice Stevens chides us for our “supposed inability to differentiate between ‘invidious’ and ‘benign’ discrimination,” because it is in his view sufficient that “people understand the difference between good intentions and bad.” Post, at 245.  But, as we have just explained, the point of strict scrutiny is to “differentiate between” permissible and impermissible governmental use of race.  And Justice Stevens himself has already explained in his dissent in Full-ilove why “good intentions” alone are not enough to sustain *229 a supposedly “benign” racial classification: “[E]ven though it is not the actual predicate for this legislation, a statute of this kind inevitably is perceived by many as resting on an assumption that those who are granted this special preference are less qualified in some respect that is identified purely by their race.  Because that perception — especially when fostered by the Congress of the United States — can only exacerbate rather than reduce racial prejudice, it will delay the time when race will become a truly irrelevant, or at least insignificant, factor.  Unless Congress clearly articulates the need and basis for a racial classification, and also tailors the classification to its justification, the Court should not uphold this kind of statute.” Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 545</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added; footnote omitted); see also <citedDecision>id., at 537</citedDecision> (“Racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification”); Croson, 488 U. S., at 516-517 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“Although [the legislation at issue] stigmatizes the disadvantaged class with the unproven charge of past racial discrimination, it actually imposes a greater stigma on its supposed beneficiaries”); supra, at 226; but cf. post, at 245-246 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  These passages make a persuasive case for requiring strict scrutiny of congressional racial classifications.  Perhaps it is not the standard of strict scrutiny itself, but our use of the concepts of “consistency” and “congruence” in conjunction with it, that leads Justice Stevens to dissent.  According to Justice Stevens, our view of consistency “equate[s] remedial preferences with invidious discrimination,” post, at 246, and ignores the difference between “an engine of oppression” and an effort “to foster equality in society,” or, more colorfully, “between a ‘No Trespassing’ sign and a welcome mat,” post, at 243, 245.  It does nothing of the kind.  The principle of consistency simply means that whenever the government treats any person unequally be *230 cause of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution’s guarantee of equal protection.  It says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny.
**Lead Opinion**
 Consistency does recognize that any individual suffers an injury when he or she is disadvantaged by the government because of his or her race, whatever that race may be.  This Court clearly stated that principle in Croson, see 488 U. S., at 493-494 (plurality opinion); id., at 520-521 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 643 (1993); Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991).  Justice Stevens does not explain how his views square with Croson, or with the long line of cases understanding equal protection as a personal right.  Justice Stevens also claims that we have ignored any difference between federal and state legislatures.  But requiring that Congress, like the States, enact racial classifications only when doing so is necessary to further a “compelling interest” does not contravene any principle of appropriate respect for a coequal branch of the Government.  It is true that various Members of this Court have taken different views of the authority §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment confers upon Congress to deal with the problem of racial discrimination, and the extent to which courts should defer to Congress’ exercise of that authority.  See, e. g., Metro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 605-606 (O’Connor, J., dissenting); Croson, 488 U. S., at 486-493 (opinion of O’Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White, J.); id., at 518-519 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 521-524 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 472-473</citedDecision> (opinion of Burger, *231 C. J.); <citedDecision>id., at 500-502</citedDecision> , and nn. 2-3, 515, and n. 14 (Powell, J., concurring); <citedDecision>id., at 526-527</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., dissenting).  We need not, and do not, address these differences today.  For now, it is enough to observe that Justice Stevens’ suggestion that any Member of this Court has repudiated in this case his or her previously expressed views on the subject, post, at 249-253, 256-257, is incorrect.  C “Although adherence to precedent is not rigidly required in constitutional cases, any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification.” Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).  In deciding whether this case presents such justification, we recall Justice Frankfurter’s admonition that “stare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).  Remaining true to an “intrinsically sounder” doctrine established in prior cases better serves the values of stare decisis than would following a more recently decided case inconsistent with the decisions that came before it; the latter course would simply compound the recent error and would likely make the unjustified break from previously established doctrine complete.  In such a situation, “special justification” exists to depart from the recently decided case. As we have explained, Metro Broadcasting undermined important principles of this Court’s equal protection jurisprudence, established in a line of cases stretching back over 50 years, see supra, at 213-225.
**Lead Opinion**
 We also note that reliance on a case that has recently departed from precedent is likely to be minimal, particularly where, as here, the rule set forth in that case is unlikely to affect primary conduct in any event.  Cf. Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 272 (1995) (declining to overrule Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1 (1984), where “private parties have likely written contracts relying upon Southland as authority” in the 10 years since Southland was decided).  Justice Stevens takes us to task for what he perceives to be an erroneous application of the doctrine of stare decisis.  But again, he misunderstands our position.  We have acknowledged that, after Croson, “some uncertainty persisted with respect to the standard of review for federal racial classifications,” supra, at 223, and we therefore do not say that we “merely restor[e] the status quo ante” today, post, at 257.  But as we have described supra, at 213-227, we think that well-settled legal principles pointed toward a conclusion different from that reached in Metro Broadcasting, and we therefore disagree with Justice Stevens that “the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the Court reached,” post, at 257.  We also disagree with Justice Stevens that Justice Stewart’s dissenting opinion in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> supports his “novelty” argument, see post, at 258-259, and n. 13.  Justice Stewart said that “[u]nder our Constitution, any official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect and presumptively invalid,” and that “‘[e]qual protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment.’” Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 523</citedDecision> , and n. 1.  He took the view that “[t]he hostility of the Constitution to racial classifications by government has been manifested in many cases decided by this Court,” and that “our cases have made clear that the Constitution is *235 wholly neutral in forbidding such racial discrimination, whatever the race may be of those who are its victims.” <citedDecision>Id., at 524</citedDecision> .  Justice Stewart gave no indication that he thought he was addressing a “novel” proposition, post, at 259.  Rather, he relied on the fact that the text of the Fourteenth Amendment extends its guarantee to “persons,” and on cases like Buckley, Loving, McLaughlin, Bolling, Hirabayashi, and Korematsu, see <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 524-526</citedDecision> , as do we today.  There is nothing new about the notion that Congress, like the States, may treat people differently because of their race only for compelling reasons.  “The real problem,” Justice Frankfurter explained, “is whether a principle shall prevail over its later misapplications.” Helvering, 309 U. S., at 122 .  Metro Broadcasting’s untenable distinction between state and federal racial classifications lacks support in our precedent, and undermines the fundamental principle of equal protection as a personal right.  In this case, as between that principle and “its later misapplications,” the principle must prevail.  D Our action today makes explicit what Justice Powell thought implicit in the <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> lead opinion: Federal racial classifications, like those of a State, must serve a compelling governmental interest, and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.  See Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> (concurring opinion).  (Recall that the lead opinion in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> “d[id] not adopt .  .  .  the formulas of analysis articulated in such cases as <citedDecision>[Bakke].” Id., at 492</citedDecision> (opinion of Burger, C. J.).) Of course, it follows that to the extent (if any) that <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> held federal racial classifications to be subject to a less rigorous standard, it is no longer controlling.  But we need not decide today whether the program upheld in Fulli-love would survive strict scrutiny as our more recent cases have defined it.  *236 Some have questioned the importance of debating the proper standard of review of race-based legislation.  See, e. g., post, at 247 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Croson, 488 U. S., at 514-515 , and n. 5 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); cf. Metro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 610 (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (“This dispute regarding the appropriate standard of review may strike some as a lawyers’ quibble over words”).  But we agree with Justice Stevens that, “[b]ecause racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment, and because classifications based on race are potentially so harmful to the entire body politic, it is especially important that the reasons for any such classification be clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate,” and that “[rjacial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification.” <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 533-535, 537</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion) (footnotes omitted).  We think that requiring strict scrutiny is the best way to ensure that courts will consistently give racial classifications that kind of detailed examination, both as to ends and as to means.  Korematsu demonstrates vividly that even “the most rigid scrutiny” can sometimes fail to detect an illegitimate racial classification, compare Korematsu, 323 U. S., at 223 (“To cast this case into outlines of racial prejudice, without reference to the real military dangers which were presented, merely confuses the issue.  Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race”), with Pub. L. 100-383, § 2 (a), 102 Stat. 903 -904 (“[Tjhese actions [of relocating and interning civilians of Japanese ancestry] were carried out without adequate security reasons .. .  and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership”).  Any retreat from the most searching judicial inquiry can only increase the risk of another such error occurring in the future.  *237 Finally, we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is “strict in theory, but fatal in fact.” <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 519</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).  The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.  As recently as 1987, for example, every Justice of this Court agreed that the Alabama Department of Public Safety’s “pervasive, systematic, and obstinate discriminatory conduct” justified a narrowly tailored race-based remedy.  See United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S., at 167 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 190 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 196 (O’Connor, J., dissenting).  When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the “narrow tailoring” test this Court has set out in previous cases. > j — j Because our decision today alters the playing field in some important respects, we think it best to remand the case to the lower courts for further consideration in light of the principles we have announced.  The Court of Appeals, following Metro Broadcasting and <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> , analyzed the case in terms of intermediate scrutiny.  It upheld the challenged statutes and regulations because it found them to be “narrowly tailored to achieve [their] significant governmental purpose of providing subcontracting opportunities for small disadvantaged business enterprises.” 16 F. 3d, at 1547 (emphasis added).  The Court of Appeals did not decide the question whether the interests served by the use of subcontractor compensation clauses are properly described as “compelling.” It also did not address the question of narrow tailoring in terms of our strict scrutiny cases, by asking, for example, whether there was “any consideration of the use of *238 race-neutral means to increase minority business participation” in government contracting, Croson, supra, at 507 , or whether the program was appropriately limited such that it “will not last longer than the discriminatory effects it is designed to eliminate,” <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 513</citedDecision> (Powell, J., concurring).  Moreover, unresolved questions remain concerning the details of the complex regulatory regimes implicated by the use of subcontractor compensation clauses.  For example, the SBA’s 8(a) program requires an individualized inquiry into the economic disadvantage of every participant, see 13 CFR § 124.106 (a) (1994), whereas the DOT’s regulations implementing STURAA § 106(c) do not require certifying authorities to make such individualized inquiries, see 49 CFR §23.62 (1994); 49 CFR pt. 23, subpt. D, App. C (1994).  And the regulations seem unclear as to whether 8(d) subcontractors must make individualized showings, or instead whether the race-based presumption applies both to social and economic disadvantage, compare 13 CFR § 124.106 (b) (1994) (apparently requiring 8(d) participants to make an individualized showing), with 48 CFR § 19.703 (a)(2) (1994) (apparently allowing 8(d) subcontractors to invoke the race-based presumption for social and economic disadvantage).  See generally Part I, supra. We also note an apparent discrepancy between the definitions of which socially disadvantaged individuals qualify as economically disadvantaged for the 8(a) and 8(d) programs; the former requires a showing that such individuals’ ability to compete has been impaired “as compared to others in the same or similar line of business who are not socially disadvantaged,'” 13 CFR § 124.106 (a) (l)(i) (1994) (emphasis added), while the latter requires that showing only “as compared to others in the same or similar line of business,” § 124.106(b)(1).  The question whether any of the ways in which the Government uses subcontractor compensation clauses can survive strict scrutiny, and any relevance distinctions such as these may have to that ques *239 tion, should be addressed in the first instance by the lower courts.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
