Primary elections for United States Senators, Congressmen and state officers are provided for by Chapters Twelve and Thirteen of the statutes. Under these chapters, the Democratic party was required to hold the primary which was the occasion of the alleged wrong to petitioner. A summary of the state statutes regulating primaries appears in the footnote. [6] These nominations are to be made by the qualified voters of the party. Art. 3101. *654 The Democratic party of Texas is held by the Supreme Court of that State to be a "voluntary association," Bell v. Hill, 123 Tex. 531 , 534, protected by § 27 of the Bill of Rights, Art. 1, Constitution of Texas, from interference by the State except that: "In the interest of fair methods and a fair expression by their members of their preferences in the selection of their *655 nominees, the State may regulate such elections by proper laws." p. 545. That court stated further: "Since the right to organize and maintain a political party is one guaranteed by the Bill of Rights of this State, it necessarily follows that every privilege essential or reasonably appropriate to the exercise of that right is likewise *656 guaranteed,  including, of course, the privilege of determining the policies of the party and its membership. Without the privilege of determining the policy of a political association and its membership, the right to organize such an association would be a mere mockery. We think these rights,  that is, the right to determine the membership of a political party and to determine its policies, of necessity are to be exercised by the state convention of such party, and cannot, under any circumstances, be conferred upon a state or governmental agency." p. 546.

United States v. Reese, 92 U.S. 214 , 217; Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.S. 370 , 388; Guinn v. United States, 238 U.S. 347 , 361; Myers v. Anderson, 238 U.S. 368 , 379; Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. 268 . It may now be taken as a postulate that the right to vote in such a primary for the nomination of candidates without discrimination by the State, like the right to vote *662 in a general election, is a right secured by the Constitution. United States v. Classic, 313 U.S. at 314; Myers v. Anderson, 238 U.S. 368 ; Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651 , 663 et seq. By the terms of the Fifteenth Amendment that right may not be abridged by any State on account of race. Under our Constitution the great privilege of the ballot may not be denied a man by the State because of his color. We are thus brought to an examination of the qualifications for Democratic primary electors in Texas, to determine whether state action or private action has excluded Negroes from participation. Despite Texas' decision that the exclusion is produced by private or party action, Bell v. Hill, supra , federal courts must for themselves appraise the facts leading to that conclusion. It is only by the performance of this obligation that a final and uniform interpretation can be given to the Constitution, the "supreme Law of the Land." Nixon v. Condon, 286 U.S. 73 , 88; Standard Oil Co. v. Johnson, 316 U.S. 481 , 483; Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. 252 ; Lisenba v. California, 314 U.S. 219 , 238; Union Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 313 U.S. 450 , 467; Drivers Union v. Meadowmoor Co., 312 U.S. 287 , 294; Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227 , 228. Texas requires electors in a primary to pay a poll tax. Every person who does so pay and who has the qualifications of age and residence is an acceptable voter for the primary. Art. 2955.

3106. The state executive committee is given power to fix qualifications of party membership, Art. 3107; Art. 2955, 1942 Supp., requires payment of a poll tax by voters in primary elections, and Art. 3093 (3) deals with political qualifications of candidates for nomination for United States Senator. But cf. Bell v. Hill, 123 Tex. 531 , 74 S.W.2d 113 . Art. 3108 empowers the county committee to prepare a budget covering the cost of the primary and to require each candidate to pay a fair share. The form of the ballot is prescribed by Art. 3109. Art. 3101 provides that the nominations be made by the qualified voters of the party.
