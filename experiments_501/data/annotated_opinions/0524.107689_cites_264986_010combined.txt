**Combined Opinion**
 MR. JUSTICE FORTAS delivered the opinion of the Court. This case has a lengthy procedural history.  In 1960, petitioner was convicted of burglary and grand larceny in New York state court proceedings and was sentenced to concurrent terms of three to five years.  On direct appeal (following Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961)), petitioner claimed that illegally obtained evidence had been introduced against him at trial. The Appellate Division affirmed the conviction without opinion, People v. Carafas, 14 App. Div. 2d 886, 218 N. Y. S. 2d 536 (1961), as did the New York Court of Appeals, 11 N. Y. 2d 891, 182 N. E. *236 2d 413 (1962).  [1] This Court denied a petition for a writ of certiorari.  372 U. S. 948 (1963).  Thereafter, complex proceedings took place in which petitioner sought in both federal and state courts to obtain relief by writ of habeas corpus, based on his claim that illegally seized evidence was used against him.  <citedDecision>334 F. 2d 331</citedDecision> (1964); petition for writ of certiorari denied, 381 U. S. 951 (1965).  On November 5, 1965, the United States District Court, as directed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ( <citedDecision>334 F. 2d 331</citedDecision> (1964)), heard petitioner's claim on the merits.  It dismissed his petition on the ground that he had failed to show a violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.  Petitioner appealed in circumstances hereinafter related.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dismissed the appeal.  On March 20, 1967, a petition for a writ of certiorari was filed here.  We granted the petition, 389 U. S. 896 (1967), to consider whether, because of facts to which we later refer, the Court of Appeals' dismissal conformed to our holding in Nowakowski v. Maroney, 386 U. S. 542 (1967).  But first we must consider the State's contention that this case is now moot because petitioner has been unconditionally released from custody.
**Combined Opinion**
 In June 1963 petitioner began his quest for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts.  The District Court denied the petition without prejudice, suggesting, in view of what the judge thought was the unsettled state of New York law, that petitioner reapply to the state courts.  See 28 U. S. C. ยง 2254 .  Petitioner did so, and apparently at the same time appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  The state courts denied relief a second time.  The United States Court of Appeals reversed the District Court and ordered a hearing on the merits.  <citedDecision>334 F. 2d 331</citedDecision> (1964).  This Court denied the State's petition for a writ of certiorari.  381 U. S. 951 (1965).  The hearing ordered by the Court of Appeals was held by the District Court on November 5, 1965.  The petition was dismissed on the merits on May 2, 1966.  Petitioner's appeal to the Second Circuit was dismissed on February 3, 1967, and a petition for rehearing was denied on February 21, 1967.  A petition for a writ of certiorari was filed here on March 20, 1967, and granted on October 16, 1967, 389 U. S. 896 , about seven years after petitioner's conviction.
