**Combined Opinion**
 See 4 R. Marsden, British Shipping Laws, Collisions at Sea §§ 119-147 (11th ed. 1961); Staring, Contribution and Division of Damages in Admiralty and Maritime Cases, 45 Calif-.  L. Rev. 304, 305-310 (1957).  But England has long since abandoned the rule 5 and now follows the Brussels Collision Liability Convention of 1910 that provides for the apportionment of damages on the basis of “degree” of fault whenever it is possible to do so. 6 Indeed, the United States is now virtually alone among the world’s major maritime nations in not adhering to the Convention with its rule of pro *404 portional fault 7 — a fact that encourages transoceanic forum shopping.  See G. Gilmore & C. Black, The Law of Admiralty 529 (2d ed. 1975) (hereinafter Gilmore & Black).  While the lower federal courts originally adhered to the divided damages rule, they have more recently followed it only grudgingly, terming it “unfair,” 8 “illogical,” 9 “arbitrary,” “archaic and frequently unjust.” 10 Judge Learned Hand was a particularly stern critic of the rule.  Dissenting in National Bulk Carriers v. United States, 183 F. 2d 405, 410 (CA2), he wrote: “An equal division [of damages] in this case would be plainly unjust; they ought to be divided in some such proportion as five to one.  And so they could be but for our obstinate cleaving to the ancient rule which has been abrogated by nearly all civilized nations.” And Judge Hand had all but invited this Court to overturn the rule when, *405 in an earlier opinion for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, he stated that “we have no power to divest ourselves of this vestigial relic; we can only go so far as to close our eyes to doubtful delinquencies.” Oriental Trading & Transport Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp., <citedDecision>173 F. 2d 108, 111</citedDecision> .  Some courts, even bolder, have simply ignored the rule.  See J. Griffin, The American Law of Collision 564 (1949); Staring, supra, at 341-342.  Cf. The Margaret, 30 F. 2d 923 (CA3).  It is no longer apparent, if it ever was, that this Solomonic division of damages serves to achieve even rough justice.  11 An equal division of damages is a reasonably satisfactory result only where each vessel’s fault is approximately equal and each vessel thus assumes a share of the collision damages in proportion to its share of the blame, or where proportionate degrees of fault cannot be measured and determined on a rational basis.  The rule produces palpably unfair results in every other case. For example, where one ship’s fault in causing a collision is relatively slight and her damages small, and where the second ship is grossly negligent and suffers extensive damage, the first ship must still make a substantial payment to the second.
