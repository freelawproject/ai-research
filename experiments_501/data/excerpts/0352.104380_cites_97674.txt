**Dissenting Opinion**
 19 Moreover, the very difficulties in his way for securing a successful determination here, which would give him some certain remedy either in the state or in the federal courts, were sufficient reason, in my opinion, to justify his foregoing that dubious procedure and starting over again in the federal court. The real trouble here is not with the law of res judicata, for that law has no valid application to these facts.  It is that the doctrine is used as an escape from facing squarely the real question presented.  This is whether North Carolina’s decision made the Erie doctrine applicable.  The Court’s opinion does state expressly that the effect of the North Carolina decision was to create a policy of the state against the validity of all claims for deficiency judgments, and comes almost but not quite to saying this requires the case to go off on application of the York rule.  That issue is inescapable here.  The Erie rule did not purport to change the law of federal jurisdiction in diversity cases, taking it out of the hands of Congress and the federal courts and putting it within the states’ power to determine.  It purported only to prescribe the rule federal courts should follow in applying the substantive law. If the North Carolina decision was exclusively a jurisdic *211 tiónal one, it had no effect on the power of the federal courts in that state to hear controversies excluded by it from the state courts, and the decision neither reached the merits of the controversy "in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation” nor barred Bullington from going to the federal court. See Lupton’s Sons Co. v. Automobile Club, <citedDecision>225 U. S. 489</citedDecision> .  If on the other hand the decision was in effect, although not in words, a determination of the merits in that sense, it both adjudicated Bullington’s substantive rights and barred him from maintaining the later suit successfully in the federal court. That question is here and until it is resolved he is deprived of any day in court except to go from one to another without securing decision either on the merits substantially or “on the merits” jurisdictionally.  From the Court’s opinion I cannot say whether the question has been resolved.  Its discussion of North Carolina’s “policy” and its overruling of the Lupton’s Sons case, supra, would seem to indicate that it is applying York , though without saying so frankly.  But, if so, why speak also of res judicata?  The law should not be made into such a merry-go-round.  Bullington is entitled to one full day in court on the substance of his claim.
