 II As early as 1907, this Court took the position that remedies for violations of constitutional rights would only be afforded to a person who “belongs to the class for whose sake the constitutional protection is given.” Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U. S. 152, 160 .  The exclusionary rule is one form of remedy afforded for Fourth Amendment violations, and the Court in Jones v. United States held that the Hatch v. Reardon principle properly limited its availability.  The Court reasoned that ordinarily “it is entirely proper to require of one who seeks to challenge the legality of a search as the basis for suppressing relevant evidence that he .  .  .  establish, that he himself was the victim of an invasion of privacy.” 362 U. S., at 261 .  Subsequent attempts to vicariously assert violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of others have been repeatedly rejected by this Court. Alderman v. United States, <citedDecision>394 U. S. 165, 174</citedDecision> (1969); Brown v. United States, 411 U. S. *87 223, 230 (1973).  Most recently, in Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S. 128 (1978), we held that “it is proper to permit only defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated to benefit from the [exclusionary] rule’s protections.” Id., at 134 .  Even though the Court in Jones recognized that the exclusionary rule should only be available to protect defendants who have been the victims of an illegal search or seizure, the Court thought it necessary to establish an exception.  In cases where possession of the seized evidence was an essential element of the offense charged, the Court held that the defendant was not obligated to establish that his own Fourth Amendment rights had been violated, but only that the search and seizure of the evidence was unconstitutional.  3 Upon such a showing, the exclusionary rule would be available to prevent the admission of the evidence against the defendant.  The Court found that the prosecution of such possessory offenses presented a “special problem” which necessitated the departure from the then settled principles of Fourth Amendment “standing.” 4 Two circumstances were found to require this exception.  First, the Court found that in order to establish standing at a hearing on a motion to suppress, the defendant would often be “forced to allege facts the proof of which would tend, if indeed not be sufficient, to convict him,” since several Courts of Appeals had “pinioned a defendant within this dilemma” by holding that evidence adduced at the motion *88 to suppress could be used against the defendant at trial. 362 U. S., at 262 .

 C Even though the original foundations of Jones are no longer relevant, respondents assert that principles not articulated by the Court in Jones support retention of the rule.  First, respondents maintain that while Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377 (1968), eliminated the possibility that the prosecutor could use a defendant's testimony at a suppression hearing as substantive evidence of guilt at trial, Simmons did not eliminate other risks to the defendant which attach to giving testimony on a motion to suppress.  7 Principally, respondents assert that the prosecutor may still be permitted to use the defendant’s testimony to impeach him at trial. 8 This Court *94 has not decided whether Simmons precludes the use of a defendant’s testimony at a suppression hearing to impeach his testimony at trial. 9 But the issue presented here is quite different from the one of whether “use immunity” extends only through the Government’s case-in-chief, or beyond that to the direct and cross-examination of a defendant in the event he chooses to take the stand.  That issue need not be and is not resolved here, for it is an issue which more aptly relates to the proper breadth of the Simmons privilege, and not to the need for retaining automatic standing.  Respondents also seek to retain the Jones rule on the grounds that it is said to maximize the deterrence of illegal police conduct by permitting an expanded class of potential challengers.  The same argument has been rejected by this Court as a sufficient basis for allowing persons whose Fourth Amendment rights were not violated to nevertheless claim the benefits of the exclusionary rule.  In <citedDecision>Alderman</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>394 U. S., at 174-175</citedDecision> , we explicitly stated: “The deterrent values of preventing the incrimination of those whose rights the police have violated have been considered sufficient to justify the suppression of probative evidence even though the case against the defendant is weakened or destroyed.  We adhere to that judgment.  But we are not convinced that the additional benefits of extending the exclusionary rule to other defendants would justify further encroachment upon the public interest in prosecuting those accused of crime and having them acquitted or convicted on the basis of all the evidence which exposes the truth.” See also Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U. S., at 137 ; United States v. Ceccolini, 435 U. S. 268, 275-276 (1978); United States v. Calandra, 414 U. S. 338, 350-351 (1974).  Respondents’ de *95 terrence argument carries no special force in the context of possessory offenses and we therefore again reject it.  We are convinced that the automatic standing rule of Jones has outlived its usefulness in this Court’s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence.  The doctrine now serves only to afford a windfall to defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights have not been violated.  We are unwilling to tolerate the exclusion of probative evidence under such circumstances since we adhere to the view of <citedDecision>Alderman</citedDecision> that the values of the Fourth Amendment are preserved by a rule which limits the availability of the exclusionary rule to defendants who have been subjected to a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights.  This action comes to us as a challenge to a pretrial decision suppressing evidence.  The respondents relied on automatic standing and did not attempt to establish that they had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the areas of Zackular’s mother’s home where the goods were seized.  We therefore think it appropriate to remand so that respondents will have an opportunity to demonstrate, if they can, that their own Fourth Amendment rights were violated.  See Combs v. United States, 408 U. S. 224 (1972).  Reversed and remanded.  The District Court held that the affidavit was deficient because the affiant relied on double hearsay, and failed to specify the dates on which information included in the affidavit had been obtained.

 (Emphasis added.) Legal possession of the seized good may be sufficient in some circumstances to entitle a defendant to seek the return of the seized property if the seizure, as opposed to the search, was illegal.  See, e. g., United States v. Lisk, 522 F. 2d 228 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.), cert. denied, 423 U. S. 1078 (1976), although in that case the property was ultimately found not to have been illegally seized.  We need not explore this issue since respondents did not challenge the constitutionality of the seizure of the evidence.  The respondents argue that the prosecutor’s access to the suppression testimony will unfairly provide the prosecutor with information advantageous to the preparation of his ease and trial strategy.  This argument, however, is surely applicable equally to possessory and nonpossessory offenses.  This Court has clearly declined to expand the Jones rule to other classes of offenses, Alderman v. United States, <citedDecision>394 U. S. 165</citedDecision> (1969); Brown v. United States, 411 U. S. 223 (1973), and thus respondents’ rationale cannot support the retention of a special rule of automatic standing here.  A number of courts considering the question have held that such testimony is admissible as evidence of impeachment.  Gray v. State, 43 Md. App. 238 , 403 A. 2d 853 (1979); People v. Douglas, 66 Cal. App. 3d 998 , 136 Cal. Rptr. 358 (1977); People v. Sturgis, 58 Ill. 2d 211 , 317 N. E. 2d 545 (1974).  See also Woody v. United States, 126 U. S. App. D. C. 353, 354-355, 379 F, 2d 130, 131-132 (Burger, J.), cert. denied, 389 U. S. 961 (1967).  This Court has held that “the protective shield of Simmons is not to be converted into a license for false representations.  .  .
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Marshall, with whom Mr. Justice Brennan joins, dissenting. Today the Court overrules the “automatic standing” rule of Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257 (1960), because it concludes that the rationale underpinning the rule has been “eroded,” ante, at 89. I do not share that view. A defendant charged with a possessory offense who moves to suppress the items he is charged with possessing must now establish at the suppression hearing that the police conduct of which he complains violated his personal Fourth Amendment rights. In many cases, a defendant will be able to make the required showing only by taking the stand and testifying about his interest in the place searched and the evidence *96 seized; the need for the defendant’s own testimony may, in fact, be more likely to arise in possession cases than in cases involving other types of offenses. The holding in Jones was premised, in part, on the unfairness of “pinion [ing] a defendant within th[e] dilemma,” 362 U. S., at 262 , of being able to assert his Fourth Amendment claim only by relinquishing his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court finds that this dilemma no longer exists because Simmons v. United States, 390 U. S. 377 (1968), held that testimony given by a defendant in support of a motion to suppress “may not thereafter be admitted against him at trial on the issue of guilt unless he makes no objection.” Id., at 394 . I cannot agree that Simmons provides complete protection against the “self-incrimination dilemma,” Brown v. United States, 411 U. S. 223, 228 (1973). Respondents contend that the testimony given at the suppression hearing might be held admissible for impeachment purposes and, while acknowledging that that question is not before us in this case, the majority broadly hints that this is so. Ante, at 94, n. 9; see Harris v. New York, 401 U. S. 222 (1971); United States v. Kahan, 415 U. S. 239 (1974); United States v. Havens, 446 U. S. 620 (1980); Jenkins v. Anderson, 447 U. S. 231 (1980); but see New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U. S. 450 (1979). The use of the testimony for impeachment purposes would subject a defendant to precisely the same dilemma, unless he was prepared to relinquish his constitutional right to testify in his own defense, and would thereby create a strong deterrent to asserting Fourth Amendment claims. One of the purposes of Jones and Simmons was to remove such obstacles. See Simmons, supra, at 392-394 . Moreover, the opportunity for cross-examination at the suppression hearing may enable the prosecutor to elicit incriminating information beyond that offered on direct examination to establish the requisite Fourth Amendment interest. Even if such information could not be introduced at the subsequent trial, it might be helpful to the prosecution in developing its case or deciding its trial strategy. The fur *97 nishing of such a tactical advantage to the prosecution should not be the price of asserting a Fourth Amendment claim. Simmons , therefore, does not eliminate the possibility that a defendant will be deterred from presenting a Fourth Amendment claim because of “the risk that the words which he utters may later be used to incriminate him.” Simmons, supra, at 393 . Accordingly, I conclude that this part of the reasoning in Jones remains viable. A second ground for relieving the defendant charged with possession from the necessity of showing “an interest in the premises searched or the property seized” was that “to hold to the contrary . . . would be to permit the Government to have the advantage of contradictory positions as a basis for conviction,” Jones, 362 U. S., at 263 . That is, since “possession both convicts and confers standing,” ibid., the Government, which had charged the defendant with possession, would not be permitted to deny that he had standing. By holding today in Rawlings v. Kentucky, post, p. 98, that a person may assert a Fourth Amendment claim only if he has a privacy interest in the area that was searched, the Court has, to be sure, done away with that logical inconsistency. For reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in that case, I believe that holding is diametrically opposed to the meaning of the Fourth Amendment as it has always been understood. In sum, I find neither of the Court’s grounds for abandoning Jones persuasive. The automatic standing rule is a salutary one which protects the rights of defendants and eliminates the wasteful requirement of making a preliminary showing of standing in pretrial proceedings involving pos-sessory offenses, where the charge itself alleges an interest sufficient to support a Fourth Amendment claim. I dissent.
