**Combined Opinion**
 Sprout v. South Bend, 277 U. S. 163, 170-171 , and cases cited.  The transportation of gas from wells outside Ohio by the lines of the producing companies to the state line and thence by means of appellant’s high pressure transmission lines to their connection with its local systems is essentially national—not local—in character and is interstate commerce within as well as without that State.  The mere fact that the title or the custody of the gas passes while it is en route from State to State is not determinative of the question where interstate commerce ends.  Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, 249 U. S. 239 , 245.  Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., 265 U. S. 298, 307-309 .  Peoples Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 270 U. S. 550, 554 .  Public Util. Comm. v. Attleboro Co., <citedDecision>273 U. S. 83, 89</citedDecision> .  But when the gas passes from the distribution lines into the supply mains, it necessarily is relieved of nearly all the pressure put upon it at the stations of the producing *471 companies, its volume thereby is expanded to many tintes what it was while in the high pressure interstate transmission lines, and it is divided into the mtfay thousand relatively tiny streams that enter the small service lines connecting such mains with the pipes on the consumers’ premises.  So segregated the gas in such service lines and pipes remains in readiness or moves forward to serve as needed.  The treatment and division of the large .compressed volume of gas is like the breaking of an original package, after shipment in interstate commerce, in order that its contents may be treated, prepared for sale and sold at retail.
