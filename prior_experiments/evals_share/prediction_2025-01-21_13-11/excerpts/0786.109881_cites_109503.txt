Case of interest: Aldinger v. Howard (1976)
-----------------------
Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641, 42 U.S. C. § 1988 (1976 ed.), which allows prevailing parties (in the discretion of the court) in § 1983 suits *699 to obtain attorney's fees from the losing parties, the Senate stated:
"[D]efendants in these cases are often State or local bodies or State or local officials. In such cases it is intended that the attorneys' fees, like other items of costs, will be collected either directly from the official, in his official capacity, from funds of his agency or under his control, or from the State or local government (whether or not the agency or government is a named party)." S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).
Far from showing that Congress has relied on Monroe, therefore, events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of Monroe to school boards and has attempted to allow awards of attorney's fees against local governments even though Monroe, City of Kenosha v. Bruno, and Aldinger v. Howard, <caseOfInterest>427 U.S. 1 </caseOfInterest>(1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible.[64]
Third, municipalities can assert no reliance claim which can *700 support an absolute immunity. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in Monroe, "[t]his is not an area of commercial law in which, presumably, individuals may have arranged their affairs in reliance on the expected stability of decision." 365 U.S., at 221-222 (dissenting in part). Indeed, municipalities simply cannot "arrange their affairs" on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely since injunctive suits against local officials under § 1983 would prohibit any such arrangement. And it scarcely need be mentioned that nothing in Monroe encourages municipalities to violate constitutional rights or even suggests that such violations are anything other than completely wrong.
Finally, even under the most stringent test for the propriety of overruling a statutory decision proposed by Mr. Justice Harlan in Monroe[65]"that it appear beyond 
-----------------------
o reserves decision on the availability of a qualified municipal immunity. Ante, at 701. Initial resolution of the question whether the protection available at common law for municipal corporations, see post, at 720-721, or other principles support a *714 qualified municipal immunity in the context of the § 1983 damages action, is left to the lower federal courts.
MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part.
Since Parts II and IV of the opinion of the Court are merely advisory and are not necessary to explain the Court's decision, I join only Parts I, III, and V.
MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.
Seventeen years ago, in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167 (1961), this Court held that the 42d Congress did not intend to subject a municipal corporation to liability as a "person" within the meaning of 42 U.S. C. § 1983. Since then, the Congress has remained silent, but this Court has reaffirmed that holding on at least three separate occasions. Aldinger v. Howard, <caseOfInterest>427 U.S. 1 </caseOfInterest>(1976); City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507 (1973); Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693 (1973). See also Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 277-279 (1977). Today, the Court abandons this long and consistent line of precedents, offering in justification only an elaborate canvass of the same legislative history which was before the Court in 1961. Because I cannot agree that this Court is "free to disregard these precedents," which have been "considered maturely and recently" by this Court, Runyon v. McCrary, <caseOfInterest>427 U.S. 1</caseOfInterest>60, 186 (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring), I am compelled to dissent.

As this Court has repeatedly recognized, id., at 175 n. 12; Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671 n. 14 (1974), considerations of stare decisis are at their strongest when this Court confronts its previous constructions of legislation. In all cases, private parties shape their conduct according to this Court's settled construction of the law, but the Congress is at *715 liberty to correct our mistakes of statutory construction, unlike our constitutional interpretations, whenever it sees fit. The controlling principles were best stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis:
"Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. . . . This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation. But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through

that liability follows the right to control the actions of a tortfeasor. By our decision in Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362 (1976), we would appear to have decided that the mere right to control without any control or direction having been exercised and without any failure to supervise is not enough to support § 1983 liability. See 423 U.S., at 370-371.
[59]  Each case cited by Monroe, see 365 U.S., at 191 n. 50, as consistent with the position that local governments were not § 1983 "persons" reached its conclusion by assuming that state-law immunities overrode the § 1983 cause of action. This has never been the law.
[60]  Although many suits against school boards also include private individuals as parties, the "principal defendant is usually the local board of education or school board." Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S., at 292-293 (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment).
[61]  Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693 (1973); City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507 (1973); Aldinger v. Howard, <caseOfInterest>427 U.S. 1 </caseOfInterest>(1976).
[62]  During the heyday of the furor over busing, both the House and the Senate refused to adopt bills that would have removed from the federal courts jurisdiction

"to make any decision, enter any judgment, or issue any order requiring any school board to make any change in the racial composition of the student body at any public school or in any class at any public school to which students are assigned in conformity with a freedom of choice system, or requiring any school board to transport any students from one public school to another public school or from one place to another place or from one school district to another school district in order to effect a change in the racial composition of the student body at any school or place or in any school district, or denying to any student the right or privilege of attending any public school or class at any public school chosen by the parent of such student in conformity with a freedom of choice system, or requiring any school b

her Congress' attempt is in fact effective is the subject of Hutto v. Finney, O. T. 1977, No. 76-1660, cert. granted, 434 U.S. 901, and therefore we express no view on it here.
[65]  We note, however, that Mr. Justice Harlan's test has not been expressly adopted by this Court. Moreover, that test is based on two factors: stare decisis and "indications of congressional acceptance of this Court's earlier interpretation [of the statute in question]." 365 U.S., at 192. As we have explained, the second consideration is not present in this case.
[66]  No useful purpose would be served by an attempt at this late date to determine whether Monroe was correct on its facts. Similarly, since this case clearly involves official policy and does not involve respondeat superior, we do not assay a view on how our cases which have relied on that aspect of Monroe that is overruled todayMoor v. County of Alameda, 411 U.S. 693 (1973); City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U.S. 507 (1973); and Aldinger v. Howard, <caseOfInterest>427 U.S. 1 </caseOfInterest>(1976)should have been decided on a correct view of § 1983. Nothing we say today affects the conclusion reached in Moor, see 411 U.S., at 703-704, that 42 U.S. C. § 1988 cannot be used to create a federal cause of action where § 1983 does not otherwise provide one, or the conclusion reached in City of Kenosha, see 412 U.S., at 513, that "nothing . . . suggest[s] that the generic word `person' in § 1983 was intended to have a bifurcated application to municipal corporations depending on the nature of the relief sought against them."
[1]  The gravamen of the complaint in Monroe was that Chicago police officers acting "under color of" state law had conducted a warrantless, early morning raid and ransacking of a private home. Although at least one of the allegations in the complaint could have been construed to charge a custom or usage of the Police Department of the city of Chicago that did not violate state law, see 365 U.S., at 258-259 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in part), and there i

 an area outside the contemplation of the state-law charterthe sort of liability that would have been imposed by the Sherman amendmentbut on the consequences of activities actually undertaken within the scope of the powers conferred by state law.
[3]  The view taken today is consistent with the understanding of the 42d Congress that unless the context revealed a more limited definition, "the word `person' may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate. . . ." Act of Feb. 25, 1871, § 2, 16 Stat. 431. It also accords with the interpretation given the same word when it was used by Senator Sherman in the antitrust legislation of 1890 bearing his name. See Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U.S. 389 (1978) (plurality opinion); Chattanooga Foundry v. Atlanta, 203 U.S. 390, 396 (1906); cf. Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.S. 308 (1978).
[4]  See, e. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U.S. 36 (1977); Machinists v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Comm'n, <caseOfInterest>427 U.S. 1</caseOfInterest>32 (1976); Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U.S. 484 (1973); Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.S. 88 (1971); Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U.S. 235 (1970); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406-407, n. 1 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).
[5]  The District Court in Monroe ruled in the municipality's favor, stating: "[S]ince the liability of the City of Chicago is based on the doctrine of respondeat superior, and since I have already held that the complaint fails to state a claim for relief against the agents of the city, there is no claim for relief against the city itself." Record, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 30. The Court of Appeals affirmed for the same reason. 272 F.2d 365-366 (CA7 1959).

Petitioners in this Court also offered an alternative argument that the city of Chicago was a "person" for purposes of § 1983, Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 25, but the underlying theory of municipal liability remained one of respondeat superior.

-----------------------
s not argued or briefed does not undermine the precedential force of a considered holding. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), cited by the dissent, post, at 718, is a case in point. But the Court's recognition of its power to invalidate legislation not in conformity with constitutional command was essential to its judgment in Marbury. And on numerous subsequent occasions, the Court has been required to apply the full breadth of the Marbury holding. In Monroe, on the other hand, the Court's rationale was broader than necessary to meet the contentions of the parties and to decide the case in a principled manner. The language in Monroe cannot be dismissed as dicta, but we may take account of the fact that the Court simply was not confronted with the implications of holding § 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies. It is an appreciation of those implications that has prompted today's re-examination of the legislative history of the 1871 measure.
[7]  In Aldinger v. Howard, <caseOfInterest>427 U.S. 1</caseOfInterest>, 16 (1976), we reaffirmed Monroe, but petitioner did not contest the proposition that counties were excluded from the reach of § 1983 under Monroe, and the question before us concerned the scope of pendent-party jurisdiction with respect to a state-law claim. Similarly, the parties in Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274 (1977), did not seek a re-examination of our ruling in Monroe.
[8]  To the extent that the complaints in those cases asserted claims against the individual defendants in their personal capacity, as well as official capacity, the court would have had authority to award the relief requested. There is no suggestion in the opinions, however, that the practices at issue were anything other than official, duly authorized policies.
[9]  MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST'S dissent makes a strong argument that "[s]ince Monroe, municipalities have had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers' failure to predict this Court's rec
