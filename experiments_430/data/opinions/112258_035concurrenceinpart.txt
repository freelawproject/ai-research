<p id="b506-5">An article in Labyrinth, a magazine published by the Committee for Prisoner Humanity &amp; Justice, began as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b506-6">“In January 1975, William Lowe, a black prisoner at the United States Penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana died of asthma. ... In August 1975, Joseph (Yusef) Jones, Jr., a black prisoner at the U. S. Penitentiary, Terre Haute, IN. died of asthma.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b506-7">“. . . The prison infirmary at that time had only one respirator[,] known to be inoperative in January 1975 when William Lowe died. It was still broken in August 1975 when Joseph Jones needed it.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b506-8">“On the day of his death Jones was suffering an acute asthma attack; he was gasping for breath in the stale, hot, humid air in the cell. He requested medical aid of the guards. After several hours of unheeded pleading, accompanied by complaints to the guards from fellow prisoners in the cell block, Jones became frantic. Each breath was painful; each breath brought him closer to suffocation. Finally, guards called the PA (physician’s assistant) . . . , who brought with him the broken respirator. Finding the equipment unusable, the PA gave Jones an injection of the tranquilizer, thorazine, to calm him. Treatment with a tranquilizer was unquestionably contraindicated by Jones’ medical condition. Twenty minutes later, Jones was dead.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b506-9"><em>“Conclusion: </em>Jones, who was convicted of bank robbery and sentenced to 10 years in prison, was in fact, sentenced to death and was <em>murdered by neglect.”</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></blockquote>
<p id="AHs"><page-number citation-index="1" label="421">*421</page-number>The incident described above eventually came to the attention of this Court, which allowed Jones’ mother to pursue her civil rights action against prison officials. <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>Green, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110245"><a href="/opinion/110245/carlson-v-green/" aria-description="Citation for case: Carlson v.

Clearly the Labyrinth article’s report of inadequate medical treatment of federal prisoners raised “a matter that is both newsworthy and of great public importance.” <em>Pell </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109079"><a href="/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/#880" aria-description="Citation for case: Pell v.

<p id="b507-5">Yet Labyrinth’s efforts to disseminate the article to its subscribers at Marion Federal Penitentiary met Government resistance. Marion officials, acting within Federal Bureau of Prisons (Bureau) regulations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> returned the magazine on the ground that “the article entitled ‘Medical Murder’ would be detrimental to the good order and discipline of this institution .... [T]his type of philosophy could guide inmates in this institution into situations which could cause themselves and other inmates problems with the Medical Staff.” J. L. 12. Two years after publication a Marion official testified that he <page-number citation-index="1" label="422">*422</page-number>believed the article had posed no threat. App. 104. Nonetheless, the District Court below found the suppression of this and 45 other publications “reasonable,” and thus sustained the rejections wholesale. App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a-34a, 47a. This Court holds today that such <em>carte blanche </em>deference was improper and remands for case-by-case review. I agree with this aspect of the Court’s decision. I cannot agree, however, with either its holding that another finding of “reasonableness” will justify censorship or its premature approval of the Bureau’s regulations. These latter determinations upset precedent in a headlong rush to strip inmates of all but a vestige of free communication with the world beyond the prison gate.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>

<p id="b508-6">This Court first addressed the First Amendment in the prison context in <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">416 U. S. 396</a></span> (1974). Prior lower court treatments had varied: some courts had maintained “a hands-off posture,” while others had required “demonstration of a ‘compelling state interest’ to justify censorship of prisoner mail.” <span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/#406" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez"><em>Id., </em>at 406</a></span>. With characteristic wisdom Justice Powell, in his opinion for the Court, rejected both extremes. The difficulties of prison administration, he perceived, make the strict scrutiny that the First Amendment demands in other contexts inappropriate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="423">*423</page-number>See, <em>e. g., First National Bank of Boston </em>v. <em>Bellotti, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109836"><a href="/opinion/109836/first-nat-bank-of-boston-v-bellotti/#786" aria-description="Citation for case: First Nat.

Martinez"><em>Id., </em>at 412</a></span> (footnote omitted). Prison administrators did not have “to show with certainty that adverse consequences would flow from the failure to censor a particular letter,” but “any regulation or practice that restricts inmate correspondence must be generally necessary to protect one or more of the legitimate governmental interests identified above.” <span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/#414" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v.

<p id="b509-5">In the 15 years since <em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">Martinez</a></span> </em>was decided, lower courts routinely have applied its standard to review limitations not only on correspondence between inmates and private citi<page-number citation-index="1" label="424">*424</page-number>zens, but also on communications — such as the newsletters, magazines, and books at issue — between inmates and publishers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Carefully examining free speech rights and countervailing governmental interests, these courts approved some restrictions and invalidated others.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This Court thus correctly recognizes that <em>Martinez's </em>standard of review does not deprive prison officials of the discretion necessary to perform their difficult tasks. <em>Ante, </em>at 409. Inexplicably, it then partially overrules <em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">Martinez</a></span> </em>by limiting its scope to outgoing mail; letters and publications sent to prisoners now are subject only to review for “reasonableness.” <em>Ante, </em>at 413-414.</p>
<p id="b510-5">This peculiar bifurcation of the constitutional standard governing communications between inmates and outsiders is unjustified. The decision in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">Martinez</a></span> </em>was based on a distinction between prisoners’ constitutional rights and the protection the First Amendment affords those who are not prisoners — not between nonprisoners who are senders and those who are receivers. As Justice Powell explained:</p>
<blockquote id="b510-6">“Whatever the status of a prisoner’s claim to uncensored correspondence with an outsider, it is plain that the latter’s interest is grounded in the First Amendment’s guarantee of freedom of speech. And this does not depend on whether the nonprisoner correspondent is the author or intended recipient of a particular letter, for <page-number citation-index="1" label="425">*425</page-number>the addressee as well as the sender of direct personal correspondence derives from the First and Fourteenth Amendments a protection against unjustified governmental interference with the intended communication. . . . The wife of a prison inmate who is not permitted to read all that her husband wanted to say to her has suffered an abridgment of her interest in communicating with him as plain as that which results from censorship of her letter to him.” <span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/#408" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">416 U. S., at 408-409</a></span> (citations omitted).</blockquote>
<p id="b511-6">The Court today abandons Martinez’s fundamental premise. In my opinion its suggestion that three later opinions applying reasonableness standards warrant this departure, see <em>ante, </em>at 410, n. 9, is disingenuous. Those cases did involve communications between inmates and outsiders; however, as I shall demonstrate, their legal and factual foundations differed critically from those in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">Martinez</a></span> </em>or in this case.</p>
<p id="b511-7">In <em>Pell </em>v. <em>Procunier, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109079"><a href="/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/" aria-description="Citation for case: Pell v.

Procunier"><em>Id., </em>at 819</a></span>. The infringement on prisoners’ rights, the Court held, was reasonable because prisoners could write letters to the media — a means of communication less disruptive than the physical entry of reporters into the prison. <span class="citation" data-id="109079"><a href="/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/#824" aria-description="Citation for case: Pell v. Procunier"><em>Id., </em>at 824</a></span>. The reporters’ assertion of a special right of access could not prevail, the Court explained, because the First Amendment does not give the media greater access to public events or institutions — including prisons — than it gives ordinary citizens.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <span class="citation" data-id="109079"><a href="/opinion/109079/pell-v-procunier/#835" aria-description="Citation for case: Pell v.

<p id="b511-8">Inmates in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., </em><span class="citation" data-id="109718"><a href="/opinion/109718/jones-v-north-carolina-prisoners-labor-union-inc/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jones v.

It also approved the officials’ refusal to deliver bulk packets of union literature to specific inmates for distribution to others.

<p id="b512-5">In the third case, <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Wolfish, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110075"><a href="/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/" aria-description="Citation for case: Bell v.

Hardbacks might serve as containers for contraband, jail administrators argued. Since the risk of improper use by publishers and similar sources was low, the jail delivered books from them but not from other outsiders. <span class="citation" data-id="110075"><a href="/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/#549" aria-description="Citation for case: Bell v.

Wolfish"><em>Id., </em>at 550</a></span>. Although the Court did not expressly address the rights of nonprisoners, the fact that softcover publications were delivered without restriction, see <span class="citation" data-id="110075"><a href="/opinion/110075/bell-v-wolfish/#552" aria-description="Citation for case: Bell v. Wolfish"><em>id., </em>at 552</a></span>, minimized the abridgment of outsiders’ rights.

<p id="b512-6">Most recently, <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Safley, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111904"><a href="/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/" aria-description="Citation for case: Turner v.

Martinez">Martinez</a></span> </em>for evaluating encroachments on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners. The Court relied on the three interim “prisoners’ rights” cases to establish a reasonableness standard for reviewing inmate-to-inmate correspondence. <em>Id., </em>at 89. But in its unanimous invalidation of a restriction on inmate marriages, the Court acknowledged that “because the regulation may entail a ‘con<page-number citation-index="1" label="427">*427</page-number>sequential restriction on the [constitutional] rights of those who are not prisoners,’” <em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v.

Notwithstanding, today the Court abandons the premise on which <em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">Martinez</a></span> </em>was grounded. This casual discarding of “ ‘the secure foundation’ ” of considered precedent ill serves the orderly development of the law. See <em>Runyon </em>v. <em>McCrary, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109509"><a href="/opinion/109509/runyon-v-mccrary/#190" aria-description="Citation for case: Runyon v. McCrary">427 U.

<p id="b513-6">II</p>
<p id="b513-7">In lieu of <em>Martinez’s </em>rationale, which properly takes into consideration the effects that prison regulations have on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners, the Court applies a manipulable “reasonableness” standard to a set of regulations that too easily may be interpreted to authorize arbitrary rejections of literature addressed to inmates. As I pointed out in my partial dissent in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111904"><a href="/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/" aria-description="Citation for case: Turner v. Safley">Turner</a></span>, </em>an</p>
<blockquote id="b513-8">“open-ended ‘reasonableness’ standard makes it much too easy to uphold restrictions on prisoners’ First Amendment rights on the basis of administrative concerns and speculation about possible security risks rather than on the basis of evidence that the restrictions <page-number citation-index="1" label="428">*428</page-number>are needed to further an important governmental interest.” <span class="citation" data-id="111904"><a href="/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/#101" aria-description="Citation for case: Turner v. Safley">482 U. S., at 101, n. 1</a></span>.</blockquote>
<p id="b514-5">To be sure, courts must give prison administrators some berth to combat the “Herculean obstacles” blocking their efforts to maintain security and prevent escapes or other criminal conduct, see <em>Martinez, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/#404" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">416 U. S., at 404</a></span>, and I do not object to those regulations clearly targeted at such interests.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Nevertheless, I agree with the Court of Appeals that provisions allowing prison officials to reject a publication if they find its contents are “detrimental” to “security, good order, or discipline” or “might facilitate criminal activity” are impermissibly ambiguous. See <em>Abbott </em>v. <em>Meese, </em>263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 193, <span class="citation" data-id="492021"><a href="/opinion/492021/jack-abbott-v-edwin-meese-iii-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/#1173" aria-description="Citation for case: Jack Abbott v. Edwin Meese, Iii, Attorney General of the...">824 F. 2d 1166, 1173</a></span> (1987). The term “detrimental” invites so many interpretations that it scarcely checks administrators’ actions. Similarly, “might facilitate” —in contrast with “encourage” or “advocate” — so attenuates the causal connection between expression and proscribed conduct that the warden has virtually free rein to censor incoming publications.</p>
<p id="b514-6">Despite this vagueness, the Court accepts petitioners’ assertion that they need “broad discretion” to prevent internal disorder, and thus holds that all the regulations are facially valid. See <em>ante, </em>at 416. This premature leap of faith creates a presumption that rejections pursuant to these regulations are “reasonable” — a presumption that makes likely far less judicial protection of publishers’ rights than I believe the First Amendment requires. As was Justice Blackmun in <page-number citation-index="1" label="429">*429</page-number><em>Block </em>v. <em>Rutherford, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111254"><a href="/opinion/111254/block-v-rutherford/#593" aria-description="Citation for case: Block v. Rutherford">468 U. S. 576, 593</a></span> (1984) (concurring in judgment), I am concerned that the Court today too readily “shbstitute[s] the rhetoric of judicial deference for meaningful scrutiny of constitutional claims in the prison setting.” Cf. <em>O’Lone </em>v. <em>Estate of Shabazz, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111913"><a href="/opinion/111913/olone-v-estate-of-shabazz/#358" aria-description="Citation for case: O&#x27;Lone v.

North Carolina Prisoners&#x27; Labor Union, Inc.">433 U. S., at 142-143</a></span> (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>
<p id="b515-5">The feeble protection provided by a “reasonableness” standard applied within the framework of these regulations is apparent in this record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Like the Labyrinth issue, many of the 46 rejected publications criticized prison conditions or otherwise presented viewpoints that prison administrators likely would not welcome.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Testimony by one mail clerk<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="430">*430</page-number>and the rote explanations for decisions<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> suggest that rejections were based on personal prejudices or categorical assumptions rather than individual assessments of risk. Cf. <em>Martinez, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/#415" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">416 U. S., at 415</a></span>. These circumstances belie the Court’s interpretation of these regulations as “content-neutral” and its assertion that rejection decisions are made individually. See <em>ante, </em>at 414-417. Some of the rejected publications may represent the sole medium for conveying and receiving a particular unconventional message; thus it is irrelevant that the regulations permit many other publications to be delivered to prisoners. See <em>ante, </em>at 417-418. No evidence supports the Court’s assumption that, unlike personal letters, these publications will circulate within the prison and cause ripples of disruption.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> See <em>ante, </em>at 412, 418. Nor is there any evidence that an incoming publication ever caused a disciplinary or security problem; indeed, some of the rejected publications were delivered to inmates in other prisons without incident. See App. 60, 99, 116-117. In sum, the record convinces me that under either the <em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">Martinez</a></span> </em>standard or the more deferential “reasonableness” standard these <page-number citation-index="1" label="431">*431</page-number>regulations are an impermissibly exaggerated response to security concerns. Cf. <em>Turner, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111904"><a href="/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/#89" aria-description="Citation for case: Turner v. Safley">482 U. S., at 89-90</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b517-5">m</p>
<p id="b517-6">If a prison official deems part of a publication’s content— even just one page of a book — to present an intolerable security risk, the Bureau’s regulations authorize the official to return the entire issue to the publisher. See <span class="citation no-link">28 CFR § 540.71</span>(e) (1988). In their challenge to this all-or-nothing rule, respondents argue that First Amendment interests easily could be accommodated if administrators omitted the objectionable material and forwarded the rest of the publication to the inmate. The District Court, however, found that “defendants’ fears” that “such censorship would create more discontent than the current practice” were “reasonably founded.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a. To the contrary, the Court of Appeals applied the <em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">Martinez</a></span> </em>standard and held that “rejection of the balance is not ‘generally necessary’ to protect the legitimate governmental interest involved in the portion properly rejected.” 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 193-194, <span class="citation" data-id="492021"><a href="/opinion/492021/jack-abbott-v-edwin-meese-iii-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/#1173" aria-description="Citation for case: Jack Abbott v. Edwin Meese, Iii, Attorney General of the...">824 F. 2d, at 1173-1174</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b517-7">In this Court petitioners argue that on remand the Court of Appeals should conduct “a detailed analysis of the evidence in this case” to determine if the all-or-nothing rule is “reasonable.” Brief for Petitioners 31. “The validity of that policy,” they continue, “will depend, among other things, on the security and administrative justifications for that policy, the availability of alternative courses of action, and the costs and risks associated with employing those alternatives.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="492021"><a href="/opinion/492021/jack-abbott-v-edwin-meese-iii-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Jack Abbott v. Edwin Meese, Iii, Attorney General of the...">Ibid.</a></span> </em>It is remarkable that after 16 years of litigation petitioners have failed to develop an argument that tells us anything about the assumed security or administrative justificatioñ for this rule. Even more remarkable is the Court’s conclusion that since it does not apply the <em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">Martinez</a></span> </em>standard, it need not examine the appropriateness of the District Court’s find<page-number citation-index="1" label="432">*432</page-number>ing that the rule was reasonable. See <em>ante, </em>at 419. A review of the record reveals that the Court thus defers to “findings” of a security threat that even prison officials admitted to be nonexistent.</p>
<p id="b518-5">There is no evidence that delivery of only part of a publication would endanger prison security.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Rather, the primary <page-number citation-index="1" label="433">*433</page-number>justification advanced for the all-or-nothing rule was administrative convenience. See App. 41, 68. The Bureau has objected that a contrary rule “would mean defacing the material and laboriously going over each article in each publication. . . .” <span class="citation no-link">44 Fed. Reg. 38258</span> (1979). But general speculation that some administrative burden might ensue should not be sufficient to justify a meat-ax abridgment of the First Amendment rights of either a free citizen or a prison inmate. It is difficult even to imagine such a burden in this instance: if, as the regulations’ text seems to require, prison officials actually read an article before rejecting it, the incremental burden associated with clipping out the offending matter could not be of constitutional significance. The Bureau’s administrative convenience justification thus is insufficient as a matter of law under either the <em><span class="citation" data-id="109016"><a href="/opinion/109016/procunier-v-martinez/" aria-description="Citation for case: Procunier v. Martinez">Martinez</a></span> </em>standard or a “reasonableness” standard. The District Court’s contradictory finding simply highlights the likelihood that an attitude of broad judicial deference, coupled with a “reasonableness” <page-number citation-index="1" label="434">*434</page-number>standard, will provide inadequate protection for the rights at stake.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>”</p>
<p id="b520-5">For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>

Application of the standard would seem to permit disregard for inmates’ constitutional rights whenever the imagination of the warden produces a plausible security concern and a deferential trial court is able to discern a logical connection between that concern and the challenged regulation. Indeed, there is a logical connection between prison discipline and the use of bullwhips on prisoners; and security is logically furthered by a total ban on inmate communication, not only with other inmates but also with outsiders who conceivably might be interested in arranging an attack within the prison or an escape from it.” 482 U. S., at 100-101 (concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citation omitted) (emphasis in original).</blockquote>
