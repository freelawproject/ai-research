 The fact is that this Court, with no discussion of its fitness, simply transferred the rate base method to the natural gas industry.  It happened in Newark Natural Gas & Fuel Co. v. City of Newark, Ohio, 242 U. S. 405 (1917), in which the company wanted 25 cents per m. c. f., and under the Fourteenth Amendment challenged the reduction to 18 cents by ordinance.  This Court sustained the reduction because the court below “gave careful consideration to the questions of the value of the property at the time of the inquiry,” and whether the rate “would be sufficient to provide a fair return on the value of the property.” The Court said this method was “based upon principles thoroughly established by repeated decisions of this court,” citing many cases, not one of which involved natural gas or a comparable wasting natural resource.  Then came issues as to state power to *651 regulate as affected by'the commerce clause.  Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, 249 U. S. 236 (1919); Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 252 U. S. 23 (1920).  These questions settled, the Court again was called upon in natural gas cases to consider state rate-making claimed to be invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment.  United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, <citedDecision>278 U. S. 300</citedDecision> (1929); United Fuel Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission of West Virginia, 278 U. S. 322 (1929).  Then, as now, the differences were “due chiefly to the difference in value ascribed by each to the gas rights and leaseholds.” <citedDecision>278 U. S. 300, 311</citedDecision> .  No one seems to have questioned that the rate base method must be pursued and the controversy was as to what rate base must be used.  Later the “value” of gas in the field was questioned in determining the amount a regulated company should be allowed to pay an affiliate therefor — a state determination also reviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment.  Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 292 U. S. 290 (1934); Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 292 U. S. 398 (1934).  In both cases, one of which sustained and one of which struck down a fixed rate, the Court assumed the rate base method as the legal way of testing reasonableness of natural gas prices fixed by public authority, without examining its real relevancy to the inquiry.  Under the weight of such precedents we cannot expect the Commission to initiate economically intelligent methods of fixing gas prices.  But the Court now faces a new plan of federal regulation based on the power to fix the price at which gas shall be allowed to move in interstate commerce.

The New York Public Service Commission said: “While the transportation of natural gas through pipe lines from one state, to another *634 state is interstate commerce .  .  ., Congress has not taken over the regulation of that particular industry.  Indeed, it has expressly excepted it from the operation of the Interstate Commerce Commissions Law (Interstate Commerce Commissions Law, section 1).  It is quite clear, therefore, that this Commission can not require a Pennsylvania corporation producing gas in Pennsylvania to transport it and deliver it in the State of New York, and that the Interstate Commerce Commission is likewise powerless.  If there exists such a power, and it seems that there does, it is a power vested in Congress and by it not yet exercised.
