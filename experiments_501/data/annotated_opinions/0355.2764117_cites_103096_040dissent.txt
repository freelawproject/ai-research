**Dissenting Opinion**
 Fortunately, todayâ€™s decision does not go that far.  But its practical result will be to offer new inducements for conduct by parties and counsel, which, in any other type of litigation, would be regarded as perjury, but which is not so regarded where divorce is involved because ladies and gentlemen indulge in it.  But if the doctrine of res judicata as to jurisdictional facts in controversies involving exclusively private interests as infused into the Full Faith and Credit Clause is applied to divorce decrees so as to foreclose subsequent inquiry into jurisdiction, there is neither logic nor reason nor practical desirability in not taking the entire doctrine over.  Res judicata forecloses relitigation if there has been an opportunity to litigate once, whether or not it has been availed of, or carried as far as possible.  Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351 ; Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U. S. 371 .  15 And it applies to questions of jurisdiction of subject matter as well as to that of persons.  Stoll v. Gottlieb, <citedDecision>305 U. S. 165</citedDecision> ; Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U. S. 66 .  Why should it not apply where there has been a wasted opportunity to litigate, but should apply where the form of a contest has been gone through?  16 Or if more than form is required, how much of a contest must it be?  Must the contest be bellicose or *368 may it be pacific?  Must it be fierce or may it be tepid?  Must there .be a cloud of witnesses to negative the testimony of the plaintiff, or may a single doubter be enough?  Certainly if the considerations that establish res judicata as between private litigants in the ordinary situations apply to the validity of a divorce against the public policy of the State of domicile, it cannot make a rational difference that the question of domicile is contested with bad feeling rather than amicably adjusted.
