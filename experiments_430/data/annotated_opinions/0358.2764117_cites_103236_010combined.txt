 39 Fortunately, today's decision does not go that far.  But its practical result will be to offer new inducements for conduct by parties and counsel, which, in any other type of litigation, would be regarded as perjury, but which is not so regarded where divorce is involved because ladies and gentlemen indulge in it.  But if the doctrine of res judicata as to jurisdictional facts in controversies involving exclusively private interests as infused into the Full Faith and Credit Clause is applied to divorce decrees so as to foreclose subsequent inquiry into jurisdiction, there is neither logic nor reason nor practical desirability in not taking the entire doctrine over.  Res judicata forecloses relitigation if there has been an opportunity to litigate once, whether or not it has been availed of, or carried as far as possible.  Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U.S. 351 , 24 L.Ed. 195 ; Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U.S. 371 , 60 S.Ct. 317 , 84 L.Ed. 329 .  15 And it applies to questions of jurisdiction of subject matter as well as to that of persons.  Stol v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165 , 59 S.Ct. 134 , 83 L.Ed. 104 ; Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., <citedDecision>308 U.S. 66</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>60 S.Ct. 44</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>84 L.Ed. 85</citedDecision> .  Why should it not apply where there has been a wasted opportunity to litigate, but should apply where the form of a contest has been gone through?  16 Or if more than form is required, how much of a contest must it be?  Must the contest be bellicose or may it be pacific?  Must it be fierce or may it be tepid?  Must there be a cloud of witnesses to negative the testimony of the plaintiff, or may a single doubter be enough?  Certainly if the considerations that establish res judicata as between private litigants in the ordinary situations apply to the validity of a divorce against the public policy of the State of domicile, it cannot make a rational difference that the question of domicile is contested with bad feeling rather than amicably adjusted.

 17 Indovina and Dalton, Statutes of All States and Territories with Annotations on Marriage-Annulment-Divorce (Santa Monica, 1945).  These five States accounted for only 24,370 divorces in 1940, but 9% of the national total.  Dept. of Commerce, Statistical Abstract of the United States (1946) p. 94.  The number of divorces granted in Arkansas, Idaho, and Wyoming is small enough to indicate the normal incidence of divorce among their permanent population, with only few transients taking advantage of their divorce laws.  Nevada and Florida thus attract virtually all the non-resident divorce business.  Yet, between them, only 16,375 divorces were granted in 1940, 6% of the total.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Some of these people were undoubtedly permanently settled in those States, and have nothing to fear.  Others may have moved to those States, intending to make their permanent homes there, and have since remained.  They were amply protected by the Full Faith and Credit Clause even before today's decision.  The only persons at all insecure are that small minority who temporarily left their home States for a State—one of the few—offering quick and easy divorce, obtained one, and departed.  Is their security so important to the Nation that we must safeguard it even at the price of depriving the great majority of States which do not offer bargain-counter divorces of the right to determine the laws of domestic relations applicable to their citizens?  41 Even to a believer in the desirability of easier divorce—an issue that is not our concern—this decision should bring little solace.  It offers a way out only to that small portion of those unhappily married who are sufficiently wealthy to be able to afford a trip to Nevada or Florida, and a six-week or three-month stay there.

 8 The action was brought pursuant to the provisions of Mass.Gen.Laws (Ter. Ed.) c. 209, § 36.  9 Petitioner testified that for many years prior to her departure for Florida, respondent had made frequent allusions to the fact that petitioner's mother had been committed to a mental institution and had suggested that petitioner was revealing the same traits of mental instability.  Petitioner testified that as a result of these remarks and other acts of cruelty, her health had been undermined and that it had therefore become necessary for her to leave respondent.  In order to insure her departure, she had represented that her stay in Florida was to be only temporary, but from the outset she had in fact intended not to return.  Petitioner testified further that both before and after the Florida decree of divorce had been entered, she had intended to reside permanently in Florida and that she and Phelps had returned to Massachusetts only after receiving a letter stating that Phelps' father was in poor health.  10 1946, 320 Mass. 351 , 69 N.E.2d 801 .  11 See Williams v.

No Florida case has been called to our attention involving a collateral attack on a divorce decree questioning the domicile of the parties, and hence the jurisdiction of the court which entered the decree, where both parties appeae d in the divorce proceedings.

See note 1 supra. 19 Justices Brewer, Shiras, and Peckham dissented.  Mr. Justice Holmes took no part in the case. 20 Thus, in the Andrews case, before the divorce decree was entered by the South Dakota court, the defendant withdrew her appearance in accordance with a consent agreement.
