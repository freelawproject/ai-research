 In 1994, after having resolved the numerous other issues in the ease, he issued an order permanently excluding pervasively sectarian schools in Jefferson Parish from receiving any Chapter 2 materials or equipment.  Two years later, Chief Judge Heebe having retired, Judge Livaudais received the ease.  Ruling in early 1997 on post-judgment motions, he reversed the decision of former Chief Judge Heebe and upheld Chapter 2, pointing to several significant changes in the legal landscape over the previous seven years.  Helms v. Cody, 1997 WL 35283 (Jan. 28), App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a.  In particular, Judge Livaudais cited our 1993 decision in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dish, 509 U. S. 1 , in which we held that a State could, as part *805 of a federal program for the disabled, provide a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at a Catholic high school.  Judge Livaudais also relied heavily on a 1995 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Walker v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 46 F. 3d 1449 , upholding Chapter 2 on facts that he found “virtually indistinguishable.” The Ninth Circuit acknowledged in Walker, as Judge Heebe had in his 1990 summary judgment ruling, that Meek and Wolman appeared to erect a constitutional distinction between providing textbooks (permissible) and providing any other in-kind aid (impermissible).  46 F. 3d, at 1464-1465; see Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 236</citedDecision> (1968) (upholding textbook program).  The Court of Appeals viewed this distinction, however, as “thin” and “unmoored from any Establishment Clause principles,” and, more importantly, as “rendered untenable” by subsequent cases, particularly Zobrest.  46 F. 3d, at 1465-1466.  These cases, in the Ninth Circuit’s view, revived the principle of <citedDecision>Allen</citedDecision> and of Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing; 3 that “state benefits provided to all citizens without regard to religion are constitutional.” 46 F. 3d, at 1465.  The Ninth Circuit also relied, id., at 1467, on our observation in Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687 (1994), that “we have frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of any benefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges,” id., at 704 .  The Ninth Circuit purported to distinguish Meek and Wolman based on the percentage of schools receiving aid that were parochial (a large percentage in those cases and a moderate percentage in Walker), 46 F. 3d, at 1468, but that court undermined this distinction when it observed that Meek also upheld “the massive provision of text *806 books to parochial schools.” 46 F. 3d, at 1468, n. 16.  Thus, although the Ninth Circuit did not explicitly hold that Meek and Wolman were no longer good law, its reasoning seemed to require that conclusion.  Finally, in addition to relying on our decision in Zobrest and the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Walker, Judge Livaudais invoked Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 615 U. S. 819 (1995), in which, a few months after Walker, we held that the Establishment Clause does not require a public university to exclude a student-run religious publication from assistance available to numerous other student-run publications.  Following Judge Livaudais’ ruling, respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  While that appeal was pending, we decided Agostini , in which we approved a program that, under Title I of the ESEA, provided public employees to teach remedial classes at private schools, including religious schools.

 We have also indicated that the answer to the question of indoctrination will resolve the question whether a program of educational aid “subsidizes” religion, as our religion eases use that term. See Agostini , 521U.  S., at 230-231; see also id., at 230 .  In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, we have consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion.  If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government.  For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question.  If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any par *810 ticular indoctrination.  To put the point differently, if the government, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without regard to religion, to all who adequately further that purpose, see Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 245-247</citedDecision> (discussing dual secular and religious purposes of religious schools), then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose.  The government, in crafting such an aid program, has had to conclude that a given level of aid is necessary to further that purpose among secular recipients and has provided no more than that same level to religious recipients.  As a way of assuring neutrality, we have repeatedly considered whether any governmental aid that goes to a religious institution does so “only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of individuals.” Agostini, supra, at 226 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We have viewed as significant whether the “private choices of individual parents,” as opposed to the “unmediated” will of government, Ball, 473 U. S., at 395, n. 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), determine what schools ultimately benefit from the governmental aid, and how much.  For if numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.  Private choice also helps guarantee neutrality by mitigating the preference for pre-existing recipients that is arguably inherent in any governmental aid program, see, e. g., Gilder, The Revitalization of Everything: The Law of the Macrocosm, Harv. Bus. Rev. 49 (Mar./Apr.  1988), and that could lead to a program inadvertently favoring one religion or favoring religious private schools in general over nonreligious ones.

 For to say that a program does not create an incentive to choose religious schools is to say that the private choice is truly “independent,” Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 .  See Agostini, supra, at 232 (holding that Title I did not create any impermissible incentive, because its services were “available to all children who meet the Act’s eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school”); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (discussing, in successive sentences, neutrality, private choice, and financial incentives, respectively); Witters, supra, at 488 (similar).  When such an incentive does exist, there is a greater risk that one could attribute to the government any indoctrination by the religious schools.  See Zobrest, supra, at 10 .  We hasten to add, what should be obvious from the rule itself, that simply because an aid program offers private schools, and thus religious schools, a benefit that they did not previously receive does not mean that the program, by reducing the cost of securing a religious education, creates, under Agostini’s second criterion, an “incentive” for parents to choose such an education for their children.  For any aid will have some such effect.  See Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244</citedDecision> ; Everson, 330 U. S., at 17 ; see also Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 .  B Respondents inexplicably make no effort to address Chapter 2 under the Agostini test.  Instead, dismissing Agostini as factually distinguishable, they offer two rules that they contend should govern our determination of whether Chapter 2 has the effect of advancing religion.  They argue first, and chiefly, that “direct, nonineidental” aid to the primary educational mission of religious schools is always impermissible.  Second, they argue that provision to religious schools of aid that is divertible to religious use is similarly impermis *815 sible.  7 Respondents’ arguments are inconsistent with our more recent ease law, in particular Agostini and Zobrest , and we therefore reject them.  1 Although some of our earlier eases, particularly Ball, 473 U. S., at 393-394 , did emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect aid, the purpose of this distinction was *816 merely to prevent “subsidization” of religion, see id., at 394 .
**Lead Opinion**
 We found it insignificant that students did not have to direetly apply for Title I services, that Title I instruction was provided to students in groups rather than individually, and that instruction was provided in the facilities of the private schools.  Id., at 226-229 .  To the extent that respondents intend their direct/indireet distinction to require that any aid be literally placed in the hands of schoolchildren rather than given directly to the school for teaching those same children, the very cases on which respondents most rely, Meek and Wolman , demonstrate the irrelevance of such formalism.  In Meek , we justified our rejection of a program that loaned instructional materials and equipment by, among other things, pointing out that the aid was loaned to the schools, and thus was “direct *818 aid.” 421 U. S., at 362-363 .  The materials-and-equipment program in Wolman was essentially identical, except that the State, in an effort to comply with Meek , see Wolman, 433 U. S., at 233, 250 , loaned the aid to the students.  (The revised program operated much like the one we upheld in Allen.  Compare Wolman, supra, at 248 , with Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 243-245</citedDecision> .) Yet we dismissed as “technical” the difference between the two programs: “[I]t would exalt form over substance if this distinction were found to justify a result different from that in Meek.” 433 U. S., at 250 .  Wol-man thus, although purporting to reaffirm Meek , actually undermined that decision, as is evident from the similarity between the reasoning of Wolman and that of the Meek dissent.  Compare Wolman, supra, at 250 (The “technical change in legal bailee” was irrelevant), with Meek, supra, at 391 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (“Nor can the fact that the school is the bailee be regarded as constitutionally determinative”).  That Meek and Wolman reached the same result, on programs that were indistinguishable but for the direct/indirect distinction, shows that that distinction played no part in Meek .  Further, respondents’ formalistic line breaks down in the application to real-world programs.  In Allen, for example, although we did recognize that students themselves received and owned the textbooks, we also noted that the books provided were those that the private schools required for courses, that the schools eould collect students’ requests for books and submit them to the board of education, that the schools could store the textbooks, and that the textbooks were essential to the schools’ teaching of secular subjects.  See <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 243-245</citedDecision> .  Whether one chooses to label this program “direct” or “indirect” is a rather arbitrary choice, one that does not further the constitutional analysis.  Of course, we have seen “special Establishment Clause dangers,” Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842, when money is *819 given to religious schools or entities directly rather than, as in Witters and Mueller , indirectly.  See 515 U. S., at 842 (collecting cases); id., at 846-847 (O’Connor, J., concurring); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608-609 (1988); compare Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), with Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472 (1973).  8 But *820 direct payments of money are not at issue in this case, and we refuse to allow a “special” case to create a rule for all cases. 2 Respondents also contend that the Establishment Clause requires that aid to religious schools not be impermissibly religious in nature or be divertible to religious use.  We agree with the first part of this argument but not the second.  Respondents’ “no divertibility” rule is inconsistent with our more recent case law and is unworkable.
**Lead Opinion**
 The aid program in Wolman explicitly barred divertible aid, 433 U. S., at 248-249 , so a concern for divertibility could not have been part of our reason for finding that program invalid.  The issue is not divertibility of aid but rather whether the aid itself has an impermissible content.  Where the aid would be suitable for use in a public school, it is also suitable for use in any private school.  Similarly, the prohibition against the government providing impermissible content resolves the Establishment Clause concerns that exist if aid is actually diverted to religious uses.  9 In Agostini , we explained Zobrest by making just this distinction between the content of aid and the use of that aid: “Because the only government aid in Zobrest was the interpreter, who was herself not inculcating any religious messages, no government indoctrination took place.” 521 U. S., at 224 (second emphasis added).  Agostini also acknowledged that what the dissenters in Zobrest had charged was essentially true: Zobrest did effect a “shift ... in our Establishment Clause law.” 521 U. S., at 225 .  The interpreter herself, assuming that she *823 fulfilled her assigned duties, see id., at 224-225 , had “no inherent religious significance,” Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244</citedDecision> (discussing bus rides in Everson), and so it did not matter (given the neutrality and private choice involved in the program) that she “would be a mouthpiece for religious instruction,” Agostini, supra, at 226 (discussing Zobrest).  And just as a government interpreter does not herself inculcate a religious message — even when she is conveying one — so also a government computer or overhead projector does not itself inculcate a religious message, even when it is conveying one.  In Agostini itself, we approved the provision of public employees to teach secular remedial classes in private schools partly because we concluded that there was no reason t© suspect that indoctrinating content would be part of such governmental aid.  See 521 U. S., at 223-225, 226-227, 234-235 .  Relying on Zobrest , we refused to presume that the public teachers would “‘inject religious content’” into their classes, 521 U. S., at 225 , especially given certain safeguards that existed; we also saw no evidence that they had done so, id, at 226-227.  In Allen we similarly focused on content, emphasizing that the textbooks were preapproved by public school authorities and were not “unsuitable for use in the public schools because of religious content.” <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 245</citedDecision> .  See Lemon, 403 U. S., at 617 (“We note that the dissenters in Allen seemed chiefly concerned with the pragmatic difficulties involved in ensuring the truly secular content of the textbooks” (emphasis added)).  Although it might appear that a book, because it has a pre-existing content, is not divertible, and thus that lack of divertibility motivated our holding in Allen, it is hard to imagine any book that could not, in even moderately skilled hands, serve to illustrate a religious message.  10 Post, at 855 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) *824 (agreeing with this point).  Indeed, the plaintiffs in Walker essentially conceded as much.  46 F. 3d, at 1469, n. 17.  A teacher could, for example, easily use Shakespeare's King Lear, even though set in pagan times, to illustrate the Fourth Commandment.

 Although we left it open on remand for the District Court to reaffirm its prior finding, we took pains to emphasize the narrowness of the “pervasively sectarian” category, see id., at 620-621 (opinion of the Court), and two *827 Members of the majority questioned whether this category was “well-founded,” id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring).  Then, in Zobrest and Agostini , we upheld aid programs to children who attended schools that were not only pervasively sectarian but also were primary and secondary.  Zobrest , in turning away a challenge based on the pervasively sectarian nature of Salpointe Catholic High School, emphasized the presence of private choice and the absence of government-provided sectarian content.  509 U. S., at 13 .  Agostini , in explaining why the aid program was constitutional, did not bother to mention that pervasively sectarian schools were at issue, 13 see 521 U. S., at 226-235 , a fact that was not lost on the dissent, see id., at 249 (opinion of Souter, J.).  In disregarding the nature of the school, Zobrest and Agostini were merely returning to the approach of Everson and Allen, in which the Court upheld aid programs to students at pervasively sectarian schools.  See post, at 875, 885-886 (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting this fact regarding Everson); Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 251-252</citedDecision> (Black, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>id., at 262-264, 269-270</citedDecision> , n. (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Second, the religious nature of a recipient should not matter to the constitutional analysis, so long as the recipient adequately furthers the government’s secular purpose.  See supra, at 810.  If a program offers permissible aid to the religious (including the pervasively sectarian), the areligious, and the irreligious, it is a mystery which view of religion the government has established, and thus a mystery what the constitutional violation would be.  The pervasively sectarian recipient has not received any special favor, and it is most bizarre that the Court would, as the dissent seemingly does, reserve special hostility for those who take their religion seriously, who think that their religion should affect the whole *828 of their lives, or who make the mistake of being effective in transmitting their views to children.  Third, the inquiry into the recipient’s religious views required by a focus on whether a school is pervasively sectarian is not only unnecessary but also offensive.  It is well established, in numerous other contexts, that courts should refrain from trolling through a person’s or institution’s religious beliefs.

 It is the students and their parents— not the government — who, through their choice of school, determine who receives Chapter 2 funds.  The aid follows the child. *831 Because Chapter 2 aid is provided pursuant to private choices, it is not problematic that one could fairly describe Chapter 2 as providing “direct” aid.  The materials and equipment provided under Chapter 2 are presumably used from time to time by entire classes rather than by individual students (although individual students are likely the chief consumers of library books and, perhaps, of computers and computer software), and students themselves do not need to apply for Chapter 2 aid in order for their schools to receive it, but, as we explained in Agostini , these traits are not constitutionally significant or meaningful.  See id., at 228-229 .  Nor, for reasons we have already explained, is it of constitutional significance that the schools themselves, rather than the students, are the bailees of the Chapter 2 aid.  The ultimate beneficiaries of Chapter 2 aid are the students who attend the schools that receive that aid, and this is so regardless of whether individual students lug computers to school each day or, as Jefferson Parish has more sensibly provided, the schools receive the computers.  Like the Ninth Circuit, and unlike the dissent, post, at 888, we “see little difference in loaning science kits to students who then bring the kits to school as opposed to loaning science kits to the school directly.” Walker, supra, at 1468, n. 16; see Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 244, n. 6</citedDecision> .  Finally, Chapter 2 satisfies the first Agostini criterion because it does not provide to religious schools aid that has an impermissible content.  The statute explicitly bars anything of the sort, providing that all Chapter 2 aid for the benefit of children in private schools shall be “secular, neutral, and nonideological,” § 7372(a)(1), and the record indicates that the Louisiana SEA and the Jefferson Parish LEA have faithfully enforced this requirement insofar as relevant to this case. The chief aid at issue is computers, computer software, and library books.  The computers presumably have no preexisting content, or at least none that would be impermissible for use in public schools.  Respondents do not contend *832 otherwise.  Respondents also offer no evidence that religious schools have received software from the government that has an impermissible content.  There is evidence that equipment has been, or at least easily could be, diverted for use in religious classes.

 We approved a similar arrangement in Quick Bear, 210 U. S., at 77-82 , and the Federal Government appears to have long had such a program, see 1999 Catalog of Caring: Combined Federal Campaign of the National Capital Area 44, 45, 59, 74-75 (listing numerous religious organizations, many of which engage in religious education or in proselytizing, to which federal employees may contribute via payroll deductions); see generally Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U. S. 788 (1985) (discussing Combined Federal Campaign).  Finally, at least some of our prior cases striking down direct payments involved serious concerns about whether the payments were truly neutral.  See, e. g., Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 762-764, 768, 774-780 (1973) (striking down, by 8-to-l vote, program providing direct grants for maintenance and repair of school facilities, where payments were allocated per-pupil but were only *820 available to private, nonprofit schools in low-income areas, “‘all or practically all’ ” of which were Catholic).  Id., at 768 .  The dissent would find an establishment of religion if a government-provided projector were used in a religious school to show a privately purchased religious film, even though a public school that possessed the same kind of projector would likely be constitutionally barred from refusing to allow a student bible club to use that projector in a classroom to show the very same film, where the classrooms and projectors were generally available to student groups.  See Lamb’s Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U. S. 384 (1998).  Although we did, elsewhere in Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 236</citedDecision> (1968), observe, in response to a party’s argument, that there was no evidence that the schools were using secular text *824 books to somehow further religious instruction, see <citedDecision>id., at 248</citedDecision> , we had no occasion to say what the consequence would be were such use occurring and, more importantly, we think that this brief concluding comment cannot be read, especially after Zobrest (not to mention Witters, Mueller, and Agostini) as essential to the reasoning of Allen.  Justice O’Connor agrees that the Constitution does not bar divertible aid.  See post, at 857 (opinion concurring in judgment).  She also finds actual diversion unproblematic if “true private-choice” directs the aid.  See post, at 842.  And even when there is not such private choice, she thinks that some amount of actual diversion is tolerable and that safeguards for preventing and detecting actual diversion may be minimal, as we explain further, infra, at 832-834.  It is thus surprising for the dissent to accuse us of following a rule of “breathtaking... manipulability.” Post, at 901, n. 19.
