 It imposes criminal penalties upon any person who possesses, keeps, or maintains premises in which policy playing occurs, or lotteries are conducted, and upon any *47 person who becomes the custodian of books, property, appliances, or apparatus employed for wagering.  Conn. Gen. Stat. Rev. § 53-298 (1958).  See also §§ 53-273, 53-290, 53-293.  It provides additional penalties for those who conspire to organize or conduct unlawful wagering activities.  Conn. Gen. Stat. Rev. § 54 — 197 (1958).  Every aspect of petitioner’s wagering activities thus subjected him to possible state or federal prosecution.  By any standard, in Connecticut and throughout the United States, wagering is “an area permeated with criminal statutes,” and those engaged in wagering are a group “inherently suspect of criminal activities.” Albertson v. SACB, <citedDecision>382 U. S. 70, 79</citedDecision> .  Information obtained as a consequence of the federal wagering tax laws is readily available to assist the efforts of state and federal authorities to enforce these penalties.  Section 6107 of Title 26 requires the principal internal revenue offices to provide to prosecuting officers a listing of those who have paid the occupational tax. Section 6806 (c) obliges taxpayers either to post the revenue stamp “conspicuously” in their principal places of business, or to keep it on their persons, and to produce it on the demand of Treasury officers.  Evidence of the possession of a federal wagering tax stamp, or of payment of the wagering taxes, has often been admitted at trial in state and federal prosecutions for gambling offenses; 7 such evidence has doubtless proved useful even more frequently to lead prosecuting authorities to other evidence upon which convictions have subsequently *48 been obtained.  8 Finally, we are obliged to notice that a former Commissioner of Internal Revenue has acknowledged that the Service “makes available” to law enforcement agencies the names and addresses of those who have paid the wagering taxes, and that it is in “full cooperation” with the efforts of the Attorney General of the United States to suppress organized gambling.  Caplin, The Gambling Business and Federal Taxes, 8 Crime & Delin.  371, 372, 377.

 To these questions we turn.  *50 III. The Court's opinion in Kahriger suggested that a defendant under indictment for willful failure to register under § 4412 cannot properly challenge the constitutionality under the Fifth Amendment of the registration requirement.  For this point, the Court relied entirely upon Mr. Justice Holmes’ opinion for the Court in United States v. Sullivan, supra. The taxpayer in Sullivan was convicted of willful failure to file an income tax return, despite his contention that the return would have obliged him to admit violations of the National Prohibition Act.  The Court affirmed the conviction, and rejected the taxpayer’s claim of the privilege.  It concluded that most of the return’s questions would not have compelled the taxpayer to make incriminating disclosures, and that it would have been “an extreme if not an extravagant application” of the privilege to permit him to draw within it the entire return.  274 U. S., at 263 .  The Court in Sullivan was evidently concerned, first, that the claim before it was an unwarranted extension of the scope of the privilege, and, second, that to accept a claim of privilege not asserted at the time the return was due would “make the taxpayer rather than a tribunal the final arbiter of the merits of the claim.” Albertson v. SACB, <citedDecision>382 U. S. 70, 79</citedDecision> .  Neither reason suffices to prevent this petitioner’s assertion of the privilege.  The first is, as we have indicated, inapplicable, and we find the second unpersuasive in this situation.  Every element of these requirements would have served to incriminate petitioner; to have required him to present his claim to Treasury officers would have obliged him “to prove guilt to avoid admitting it.” United States v. Kahriger, supra, at 34 (concurring opinion).  In these circumstances, we cannot conclude that his failure *51 to assert the privilege to Treasury officials at the moment the tax payments were due irretrievably abandoned his constitutional protection.  Petitioner is under sentence for violation of statutory requirements which he consistently asserted at and after trial to be unconstitutional; no more can here be required.  The Court held in Lewis that the registration and occupational tax requirements do not infringe the constitutional privilege because they do not compel self-incrimination, but merely impose on the gambler the initial choice of whether he wishes, at the cost of his constitutional privilege, to commence wagering activities.

 *57 First, petitioner Marchetti was not, by the provisions now at issue, obliged to keep and preserve records “of the same kind as he has customarily kept”; he was required simply to provide information, unrelated to any records which he may have maintained, about his wagering activities.  This requirement is not significantly different from a demand that he provide oral testimony.  Compare McKay, supra, at 221.  Second, whatever “public aspects” there were to the records at issue in Shapiro , there are none to the information demanded from Marchetti.  The Government’s anxiety to obtain information known to a private individual does not without more render that information public; if it did, no room would remain for the application of the constitutional privilege.  Nor does it stamp information with a public character that the Government has formalized its demands in the attire of a statute; if this alone were sufficient, the constitutional privilege could be entirely abrogated by any Act of Congress.  Third, the requirements at issue in Shapiro were imposed in “an essentially non-criminal and regulatory area of inquiry” while those here are directed to a “selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.” Cf. Albertson v. SACB, <citedDecision>382 U. S. 70, 79</citedDecision> .  The United States’ principal interest is evidently the collection of revenue, and not the punishment of gamblers, see United States v. Calamaro, 354 U. S. 351, 358 ; but the characteristics of the activities about which information is sought, and the composition of the groups to which inquiries are made, readily distinguish this situation from that in Shapiro .  There is no need to explore further the elements and limitations of Shapiro and the cases involving public papers; these points of difference in combination preclude any appropriate application of those cases to the present one.' *58 y. Finally, we have been urged by the United States to permit continued enforcement of the registration and occupational tax provisions, despite the demands of the constitutional privilege, by shielding the privilege’s claimants through the imposition of restrictions upon the use by federal and state authorities of information obtained as a consequence of compliance with the wagering tax requirements.  It is suggested that these restrictions might be similar to those imposed by the Court in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, 378 U. S. 52 .  The Constitution of course obliges this Court to give full recognition to the taxing powers and to measures reasonably incidental to.  their exercise.
