 My Brethren thus have today manufactured an abstraction without substance, founded neither in the words of the Constitution nor on precedent.  An abstraction having such profoundly pernicious consequences is not made less so by characterizing the 1974 amendments as legislation directed against the “States qua States.” Ante, at 847.  See ante, at 845, 854.  Of course, regulations that this Court can say are not regulations of “commerce” cannot stand, Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S. 453, 466 (1938), and in this sense “[t]he Court has ample power to prevent .  .  .  'the Utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity.’ ” Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183, 196</citedDecision> (1968).  3 But my *861 Brethren make no claim that the 1974 amendments are not regulations of “commerce”; rather they overrule <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> in disagreement with historic principles that United States v. California, supra, reaffirmed: “[W]hile the commerce power has limits, valid general regulations of commerce do not cease to be regulations of commerce because a State is involved.  If a State is engaging in economic activities that are validly regulated by the Federal Government when engaged in by private persons, the State too may be forced to conform its activities to federal regulation.” <citedDecision>Wirtz, supra, at 196-197</citedDecision> .  Clearly, therefore, my Brethren are also repudiating the long line of our precedents holding that a judicial finding that Congress has not unreasonably regulated a subject matter of “commerce” brings to an end the judicial role.  “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.” M'Culloch v. Maryland, supra, at 421.  The reliance of my Brethren upon the Tenth Amendment as “an express declaration of [a state sovereignty] limitation,” ante, at 842, 4 not only suggests that they *862 overrule governing decisions of this Court that address this question but must astound scholars of the Constitution.  For not only early decisions, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 196 ; M‘Culloch v. Maryland, supra, at 404-407; and Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304 , 324— 325 (1816), hold that nothing in the Tenth Amendment constitutes a limitation on congressional exercise of powers delegated by the Constitution to Congress.  See F. Frankfurter, The Commerce Clause Under Marshall, Taney and Waite 39-40 (1937).  Rather, as the Tenth Amendment’s significance was more recently summarized: “The amendment states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered.

 It may have been the eventual abandonment of that overly restrictive construction of the commerce power that spelled defeat for the Court-packing plan, and preserved the integrity of this institution, id., at 682 , see, e. g., United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941); Mulford v. Smith, 307 U. S. 38 (1939); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1 (1937), but my Brethren today are transparently trying to cut back on that recognition of the scope of the commerce power.  My Brethren’s approach to this case is not far different from the dissenting opinions in the cases that averted the crisis.  See, e. g., Mulford v. Smith, supra, at 51 (Butler, J., dissenting); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, at 76 (McReynolds, J., dissenting) .  9 *869 That no precedent justifies today's result is particularly clear from the awkward extension of the doctrine of state immunity from federal taxation — an immunity conclusively distinguished by Mr. Justice Stone in California , and an immunity that is “narrowly limited” because “the people of all the states have created the national government and are represented in Congress,” Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 416 (1938) (Stone, J.) 10 — to fashion a judicially enforceable restraint on *870 Congress’ exercise of the commerce power that the Court has time and again rejected as having no place in our constitutional jurisprudence.  11 “[W]here [Congress] *871 keeps within its sphere and violates no express constitutional limitation it has been the rule of this Court, going back almost to the founding days of the Republic, not to interfere.” Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S., at 305 .  To argue, as do my Brethren, that the 1974 amendments are directed at the “States qua States,” and “dis-plací] state policies regarding the manner in which they will structure delivery of those governmental services which their citizens require,” ante, at 847, and therefore “directly penaliz[e] the States for choosing to hire governmental employees on terms different from those which Congress has sought to impose,” ante, at 849, is only to advance precisely the unsuccessful arguments made by the State of Washington in Case v. Bowles and the State of California in United States v. California .  The 1974 amendments are, however, an entirely legitimate exercise of the commerce power, not in the slightest restrained by any doctrine of state sovereignty cognizable in this Court, as Case v. Bowles, United States v. California, Maryland v. <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , and our other pertinent precedents squarely and definitively establish.  Moreover, since Maryland v. <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> is overruled, the Fair Labor Standards Act is invalidated in its application to all state employees “in [any areas] that the States have regarded as integral parts of their governmental activities.” Ante, at 854 n. 18.  This standard is a meaningless limitation on the Court’s state-sovereignty doctrine, and thus today’s holding goes beyond even what the States of Washington and California urged in Case v. Bowles and United States v. California , and by its logic would overrule those cases and with them Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and certain reasoning in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S. 279, 284-285 (1973).  I cannot recall another instance in the Court’s history when the reasoning of so many decisions covering so long a span of time has been *872 discarded in such a roughshod manner.  That this is done without any justification not already often advanced and consistently rejected, clearly renders today’s decision an ipse dixit reflecting nothing but displeasure with a congressional judgment.  My Brethren’s treatment of Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), further illustrates the paucity of legal reasoning or principle j ustifying today’s result.  Although the Economic Stabilization Act “displace[d] the States’ freedom,” ante, at 852 — the reason given for invalidating the 1974 amendments — the result in Fry is not disturbed since the interference was temporary and only a national program enforced by the Federal Government could have alleviated the country’s economic crisis.  Thus, although my Brethren by fiat strike down the 1974 amendments without analysis of countervailing national considerations, Fry by contrary logic remains undisturbed because, on balance, countervailing national considerations override the interference with the State’s freedom.

 It is absurd to suggest that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between curbs against increasing wages and curbs against paying wages lower than the federal minimum.  Today’s holding patently is in derogation of the sovereign power of the Nation to regulate interstate commerce.  Can the States engage in businesses competing with the private sector and then come to the courts arguing that withdrawing the employees of those businesses from the private sector evades the power of the Federal Government to regulate commerce?  See New York v. *873 United States, 326 U. S., at 582 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  No principle given meaningful content by my Brethren today precludes the States from doing just that.  Our historic decisions rejecting all suggestions that the States stand in a different position from affected private parties when challenging congressional exercise of the commerce power reflect that very concern.  Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936).  Fry only last Term emphasized “that States are not immune from all federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status.” 421 U. S., at 548 (emphasis added).  For “[b]y empowering Congress to regulate commerce .  .  .  the States necessarily surrendered any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regulation.” Farden v. Terminal R. Co., supra, at 192; see Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., supra, at 286.  Employment relations of States that subject themselves to congressional regulation by participating in regulable commerce are subject to congressional regulation.

 In fiscal 1977 the President’s proposed budget recommends $60.5 billion in federal assistance to the States, exclusive of loans.  Office of Management and Budget, Special Analyses: Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1977, p. 255.  Appellants complain of the impact of the amended FLSA on police and fire departments, but the 1977 budget contemplates outlays for law enforcement assistance of $716 million.  Id., at 258.  Concern is also expressed about the diminished ability to hire students in the summer if States must pay them a minimum wage, but the Federal Government’s “summer youth program” provides $400 million for 670,000 jobs.  Ibid. Given this demonstrated ability to obtain funds from the Federal Government for needed state services, there is little doubt that the States’ influence in the political process is adequate to safeguard their sovereignty.  14 *879 My Brethren’s disregard for precedents recognizing these long-settled constitutional principles is painfully obvious in their cavalier treatment of Maryland v. <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> .  Without even a passing reference to the doctrine of stare decisis, Wirtz — regarded as controlling only last Term, Fry v. United States, 421 U. S., at 548 , and as good law in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S., at 283—is by exercise of raw judicial power overruled.  No effort is made to distinguish the FLSA amendments sustained in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> from the 1974 amendments.  We are told at the outset that “the 'far-reaching implications’ of <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> should be overruled,” ante, at 840; later it is said that the “reasoning in Wirtz” is no longer “authoritative,” ante, at 854.  My Brethren then merely restate their essential-function test and say that <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> must “therefore” be overruled.  Ante, at 855-856.  There is no analysis whether <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> reached the correct result, apart from any flaws in reasoning, even though we are told that “there are obvious differences” between this case and Wirtz.  Ante, at 855.  15 Are state and fed *880 eral interests being silently balanced, as in the discussion of Fry, ante, at 853?  The best I can make of it is that the 1966 FLSA amendments are struck down and <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> is overruled on the basis of the conceptually unworkable essential-function test; and that the test is unworkable is demonstrated by my Brethren’s inability to articulate any meaningful distinctions among state-operated railroads, see ante, at 854-855, n. 18, state-operated schools and hospitals, and state-operated police and fire departments.  We are left then with a catastrophic judicial body blow at Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.  Even if Congress may nevertheless accomplish its objectives— for example, by conditioning grants of federal funds upon compliance with federal minimum wage and overtime standards, cf. Oklahoma v. CSC, 330 U. S. 127, 144 (1947)—there is an ominous portent of disruption of our constitutional structure implicit in today’s mischievous decision.  I dissent.  “A government ought to contain in itself every power requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed to its care, and to the complete execution of the trusts for which it is responsible; free from every other control, but a regard to the public good and to the sense of the people.” The Federalist No. 31, p. 195 (J. Cooke ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  Some decisions reflect the Court’s reluctance to interpret legislation to alter the federal-state balance of power.  See, e. g., Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S. 279, 285-287 (1973); United States v. Bass, 404 U. S. 336, 349 (1971).  Rather than state any limit on congressional power, however, these decisions merely rely on our traditional canon of construction in the face of statutory ambiguity that recognizes a presumption that Congress normally considers effects on federalism before taking action displacing state authority.  Stern, The Commerce Clause and the National Economy, 1933-1946, Part Two, 59 Harv. L. Rev. 883 , 946 (1946).  There is no claim that the 1974 amendments are not clearly intended to apply to the States, nor is there any suggestion that Congress was unaware of the federalism issue.  As support for the creation of a state sovereignty limitation on the commerce power, my Brethren quote this statement in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> out of context.  Ante, at 842.  This statement is at the end of a paragraph in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> recognizing that Congress’ commerce power is limited because it reaches only “ ‘commerce with foreign nations and among the several States.’ ” <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 196</citedDecision> , quoting Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S., at 466 .  The passage that follows the language quoted by the Court is: “But while the commerce power has limits, valid general regulations of commerce do not cease to be regulations of commerce because a State is involved.  If a State is engaging in economic activities that are validly regulated by the Federal Government when engaged in by private persons, the State too may be forced to conform its activities to federal regulation.” <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 196-197</citedDecision> .  It is clear, then, that this Court’s “ample power” to prevent the destruction of the States was not found in <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> to result from some affirmative limit on the exercise of the commerce power, but rather in the Court’s function of limiting congressional exercise of its power to regulation of “commerce.” The Court relies on Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 , 547 n. 7 (1975), but I cannot subscribe to reading Fry as departing, without analysis, from a principle that has remained unquestioned for over 150 years.  Although the Tenth Amendment “is not without significance/’ ibid., its meaning is clear: it declares that our Federal Government is one of delegated powers.  And it is because of this constraint, rather than the state-sovereignty doctrine discovered today by the Court, “that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States’ integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.” Ibid. Fry did not say that there is a limit in the Tenth Amendment on the exercise of a delegated power, but instead said that “Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that ....’’ The only import of the footnote in Fry , then, *862 is that Congress may not invade state sovereignty by exercising powers not delegated to it by the Constitution; since the wage ceilings at issue in Fry were clearly within the commerce power, we found no “drastic invasion of state sovereignty.” Id., at 548 n. 7.  Even the author of today’s opinion stated in Fry that the Tenth Amendment does not “by its terms” restrict Congress’ power to regulate commerce.  Id., at 557 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).  In support of the first-quoted paragraph, Darby cited 2 J. Elliot, Debates 123, 131 (2d ed. 1787); 3 id., at 450, 464, 600; 4 id., at 140, 148; 1 Annals of Congress 432, 761, 767-768 (1789); 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution §§ 1907-1908 (2d ed. 1851) (“It is plain, therefore, that it could not have been the intention of the framers of this amendment to give it effect, as an abridgment of any of the powers granted under the constitution, whether they are express or implied, direct or incidental.  Its sole design is to exclude any interpretation, by which other powers should be assumed beyond those which are granted”).

 The Congress has reduced some of the economic and social disruptions this extension could cause by recognizing the unique requirements of police, fire, and correctional services.” 10 Weekly Comp, of Presidential Documents 392 (1974).  In contrast, my Brethren frequently remand powerless individuals to the political process by invoking doctrines of standing, jus-ticiability, and remedies.  For example, in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U. S. 490 (1975), the Court suggested that some residents of Rochester, *879 N. Y., “not overlook the availability of the normal democratic process,” id., at 508 n. 18, even though they were challenging a suburban zoning ordinance and had no voice in the suburb’s political affairs.  In this case, however, those entities with perhaps the greatest representation in the political process have lost a legislative battle, but when they enter the courts and repeat the arguments made in the political branches, the Court welcomes them with open arms, embraces their political cause, and overrides Congress’ political decision.  In contrast, the Court measures the legislation at issue in Fry in light of today’s decision, although, as I have noted, that consideration amounts to a repudiation of the Court’s holding.  See supra, at 872.  Just as the reasoning of <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> is rejected, however, the reasoning of Fry , decided only last Term, must also be deemed rejected, for it adhered totally to the principles of <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> .  That the Economic Stabilization Act was an emergency measure was not dis-positive in Fry ; it merely rendered the Act “even less intrusive” than the “quite limited” legislation sustained in Wirtz.  421 U. S., at 548 .
