Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Powell and Justice Stevens join, dissenting.  In Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 274</citedDecision> (1977), a unanimous Court observed: “A tailored tax, however accomplished, must receive the careful scrutiny of the courts to determine whether it produces a forbidden effect on interstate commerce.” <citedDecision>Id., at 288-289, n. 15</citedDecision> .  In this case, appellants have alleged that Montana’s severance tax on coal is tailored to single out interstate commerce, and that it produces a forbidden effect on that commerce because the tax bears no “relationship to the services provided by the State.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> The Court today concludes that appellants are not entitled to a trial on this claim.  Because I believe that the “careful scrutiny” due a tailored tax makes a trial here necessary, I respectfully dissent.  I The State of Montana has approximately 25% of all known United States coal reserves, and more than 50% of the Nation’s low-sulfur coal reserves.  1 Department of Energy, Demonstrated Reserve Base of Coal in the United States on January 1, 1979, p. 8 (1981); National Coal Assn., Coal Data 1978, p. 1-6 (1980).  Approximately 70-75% of Montana’s *639 coal lies under land owned by the Federal Government in the State.  See Hearings on H. It.  6625, H. R. 6654, and H. R. 7163 before the Subcommittee on Energy and Power of the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 96th Cong., 2d Sess., 22 (1980) (Hearings) (statement of Rep. Vento).  The great bulk of the coal mined in Montana — indeed, allegedly as much as 90%, see ante, at 617-618 — is exported to other States pursuant to long-term purchase contracts with out-of-state utilities.  See H. R. Rep. No. 96-1527, pt. 1, pp. 3-4 (1980).  Those contracts typically provide that the costs of state taxation shall be passed on to the utilities; in turn, fuel adjustment clauses allow the utilities to pass the cost of taxation along to their consumers.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Because federal environmental legislation has increased the demand for low-sulfur coal, id., at 3, and because the Montana coal fields occupy a “pivotal” geographic position in the midwestern and northwestern energy markets, see J. Krutilla & A. Fisher with R. Rice, Economic and Fiscal Impacts of Coal Development: Northern Great Plains xvi (1978) (Krutilla), Montana has supplied an increasing percentage of the Nation’s coal. 2 In 1975, following the Arab oil embargo and the first federal coal conversion legislation, the Montana Legislature,.  by 1975 Mont. Laws, ch. 525, increased the State’s severance tax on coal from a flat rate of approximately 34 cents per ton to a maximum rate of 30% of the “contract sales price.” Mont. Code Ann. § 15-35-103 (1979).  3 See H. R. Rep. No. 96-1527, pt. 1, p. 3 (1980).  The legislative history of this tax is illuminating.  The Joint Conference Committees of the Mon *640 tana Legislature that recommended this amendment acknowledged : “It is true that this is a higher rate of taxation than that levied by any other American state on the coal industry/’ 4 Statement to Accompany the Report “of the Free Joint Conference Committees on Coal Taxation 1 (1975).  The Committees pointed out, however, that the Province of Alberta, Canada, recently had raised sharply its royalty on natural gas, thereby forcing consumers of Alberta gas in Montana and elsewhere to finance involuntarily Alberta’s “universities, hospitals, reduction of other taxes, etc.” Ibid. Stating that “we should .  .

 Several commentators have agreed that Montana and other similarly situated Western States have pursued a policy of “OPEC-like revenue maximization,” and that the Montana tax accordingly bears no reasonable relationship to the services and protection afforded by the State.  R. Nehring & B. Zycher with J. Wharton, Coal Development and Government Regulation in the Northern Great Plains: A Preliminary Report 148 (1976); Church, at 272.  See Krutilla, at 185.  These findings, of course, are not dispositive of the issue whether the Montana severance tax is “fairly related” to the services *644 provided by the State within the meaning of our prior cases. They do suggest, however, that appellants’ claim is a substantial one.  The failure of the Court to acknowledge this stems, it seems to me, from a misreading of our prior cases. It is to those cases that I now turn.  h — t hH This Court’s Commerce Clause cases have been marked by-tension between two competing concepts: the view that interstate commerce should enjoy a “free trade” immunity from state taxation, see, e. g., Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249, 252 (1946), and the view that interstate commerce may be required to “ 'pay its way,’ ” see, e. g., Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938).  See generally Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 278-281, 288-289, n. 15</citedDecision> ; Simet & Lynn, Interstate Commerce Must Pay Its Way: The Demise of Spector, 31 Nat. Tax J. 53 (1978); Hellerstein, Foreword, State Taxation Under the Commerce Clause: An Historical Perspective, 29 Yand.  L. Rev. 335, 335-339 (1976).  In Complete Auto Transit, the Court resolved that tension by unanimously reaffirming that interstate commerce is not immune from state taxation.  <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 288</citedDecision> .  But at the same time the Court made clear that not all state taxation of interstate commerce is valid; a state tax will be sustained against Commerce Clause challenge only if “the tax is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to the services provided by the State.” <citedDecision>Id., at 279</citedDecision> .  See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725, 754 (1981).  The Court today acknowledges and, indeed, holds that a Commerce Clause challenge to a state severance tax must be evaluated under Complete Auto Transit’s four-part test.  Ante, at 617.  I fully agree.  I cannot agree, however, with the Court’s application of that test to the facts of the present case. Appellants concede, and the Court properly concludes, *645 that the first two prongs of the test — substantial nexus and fair apportionment — are satisfied here.  The Court also correctly observes that Montana’s severance tax is facially neutral.

 Ante, at 626.  This interpretation emasculates the fourth prong.  No trial will ever be necessary on the issue of fair relationship so long as a State is careful to impose a proportional rather than a flat tax rate; thus, the Court’s rule is no less “mechanical” than the approach entertained in Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., 260 U. S. 245 (1922), disapproved today, ante, at 617.  10 Under the Court’s reasoning, any ad valorem tax will satisfy the fourth prong; indeed, the Court implicitly ratifies Montana’s contention that it is free to tax this coal at 100% or even 1,000% of value, should it *646 choose to do so. Tr. of Oral Arg. 21.  Likewise, the Court’s analysis indicates that Montana’s severance tax would not run afoul of the Commerce Clause even if it raised sufficient revenue to allow Montana to eliminate all other taxes upon its citizens.  11 The Court’s prior cases neither require nor support such a startling result.  12 The Court often has noted that “‘[i]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business.’ ” Complete Auto Transit, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 279</citedDecision> (emphasis added), quoting Western Live Stock, 303 U. S., at 254 .  See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 754 .  Accordingly, *647 interstate commerce cannot claim any exemption from a state tax that “is fairly related to the services provided by the State.” Complete Auto Transit, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 279</citedDecision> .  We have not interpreted this requirement of “fair relation” in a narrow sense; interstate commerce may be required to share equally with intrastate commerce the cost of providing “police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and ‘the advantages of a civilized society.’ ” Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980), quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 445 (1979).  See, e. g., Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S. 416, 433 (1946).  Moreover, interstate commerce can be required to “pay its own way” in a narrower sense as well: the State may tax interstate commerce for the purpose of recovering those costs attributable to the activity itself.  See, e. g., Postal Telegraph-Cable Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252 (1919).  13 *648 The Court has never suggested, however, that interstate commerce may be required to pay more than its own way.  The Court today fails to recognize that the Commerce Clause does impose limits upon the State’s power to impose even facially neutral and properly apportioned taxes.  See ante, at 622-623.  In Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157, 163 (1954), Texas argued that no inquiry into the constitutionality of a facially neutral tax on the “taking” of gas was necessary because the State “has afforded great benefits and protection to pipeline companies.” The Calvert Court rejected this argument, holding that “these benefits are relevant here only to show that the essential requirements of due process have been met sufficiently to justify the imposition of any tax on the interstate activity.” Id., at 163-164 .  The Court held, id., at 164 , that when a tax is challenged on Commerce Clause grounds its validity “ ‘depends upon other considerations of constitutional policy having reference to the substantial effects, actual or potential, of the particular tax in suppressing or burdening unduly the commerce,’ ” quoting Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S., at 424 .  Accordingly, while *649 the Commerce Clause does not require that interstate commerce be placed in a privileged position, it does require that it not be unduly burdened.  In framing its taxing measures to reach interstate commerce, the State must be “at pains to do so in a manner which avoids the evils forbidden by the commerce clause and puts that commerce actually on a plane of equality with local trade in local taxation.” Nippert, 327 U. S., at 434 (emphasis added).  Thus, the Court has been particularly vigilant to review taxes that “single out interstate business,” since “[a]ny tailored tax of this sort creates an increased danger of error in apportionment, of discrimination against interstate commerce, and of a lack of relationship to the services provided by the State.” Complete Auto Transit, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 288-289, n. 15</citedDecision> .  14 Moreover, the Court’s vigilance has not been limited to taxes that discriminate upon their face: “Not the tax in a vacuum of words, but its practical consequences for the doing of interstate commerce in applications to concrete facts are our concern.” Nippert, 327 U. S., at 431 .  See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 756 .  This is particularly true when the challenged tax, while facially neutral, falls so heavily upon interstate commerce that its burden “is not likely to be alleviated by those political restraints which are normally exerted on legislation where it affects adversely interests within the state.” McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., 309 U. S. 33 , 46, n. 2 (1940).  Cf. Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice, 434 U. S. 429, 446-447 (1978).  In sum, then, when a tax has been “tailored” to reach interstate com *650 merce, the Court’s cases suggest that we require a closer “fit” under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test than when interstate commerce has not been singled out by the challenged tax. As a number of commentators have noted, state severance taxes upon minerals are particularly susceptible to “tailoring.” “Like a tollgate lying athwart a trade route, a severance or processing tax conditions access to natural resources.” Developments in the Law: Federal Limitations on State Taxation of Interstate Business, 75 Harv. L. Rev. 953 , 970 (1962).  Thus, to the extent that the taxing jurisdiction approaches a monopoly position in the mineral, and consumption is largely outside the State, such taxes are “[economically and politically analogous to transportation taxes exploiting geographical position.” Brown, The Open Economy: Justice Frankfurter and the Position of the Judiciary, 67 Yale L. J. 219, 232 (1957) (Brown).

 In fact, however, the matter is not nearly so clear as the Court suggests.  The Montana court also implied that the tax was designed at least in part to compensate the State for the special costs attributable to coal mining,-Mont., at-, -, 615 P. 2d, at 850, 855 , as have appellees here.  Brief for Appellees 1-3, 26-27.  Indeed, the stated objectives of the 1975 amendment were to: “(a) preserve or modestly increase revenues going to the general fund, (b) to respond to current social impacts attributable to coal development, and (c) to invest in the future, when new energy technologies reduce our dependence on coal and mining activity may decline.” Statement to Accompany the Report of the Free Joint Conference Committees on Coal Taxation 1 (1975).  Since the tax was designed only to “preserve or modestly increase” general revenues, it is appropriate for a court to inquire here whether the “surplus” revenue Montana has received from this severance tax is “manifestly disproportionate” to the present or future costs attributable to coal development.  Complete Auto Transit gave several examples of “tailored” taxes: property taxes designed to differentiate between property used in transportation and other types of property; an income tax using different rates for different types of business; and a tax on the “privilege of doing business in corporate form” that changed with the nature of the corporate activity involved.  <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 288, n. 15</citedDecision> .  A severance tax using different rates for different minerals is, of course, directly analogous to these examples.  See also Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734, 754-755 (1978); id., at 764 (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in result).  The degree to which a tax may be “exported” turns on such factors as the taxing jurisdiction’s relative dominance of the market, the elasticity of demand for the product, and the availability of adequate substitutes.  See, e. g., McLure, Economic Constraints on State and Local Taxation of Energy Resources, 31 Nat. Tax J. 257, 257-259 (1978); Posner, at 510-512.  Commentators are in disagreement over the likelihood that coal severance taxes are in fact exported.  Compare, e. g., McLure, at 259, and Gillis & Peprah, Severance Taxes on Coal and Uranium in the Sunbelt, Tex. Bus. Rev. 302, 308 (1980), with Church, at 277, and Griffin, at 33.
