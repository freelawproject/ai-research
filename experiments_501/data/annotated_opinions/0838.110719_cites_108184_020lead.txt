 No warrant was obtained.  Ross was charged with possession of heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U. S. C. § 841 (a).  Prior to trial, he moved to suppress the heroin found in the paper bag and the currency found in the leather pouch.  After an eviden-tiary hearing, the District Court denied the motion to suppress.  The heroin and currency were introduced in evidence at trial and Ross was convicted.  A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.  It held that the police had probable cause to stop and search Ross’ car and that, under Carroll v. United States, supra, and Chambers v. Maroney, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 42</citedDecision> , the officers lawfully could search the automobile — including its trunk — without a warrant.  The court considered separately, however, the warrantless search of the two containers found in the trunk.  On the basis of Arkansas v. Sanders, *802 442 U. S. 753 , the court concluded that the constitutionality of a warrantless search of a container found in an automobile depends on whether the owner possesses a reasonable expectation of privacy in its contents.  Applying that test, the court held that the warrantless search of the paper bag was valid but the search of the leather pouch was not.  The court remanded for a new trial at which the items taken from the paper bag, but not those from the leather pouch, could be admitted.  2 The entire Court of Appeals then voted to rehear the case en banc.  A majority of the court rejected the panel’s conclusion that a distinction of constitutional significance existed between the two containers found in respondent’s trunk; it held that the police should not have opened either container without first obtaining a warrant.

 IV In Carroll itself, the whiskey that the prohibition agents seized was not in plain view.  It was discovered only after an officer opened the rumble seat and tore open the upholstery of the lazyback.  The Court did not find the scope of the search unreasonable.  Having stopped Carroll and Kiro on a public road and subjected them to the indignity of a ve- *818 hide search — which the Court found to be a reasonable intrusion on their privacy because it was based on probable cause that their vehicle was transporting contraband — prohibition agents were entitled to tear open a portion of the roadster itself.  The scope of the search was no greater than a magistrate could have authorized by issuing a warrant based on the probable cause that justified the search.  Since such a warrant could have authorized the agents to open the rear portion of the roadster and to rip the upholstery in their search for concealed whiskey, the search was constitutionally permissible.  In <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maroney</citedDecision> the police found weapons and stolen property “concealed in a compartment under the dashboard.” <citedDecision>399 U. S., at 44</citedDecision> .  No suggestion was made that the scope of the search was impermissible.  It would be illogical to assume that the outcome of <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> — or the outcome of Carroll itself — would have been different if the police had found the secreted contraband enclosed within a secondary container and had opened that container without a warrant.  If it was reasonable for prohibition agents to rip open the upholstery in Carroll , it certainly would have been reasonable for them to look into a burlap sack stashed inside; if it was reasonable to open the concealed compartment in <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> , it would have been equally reasonable to open a paper bag crumpled within it.  A contrary rule could produce absurd results inconsistent with the decision in Carroll itself.  In its application of Carroll , this Court in fact has sustained warrantless searches of containers found during a lawful search of an automobile.  In Husty v. United States, 282 U. S. 694 , the Court upheld a warrantless seizure of whiskey found during a search of an automobile, some of which was discovered in “whiskey bags” that could have contained other goods.  23 In Scher v. United States, 305 U. S. 251 , federal of- *819 fleers seized and searched packages of unstamped liquor found in the trunk of an automobile searched without a warrant.  As described by a police officer who participated in the search: “I turned the handle and opened the trunk and found the trunk completely filled with packages wrapped in brown paper, and tied with twine; I think somewhere around thirty packages, each one containing six bottles.” 24 In these cases it was not contended that police officers needed a warrant to open the whiskey bags or to unwrap the brown paper packages.  These decisions nevertheless “have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench.” Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (Marshall, C. J.).

 The same legislation required a warrant for searches of dwelling places.  267 U. S., at 150-151 .  In particular, the Court noted an 1815 statute that permitted customs officers not only to board and search vessels without a warrant “but also to stop, search and examine any vehicle, beast or person on which or whom they should suspect there was merchandise which was subject to duty or had been introduced into the United States in any manner contrary to law.” Id., at 151 .  In light of this established history, individuals always had been on notice that movable vessels may be stopped and searched on facts giving rise to probable cause that the vehicle contains contraband, without the protection afforded by a magistrate’s prior evaluation of those facts.  Subsequent cases make clear that the decision in Carroll was not based on the fact that the only course available to the police was an immediate search.  As Justice Harlan later recognized, although a failure to seize a moving automobile believed to contain contraband might deprive officers of the illicit goods, once a vehicle itself has been stopped the exigency does not necessarily justify a warrantless search.  Chambers v. Maroney, <citedDecision>399 U. S. 42, 62-64</citedDecision> (opinion of Harlan, J.).  The Court in <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> , however — with only Justice Harlan dissenting — refused to adopt a rule that would permit a warrantless seizure but prohibit a warrantless search.  The Court held that if police officers have probable cause to justify a war-rantless seizure of an automobile on a public roadway, they may conduct an immediate search of the contents of that vehicle.  “For constitutional purposes, we see no difference between on the one hand seizing and holding a car before presenting the probable cause issue to a magistrate and on the other hand carrying out an immediate search without a warrant.  Given probable cause to search, either course is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.” <citedDecision>Id., at 52</citedDecision> .  The Court also has held that if an immediate search on the street is permissible without a warrant, a search soon thereafter at the police station is permissible if the vehicle is impounded.  <citedDecision>Chambers, supra;</citedDecision> Texas v. White, 423 U. S. 67 .  These decisions are based on the practicalities of the situations presented and a realistic appraisal of the relatively minor protection that a contrary rule would provide for privacy interests.  Given the scope of the initial intrusion caused by a seizure of an automobile — which often could leave the occupants stranded on the highway — the Court rejected an inflexible rule that would force police officers in every case either to post guard at the vehicle while a warrant is obtained or to tow the vehicle itself to the station.  Similarly, if an immediate search on the scene could be conducted, but not one at the station if the vehicle is impounded, police often simply would search the vehicle on the street — at no advantage to the occupants, yet possibly at certain cost to the police.  The rules as applied in particular cases may appear unsatisfactory.  They reflect, however, a reasoned application of the more general rule that if an individual gives the police probable cause to believe a vehicle is transporting contraband, he loses the right to proceed on his way without official interference.  After reviewing the relevant authorities at some length, the Court concluded that the probable-cause requirement was satisfied in the case before it.  The Court held that “the facts and circumstances within [the officers’] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information were sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief *809 that intoxicating liquor was being transported in the automobile which they stopped and searched.” 267 U. S., at 162 .  Cf. Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 176-177 ; Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98, 102 .  See Husty v. United States, 282 U. S. 694 ; Scher v. United States, 305 U. S. 251 ; Brinegar v. United States, supra; Henry v. United States, supra; Dyke v. Taylor Implement Mfg. Co., 391 U. S. 216 ; <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Maroney, supra;</citedDecision> Texas v. White, supra; Colorado v. Bannister, 449 U. S. 1 .  Warrantless searches of automobiles have been upheld in a variety of factual contexts quite different from that presented in Carroll .  Cf. Cooper v. California, 386 U. S. 58 ; Cady v. Dombrowski, 413 U. S. 433 ; South Dakota v. Opperman, 428 U. S. 364 .  Many of these searches do not require a showing of probable cause that the vehicle contains contraband.  We are not called upon to — and do not — consider in this case the scope of the war-rantless search that is permitted in those cases. As the Court in Carroll concluded: “We here find the line of distinction between legal and illegal seizures of liquor in transport in vehicles.  It is certainly a reasonable distinction.  It gives the owner of an automobile or other vehicle seized under Section 26, in absence of probable cause, a right to have restored to him the automobile, it protects him under the Weeks [Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 ] and Amos [Amos v. United States, 255 U. S. 313 ] cases from use of the liquor as evidence against him, and it subjects the officer making the seizures to damages.

 In describing the permissible scope of a search of a home pursuant to a warrant, Professor LaFave notes: “Places within the described premises are not excluded merely because some additional act of entry or opening may be required.  ‘In countless cases in which warrants described only the land and the buildings, a search of desks, cabinets, closets and similar items has been permitted.”’ 2 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 152 (1978) (quoting Massey v. Commonwealth, 305 S. W. 2d 755, 756 (Ky. 1957)).  The practical considerations that justify a warrantless search of an automobile continue to apply until the entire search of the automobile and its contents has been completed.  Arguably, the entire vehicle itself (including its upholstery) could be searched without a warrant, with all wrapped articles and containers found during that search then taken to a magistrate.  But prohibiting police from opening immediately a container in which the object of the search is most likely to be found and instead forcing them first to comb the entire vehicle would actually exacerbate the intrusion on privacy interests.  Moreover, until the container itself was opened the police could never be certain that the contraband was not secreted in a yet undiscovered portion of the vehicle; thus in every case in which a container was found, the vehicle would need to be secured while a warrant was obtained.  Such a requirement would be directly inconsistent with the rationale supporting the decisions in Carroll and <citedDecision>Chambers</citedDecision> .  Cf. nn. 19 and 22, supra. Cf. 453 U. S., at 426-427 (plurality opinion); id., at 436 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); id., at 443 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); id., at 447 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  If the distinction is based on the proposition that the Fourth Amendment protects only those containers that objectively manifest an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy, however, the propriety of a war-rantless search necessarily would turn on much more than the fabric of the container.  A paper bag stapled shut and marked “private” might be found to manifest a reasonable expectation of privacy, as could a cardboard box stacked on top of two pieces of heavy luggage.  The propriety of the war-rantless search seemingly would turn on an objective appraisal of all the surrounding circumstances.
