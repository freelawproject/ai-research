 Passell, supra, n. 8.  See also Bailey, Murder and Capital Punishment: Some Further Evidence, 45 Am. J. Orthopsychiatry 669 (1975); W. Bowers, Executions in America 121-163 (1974).  In Furman , I considered several additional purposes arguably served by the death penalty.  408 U. S., at 314, 342, 355-358 .  The only additional purpose mentioned in the opinions in, these cases is specific deterrence — preventing the murderer from com *237 mitting another crime.  Surely life imprisonment and, if necessary, solitary confinement would fully accomplish- this purpose.  Accord, Commonwealth v. O’Neal, — Mass. —, —, 339 N. E. 2d 676, 685 (1975); People v.

Mr. Justice White’s view of retribution as a justification for the death penalty is not altogether clear.  “The widespread reenactment of the death penalty,” he states at one point, “answers any claims that life imprisonment is adequate punishment to satisfy the need for reprobation or retribution.” Roberts v. Louisiana, post, at 354.  (White, J„ dissenting).  But Mr. Justice White later states: “It will not do to denigrate these legislative judgments as some form of vestigial savagery or as purely retributive in motivation; for they are solemn judgments, reasonably based, that imposition of the death penalty will save the fives of innocent persons."
