      <p class="indent">This is an appeal by the plaintiffs from an order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Charles M. Metzner, Judge, dismissing their complaint.  <span class="citation no-link">394 F.Supp. 853</span> (S.D.N.Y.1975).  The plaintiffs are female employees of the New York City Department of Social Services ("Department") and of the New York City Board of Education ("Board") suing on behalf of themselves and other female employees in city agencies similarly situated.  The essence of the complaint is that rules and regulations of the city agencies formerly compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before medical reasons required them to do so, and that such rules and regulations were unconstitutional.</p>

      <p class="indent">The defendants Sugarman, former Commissioner of the Department of Social Services, Scribner, former Chancellor of the City School District of the City of New York, and Lindsay, former Mayor, are sued in their official capacities (Amended Complaint P 24).  Jurisdiction is alleged under the Civil Rights Act, <span class="citation no-link">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983</span>, and its jurisdictional counterpart, <span class="citation no-link">28 U.S.C. &#167; 1343</span>(3), as well as under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e et seq.

No amount of damages was alleged.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a>  The defendants moved to dismiss the action, or, in the alternative, for an order granting summary judgment.  They also moved to vacate the order granting class action status, or, in the alternative, to compel the plaintiffs to pay for the class action notice if the action were allowed to continue as a class action.  The plaintiffs cross-moved for summary judgment.  Judge Metzner dismissed the complaint.  <span class="citation no-link">394 F.Supp. 853</span> (S.D.N.Y.1975).</p>

      <p class="indent">With respect to the requests for injunctive and declaratory relief, he noted that in the fall of 1971, the Department had changed its maternity leave policy to provide that no woman need report her pregnancy or take maternity leave as long as she is able to continue to perform her job and desires to do so.  The policy change became effective on January 29, 1972.  The Board of Education similarly changed its bylaws effective September 1, 1973.  The judge therefore dismissed as moot the claims for equitable relief by way of injunction or declaratory judgment.  We agree that these claims are moot and accordingly affirm.  See Nieves v. Oswald, <span class="citation" data-id="319996"><a href="/opinion/319996/george-nieves-v-russell-g-oswald-commissioner-of-correctional-services/">498 F.2d 802</a></span>, 813-15 (2 Cir. 1974); cf.

      <p class="indent">The District Judge also dismissed the claims for back pay covering the periods for which plaintiffs allege they could have worked after they were forced to take maternity leave on the ground that there was no subject matter jurisdiction for the award of back pay either under Title VII or under &#167; 1983.  Judge Metzner determined that the 1972 amendment to Title VII, Pub.L.No.92-261, &#167; 2(1) (amending Title VII &#167; 701(a), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e(a)), which broadened the definition of "person" under the Act so as to include "governments, governmental agencies (and) political subdivisions," could not be applied retroactively.  He therefore dismissed the claim for relief pursuant to Title VII, since all the acts of discrimination claimed to have been committed against the named plaintiffs occurred before the 1972 amendment to Title VII.  The court also concluded that any attempt to use &#167; 1983 as a basis of obtaining monetary relief against the named city officials in their official capacities would circumvent the decision of the Supreme Court in Monroe v. Pape, <span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/">365 U.S. 167</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/">81 S.Ct. 473</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="106170"><a href="/opinion/106170/monroe-v-pape/">5 L.Ed.2d 492</a></span> (1961), which held that municipalities cannot be sued for damages under &#167; 1983, and accordingly dismissed the claim for relief brought under that section.</p>

      <p class="indent">Appellants contend that the court erred in dismissing the action for lack of jurisdiction under the Civil Rights Act (&#167; 1983) and in failing to give retroactive effect to the amendment of Title VII in 1972.</p>

      <p class="indent">* Appellants are correct in their contention that, under the Title VII amendment of 1972, municipalities and their subdivisions are employers within the meaning of the Act.  They also correctly state that one of the remedies provided for violation of the Act is the award of back pay.  Title VII, &#167; 706(g), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(g).  Back pay is specifically made "payable by the employer, employment agency, or labor organization, as the case may be, responsible for the unlawful employment practice."  Id. (emphasis added).  There is no statutory warrant for such an award against a public official, however.  Accordingly, so far as the Title VII claim is concerned, employees discriminated against may henceforth obtain an award of back pay against the city itself (but not against individual officials).</p>

      <span class="num">8</span>
      <p class="indent">We must conclude, however, that the 1972 amendment to Title VII does not apply retroactively so as to permit an award of back pay against the city in this case.  The same law, Pub.L.No.92-261, section 2(1) of which amended the definition of "person" to include "governments, governmental agencies (and) political subdivisions," also struck out in section 3 the exemption for the employment of individuals engaged in educational activities of nonreligious educational institutions.  In Weise v. Syracuse University, <span class="citation" data-id="329995"><a href="/opinion/329995/10-fair-emplpraccas-1331-10-empl-prac-dec-p-10294-selene-weise-v/">522 F.2d 397</a></span>, 410-11 (2 Cir. 1975), we met the question whether Title VII was applicable to discrimination occurring before the lifting of the exemption for educational institutions.  We held that it was not retroactive, for it was "a statute creating new rights where none had previously existed."  Judge Smith went on to note that "(t)he manifest injustice of such ex post facto imposition of civil liability is reflected in the general rule of construction that absent clear legislative intent statutes altering substantive rights are not to be applied retroactively.

But this was merely a procedural section relating to federal employees which gave them a limited right to judicial review of Title VII claims before administrative remedies were exhausted.  Similar administrative remedies had previously been available to enforce rights provided by Title VII.  In the case of city employees, on the other hand, entirely new substantive rights were created by the amendment to Title VII.  We are constrained to hold, as a consequence, that back pay may not be awarded against the city or the Board of Education under Title VII for discrimination that occurred before the 1972 amendment.  The argument that, as in Brown, there was already a substantive right not to be forced to take a maternity leave arbitrarily is not well-taken.  To support their position, appellants cite Green v. Waterford Board of Education, <span class="citation" data-id="308263"><a href="/opinion/308263/5-fair-emplpraccas-443-5-empl-prac-dec-p-8446-priscilla-b-green-v/">473 F.2d 629</a></span> (2 Cir. 1973), and Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, <span class="citation" data-id="108913"><a href="/opinion/108913/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-lafleur/">supra.</a></span>  But these cases were not decided until 1973 and 1974, respectively.  In any event, no remedy existed prior to 1972 by which appellants could secure monetary relief to compensate them for the alleged discrimination.<a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">2</a></p>

In point of fact, moreover, in every case individual defendants were named in addition to the Board of Education.  In Cleveland Board of Education v.

Board of Education, the principal of the school who recommended the discharge of Lombard was a named defendant.  And in Green v.

The fiction that permits equity relief under Ex parte Young loses its validity, as we have seen in the Eleventh Amendment cases, when the public body which is not amenable to suit is requested to pay the judgment.  Just as the Congress which enacted the Eleventh Amendment in order to overrule Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S.  (2 Dall.) 419, <span class="citation" data-id="84681"><a href="/opinion/84681/chisholm-v-georgia/">1 L.Ed. 440</a></span> (1793), meant to protect the treasuries of the states, so the Reconstruction Congress which enacted the Civil Rights Act sought to protect municipal treasuries.  The mere substitution of the name of the official for the name of the city in the complaint cannot be used as a subterfuge to circumvent the intent of Congress.  Thus, we must consider the suit at hand to have been brought directly against the City and the Board of Education, which, as we have seen, are not "persons" for purposes of &#167; 1983.

        <p>To the extent that the court in Conway v. Alfred I. DuPont School District, supra, and in the later case of Boyce v. Alexis I. duPont School District, <span class="citation no-link">341 F.Supp. 672</span>, 674-75 (D.Del.1972), indicated that damages could be recovered against individual defendants in their official capacities if it were established that the officials acted in bad faith, we believe that it erred and that it misinterpreted Judge Stapleton's opinion in the Mathias case.  A finding of bad faith could result in a judgment against the officials in their individual capacities, but not in their official capacities.</p>

        <p> Appellants further rely on the case of Sugarman v. Dougall, <span class="citation" data-id="108859"><a href="/opinion/108859/sugarman-v-dougall/">413 U.S. 634</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="108859"><a href="/opinion/108859/sugarman-v-dougall/">93 S.Ct. 2842</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="108859"><a href="/opinion/108859/sugarman-v-dougall/">37 L.Ed.2d 853</a></span> (1973).  They argue that the plaintiffs in Sugarman sued under &#167; 1983 for both injunctive relief and lost wages, and that neither the three-judge district court, Dougall v. Sugarman, <span class="citation no-link">339 F.Supp. 906</span> (S.D.N.Y.1971), nor the Supreme Court questioned the propriety under &#167; 1983 of the claim for damages.  While it is true that the amended complaint in Sugarman prayed that the court "(g)rant each plaintiff damages of $10,000 as represented by lost earnings," this claim was apparently not pressed at trial.  The District Court granted only injunctive and declaratory relief, and the Supreme Court was thus not faced with the issue of whether monetary relief against the named officials was permissible under &#167; 1983</p>
        <p>Another case relied on by plaintiffs is Calo v. Paine, <span class="citation" data-id="329555"><a href="/opinion/329555/francis-x-calo-v-r-morris-paine/">521 F.2d 411</a></span>, 413 (2 Cir. 1975).  In Calo we held that an action under &#167; 1983 could be brought against municipal officials who, as appears from the caption of the case in the district court, were sued both in their individual and their official capacities.  Furthermore, as we noted, <span class="citation" data-id="329555"><a href="/opinion/329555/francis-x-calo-v-r-morris-paine/">521 F.2d at 412</a></span>, the complaint asked both for equitable relief and for back pay and compensatory and punitive damages.  We do not, however, interpret Calo as holding that city officials are considered "persons" for &#167; 1983 purposes even when they are being sued in their official capacities for damages, as we merely vacated Judge Blumenfeld's grant of summary judgment for the defendant and remanded the case for further proceedings.  Since Judge Blumenfeld had not awarded any damages, we were not required to consider whether a federal court has jurisdiction, in a proper case, to award such damages against city officials sued in their official capacities.</p>
        <p>Similarly distinguishable is the case of Sterzing v. Fort Bend Independent School District, <span class="citation" data-id="318964"><a href="/opinion/318964/henry-keith-sterzing-v-fort-bend-independent-school-district-fort-bend/">496 F.2d 92</a></span> (5 Cir. 1974).  The Sterzing court dealt on appeal only with the claim of the plaintiff that he was entitled to the equitable remedy of reinstatement.  In remanding, the court stated that it expressed no view on what the remedy should be.</p>
        <p>The other cases cited by plaintiffs in their brief are plainly distinguishable.  In most of these cases either the defendants were sued in their individual, not their official, capacities, e. g., Ingraham v. Wright, <span class="citation" data-id="319903"><a href="/opinion/319903/eloise-ingraham-as-next-friend-etc-v-willie-j-wright-i-individually/">498 F.2d 248</a></span>, 251-52 (5 Cir. 1974), or only injunctive relief was requested, e. g., Rochester v. White, <span class="citation" data-id="321725"><a href="/opinion/321725/aldine-rochester-individually-and-on-behalf-of-her-minor-child-rose/">503 F.2d 263</a></span>, 266-67 (3 Cir. 1974).</p>

        <p> See Thonen v. Jenkins, <span class="citation" data-id="327978"><a href="/opinion/327978/robert-r-thonen-and-william-schell-jr-v-leo-w-jenkins-president-of/">517 F.2d 3</a></span>, 7-8 (4 Cir. 1975), which noted that attorneys' fees are like costs of the action.  Our analogous holding in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, <span class="citation" data-id="328830"><a href="/opinion/328830/10-fair-emplpraccas-956-10-empl-prac-dec-p-10270-garland-m/">supra,</a></span> <span class="citation" data-id="328830"><a href="/opinion/328830/10-fair-emplpraccas-956-10-empl-prac-dec-p-10270-garland-m/">519 F.2d at 571-72</a></span>, may be reviewed by the Supreme Court, since a writ of certiorari has been granted.  --- U.S. ----, <span class="citation no-link">96 S.Ct. 561</span>, <span class="citation no-link">46 L.Ed.2d 404</span> (1975) (No. 75-251)</p>
        <p>We note, in passing, that in Alyeska Pipeline Service, Inc. v. Wilderness Society, <span class="citation" data-id="109246"><a href="/opinion/109246/alyeska-pipeline-service-co-v-wilderness-society/">421 U.S. 240</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="109246"><a href="/opinion/109246/alyeska-pipeline-service-co-v-wilderness-society/">95 S.Ct. 1612</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="109246"><a href="/opinion/109246/alyeska-pipeline-service-co-v-wilderness-society/">44 L.Ed.2d 141</a></span> (1975), the Supreme Court rejected the "private attorney general" rationale used to justify the award of attorneys' fees in Fair.</p>
