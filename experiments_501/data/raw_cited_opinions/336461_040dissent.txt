<p id="AT4">I dissent solely on the ground that, as Judge Kilkenny demonstrates in parts I and II of his dissenting opinion, the case of <em>United States v. Arnold, Schwinn &amp; Co., </em>1967, <span class="citation" data-id="107491"><a href="/opinion/107491/united-states-v-arnold-schwinn-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v.

I agree with Judge Browning when he says that “[t]his should end the matter for an intermediate appellate court.” I express no views as to the conflicting policy arguments that appear in the respective opinions of Judges Browning, Ely and Kilkenny. I cannot, however, refrain from making one small observation. I am puzzled by the notion that because the courts are not very well equipped to decide between conflicting notions of economic policy, they should pick one side of such an argument and erect it into a rule of per se illegality.</p>
