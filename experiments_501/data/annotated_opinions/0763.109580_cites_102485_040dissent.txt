 No other rule can be applied on just principles.  Every proprietor whose land is thus bounded is subject to loss, by the same means which may add to his territory: and as he is without remedy for his loss, in this way, he cannot be held accountable for his gain.” Ibid, (emphasis added).  This statement of the law was quoted by the Court in County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 68 (1874).  *387 The Court in County of St. Clair went on to note: “The riparian right to future alluvion is a vested right.  It is an inherent and essential attribute of the original property.” Ibid, (emphasis added).  Similarly, in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1 (1894), 6 the Court said: “The rule, everywhere admitted, that where the land encroaches upon the water by gradual and imperceptible degrees, the accretion or alluvion belongs to the owner of the land, is equally applicable to lands bounding on tide waters or on fresh waters, and to the King or the State as to private persons; and is independent of the law governing the title in the soil covered by the water.” Id., at 35 (emphasis added).  Thus, the right to such additions 7 was part of the title which passed with the federal grant, cf. 3 American Law of Property § 15.27, p. 859 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952), and was protected by federal law. By holding that state law now governs the impact of changes in the course of the bordering water on a federal riparian grant, the Court denies that “a question which concerns the validity and effect of an act done by the United States” is “necessarily a federal question.” Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, <citedDecision>296 U. S. 10, 22</citedDecision> (1935).  As far as federal law is concerned, a federal riparian grant *388 is now understood to have incorporated a fixed rather than ambulatory boundary.  Ante, at 376.  The rule of New Orleans v. United States, supra, and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, supra, is discarded along with Bonelli and Hughes .  The cases the Court concludes compel this dramatic shift do not even support it.  Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498 (1839), 8 was an action of ejectment brought against the commander of a United States military post to recover part of the post.  The plaintiff claimed under a state registration certificate.

 In its eagerness to do away with Bonelli’s result as well as its approach, however, today’s opinion explicitly concludes that had Bonelli relied on the theory advocated by the petitioner there and the Solicitor General, it would now be rejected.  Ante, at 371-372, 378-381.  Nevertheless, the majority suggests that Hughes might still control oceanfront property.  Ante, at 377 n. 6.  It is difficult to take seriously the suggestion that the national interest in international relations justifies applying'a different rule to oceanfront land grants than to other grants by the Federal Government.  It is clear that the States have complete title to the lands below the line of mean high tide.  See Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, <citedDecision>296 U. S. 10</citedDecision> (1935); 43 U. S. C. §§ 1301 (a) (2), 1311.  These lands, of course, are the only place where the waters “ ‘lap both the lands of the State and the boundaries of the international sea.’” Ante, at 377 n. 6, quoting Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S., at 293 .  There are no international relations implications in the ownership of land above the line of mean high tide.  See Note, The Federal Rule of Accretion and California Coastal Protection, 48 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1457 , 1472 (1975).  The cross-petitions for certiorari did not raise the question whether federal law governed the outcome; they were concerned only with whether the Oregon courts properly interpreted the governing federal common law. The State’s petition for certiorari in No. 76-567 stated the question presented as: “In a typical situation of a navigable river flowing through two channels, where the smaller of the two channels after 20 years of erosive flooding 'suddenly’ becomes the main channel, and the other channel eventually becomes unusable, does federal law deprive the public of title to the beds of both channels?” In No. 75-577, Corvallis Sand & Gravel Co. raised two questions in its petition for certiorari: “1.  Does plaintiff, State of Oregon, have sufficient ownership to maintain statutory ejectment to recover possession of the bed of a navigable fresh water stream where its claim of ownership is based on sovereignty rather than grant and where there is no allegation pleaded and no proof that the public rights of navigation, fishery and related uses are being impaired or interfered with by defendant Corvallis Sand and Gravel Company?  “2.
