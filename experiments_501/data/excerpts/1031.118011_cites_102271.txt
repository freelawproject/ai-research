 We adhere in this case, however, not to mere obiter dicta, but rather to the well-established rationale upon which the *67 Court based the results of its earlier decisions.  When an opinion issues for the Court, it is not only the result but also those portions of the opinion necessary to that result by which we are bound.  Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 613 (1990) (exclusive basis of a judgment is not dicta) (plurality); County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 668 (1989) (“As a general rule, the principle of stare decisis directs us to adhere not only to the holdings of our prior cases, but also to their explications of the governing rules of law”) (Kennedy, J., concurring and dissenting); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 490 (1986) (“Although technically dicta,... an important part of the Court’s rationale for the result that it reache[s] ... is entitled to greater weight.  .  .”) (O’Connor, J., concurring).  For over a century, we have grounded our decisions in the oft-repeáted understanding of state sovereign immunity as an essential part of the Eleventh Amendment.  In Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 313</citedDecision> (1934), the Court held that the Eleventh Amendment barred a suit brought against a State by a foreign state.  Chief Justice Hughes wrote for a unanimous Court: “[NJeither the literal sweep of the words of Clause one of § 2 of Article III, nor the absence of restriction in the letter of the Eleventh Amendment, permits the conclusion that in all controversies of the sort described in Clause one, and omitted from the words of the Eleventh Amendment, a State may be sued without her consent.  Thus Clause one specifically provides that the judicial Power shall extend ‘to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.’ But, although a case may arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the judicial power does not extend to it if the suit is *68 sought to be prosecuted against a State, without her consent, by one of her own citizens.  .  .  .  “Manifestly, we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of §2 of Article III, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against non-consenting States.

 See, e. g., post, at 152, n. 47.  Its undocumented and highly speculative extralegal explanation of *69 the decision in Hans is a disservice to the Court’s traditional method of adjudication.  See post, at 120-123.  The dissent mischaracterizes the Hans opinion.  That decision found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental “ ‘jurisprudence in all civilized nations.’” Hans, 134 U. S., at 17 , quoting Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858); see also The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (sovereign immunity “is the general sense and the general practice of mankind”).  The dissent’s proposition that the common law of England, where adopted by the States, was open to change by the Legislature is wholly unexceptionable and largely beside the point: that common law provided the substantive rules of law rather than jurisdiction.  Cf. <citedDecision>Monaco, supra, at 323</citedDecision> (state sovereign immunity, like the requirement that there be a “justiciable” controversy, is a constitutionally grounded limit on federal jurisdiction).  It also is noteworthy that the principle of state sovereign immunity stands distinct from other principles of the common law in that only the former prompted a specific constitutional amendment.  Hans — with a much closer vantage point than the dissent — recognized that the decision in Chisholm was contrary to the well-understood meaning of the Constitution.  The dissent’s conclusion that the decision in Chisholm was “reasonable,” post, at 106, certainly would have struck the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment as quite odd: That decision created “such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted.” <citedDecision>Monaco, supra, at 325</citedDecision> .  The dissent’s lengthy analysis of the text of the Eleventh Amendment is directed at a straw man — we long have recognized that blind reliance upon the text of the Eleventh Amendment is “ ‘to strain the Constitution and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of.’ ” <citedDecision>Monaco, supra, at 326</citedDecision> , quoting Hans, supra, at 15 .  The text dealt in terms only with the problem presented by the decision in Chisholm ; in light of the fact that the federal courts did not *70 have federal-question jurisdiction at the time the Amendment was passed (and would not have it until 1875), it seems unlikely that much thought was given to the prospect of federal-question jurisdiction over the States.  That same consideration causes the dissent’s criticism of the views of Marshall, Madison, and Hamilton to ring hollow.  The dissent cites statements made by those three influential Framers, the most natural reading of which would preclude all federal jurisdiction over an unconsenting State.  12 Struggling against this reading, however, the dissent finds significant the absence of any contention that sovereign immunity would affect the new federal-question jurisdiction.  Post, at 142-150.  But the lack of any statute vesting general federal-question jurisdiction in the federal courts until much later makes the dissent’s demand for greater specificity about a then-dormant jurisdiction overly exacting.

 See supra, at 116-117.  The “rationale” which the majority seeks to invoke is, I think, more nearly stated in its quotation from Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 321-323 (1934).  There, the Court said that “we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of § 2 of Article III, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against non-consenting States.” Id., at 322.  19 This statement certainly is true to Hans , which *125 clearly recognized a pre-existing principle of sovereign immunity, broader than the Eleventh Amendment itself, that will ordinarily bar federal-question suits against a noncon-senting State.  That was the “rationale” which was sufficient to decide Hans and all of its progeny prior to Union Gas.  But leaving aside the indefensibility of that rationale, which I will address further below, that was as far as it went.  The majority, however, would read the “rationale” of Hans and its line of subsequent cases as answering the further question whether the “postulate” of sovereign immunity that “limit[s] and controls]” the exercise of Article III jurisdiction, <citedDecision>Monaco, supra, at 322</citedDecision> , is constitutional in stature and therefore unalterable by Congress.  It is true that there are statements in the cases that point toward just this conclusion.  See, e. g., Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 98 (1984) (“In short, the principle of sovereign immunity is a constitutional limitation on the federal judicial power established in Art. Ill”); Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 497 (1921) (“[T]he entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given .  .  .”).  These statements, however, are dicta in the classic sense, that is, sheer speculation about what would happen in cases not before the court. 20 But this *126 is not the only weakness of these statements, which are counterbalanced by many other opinions that have either stated the immunity principle without more, see, e. g., Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223, 229, n. 2 (1989) (noting that “an uncon-senting State is immune from liability for damages in a suit brought in federal court by one of its own citizens,” without suggesting that the immunity was unalterable by Congress), 21 or have suggested that the Hans immunity is not of constitutional stature.  The very language quoted by the majority from Monaco, for example, likens state sovereign immunity to other “essential postulates” such as the rules of justiciability.  <citedDecision>292 U. S., at 322</citedDecision> .  Many of those rules, as Justice Stevens points out, are prudential in nature and therefore not unalterable by Congress.  See ante, at 88-90.  22 More generally, the proponents of the Court’s theory have repeatedly referred to state sovereign immunity as a “background principle,” ante, at 72, “postulate,” Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 437 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), or “implicit limitation,” Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468, 496 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and as resting on the “inherent nature of sovereignty,” Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), rather than any explicit con *127 stitutional provision.  23 But whatever set of quotations one may prefer, taking heed of such jurisprudential creations in assessing the contents of federal common law is a very different thing from reading them into the Founding Document itself.  The most damning evidence for the Court’s theory that Hans rests on a broad rationale of immunity unalterable by Congress, however, is the Court’s proven tendency to disregard the post-Hans dicta in cases where that dicta would have mattered.  24 If it is indeed true that “private suits against States [are] not permitted under Article III (by virtue of the understanding represented by the Eleventh Amendment),” Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 40 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), then it is hard to see how a State’s sovereign immunity may be waived any more than it may be abrogated by Congress.

 The first of these notions rests on the ancient maxim that “the Eing can do no wrong.” See, e. g., 1W.  Blackstone, Commentaries *244.  Professor Jaffe has argued this expression “originally meant precisely the contrary to what it later came to mean,” that is, “ ‘it meant that the king must not, was not allowed, not entitled, to do wrong.’” Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 4 (quoting L. Ehrlich, Proceedings Against the Crown (1216-1377), p. 42, in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History (P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921), p. 42); see also 1 Blackstone, supra, at *246 (interpreting the maxim to mean that “the prerogative of the crown extends not to do any injury”).  In any event, it is clear that the idea of the sovereign, or any part of it, being above the law in this sense has not survived in American law. See, e. g., Langford v. United States, 101 U. S. 341, 342-343 (1880); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 415 (1979).  The text reads that “[t]he Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; — to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; — to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; — to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; — to Controversies between two or more States; — between a State and Citizens of another State; — between Citizens of different States, — between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.” The one statement I have found on the subject of States’ immunity in federal-question eases was an opinion that immunity would not be applicable in these cases: James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania ratification debate, stated that the federal-question clause would require States to make good on pre-Revolutionary debt owed to English merchants (the enforcement of which was promised in the Treaty of 1783) and thereby “show the world that we make the faith of treaties a constitutional part of the character of the United States; that we secure its performance no longer nominally, for the judges of the United States will be enabled to carry it into effect, let the legislatures of the different states do what they may.” 2 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 490 (2d ed. 1836) (Elliot’s Debates).  This lengthy discussion of the history of the Constitution’s ratification, the Court’s opinion in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793), and the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment is necessary to explain why, in my view, the contentions in some of our earlier opinions that Chisholm ere- *107 ated a great “shock of surprise” misread the history.  See Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 313</citedDecision> (1934).  The Court’s response to this historical analysis is simply to recite yet again Monaco’s erroneous assertion that Chisholm created “such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted,” <citedDecision>292 U. S., at 325</citedDecision> .  See ante, at 69.  This response is, with respect, no response at all. Monaco’s ipse dixit that Chisholm created a “shock of surprise” does not make it so. This Court’s opinions frequently make assertions of historical fact, but those assertions are not authoritative as to history in the same way that our interpretations of laws are authoritative as to them.  In Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U. S. 424, 434 (1902), which was, like Monaco, decided a century after the event it purported to recount, the Court baldly stated that “in September 1790, General Washington, on the advice of Mr. Adams, did refuse to permit British troops to march through the territory of the United States from Detroit to the Mississippi, apparently for the reason that the object of such movement was an attack on New Orleans and the Spanish possessions on the Mississippi.” Modern historians agree, however, that there was no such request, see J. Daly, The Use of History in the Decisions of the Supreme Court: 1900-1930, pp. 65-66 (1954); W. Manning, The Nootka Sound Controversy, in Annual Report of the American Historical Association, H. R. Doc. No. 429, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 415-423 (1905), and it would of course be absurd for this Court to treat the fact that Tucker asserted the existence of the request as proof that it actually occurred.  Cf. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 72-73 (1938) (“But it was the more recent research of a competent scholar, who examined the original document, which established that the construction given to [the Judiciary Act of 1789] by the Court was erroneous; and that the purpose of the section was merely to make certain that, in all matters except those in which some federal law is controlling, the federal courts exercising jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship cases would apply as their rules of decision the law of the State, unwritten as well as written”).  Moreover, in this case, there is ample evidence contradicting the “shock of surprise” thesis.  Contrary to Monaco’s suggestion, the Eleventh Amendment was not “at once proposed and adopted.” Congress was in session when Chisholm was decided, and a constitutional amendment in response was proposed two days later, but Congress never acted on it, and in fact it was not until two years after Chisholm was handed down that *108 an Amendment was ratified.
