**Dissenting Opinion**
 8 *275 H — I » — I The lead opinion uses one term, “strict scrutiny,” to describe the standard of judicial review for all governmental classifications by race.  Ante, at 235-237.  But that opinion’s elaboration strongly suggests that the strict standard announced is indeed “fatal” for classifications burdening groups that have suffered discrimination in our society.  That seems to me, and, I believe, to the Court, the enduring lesson one should draw from Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944); for in that case, scrutiny the Court described as “most rigid,” id., at 216 , nonetheless yielded a pass for an odious, gravely injurious racial classification.  See ante, at 214-215 (lead opinion).  A Korematsu-type classification, as I read the opinions in this case, will never again survive scrutiny: Such a classification, history and precedent instruct, properly ranks as prohibited.  For a classification made to hasten the day when “we are just one race,” ante, at 239 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), however, the lead opinion has dispelled the notion that “strict scrutiny” is “‘fatal in fact.’” Ante, at 237 (quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448, 519</citedDecision> (1980) (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)).  Properly, a majority of the Court calls for review that is searching, in order to ferret out classifications in reality malign, but masquerading as benign.  See ante, at 228-229 (lead opinion).  The Court’s once lax review of sex-based classifications demonstrates the need for such suspicion.  See, e. g., Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57, 60 (1961) (upholding women’s “privilege” of automatic exemption from jury service); Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948) (upholding Michigan law barring women from employment as bartenders); see also Johnston & Knapp, Sex Discrimination by Law: A Study in Judicial Perspective, 46 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 675 (1971).  Today’s decision thus usefully reiterates that the purpose of strict scrutiny “is precisely to distinguish legitimate from *276 illegitimate uses of race in governmental decisionmaking,” ante, at 228 (lead opinion), “to ‘differentiate between’ permissible and impermissible governmental use of race,” ibid., to distinguish “ ‘between a “No Trespassing” sign and a welcome mat,’ ” ante, at 229.  Close review also is in order for this further reason.
