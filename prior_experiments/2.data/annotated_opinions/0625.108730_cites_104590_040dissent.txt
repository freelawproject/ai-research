The situations in which pretrial or preconviction federal interference by way of habeas corpus with state criminal processes is justified involve the lack of jurisdiction, under the Supremacy Clause, for the State to bring any criminal charges against the petitioner. Wildenhus’s Case, 120 U. S. 1 (1887); In re Loney, 134 U. S. 372 (1890); In re Neagle, 135 U. S. 1 (1890). The effect of today's ruling that federal habeas corpus prior to trial is appropriate because it will determine the validity of custody that may be imposed in actuality only sometime in the indefinite future constitutes an unjustifiable federal interference with the judicial administration of a State’s criminal laws. The use of federal habeas corpus is, presumably, limited neither to the interstate detainer situation nor to the constitutional rights secured by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. The same reasoning would apply to a state prisoner who alleges that “future custody” will result because the State plans to introduce at a criminal trial sometime in the future a confession allegedly obtained in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, or evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. I thoroughly disagree with this conversion of federal habeas corpus into a pretrial-motion forum for state prisoners. *509 III In addition to sanctioning an expansion of when a federal court may interfere with state judicial administration, the Court overrules Ahrens v. <targetCase>Clark, supra</targetCase>, and expands the parameters of which federal courts may so intervene. In Ahrens, the Court held that “the presence within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court of the person detained is [a] prerequisite to filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus.” 335 U. S., at 189. The Court construed the phrase “within their respective jurisdictions” to mean that Congress intended to limit the jurisdiction of a district court to prisoners in custody within its territorial jurisdiction. Id., at 193. The Court here says that the “language” of Ahrens “indicates” the result reached below. The explicit holding of the Court, however, is plainly much more than an “indication.” “Thus the view that the jurisdiction of the District Court to issue the writ in cases such as this is restricted to those petitioners who are confined or detained within the territorial jurisdiction of the court is supported by the language of the statute, by considerations of policy, and by the legislative history of the enactment. We therefore do not feel free to weigh the policy considerations which are advanced for giving district courts discretion in cases like this. If that concept is to be imported into this statute, Congress must do so.” Id., at 192-193 (emphasis added; footnote omitted). The result reached today may be desirable from the point of view of sound judicial administration, see Ahrens v. <targetCase>Clark, supra</targetCase>, at 191; Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224, 228 n. 5 (1970). It is the function of this Court, however, to ascertain the intent of Congress as to the mean *510 ing of “within their respective jurisdictions.” Having completed that task in Ahrens, it is the function of Congress to amend the statute if this Court misinterpreted congressional intent or if subsequent developments suggest the desirability, from a policy viewpoint, of alterations in the statute. See Cleveland v. United States, 329 U. S. 14 (1946). We noted in Nelson that the resolution of any apparent dilemma “caused” by this Court’s holding in Ahrens is appropriately one to be undertaken by Congress. 399 U. S., at 228 n. 5. Legislative “inaction” in amending a statute to comport with this Court’s evaluation of “[s]ound judicial administration” hardly warrants the disingenuous reading of a previous decision to achieve the result that Congress, despite judicial prodding, has refused to mandate. However impatient we may be with a federal statute which sometimes may fail to provide a remedy for every situation, one would have thought it inappropriate for the Court to amend the statute by judicial action.

Indeed, the most recent indications of legislative intent support this conclusion rather than that advanced by the Court. See H. R. Rep. No. 1894, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 1-2 (1966); S. Rep. No. 1502, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966). See also n. 13,. ante, at 497. I would adhere to this Court’s interpretation of the legislative intent set forth in Ahrens v. <targetCase>Clark, supra</targetCase>, and leave it to Congress, during the process of considering legislation to amend this section, to consider and to weigh the various policy factors that the Court today weighs for itself.
