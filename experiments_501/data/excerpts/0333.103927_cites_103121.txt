**Combined Opinion**
 After the accident, examination of the rope at the point where it broke showed that it was so rotten as to be inadequate to support the strain imposed upon it.  The trial judge concluded from the evidence that there was sound rope on board available for rigging the staging.  He found that there was no fault in the manner in which the stage had been rigged, but that the rope selected by the mate was defective and that petitioner’s injury was attributable to the negligence of the boatswain and the *98 mate in failing to observe the defect.  1 He held that the proceeding was brought too late to recover for the negligence under the Jones Act, and that the “Wichita Falls” was not unseaworthy by reason of the defective rope used in rigging the staging, citing Plamals v. The Pinar Del Rio, 277 U. S. 151, 155 .  He accordingly denied indemnity to petitioner, but gave judgment in his favor for maintenance and cure.  The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed, 129 F. 2d 857 , 135 F. 2d 602 , by a divided court, resting its decision on the statement quoted from the opinion in The Pinar Del Rio, supra, 155, that “The record does not support the suggestion that the ‘Pinar Del Rio’ was unseaworthy.  The mate selected a bad rope when good ones were available.” We granted certiorari, 320 U. S. 725 , upon a petition which urged that the statement quoted from The Pinar Del Rio, supra, does not rule this case, and that the decision below is inconsistent with the decisions in The Osceola, 189 U. S. 158 , and in Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, <citedDecision>305 U. S. 424</citedDecision> .  The sole issue presented by the petition for certiorari is that of respondent’s liability to indemnify petitioner for the injury suffered by reason of the defective staging.  No question is raised with respect to petitioner’s right to recover under the Jones Act or his right to the award of maintenance and cure or its adequacy.  A finding of seaworthiness is usually a finding of fact.  Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Co., 248 U. S. 139, 145 ; Steel v. State Line S. S. Co., L. R. 3 A. C. 72, 81-82, 90-91.  Ordinarily we do not, in admiralty, more than in other *99 cases, review the concurrent findings of fact of two courts below.  The Carib Prince, 170 U. S. 655, 658 ; The Wildcroft, 201 U. S. 378, 387 ; Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Co., supra; Piedmont Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., 254 U. S. 1, 13 ; Just v. Chambers, 312 U. S. 383, 385 .  Here, however, both courts below, holding themselves bound by The Pinar Del Rio, supra, have, on the facts found, held as a matter of law that the staging was seaworthy despite its defect.  That conclusion of law is reviewable here.  Until the enactment of the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007 , 46 U. S. C. § 688 , the maritime law afforded no remedy by way of indemnity beyond maintenance and cure, for the injury to a seaman caused by the mere negligence of a ship’s officer or member of the crew.  But the admiralty rule that the vessel and owner are liable to indemnify a seaman for injury caused by unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment, has been the settled law since this Court’s ruling to that effect in The Osceola, supra, 175 .  Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., 247 U. S. 372, 380-381 ; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, 259 U. S. 255, 258-260 ; Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 134 ; Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, 287 U. S. 367, 370-371 ; Warner v. Goltra, 293 U. S. 155, 158 ; The Arizona v. Anelich, 298 U. S. 110 , 120 et seq.; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. <citedDecision>
   Smith, supra,
  
  428-429</citedDecision> ; O’Donnell v. Great Lakes Co., 318 U. S. 36, 40 .  The latter rule seems to have been derived from the seaman’s privilege to abandon a ship improperly fitted out, and was generally applied, before its statement in The Osceola, supra, by numerous decisions of the lower federal courts during the last century.  See The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 121 , footnote 2.  This was a recognized departure from the rule of the English law, which allowed no recovery other than maintenance and cure for injuries caused by unseaworthiness, Couch v. Steel, 3 El.  & Bl. 402, until the enactment of the *100 Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, 39 & 40 Vict., Chap. 80, § 5, reenacted by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, 57 & 58 Vict., Chap. 60, § 458.  By that statute there is annexed to every contract of service between the owner of a ship or the master and any seaman thereof, an obligation that all reasonable means be used to insure the seaworthiness of the ship before and during the voyage.  See Hedley v. Pinkney & Sons S. S. Co., [1894] A. C. 222.  In a number of cases in the federal courts, decided before The Osceola, supra, the right of the seaman to recover for injuries caused by unseaworthiness seems to have been rested on the negligent failure, usually by the seaman’s officers or fellow seamen, to supply seaworthy appliances.  The Noddleburn, 28 F. 855 , aff’d, 30 F. 142 ; The Neptuno, 30 F. 925 ; The Frank and Willie, 45 F. 494 ; The Julia Fowler, 49 F. 277 ; William Johnson & Co. v. Johansen, 86 F. 886 ; and see The Columbia, 124 F. 745 ; The Lyndhurst, 149 F. 900 .  But later cases in this and other federal courts have followed the ruling of The Osceola, supra, that the exercise of due diligence does not relieve the owner of his obligation to the seaman to furnish adequate appliances.  2 Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, 259-260 ; The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 120 et seq.; Beadle v. Spencer, 298 U. S. 124, 128-129 ; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. <citedDecision>
   Smith, supra,
  
  428-429, 432</citedDecision> ; The H. A. Scandrett, 87 F. 2d 708 , 710-711; cf. The Edwin I.  Morrison, 153 U. S. 199, 210 .  If the owner is liable for furnishing an unseaworthy appliance, even when he is not negligent, a fortiori his obligation is unaffected by the fact that the negligence of the officers of the vessel contributed to its unseaworthiness.  *101 It is true that before the Jones Act the owner was, in other respects, not responsible for injuries to a seaman caused by the negligence of officers or members of the crew.  But this is not sufficient to insulate the owner from liability for their negligent failure to furnish seaworthy appliances, see Judge Addison Brown, in The Frank and Willie, supra, 495-497; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, 259-260 , more than their negligence relieves him from his liability for maintenance and cure.  The Osceola, supra, 175 ; Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, supra, 134 ; Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, 303 U. S. 525, 527 .  It required the Harter Act to relax the exacting obligation to cargo of the owner’s warranty of seaworthiness of ship and tackle.
**Combined Opinion**
 It was unseaworthy in the sense that it was inadequate for the purpose for which it was ordinarily used, because of the defective rope with which it was rigged.  Its inadequacy rendered it unseaworthy, whether the mate’s failure to observe the defect was negligent or unavoidable.  Had it been adequate, petitioner would not have been injured and his injury was the proximate and immediate consequence of the unseaworthiness.  See The Osceola, supra, 174-175 , and cases cited.  Any negligence of the mate in selecting the rope and ordering its use as a part of the staging, or of the boatswain in using it for that purpose, could not relieve respondent of the duty to furnish a seaworthy staging.  Whether petitioner knew of the defective condition of the rope does not appear, but in any case the seaman, in the performance of his duties, is not deemed to assume the risk of unseaworthy appliances.  The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 123-124 ; Beadle v. Spencer, supra, 129-130 ; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. <citedDecision>Smith, supra.</citedDecision> Nor does the fact that there was sound rope on board, which might have been used to rig a safe staging, afford an excuse to the owner for the failure to provide a safe one.  We have often had occasion to emphasize the conditions of the seaman’s employment, see Socony-Vacuum Co. v. <citedDecision>Smith, supra,</citedDecision> 430-431 and cases cited, which have been deemed to make him a ward of the admiralty and to place large responsibility for his safety on the owner.  He is subject to the rigorous discipline of the sea, and all the conditions of his service constrain him to accept, without critical examination and without protest, working conditions and appliances as commanded by his superior officers.  These conditions, which have generated the exacting re *104 quirement that the vessel or the owner must provide the seaman with seaworthy appliances with which to do his work, likewise require that safe appliances be furnished when and where the work is to be done.  For, as was said in The Osceola, supra, 175 , the owner’s obligation is “to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship.” (Italics supplied.) It is not enough that the “Wichita Falls” had on board sound rope which could have been used to make the staging seaworthy, if in fact the staging was unsafe because sound rope was not used.  The Julia Fowler, supra; The Navarino, 7 F. 2d 743, 746 ; cf. The Portland, 213 F. 699 .  Respondent’s argument that the defective rope was a consumable supply of the vessel, not falling within the requirement that the owner must furnish seaworthy equipment appurtenant to the vessel, is inappropriate here because, as we have said, it was the stage which was unseaworthy, by reason of the use of the defective rope in its construction.

 if thus unseaworthy and one of the crew received damage as the direct result thereof, he was entitled to recover compensatory damages.” (Italics supplied.) The court cited, amongst other cases, The Osceola .  I am at a loss to understand the citation of this case as authority for the present decision.  The reasoning of the court’s opinion seems to be this: In the Carlisle Packing Co. case recovery was permitted because the injury was the direct result of unseaworthiness.  That decision, therefore, requires that the owner be held liable in the instant case although the seaman’s injury was not the direct result of unseaworthiness, but of the mate’s negligence.  It must be upon the basis of such reasoning that the Pinar Del Rio case is overruled and the judgment below reversed.  There is some suggestion that the Pinar Del Rio case was overruled by Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith, <citedDecision>305 U. S. 424</citedDecision> .  It need only be said that the Pinar Del Rio case was not cited in the briefs of counsel in the Socony case nor referred to in the opinion and that in fact the Socony decision involved and purported to deal only with the general doctrine of assumption of risk and not with the defense of fellow servant’s negligence.  That the defenses are not the same is made plain by the fact that it has always been held that a fellow servant’s negligence is no defense in actions brought under the Federal Em *112 ployers’ Liability Act, 4 whereas assumption of other risks was a defense 5 until Congress recently explicitly acted to abolish it as such.  6 Indeed, if in the Socony case, the suit had involved a fellow servant’s negligence instead of the seaman’s assumption of the risk involved in the use of an unsafe appliance supplied by the vessel, the case would have been so plainly ruled by earlier decisions 7 that it would have merited no consideration, much less an opinion, by this court. The statement in the opinion that the defense of a fellow servant’s negligence had never been deemed applicable to the owner’s obligation to the seaman under the warranty of seaworthiness ignores the point that if the seaman is to recover the unseaworthiness must, under the authorities cited, be the direct cause of the injury.  If it is not, but a fellow servant’s negligence is the cause, the seaman could not recover, 8 until the law was altered by the Jones Act.  The evil resulting from overruling earlier considered decisions must be evident.  In the present case, the court below naturally felt bound to follow and apply the law as clearly announced by this court. If litigants and lower federal courts are not to do so, the law becomes not a chart to govern conduct but a game of chance; instead of settling rights and liabilities it unsettles them.
