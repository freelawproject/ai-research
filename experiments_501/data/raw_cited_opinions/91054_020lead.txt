<author id="b545-10">Ms. Justice Matthews</author>
<p id="Ax5">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>
<p id="AFtX">After reciting the facts in the foregoing language, he continued:</p>
<p id="b545-11">It is claimed on behalf of the prisoner that the conviction and sentence are void, .op the ground that they are repugnant to that clause of the'Fourteenth Article of Amendment of the Constitution of the United States which is in these words:</p>
<blockquote id="b546-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="520">*520</page-number>“ Nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process, of law.”</blockquote>
<p id="b546-4">The proposition of law we are asked to affirm is that an indictment or presentment by a grand jury, as known to the common law of England, is essential to that “ due process of law,” when applied to prosecutions for felonies, which is secured and guaranteed by this provision of the Constitution of the United States, and which accordingly it is forbidden to the States respectively to dispense with in the administration of criminal law.</p>
<p id="Av9">The question is one of grave and serious import, affecting both private and public rights and interests of great magnitude, and involves a consideration of what additional restrictions upon the legislative policy of the States has been imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</p>
<p id="AqqK">The Supreme Court of California, in the judgment now under review, followed its own previous decision in <em>Kalloch </em>v. <em>Superior </em>Court, 56 Cal. 229, in which the question was deliberately adjudged. Its conclusion was there stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b546-8">“This proceeding, as [it] is regulated by the.Constitution and laws of this State, is not opposed to any of the definitions given of the phrases ‘ due process of law ’ and (the law of the land ; ’ but, on the contrary, it is a proceeding strictly within such definitions, as much so in every respect as is a proceeding by indictment. It may be quéstioned whether the proceeding by indictment secures to the accused any superior fights and privileges ; but certainly a prosecution by information takes from him no immunity or protection to which he is entitled under the law.”</blockquote>
<p id="b546-9">And the opinion, cites and relies upon a decision of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in the case of <em>Rowan </em>v. <em>The </em>State, 30 Wis. 129. In that case the court, speaking of the Fourteenth Amendment, says:</p>
<blockquote id="b546-10">“ But its design was not to confine the States to a particular mode of procedure in judicial proceedings, and prohibit them from <page-number citation-index="1" label="521">*521</page-number>prosecuting for felonies by information instead of by indictment, if they chose to abolish the grand jury system. And the words ‘ due process of law ’ in the amendment do not mean and have not the' effect to limit the powers of State governments to prosecutions for crime by indictment; but these words do mean law in its regular course of administration, according to prescribed forms, find in accordance with the general rules for the protection of individual rights. Administration and remedial proceedings must change, from time to time, with the advancement of legal science and the progress of society; and, if the people of the State find it wise and expedient to abolish the-gran¿1 jury and prosecute all crimes by information, there is nothing in our State Constitution and nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States which prevents them from doing so.”</blockquote>
<p id="b547-5">On the other hand, it is maintained on behalf of the plaintiff in error that the phrase <em>“ </em>due process of law ” is equivalent to “law of the land,” as found in the 29th chapter of Magna Chárta; that by immemorial usage it- has acquired a fixed, definite, and technical meaning; that it refers to and includes, not only the general principles of public liberty and private right, which lie at the foundation, of all free government, but the very institutions which, venerable by time and custom, have been tried by experience and found fit and necessary for the preservation of those principles, and which, having been the birthright and inheritance of every English subject, crossed the-Atlantic with the colonists and were transplanted and established in the fundamental laws of the State; that, having been originally introduced into the Constitution of the United States as a limitation upon the powers of the government, brought into being by that instrument, it has now been added as an additional security to the individual against oppression by the States themselves; that one of these institutions is that of the grand jury, an indictment or presentment by which against the accused .in cases of alleged felonies is an essential part' of due process of law, in order that he may not be harassed or destroyed by prosecutions founded only upon private malice or popular fury.</p>
<p id="b547-6">This view is certainly supported by the authority of the <page-number citation-index="1" label="522">*522</page-number>great name of Chief Justice Shaw and of the court in Which he presided, which, in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>robbins, </em>8 Gray, 329, decided that the 12th article of the Bill of Rights of Massachusetts, a transcript of Magna Charta in this respect, made an indictment or presentment of a grand jury essential to the validity of a conviction in cases of prosecutions for felonies. In delivering the opinion of the court in that case, Merrick, J., alone dissenting, the Chief Justice said:</p>
<blockquote id="b548-4">“ The right of individual citizens to be secure from an open and public accusation of crime, and from the trouble, expense, and anxiety of <em>i </em>public trial before a probable cause is established by the presentment and indictment of a grand jury, in case of high offences, is justly regarded as one of the securities to the innocent against hasty, malicious, and oppressive public prosecutions, and as one of the ancient immunities and privileges of English liberty.” . . . . “It having been stated,” he continued, “ by Lord Coke, that by the ‘ law of the land ’ was intended a due course of proceeding according to the established rules and practice of the courts of common law, it may, perhaps, be suggested that this might include other modes of proceeding sanctioned by the common law, the most familiar of which are, by ■ informa-tions of various kinds, by the officers of the crown in the name of the King. But, in reply to this, it 'may be said that Lord. Coke himself explains his own meaning .by saying ‘ the law.of the land,’ as expressed in Magna Charta, was intended due process of law, that is,.by indictment or presentment of good and lawful men. And further, it is stated, on the authority of Blackstone, tbayinfor-mations of every, kind are confined by^the constitutional law to-misdemeanors only. 4 Bl. Com. 310.”</blockquote>
<p id="b548-7">Referring again to the passage from Lord Coke, he says, p. 343: .</p>
<blockquote id="b548-8">“This may not be conclusive, but,being a construction adopted by a writer of high authority before the emigration of our ancestors, it. has a tendency to show how it was then understood.”</blockquote>
<p id="b548-9">This passage'from Coke seems to be the chief foundation of the opinion for which it is cited; but a critical examination and <page-number citation-index="1" label="523">*523</page-number>comparison of the text and context will show that it has' been misunderstood; that it was not intended to assert that an indictment or presentment of a .grand, jury. WUS1 essential to the idea of due process’of law in the 'prósefeutión and punishment of crimes, but was only mentioned, as an ■ example and illus-, tration of due process of law as .it- actually existed in cases in which It was customarily used. - .In beginning his commentary on this chapter of Magna Charta,.2 Inst. 46, 'Coke says:</p>
<blockquote id="b549-4">“ This chapter eontaineth nine,several Branches’:</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b549-5">■“ 1. That no man be taken or’imprisoned1 but <em>per, legem, terree, </em>that is, by the <em>common law', statute law,'or ckstóni of England; </em>for the words <em>per legem terreé, </em>being’ towards the end of this chapter, doe ref eyre to all the‘precedent matters,In thé chapter, e,te.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b549-6">“-2. No man shall be disseised, etc,./unless it’be by, the lawful' judgment, that is, Verdict of his equals, (thatIs of men of his own condition,) <em>or by the law.of the lanel,,(that is to'¿peak it onpefor all,) by the due course and process of law” </em>'</blockquote>
<p id="b549-7">He then proceeds to state that, 3, no maw shall be outlawed, unless according to the law of the land; 4, no man ¿hall be exiled, unless according to the law of the land; 5, ho man shall be in, any sort destroyed, “ unless^ it be by the verdict of his equals, or according to the law of the land;” 6, “homan shall be condemned at the King’s ’suite, either before the King in his bench, where the pleas are <em>coram-rege, </em>(and so are the words <em>inee super eum ibimu.s </em>,tó be ’understood,) nor before .any other commissioner or judge whatsoever,' apd so áre the words <em>neo super eum mittemus </em>to be understood, but by the judgment’of his peers, that is, equal's, or according to the law of the land.”</p>
<p id="b549-8">Recurring to the first clause of the chapter, he continues:</p>
<blockquote id="b549-9">“ 1. No man shall be taken (that is) restrained of liberty by petition or suggestion to $he King or to his couneill, unless it be by indictment or presentment of good and lawfull men, where such deeds ,be done. This branch. and. divers pther parts of this act have been notably explained by divers acts of Parliament, &amp;c., quoted in the inargent.”</blockquote>
<p id="b549-10">'The reference is to various acts during the reign of Edward <page-number citation-index="1" label="524">*524</page-number>III. And reaching again the words “ <em>nisi per legem </em>terra,,” he continues:</p>
<blockquote id="b550-4">“ But by the law of the land. For the true sense and exposition of these words see the statute of 37 E. 3, cap. 8, where the words, by the law of the land, are rendered, without due proces of the law, for there it is said, though it be contained in the Great Charter, that no naan be taken, imprisoned, or put out of his freehold without proces of the law, that is, by indictment of good and lawfull men, where such deeds be done- in due manner, or by writ originall. of the common law. Without being brought in to answere but by due proces of the common law. No man be put to answer without presentment before justices, or thing of record, or by due proces, or by writ originall, according, to the old law of the land. Wherein it is to be observed that this chapter is but declaratory of the old law of England.”</blockquote>
<p id="b550-5">It is quite apparent from these extracts that the interpretation usually put upon Lord Coke’s statement is too large, because if an indictment or presentment by a grand jury is essential to due process of law in all cases of imprisonment for crime, it applies not only to felonies but to misdemeanors and petty offences, and the conclusion would be inevitable that informations as a substitute for indictments would be illegal in all cases. It was indeed so argued by Sir Francis Winninton in <em>Mr. Prynn's Case, </em>5 Mod. 459, from this very language of Magna Charta, that all suits of the King - must be by presentment or indictment, and he cited Lord Coke as authority to that effect. He attempted to show that informations had their origin in the act of 11 Hen. 7, c. 3, enacted in 1494, known as the infamous Eppson and Dudley act, which was repealed by that of 1 Hen. <em>8, </em>c. 6,.in .1509... But the argument was overruled, Lord Holt saying that to hold otherwise “ would be a reflection on the whole bar.” Sir Bartholomew Shower, who was prevented from arguing in support of the information, prints his intended árgument in his report of the case under the name of <em>The King </em>v. <em>Berchet, </em>1 Show. 106, in which, with great thoroughness, he arrays all the learning of the time on the subject. He undertakes to <em>“ </em>evince that this method of prosecution is noways con-<page-number citation-index="1" label="525">*525</page-number>trariant to any fundamental rule of law, but agreeable to it.” He answers the objection that it is inconvenient and vexatious to the subject by saying (p. 117):</p>
<blockquote id="b551-4"><em>“ </em>Here is no inconvenience to the people. Here is a trial <em>per pais, </em>fair notice, liberty of pleading <em>dilatorios </em>as well as <em>bars. </em>Here <em>issubpoena </em>and <em>attachment, </em>as much time for defence, charge, &amp;c., for the prosecutor makes up the record, &amp;c.; then, in case of malicious prosecution, the person &gt;vho prosecutes is known by the note to the coroner, according to the practice of the court.”</blockquote>
<p id="b551-5">He answers the argument drawn from Magna Charta, and says:</p>
<blockquote id="b551-6">“ That .this method of prosecution no way contradicts that law, for we say this is <em>per legem terree et per communem legem terree, </em>for otherwise there never had been so universal a practice of it in all ages.”</blockquote>
<p id="b551-7">And referring to Coke’s comment, that “ no man shall be taken,” <em>i. e., </em>restrained of liberty by petition or suggestion to the King or his Council unléss it be by indictment or presentment, he says (p. 122):</p>
<blockquote id="b551-8">“ By petition or suggestion can never be meant of the King’s Bench, for he himself had preferred several here ; that is meant only of the the King alone, or in' Council, or in the Star Chamber. In the King’s Bench the information is not a suggestion to <em>thei King, </em>but to the <em>court </em>upon record.” '</blockquote>
<p id="b551-9">And" he quotes 3 Inst. 136, where Coke modifies the statement by saying, “ The King cannot put any to answer, but his court must be apprized of the crime by indictment, presentment, or <em>other matter of </em>record,” which, Shower says, includes ah information.</p>
<p id="b551-10">So it has been recently held that upon a coroner’s inquisition taken concerning the death of a man and a verdict of guilty of murder or manslaughter is returned, the offender may be prosecuted and tried without the intervention of a grand jury. <em>Reg. v. Ingham, </em>5 B. &amp; S. 257. And it was said by Buffer, J., in <page-number citation-index="1" label="526">*526</page-number><em>Rex </em>v. <em>Joliffe, </em>4 T. R. 285-293, that if to an action for slander in charging the plaintiff with felony a justification is pleaded which is found by the jury, that of itself amounts to an indictment, as if it had been found by the grand jury, and is sufficient to put the party thus accused on his trial.</p>
<p id="b552-4">The language of Lord Coke' applies only to forfeitures of life and liberty at the suit of the King, and hence appeals of murder, which were prosecutions by private persons, were never regarded as contrary to Magna Charta. On the contrary, the appeal of death was by Lord Holt “ esteemed a noble remedy and a badge of the rights and liberties of an Englishman.” R<em>ex </em>v. Toler, 1 Ld. Raymond, 555-557; 12 Mod. 375; Holt, 483. <em>We </em>are told that in the early part of the last century, in England, persons who had been acquitted on indictments for murder were often trier], convicted and executed on appeals.' Kendall on Trial by Battel (3d Ed.), 4N47. An appeal of murder was .brought .in England as lately as 1817, but defeated by the appellant’s declining to accept the wager of. battel. <em>Ashford </em>v. Thornton, 1 B. <em>&amp; </em>Ald. 405. The English statutes concerning appeals of murder were in' force in the Provinces of Pennsylvania and Maryland. <em>Beport of' </em>Judges, 3 Binn. 599-604; Kilty on Maryland Statutes, 141, 143, 158. It is said that no such appeal was ever brought in Pennsylvania; but in Maryland, in 1765, a negro was convicted and executed upon such an appeaj. <em>Soper </em>v. Tom, 1 Har. &amp; McHen. 227. See note to <em>Paxton’s Case, </em>Quincy’s - Mass. Rep. 53, by Mr. Justice Gray.</p>
<p id="b552-5">This view of the meaning of Lord Coke is the one taken by Merrick, J., in his dissenting opinion in <em>Jones </em>v. Robbins, 8 Gray, 329, who states his conclusions in these words:</p>
<blockquote id="b552-6">“ It is the forensic trial, under a broad, and general law, operating equally upon every member of our community, which the words, cby the law of the land,’ in Magna Charta, and’ in every subsequent declaration of rights which has borrowed its phraseology, make essential to the safety of the citizen, securing thereby both his liberty and his property, by preventing the unlawful arrest of his person any unlawful interference with his estate.” See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Starling, </em>15 Rich. (S. C.) Law, 120.</blockquote>
<p id="b553-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="527">*527</page-number>Mr. Reeve, in 2 History of Eng. Law, 43, translates the phrase, <em>nisi per legale judicium parium suorum vel per legem terree,</em></p>
<blockquote id="b553-5"><em>“ </em>But by the judgment of his peers, or by some other legal process or proceeding adapted by the law to the nature of the case.”</blockquote>
<p id="b553-6">Chancellor Kent, 2 Com. 13, adopts this mode of construing the phrase. Quoting the language of Magna Charta, and referring to Lord Coke’s comment upon it, he says:</p>
<blockquote id="b553-7">“ The better and larger definition of <em>clue process of law </em>is that it means law in its regular course of administration through courts of justice.”</blockquote>
<p id="b553-8">This accords with whát is said in <em>Westervelt </em>v. Gregg, 12 N. Y. 202, by Denio, J., p. 212:</p>
<blockquote id="b553-9">“ The provision was designed to protect the citizen against all mere acts of power, whether flowing from the legislative or executive branches of the government.”</blockquote>
<p id="b553-10">The principal and true meaning of the phrase has never been more tersely or accurately stated than by Mr. Justice Johnson, in <em>Bank of Columbia </em>v. <em>Okely, </em>4 Wheat. 235-244:</p>
<blockquote id="b553-11">“ As to the words from Magna Charta, incorporated into the Constitution of Maryland, after volumes spoken and written with a view to their exposition, the good sense of mankind has at last settled down to this : that they were intended to secure the individual from the arbitrary exercise of the powers of government, unrestrained by the established principles of private right and distributive justice.”</blockquote>
<p id="b553-12">And the conclusion- rightly deduced is, as stated by Mr. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, 356:</p>
<blockquote id="b553-13">“ The. principles, then, upon which the process is based, are to determine whether it is {due process ’ or not, and not any considerations of mere form. Administrative and remedial process'may <page-number citation-index="1" label="528">*528</page-number>be ■ changed from time to time, but. only with due regard to the landmarks established for the protection of the citizen.”</blockquote>
<p id="b554-4">It' is urged upon us, however, in argument, that the claim made in behalf of the plaintiff in error is supported by the decision of this court in <em>Murray's Lessee </em>v. <em>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Company, </em>18 How. 272. There Mr. Justice Curtis, delivering the opinion of the court, after showing, p. 276, that due process of law must mean something more than the actual existing law of the land, for otherwise it would be no restraint -upon legislative power, proceeds as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b554-5">“ To what principle, then, are we to resort to ascertain whether this process, enacted by Congress, is due process ? To this the answer must be twofold. . We must examine the Constitution itself to see whether this process be in conflict with any of its provisions. If ncft found to be so, we must look to those settled usages and modes of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England before the emigration of our ancestors, and which are shown not to have been unsuited to their civil and political-condition by having been acted on by them after the settlement of this country.”</blockquote>
<p id="b554-6">This, it is argued, furnishes an - indispensable test of what constitutes “ due process of law; ” that any proceeding otherwise authorized by law, which is not thus sanctioned by usage, or which supersedes and displaces one that is, cannot be regarded as due process of law.</p>
<p id="b554-7">But this inference is unwarranted. The real syllabus of the passage quoted is, that a process of law, which is not otherwise forbidden, must be taken to be due process of law, if it can show, •the sanction of settled usage both in England and in. this country ; but it by no means follows that nothing else can be due process of law. The point in the case cited arose in reference to a summary proceeding,, questioned on that account,, as not due process of law. The answer was: however exceptional it may be, as tested by definitions and principles of ordinary procedure; nevertheless, this, in substance, has been immemorially the actual law of the land, and, therefore, is due process of law. <page-number citation-index="1" label="529">*529</page-number>But to hold that such a characteristic is essential to due process of law, would be to deny every quality of the law but its age, and to render it incapable of- progress or improvement! It would be to stamp upon our jurisprudence the unchangeableness attributed to the laws of the Medes and Persians.</p>
<p id="b555-5">This would be all the more singular - and surprising, in- this quick and active age, when we consider that, owing to the progressive development of legal ideas and institutions in England, the -words of Magna Charta stood for very different things at the time of the separation of the American colonies from what they represented originally. For at first the words <em>nisi per legale judicium pa/rium </em>had no reference to a jury; they applied only to the <em>pares regni, </em>Avho were the constitutional judges in the Court of Exchequer and <em>coram rege. </em>Bac. Abr. Juries, 7th Ed., Bond., note, Peeve, H. L. 41. And as to the grand jury itself, we learn of its constitution and functions from the Assize of Clarendon, a. d. 1164, and that of Northampton, a. d. 1176, Stubbs’ Charters, 143-150. By the latter of these, which was a republication of the former, it was provided, that “ if any one is accused before the justices of our Lord the King- of murder, or theft, or robbery, or of harbouring persons committing those crimes, or of forgery or arson, by the oath of twelve knights of, the hundred, or, if there are no knights, by the oath of twelve free and lawful mén, and by the oath of four men from each township of the hundred, lét him go to the ordeal of water, and, if he fails, let him lose one foot. And at' Northampton it was added, for greater strictness of justice <em>{pro rigore justitice), </em>that he shall lose his right hand at the same time with his foot, and abjure the realm and exile himself from the realm within forty days. And if he is acquitted by the ordeal, let him1 find, pledges and remain in the kingdom, unless he is accused of murder or other base felony by the body of the country and the lawful knights of the country; but if he is so accused as- aforesaid, although he is acquitted by the ordeal of water, nevertheless he must leave the kingdom in forty days and take his chattels with him, subject to the rights of his lords, and he must abjure the kingdom at the mercy of our Lord the King.”</p>
<blockquote id="b556-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="530">*530</page-number>“ The system thus established,” says Mr. Justice Stephens, 1 Hist. Grim. Law of England, 252, “ is simple. The body, of the country are the accusers. Their accusation is practically equivalent to a conviction, subject to the chance of a favorable termination of the ordeal by water. If the ordeal fails, the accused person loses his foot and his hand. If it succeeds, he is nevertheless to be banished. Accusation,- therefore, was equivalent to banishment, at least.”</blockquote>
<p id="b556-4">When we add to this that the primitive grand jury heard no witnesses in support of the truth-of the charges to be preferred, but presented upon thgir own knowledge, or indicted upon common fame and general suspicion, we' shall be ready to acknowledge that it is better not to go too far back into antiquity for the best securities for our “ ancient liberties.” It is more consonant to the true philosophy of our historical legal institutions to say that the spirit of, personal liberty and individual right, which they1 embodied} was preserved and developed by’a progressive growth and wise adaptation, to new circumstances and situations of the form? and, processes found fit to give, from time to time, new- expression 'and greater effect to modern ideas of. self-government.</p>
<p id="AMY">This flexibility and capacity for growth and adaptation is the peculiar boast and excellence' of the common law. Sir James Mackintosh ascribe? this 'principle of dévelopment ,to Magna Charta itsqlf., To, use his- own language: ' '</p>
<blockquote id="b556-6">■ “ It was a peculiar advantage that the consequences of its principles were, if we- may so speak, only discovered slowly and gradually. It gave out on each occasion only so much of the spirit, of liberty and reformation as the circumstances of succeeding, generations required and as their character-would safely bear. For almost five . centuries it Was appealed to as the decisive authority on behalf of the people, though commonly so far only as the necessities of each case demanded,”. 1 Hist, of England, 221.</blockquote>
<p id="AkSd">The Constitution of the United States was ordained, it is true, by descendants of -Englishmen, who inherited the tradi-tióiiS of English law and history; but it was made for an un<page-number citation-index="1" label="531">*531</page-number>defined and expanding future, .and for a people gathered and to be gathered from many nations and of many tongues. And while we take just pride in the principles and institutions of the common law, we are not to forget that in lands where other systems of jurisprudence prevail, the ideas and processes of civil justice are also not unknown. Due process of law, in spite of the absolutism of continental governments, is not alien to that code which survived the Roman Empire as the foundation of modern civilization in Europe, and which has given us that fundamental maxim of distributive <em>justice </em>— suum <em>cuique tribu&amp;re. </em>There is nothing in Magna Charta, rightly construed as a broad charter of public right and law, which ought to exclude the best ideas of all systems and of every age; and as it was the characteristic principle of .the common law to draw its inspiration from every fountain of justice, we are not to assume that the sources of its supply have 'been exhausted. On the contrary, we should expect that the new and various experiences of our own situation and system will mould and shape it into new and not less useful forms.</p>
<p id="b557-4">The concessions of Magna Charta were wrung from the King as guaranties against the oppressions and usurpations of his prerogative. It did' not enter into the minds of the barons to provide security against their own body or in favor of the Commons by limiting the power of Parliament; so that bills of attainder, <em>ex post facto </em>laws, laws declaring forfeitures of estates, and other arbitrary acts of legislation which occur so frequently in English history, were never regarded as inconsistent with the law of the land; for notwithstanding what was attributed to Lord Coke in <em>Bonham’s Case, </em>8 Rep. 115, 118 <em>a, </em>the omnipotence of Parliament over the common law was absolute, even against common right and reason. The actual and practical security for English liberty against legislative tyranny was the power of a free public opinion represented by the Commons.</p>
<p id="b557-5">In this country written constitutions were deemed essential to protect the rights and liberties of the people against the encroachments of power delegated to their governments, and .the provisions'of Magna Charta^were incorporated into Bills of <page-number citation-index="1" label="532">*532</page-number>Rights. They were limitations upon all the powers of government, legislatives well as executive and judicial.</p>
<p id="b558-4">It necessarily happened, therefore, that as these broad and general maxims of liberty and justice held in our system a different place and performed a different function from their position and office in English constitutional history and law, they would receive and justify a corresponding and more comprehensive interpretation. Applied in England only as guards against executive usurpation • and tyranny, here they have become bulwarks also against arbitrary legislation ; but, in that application, as it would be incongruous to measure and restrict them by the ancient customary English law, they must be held to guarantee not particular forms of procedure, but the very substance of individual rights to life, liberty, and property.</p>
<p id="b558-5">Restraints that could be fastened upon executive authority with precision and detail, might prove obstructive and injurious when imposed on the just and necessary discretion of legislative power; and, while in every instance, laws that violated express and specific injunctions and prohibitions, might, without embarrassment, be judicially declared to be void, yet, any general principle or maxim, founded on the .essential nature of law, as a just and reasonable expression of the public will and of government, as instituted by popular' consent and for the general good, can only be applied to cases coming clearly within the scope of its spirit and purpose, and not to legislative provisions merely establishing forms and modes of attainment. Such regulations, to adopt a sentence of Burke’s, “ may alter the mode and application but have no power over the substance of original justice.” Tract on the Popery Laws, 6 Burke’s Works, ed. Little &amp; Brown, 323.</p>
<p id="b558-6">■ Such is the often-repeated doctrine of this court. In <em>Munn </em>v. Illinois, 94 U. S. 113-134, the Chief Justice, delivering' the opinion of the court, said:</p>
<blockquote id="b558-7">“ A person has no property, no vested interest, in ,any rule of the common law. That is only one of the forms of municipal law, and is no more .sacred than any other. Rights of property which have been created by the common law cannot be taken <page-number citation-index="1" label="533">*533</page-number>away without due process; but the law itself, as a rule of conduct, maybe changed at the will or even at the whim of the legislature^ unless prevented by constitutional limitations. Indeed, the great office of statutes is to remedy defects’in the common law as they are developed, and to adapt it to the changes of time and circumstances.” _ <em>1</em></blockquote>
<p id="b559-5">And in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Savinet, </em>92 U. S. 90, the court said: .</p>
<blockquote id="b559-6"><em>“A </em>trial by jury in suits at common law pending in State courts is not, therefore, a privilege or immunity of national citizenship which the States are forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment to abridge. A State cannot deprive a person of his property without due process of law ; but this does not necessarily, imply that all trials in the State courts affecting the property of persons must be by jury. This requirement of the Constitution is met if the trial is had according to the settled course of judicial proceedings. Due process of law is process according to the law of the land. This process in the States is regulated by the law of State.”</blockquote>
<p id="b559-7">In <em>Kennard </em>v. <em>Louisiana ex rel. Morgan, </em>92 U. S. 480, the question was whether a mode of trying the title to an office, in which was no provision for a jury, was due process of law. Its validity was affirmed. The Chief Justice, after reciting the various steps in the proceeding, said:</p>
<blockquote id="b559-8">“ From this it appears that ample provision has been made for the trial of the contestation before a court of competent-jurisdiction ; for bringing the party against whom the proceeding is had before the court and notifying him of the case he is required to meet; for giving him an Opportunity to be heard in his defence ; for the deliberation and judgment of the court; for an appeal from this judgment to the highest court of the State, and for hearing and judgment there. A hiere statement of the facts carries with it a complete answer to all the constitutional objections urged against the validity of the act.”</blockquote>
<p id="b559-9">And. Mr. Justice Miller, in <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>New </em>Orleans, 96 U. S. 97-105, after showing the difficulty, if not the impossibility of framing a definition of this constitutional phrase, which <page-number citation-index="1" label="534">*534</page-number>should be “ at once perspicuous, comprehensive, and satisfactory,” and thenpe deducing the wisdom “in the ascertaining of the intent and application of such an important phrase in the Federal Constitution, by the gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion, as the casés presented for decision shall require,” says, however, that:</p>
<blockquote id="b560-3"><em>“ </em>It is not possible to bold that a party has, without due process of law, been deprived of his property, when, as regards the issues affecting it; he has by the laws of the State a fair trial in a court of justice, according to the modes of proceeding applicable to such a case.” See also <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>101 U. S. 22-31 ; <em>Ex parte Wall, 107 U. </em>S. 288-290.</blockquote>
<p id="A6l">We are to construe this phrase in the Fourteenth Amendment by the <em>usus loquendi </em>of the Constitution itself. The same words are contained in the Fifth Amendment. That article makes specific and express provision for perpetuating the institution of the grand jury, so far as relates to prosecutions for the more aggravated crimes under the laws of the United States. It declares that:</p>
<blockquote id="b560-5">“No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in eases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the militia when in actual service in time of war or public danger ; nor shall any person be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb ; nor shall he be compelled in any criminal case to be witness against himself.” [It then immediately adds] : “ Nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.”</blockquote>
<p id="b560-6">According to a recognized canon of interpretation, especially applicable to formal and solemn instruments of constitutional law, we are forbidden to assume, without clear reason to the contrary, that any part of this most important amendment is superfluous. The natural and obvious inference is, that in the sense of the Constitution, “ due process of law ” was not meant or intended to include, <em>ex vi </em>termini, the institution and procedure of a grand jury in any case. The conclusion is equally <page-number citation-index="1" label="535">*535</page-number>irresistible, that when the same phrase was employed in the Fourteenth Amendment to restrain the action of the States, it was used in the same sense and with no greater extent; and that if in the adoption of that amendment it had been part of its purpose to perpetuate the institution of the grand jury in all the States, it would have embodied, as did the Fifth Amendment, express declarations to that effect. Due process of law in the latter refers to that law of the land which derives its authority from the legislative powers conferred upon Congress by th§ Constitution of the United States, exercised within the limits therein prescribed, and interpreted according to the principles of the common law. In the Fourteenth Amendment, by parity of reason,- it refers to that law of the land in each State, which derives its authority from the inherent and reserved powers of the State, exerted within the limits of those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions, and the greatest security for which resides in the right of the people to make their own laws, and alter them at their pleasure.</p>
<blockquote id="b561-4">“The Fourteenth Amendment” [as was said by Mr. Justice Bradley in <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>101 U. S. 22-31] “ does not profess to secure to all persons in- the United States the benefit of the same laws and the same remedies. Great diversities in these respects may exist in two States separated only by an imaginary line. On one side of this line there may be a right of trial by -jury, and on the other side no such right. Each State prescribes its own modes of judicial proceeding.”</blockquote>
<p id="b561-5">But it is not to be supposed -that these legislative powers are absolute and despotic, and that-the amendment prescribing due process of law is too vague and indefinite to operate as- a practical restraint. It is not every act, legislative in form, that is law. Law is something more than mere will exerted as an act-of power. It must be not a special rule-for a particular person or a particular case, -but, in the language of Mr. Webster, in his familiar definition, “ the general law, a law which hears- before it condemns, which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial,” so “ that every citizen shall <page-number citation-index="1" label="536">*536</page-number>hold his life, liberty, property and immunities under tha protection of the general rules which govern society,” and thus excluding, as not due process of law, acts of attainder, bills of pains and penalties, acts of confiscation, acts reversing judgments', and acts directly transferring one man’s estate to another, legislative judgments and decrees, and other similar special, partial and arbitrary exertions of power under the forms of legislation. Arbitrary power, enforcing its edicts to the injury of the persons and property .of its subjects, is not law, whether manifested as the decree of a personal monarch or of an impersonal multitude. And the limitations imposed by our constitutional law upon the action of the governments, both State and national, are essential to the preservation of public and private rights, notwithstanding the representative character of our political institutions. The enforcement of these limitations by judicial process is the device of self-governing communities to protect the rights of individuals and minorities, as well against the power of numbers, as against the violence of public agents transcending the limits of lawful authority, even when acting in the name and wielding the force of the government.</p>
<p id="b562-4">The Supreme Court of Mississippi, in a well-considered case, <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Levee Commissioners, </em>50 Miss. 468, speaking of the meaning of the phrase “ due process of law,” says:</p>
<blockquote id="b562-5">“ The principle does not demand that the laws existing at any point of time shall be irrepealable, or'that any forms of remedies shall necessarily continue. It refers to certain fundamental rights which that system of jurisprudence, of which ours is a derivative, has always recognized. If any of these are disregarded in the proceedings by which a person is condemned to the loss of life, liberty, or property, then the deprivation has not been by 4 due process of law.’ ”</blockquote>
<p id="b562-6">This court, speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, in <em>Loan, Association </em>v. <em>Topeka, </em>20 Wall. 655-662, said:</p>
<blockquote id="b562-7"><em>“ </em>It must be conceded that there are such rights in every free government beyond the control of the State. A government <page-number citation-index="1" label="537">*537</page-number>which recognized, no such rights, which held the lives, the liberty, and the property of its citizens subject at all times to the absólute disp.osition and unlimited control of even the most democratic depository of power, is after all but a despotism. It is true it is a despotism of the many, of the majority, if you choose to call it so, blit it is nevertheless a despotism. It may be doubted, if a man is to hold all that he is accustomed to call his own, all in which he has placed his happiness and the security of which is essential to that happiness, under the unlimited dominion of others, whether it is not wiser that this power should be exercised by one man than by many.” . •</blockquote>
<p id="b563-4">It follows that any legal proceeding enforced by public authority, whether sanctioned by age and custom, or newly devised in the discretion of the legislative power, in furtherance of the general public good, which regards and preserves these principles of liberty and justice, must be held to be due process of law.</p>
<p id="b563-5">The Constitution of Connecticut, adopted in 1818 and in force when the Fourteenth Amendment took effect, requires an indictment or presentment of a grand jury only in cases where the punishment of the crime charged is death or imprisonment for life, and yet it also declares that no person shall “ be deprived of life, liberty, or property but by due course of law.” It falls short, therefore, of that measure of protection which it is claimed is guaranteed by Magna Charta to the right of personal liberty; notwithstanding which it is no doubt justly said in Swift’s Digest, 17, that</p>
<blockquote id="b563-6">“ This sacred and inestimable right, without which all others are of little value, is enjoyed by the people of this State in as full extent as in any country on the globe, and in as high a degree as is consistent with the nature of civil government. No individual, or body of men has a discretionary or arbitrary power to commit any person to prison ; no man can be restrained of his liberty, be prevented from removing himself from place to place as he chooses, be compelled to go to a place contrary to his inclination, or be~in any way imprisoned or confined, unless by virtue of the express laws of the land.”</blockquote>
<p id="b564-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="538">*538</page-number>Tried by these principles, we are unable to' say that the substitution for a presentment or indictment by a grand jury of the proceeding by information, after examination and commitment by a magistrate, certifying to the probable guilt of the defendant, with the right on his part to the aid of counsel, and to the cross-examination of the witnesses produced for the prosecution, is not due process of law. It is, as we have seen, an ancient proceeding at common law, which might include every case of an offence of less grade than a felony, except misprision of treason; and in every circumstance of its administration, as authorized by the statute of California, it carefully considers and guards the substantial interest of the prisoner. It is merely a preliminary proceeding, and can result in no final judgment, except as the consequence of a regular judicial trial, conducted precisely as in cases of indictments. -</p>
<p id="b564-4">In reference to this mode of proceeding at the common law, and which he says “is as ancient as the common law itself,” Blackstone adds (4 Com. 305):</p>
<blockquote id="b564-5"><em>“ </em>And as to those offences in which informations were allowed as well as indictments, so long as they were confined to this high and respectable jurisdiction, and were carried on in a legal and regular course in His Majesty’s Court of King’s Bench, the subject had no reason to complain. The same notice was given, the same process was issued, the same pleas were allowed, the same trial by jury was had, the same judgment was: given by the same judges, as if the prosecution had originally been by indictment.”</blockquote>
<p id="b564-6">For these reasons, finding no error therein, the judgment of the Supreme Court of California is <em>Affirmed.</em></p>
