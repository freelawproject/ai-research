Hester v. United States, 265 U. S. 57. Defending the inclusion of a telephone booth in his fist the petitioner cites United States v. Stone, 232 F. Supp. 396, and United States v. Madison, 32 L. W. 2243 (D. C. Ct. Gen. Sess.). Urging that the telephone booth should be excluded, the Government finds support in United States v. Borgese, 235 F. Supp. 286. It is true that this Court has occasionally described its conclusions in terms of “constitutionally protected areas,” see, e. g., Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 510, 512; Lopez v. United States, <targetCase>373 U. S. 427</targetCase>, 438-439; Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, 57, 59, but we have never suggested that this concept can serve as a talismanic solution to every Fourth Amendment problem. Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385. Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257. Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253. See Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 464-466. We do not deal in this case with the law of detention or arrest under the Fourth Amendment. Based upon their previous visual observations of the petitioner, the agents correctly predicted that he would use the telephone booth for several minutes at approximately the same time each morning.

serves to minimize the hazards of the officers’ dangerous calling,” id., at 57-58, these considerations are not rele *356 vant to the problems presented by judicially authorized electronic surveillance. Nor do the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure impose an inflexible requirement of prior notice. Rule 41 (d) does require federal officers to serve upon the person searched a copy of the warrant and a receipt describing the material obtained, but it does not invariably require that this be done before the search takes place. Nordelli v. United States, 24 F. 2d 665, 666-667. Thus the fact that the petitioner in Osborn was unaware that his words were being electronically transcribed did not prevent this Court from sustaining his conviction, and did not prevent the Court in Berger from reaching the conclusion that the use of the recording device sanctioned in Osborn was entirely lawful. 388 U. S. 41, 57. Lopez v. United States, <targetCase>373 U. S. 427</targetCase>, 464 (dissenting opinion of Me. Justice BRENNAN). See, e. g., Jones v. United States, 357 U. S. 493, 497-499; Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253, 261; Chapman v. United States, 365 U. S. 610, 613-615; Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483, 486-487. See, e. g., Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 153, 156; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 454-456; Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 174-177; Cooper v. California, 386 U. S. 58; Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298-300. In Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20, 30, the Court stated: “The right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by which it was committed, as well as weapons and other things to effect an escape from custody, is not to be doubted.” Whatever one’s view of “the long-standing practice of searching for other proofs of guilt within the control of the accused found upon arrest,” United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56, 61; cf. id., at *358 71-79 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter), the concept of an “incidental’’ search cannot readily be extended to include surreptitious surveillance of an individual either immediately before, or immediately after, his arrest. Although “[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others,” Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298-299, there seems little likelihood that electronic surveillance would be a realistic possibility in a situation so fraught with urgency. A search to which an individual consents meets Fourth Amendment requirements, Zap v. United States, 328 U. S. 624, but of course “the usefulness of electronic surveillance depends on lack of notice to the suspect.” Lopez v. United States, <targetCase>373 U. S. 427</targetCase>, 463 (dissenting opinion of MR. Justice BreNNAn). Whether safeguards other than prior authorization by a magistrate would satisfy the Fourth Amendment in a situation involving the national security is a question not presented by this case. See Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323, 330.
