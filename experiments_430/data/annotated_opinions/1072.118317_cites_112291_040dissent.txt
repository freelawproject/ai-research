**Dissenting Opinion**
 Instead, the decision depends on whether Congress had a reasonable basis for concluding that abrogation was necessary to prevent violations that would otherwise occur.  Given the presumption of validity that supports all federal statutes, I believe the Court must shoulder the burden of demonstrating why the judgment of the Congress of the United States should not command our respect.  It has not done so. For these reasons, as well as those expressed by Justice Breyer, I respectfully dissent.  See 28 U. S. C. § 1605 (a)(2) (commercial activity exception to foreign sovereign immunity).  The statute provides the following definition of "commercial activity': "either a regular course of commercial conduct or a particular commercial transaction or act.  The commercial character of an activity shall be determined by reference to the nature of the course of conduct or particular transaction or act, rather than by reference to its purpose.” § 1603(d).  As we held in Pennsylvania, v. Union Gas Co., <citedDecision>491 U. S. 1, 23</citedDecision> (1989), the Commerce Clause granted Congress the power to abrogate the States’ common-law defense of sovereign immunity.  I remain convinced that that case was correctly decided for the reasons stated in the principal and concurring opinions.
