 .  . ").  [26] Id., at 751; see n. 17, supra. [27]  Globe 751 (emphasis added).  Compare this statement with Representative Poland's remark upon which our holding in Monroe was based.  See supra, at 664.  [28]  See, e. g., Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175 (1864); Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535 (1867); Riggs v. Johnson County, 6 Wall. 166 (1868); Weber v. Lee County, 6 Wall. 210 (1868); Supervisors v. Rogers, 7 Wall. 175 (1869); Benbow v. Iowa City, 7 Wall. 313 (1869); Supervisors v. Durant, <citedDecision>9 Wall. 415</citedDecision> (1870).  See generally 6 C. Fairman, History of the Supreme Court of the United States: Reconstruction and Reunion, 1864-1888, ohs.  17-18 (1971).  [29]  See Globe 751-752.  [30]  Others taking a view similar to Representative Blair's included: Representative Willard, see id., at 791; Representative Poland, see id., at 794; Representative Burchard, see id., at 795; Representative Farnsworth, see id., at 799.  Representative Willard also took a somewhat different position: He thought that the Constitution would not allow the Federal Government to dictate the manner in which a State fulfilled its obligation of protection.  That is, he thought it a matter of state discretion whether it delegated the peacekeeping power to a municipal or county corporation, to a sheriff, etc. He did not doubt, however, that the Federal Government could impose on the States the obligation imposed by the Sherman amendment, and presumably he would have enforced the amendment against a municipal corporation to which the peacekeeping obligation had been delegated.
