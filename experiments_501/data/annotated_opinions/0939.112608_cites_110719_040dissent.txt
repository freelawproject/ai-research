**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Marshall joins, dissenting.  At the end of its opinion, the Court pays lipservice to the proposition that should provide the basis for a correct analysis of the legal question presented by this case: It is ‘“a cardinal principle that “searches conducted outside the judicial process, without prior approval by judge or magistrate, are per se unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment — subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.’” Mincey v. Arizona, 437 U. S. 385, 390 (1978), quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 357 (1967) (footnotes omitted).” Ante, at 580.  Relying on arguments that conservative judges have repeatedly rejected in past cases, the Court today — despite its disclaimer to the contrary, ibid.— enlarges the scope of the automobile exception to this “cardinal principle,” which un-dergirded our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence prior to the retirement of the author of the landmark opinion in United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 (1977).  As a preface to my response to the Court’s arguments, it is appropriate to restate the basis for the warrant requirement, the significance of the Chadwick case, and the reasons why the limitations on the automobile exception that were articulated in United States v. Ross, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 798</citedDecision> (1982), represent a fair accom *586 modation between the basic rule requiring prior judicial approval of searches and the automobile exception.  ► — I The Fourth Amendment is a restraint on Executive power.  The Amendment constitutes the Framers’ direct constitutional response to the unreasonable law enforcement practices employed by agents of the British Crown.  See Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 389-391 (1914); Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 624-625 (1886); 1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 3-5 (2d ed. 1987).  Over the years—particularly in the period immediately after World War II and particularly in opinions authored by Justice Jackson after his service as a special prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials — the Court has recognized the importance of this restraint as a bulwark against police practices that prevail in totalitarian regimes.  See, e. g., United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 595 (1948); Johnson v. United States, 333 U. S. 10, 17 (1948).  This history is, however, only part of the explanation for the warrant requirement.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 .  “The breadth of the Court’s opinion and its repeated references to the ‘automobile’ from which respondent’s suitcase was seized at the time of his arrest, however, might lead the reader to believe — as the dissenters apparently do — that this case involves the ‘automobile’ exception to the warrant requirement.  See ante, at 762-765, and n. 14.  It does not.  Here, as in Chadwick , it was the luggage being transported by respondent at *591 the time of the arrest, not the automobile in which it was being carried, that was the suspected locus of the contraband.” 442 U. S., at 766-767 (opinion concurring in judgment).  Chief Justice Burger thus carefully explained that Sanders, which the Court overrules today, “simply d[id] not present the question of whether a warrant is required before opening luggage when the police have probable cause to believe contraband is located someiohere in the vehicle, but when they do not know whether, for example, it is inside a piece of luggage in the trunk, in the glove compartment, or concealed in some part of the car’s structure.” Id., at 767.  We confronted that question in United States v. Ross, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 798</citedDecision> (1982).  6 We held in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> that “the scope of the warrantless search authorized by [the automobile] exception is no broader and no narrower than a magistrate could legitimately authorize by warrant.” See <citedDecision>id., at 825</citedDecision> .  The inherent mobility of the vehicle justified the immediate search without a warrant, but did not affect the scope of the search.  See <citedDecision>id., at 822</citedDecision> .  Thus, the search could encompass containers, which might or might not conceal the object of the search, as well as the remainder of the vehicle.  See <citedDecision>id., at 821</citedDecision> .  Our conclusion was supported not only by prior cases defining the proper scope of searches authorized by warrant, as well as cases involving the automobile exception, but also by practical considerations that apply to searches in which the police have only generalized probable cause to believe that contraband is somewhere in a vehicle.  We explained that, in such instances, “prohibiting police from opening immediately a container in which the object of the search is most likely to be found and instead forcing them first to comb the entire vehicle would actually exacerbate the intrusion on privacy in *592 terests.” <citedDecision>Id., at 821, n. 28</citedDecision> .  Indeed, because “the police could never be certain that the contraband was not secreted in a yet undiscovered portion of the vehicle,” the most likely result would be that “the vehicle would need to be secured while a warrant was obtained.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> These concerns that justified our holding in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> are not implicated in cases like Chadwick and Sanders in which the police have probable cause to search a particular container rather than the entire vehicle.  Because the police can seize the container which is the object of their search, they have no need either to search or to seize the entire vehicle.  Indeed, as even the Court today recognizes, they have no authority to do so. See <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 824</citedDecision> ; ante, at 580.  In reaching our conclusion in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> , we therefore did not retreat at all from the holding in either Chadwick or Sanders.  Instead, we expressly endorsed the reasoning in Chief Justice Burger’s separate opinion in Sanders.  <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 813-814</citedDecision> .  7 We explained repeatedly that <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> involved the scope of the warrantless search authorized by the automobile exception, <citedDecision>id., at 800, 809, 817, 825</citedDecision> , and, unlike Chadwick and Sanders, did not involve the applicability of the exception to closed containers.  <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 809-817</citedDecision> .  Thus, we recognized in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> that Chadwick and Sanders had not created a special rule for container searches, but *593 rather had merely applied the cardinal principle that war-rantless searches are per se unreasonable unless justified by an exception to the general rule.  See <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 811-812</citedDecision> .  8 <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> dealt with the scope of the automobile exception; Chadwick and Sanders were cases in which the exception simply did not apply.  II In its opinion today, the Court recognizes that the police did not have probable cause to search respondent’s vehicle and that a search of anything but the paper bag that respondent had carried from Daza’s apartment and placed in the trunk of his car would have been unconstitutional.  Ante, at 580.  Moreover, as I read the opinion, the Court assumes that the police could not have made a warrantless inspection of the bag before it was placed in the car. See ibid. Finally, the Court also does not question the fact that, under our prior cases, it would have been lawful for the police to seize the container and detain it (and respondent) until they obtained a search warrant.  Ante, at 575.  Thus, all of the relevant facts that governed our decisions in Chadwick and Sanders are present here whereas the relevant fact that justified the vehicle search in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> is not present.  The Court does not attempt to identify any exigent circumstances that would justify its refusal to apply the general rule against warrantless searches.  Instead, it advances these three arguments: First, the rules identified in the foregoing cases are confusing and anomalous.  Ante, at 576-579.  Second, the rules do not protect any significant interest in privacy.  Ante, at 573-576.  And, third, the rules impede effec *594 tive law enforcement.  Ante, at 576-577.  None of these arguments withstands scrutiny.  The “Confusion” In the nine years since <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> was decided, the Court has considered three cases in which the police had probable cause to search a particular container and one in which they had probable cause to search two vehicles.  The decisions in all four of those cases were perfectly straightforward and provide no evidence of confusion in the state or lower federal courts.  In United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983), we held that, although reasonable suspicion justifies the temporary detention of an airline passenger’s luggage, the seizure in that particular case was unreasonable because of the prolonged delay in ascertaining the existence of probable cause.  In the course of our opinion, we noted that the then-recent decision in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> had not modified the holding in Sanders.  462 U. S., at 701, n. 3 .  We also relied on Chadwick for our conclusion that the temporary seizure of luggage is substantially less intrusive than a search of its contents.  462 U. S., at 706-707 .  In Oklahoma v. Castleberry, 471 U. S. 146 (1985), police officers had probable cause to believe the defendant carried narcotics in blue suitcases in the trunk of his car. After arresting him, they opened the trunk, seized the suitcases, and searched them without a warrant.  The state court held that the search was invalid, explaining: “If the officer has probable cause to believe there is contraband somewhere in the car, but he does not know exactly where, he may search the entire car as well as any containers found therein.  See United States v. Ross, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 798</citedDecision> .  .  .  (1982); Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 , .  .  .  (1970); Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 .  .  .  (1925).  If, on the other hand, the officer only has probable cause to believe there is contraband in a *595 specific container in the car, he must detain the container and delay his search until a search warrant is obtained.  See United States v. Ross, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 798</citedDecision> .  .  .  (1982); Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S. 753 .  .  .  (1979); United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1 .  .  .  (1977).” Castleberry v. State, 678 P. 2d 720, 724 (Okla. 1984).  This Court affirmed by an equally divided Court. 471 U. S. 146 (1985).  In the case the Court decides today, the California Court of Appeal also had no difficulty applying the critical distinction.  Relying on Chadwick , it explained that “the officers had probable cause to believe marijuana would be found only in a brown lunch bag and nowhere else in the car. We are compelled to hold they should have obtained a search warrant before opening it.” 216 Cal. App. 3d 586, 592 , 265 Cal. Rptr. 23, 27 (1990).  In the case in which the police had probable cause to search two vehicles, United States v. Johns, 469 U. S. 478 (1985), 9 we rejected the respondent’s reliance on Chadwick with a straightforward explanation of why that case, unlike <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> , did not involve an exception to the warrant requirement.  We first expressed our agreement with the Court of Appeals that the Customs officers who had conducted the search had *596 probable cause to search the vehicles.  Id., at 482.  We then explained: “Under the circumstances of this case, respondents’ reliance on Chadwick is misplaced.  .  .  .  Chadwick .  .  .  did not involve the exception to the warrant requirement recognized in Carroll v. United States, supra, because the police had no probable cause to believe that the automobile, as contrasted to the footlocker, contained contraband.  See 433 U. S., at 11-12 .  This point is underscored by our decision in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> , which held that notwithstanding Chadwick police officers may conduct a warrantless search of containers discovered in the course of a lawful vehicle search.  See <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 810-814</citedDecision> .  Given our conclusion that the Customs officers had probable cause to believe that the pickup trucks contained contraband, Chadwick is simply inapposite.  See <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 817</citedDecision> .” 469 U. S., at 482-483 .  The decided cases thus provide no support for the Court’s concern about “confusion.” The Court instead relies primarily on predictions that were made by Justice Blackmun in his dissenting opinions in Chadwick and Sanders.  10 The Court, however, cites no evidence that these predictions have in fact materialized or that anyone else has been unable to understand the “‘inherent opaqueness,”’ ante, at 579, of this uncomplicated issue.  The only support offered by the Court, other than the unsubstantiated allegations of prior dissents, is three law review comments and a sentence from Professor LaFave’s treatise.  None of the law review pieces *597 criticize the holdings in Chadwick and Sanders.  11 The sentence from Professor LaFave’s treatise, at most, indicates that, as is often the case, there may be some factual situations at the margin of the relevant rules that are difficult to decide.  Moreover, to the extent Professor LaFave criticizes our jurisprudence in this area, he is critical of <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> rather than Chadwick or Sanders.  And he ultimately concludes that even <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> was correctly decided.  See 3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure 55-56 (2d ed. 1987).  The Court summarizes the alleged “anomaly” created by the coexistence of Ross, Chadwick, and Sanders with the statement that “the more likely the police are to discover drugs in a container, the less authority they have to search it.” Ante, at 577.  This juxtaposition is only anomalous, however, if one accepts the flawed premise that the degree to which the police are likely to discover contraband is correlated with their authority to search without a warrant.  Yet, even proof beyond a reasonable doubt will not justify a war-rantless search that is not supported by one of the exceptions to the warrant requirement.  And, even when the police have a warrant or an exception applies, once the police possess probable cause, the extent to which they are more or less certain of the contents of a container has no bearing on their authority to search it.  *598 To the extent there was any “anomaly” in our prior jurisprudence, the Court has “cured” it at the expense of creating a more serious paradox.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The earliest case cited by Chief Justice Burger was Justice Field’s opinion in Ex parte Jackson, 96 U. S. 727, 733 (1878).  “Having probable cause to believe that .contraband was being driven away in the taxi, the police were justified in stopping the vehicle, searching it on the spot, and seizing the suitcase they suspected contained contraband.  See Chambers v. Maroney, [ 399 U. S. 42, 52 (1970)].  At oral argument, respondent conceded that the stopping of the taxi and the seizure of the suitcase were constitutionally unobjectionable.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30, 44-46.” Arkansas v. Sanders, 442 U. S., at 761-762 .  “[B]ecause each exception to the warrant requirement invariably impinges to some extent on the protective purpose of the Fourth Amendment, the few situations in which a search may be conducted in the absence of a warrant have been carefully delineated and ‘the burden is on those *590 seeking the exemption to show the need for it.’ United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48, 51 (1951).” Id., at 759-760.  ’In framing the question for decision we stated: “Unlike Chadwick and Sanders, in this case police officers had probable cause to search respondent’s entire vehicle.” <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 817</citedDecision> .  Moreover, we quoted the following paragraph from Justice Powell’s opinion concurring in the judgment in the intervening case of Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420 (1981): “ ‘[W]hen the police have probable cause to search an automobile, rather than only to search a particular container that fortuitously is located in it, the exigencies that allow the police to search the entire automobile without a warrant support the warrantless search of every container found therein.  See post, at 451, and n. 13 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This analysis is entirely consistent with the holdings in Chadwick and Sanders, neither of which is an ‘automobile case,’ because the police there had probable cause to search the double-locked footlocker and the suitcase respectively before either came near an automobile.’ ” Id., at 435, quoted in United States v. Ross, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 798, 816</citedDecision> (1982).  Although the Court today purports to acknowledge that the warrant requirement is the general rule, ante, at 580, it nonetheless inexplicably persists in referring to Chadwick and Sanders as announcing a “separate rule, unique to luggage and other closed packages, bags, and containers.” Ante, at 571.  Equally inexplicable is the Court’s contention that, in overruling Sanders, it has not “extend[ed] the Carroll doctrine” that created the automobile exception.  Ante, at 580.  In its discussion of the Johns case, the Court makes the puzzling statement that it “cannot see the benefit of a rule that requires law enforcement officers to conduct a more intrusive search in order to justify a less intrusive one.” See ante, at 575.  I assume that the Court does not mean to suggest that evidence found during the course of a search may provide the probable cause that justifies the search.  Our cases have unequivocally rejected this bootstrap justification for a search which was not lawful when it commenced.  See, e. g., United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 595 (1948); Byars v. United States, 273 U. S. 28, 29-30 (1927).  Perhaps the Court fears that defendants will attempt similar post hoc reasoning and argue that, when the police have searched only a container rather than the whole car, they must have had probable cause only to search the container.  If so, the Court’s fear is unwarranted, for Johns itself foreclosed this argument.  See 469 U. S., at 482-483 .  See ante, at 578-579 (referring to the undocumented prediction made by Justice Blackmun, joined by then-JusTiCE Rehnquist, in dissent in Chadwick); ante, at 579 (referring to the fact that the dissenters had “bemoaned the ‘inherent opaqueness’ of the difference between the Carroll and Chadwick principles and noted ‘the confusion to be created for all concerned’ ”).  One of the three pieces, Kamisar, The “Automobile Search” Cases: The Court Does Little to Clarify the “Labyrinth” of Judicial Uncertainty, in 3 The Supreme Court: Trends and Developments 1980-1981 (D. Opperman ed. 1982), was written prior to the decision in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> .  Moreover, rather than criticizing Chadwick and Sanders, the article expressly endorses Justice Brennan’s refutation of the arguments advanced by Justice Black-mun in his dissent in Chadwick .  See Kamisar, supra, at 83-85.  The other two articles were written shortly after <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> , and both criticize <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> rather than Chadwick or Sanders.
