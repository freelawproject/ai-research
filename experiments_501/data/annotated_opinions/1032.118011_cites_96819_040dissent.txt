 I will explain why the *102 Eleventh Amendment did not affect federal-question jurisdiction, a notion that needs to be understood for the light it casts on the soundness of Hans’s holding that States did enjoy sovereign immunity in federal-question suits.  The Hans Court erroneously assumed that a State could plead sovereign immunity against a noncitizen suing under federal-question jurisdiction, and for that reason held that a State must enjoy the same protection in a suit by one of its citizens.  The error of Hans’s reasoning is underscored by its clear inconsistency with the Founders’ hostility to the implicit reception of common-law doctrine as federal law, and with the Founders’ conception of sovereign power as divided between the States and the National Government for the sake of very practical objectives.  The Court’s answer today to the third question is likewise at odds with the Founders’ view that common law, when it was received into the new American legal system, was always subject to legislative amendment.  In ignoring the reasons for this pervasive understanding at the time of the ratification, and in holding that a nontextual common-law rule limits a clear grant of congressional power under Article I, the Court follows a course that has brought it to grief before in our history, and promises to do so again.  Beyond this third question that elicits today’s holding, there is one further issue.  To reach the Court’s result, it must not only hold the Hans doctrine to be outside the reach of Congress, but must also displace the doctrine of Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 123</citedDecision> (1908), that an officer of the government may be ordered prospectively to follow federal law, in cases in which the government may not itself be sued directly.  None of its reasons for displacing Young’s jurisdictional doctrine withstand scrutiny.  A The doctrine of sovereign immunity comprises two distinct rules, which are not always separately recognized.  The one rule holds that the King or the Crown, as the font of law, is *103 not bound by the law’s provisions; the other provides that the King or Crown, as the font of justice, is not subject to suit in its own courts.  See, e. g., Jaffe, Suits Against Governments and Officers: Sovereign Immunity, 77 Harv. L. Rev. 1 , 3-4 (1963).  2 The one rule limits the reach of substantive law; the other, the jurisdiction of the courts.  We are concerned here only with the latter rule, which took its common-law form in the high Middle Ages.

 ... If, on the other hand, the Legislature of the Union, or the Legislature of any member of the Union, shall pass a law, within the general scope of their constitutional power, the Court cannot pronounce it to be void, merely because it is, in their judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice.  The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard: the ablest and the purest men have differed upon the subject; and all that the Court could properly say, in such an event, would be, that the Legislature (possessed of an equal right of opinion) had passed an act which, in the opinion of the judges, was inconsistent with the abstract principles of natural justice.” Id., at 398-399 (emphasis deleted) (opinion dissenting in part).  Later jurisprudence vindicated Justice Iredell’s view, and the idea that “first principles” or concepts of “natural justice” might take precedence over the Constitution or other positive law “all but disappeared in American discourse.” J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 52 (1980).  It should take more than references to “background principle^],” ante, at 72, and “implicit limitation^],” Welch, 483 U. S., at 496 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), to revive the judicial power to overcome clear text unopposed to any other provision, when that clear text is in harmony with an almost equally clear intent on the part of the Framers and the constitutionalists of their generation.  *169 > The Court s holding that the States Hans immunity may not be abrogated by Congress leads to the final question in this case, whether federal-question jurisdiction exists to order prospective relief enforcing IGRA against a state officer, respondent Chiles, who is said to be authorized to take the action required by the federal law. Just as with the issue about authority to order the State as such, this question is entirely jurisdictional, and we need not consider here whether petitioner Seminole Tribe would have a meritorious argument for relief, or how much practical relief the requested order (to bargain in good faith) would actually provide to the Tribe.  Nor, of course, does the issue turn in any way on one’s views about the scope of the Eleventh Amendment or Hans and its doctrine, for we ask whether the state officer is subject to jurisdiction only on the assumption that action directly against the State is barred.  The answer to this question is an easy yes, the officer is subject to suit under the rule in Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 123</citedDecision> (1908), and the case could, and should, readily be decided on this point alone.  A In Ex parte Young, this Court held that a federal court has jurisdiction in a suit against a state officer to enjoin official actions violating federal law, even though the State itself may be immune.  Under Young, “a federal court, consistent with the Eleventh Amendment, may enjoin state officials to conform their future conduct to the requirements of federal law.” Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 337 (1979); see also Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 289 (1977).  The fact, without more, that such suits may have a significant impact on state governments does not count under Young.  Milliken, for example, was a suit, under the authority of Young, brought against Michigan’s Governor, Attorney General, Board of Education, Superintendent of Public In *170 struction, and Treasurer, which resulted in an order obligating the State of Michigan to pay money from its treasury to fund an education plan.  The relief requested (and obtained) by the plaintiffs effectively ran against the State: state moneys were to be removed from the state treasury, and they were to be spent to fund a remedial education program that it would be the State’s obligation to implement.  To take another example, Quern v. Jordan involved a court order requiring state officials to notify welfare beneficiaries of the availability of past benefits.

 In re Ayers, 123 U. S. 443, 502 (1887), sought to rationalize the competing strands of doctrine on the ground that an action may be “sustained only in those instances where the act complained of, considered apart from the official authority alleged as its justification, and as the personal act of the individual defendant, constituted a violation of right for which the plaintiff was entitled to a remedy at law or in equity against the wrongdoer in his individual character.” Ex parte Young restored the old simplicity by complementing In re Ayers with the principle that state officers never have authority to violate the Constitution or federal law, so that any illegal action is stripped of state character and rendered an illegal individual act.  Suits against these officials are consequently barred by neither the Eleventh Amendment nor Hans immunity.  The officer’s action “is simply an illegal act upon the part of a state official in at *174 tempting by the use of the name of the State to enforce a legislative enactment which is void because unconstitutional.  .  .  .  The State has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States.” Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S., at 159-160</citedDecision> .  The decision in Ex parte Young, and the historic doctrine it embodies, thus plays a foundational role in American constitutionalism, and while the doctrine is sometimes called a “fiction,” the long history of its felt necessity shows it to be something much more estimable, as we may see by considering the facts of the case. “Young was really and truly about to damage the interest of plaintiffs.  Whether what he was about to do amounted to a legal injury depended on the authority of his employer, the state.  If the state could constitutionally authorize the act then the loss suffered by plaintiffs was not a wrong for which the law provided a remedy.... If the state could not constitutionally authorize the act then Young was not acting by its authority.” Orth, Judicial Power of the United States, at 133.  The doctrine we call Ex parte Young is nothing short of “indispensable to the establishment of constitutional government and the rule of law.” C. Wright, Law of Federal Courts 292 (4th ed. 1983).  See also Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction, at 393.  A rule of such lineage, engendered by such necessity, should not be easily displaced, if indeed it is displaceable at all, for it marks the frontier of the enforceability of federal law against sometimes competing state policies.

 2 Next, the Court suggests that it may be justified in displacing Young because Young would allow litigants to ignore the “intricate procedures” of IGRA in favor of a menu of streamlined equity rules from which any litigant could order as he saw fit.  But there is no basis in law for this suggestion, and the strongest authority to reject it.  Young did not establish a new cause of action and it does not impose any particular procedural regime in the suits it permits.  It stands, instead, for a jurisdictional rule by which paramount *178 federal law may be enforced in a federal court by substituting a nonimmune party (the state officer) for an immune one (the State itself).  Young does no more and furnishes no authority for the Court’s assumption that it somehow pre-empts procedural rules devised by Congress for particular kinds of cases that may depend on Young for federal jurisdiction.  61 If, indeed, the Court were correct in assuming that Congress may not regulate the procedure of a suit jurisdiction-ally dependent on Young, the consequences would be revolutionary, for example, in habeas law. It is well established that when a habeas corpus petitioner sues a state official alleging detention in violation of federal law and seeking the prospective remedy of release from custody, it is the doctrine identified in Ex parte Young that allows the petitioner to evade the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment (or, more properly, the Hans doctrine).  See Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S., at 167-168</citedDecision> ; Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U. S. 682, 689-690 (1949).  62 And yet Congress has im *179 posed a number of restrictions upon the habeas remedy, see, e. g., 28 U. S. C. § 2254 (b) (requiring exhaustion of state remedies prior to bringing a federal habeas petition), and this Court has articulated several more, see, e. g., McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991) (abuse of the writ); Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989) (limiting applicability of "new rules” on habeas); Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619 (1993) (applying a more deferential harmless-error standard on habeas review).  By suggesting that Ex parte Young provides a free-standing remedy not subject to the restrictions otherwise imposed on federal remedial schemes (such as habeas corpus), the Court suggests that a state prisoner may circumvent these restrictions by ostensibly bringing his suit under Young rather than 28 U. S. C. § 2254 .  The Court’s view implies similar consequences under any number of similarly structured federal statutory schemes.  63 This, of course, tionale for rejecting the Court’s contrary assumption is that Congress has just as much authority to regulate suits when jurisdiction depends on Young as it has to regulate when Young is out of the jurisdictional picture.  If Young does not preclude Congress from requiring state exhaustion in habeas cases (and it clearly does not), then Young does not bar the application of IGRA’s procedures when effective relief is sought by suing a state officer.  3 The Court’s third strand of reasoning for displacing Ex parte Young'is a supposed inference that Congress so in *180 tended.

 The difference from the situation in other States, however, was that Virginia had made its bond coupons receivable in payment of state taxes; “[u]nder these circumstances federal courts did not need to rely on the political branches of government to enforce their orders but could protect creditors by a *122 judgment that their taxes had in fact been paid.  In these cases the Eleventh Amendment faded into the background.” J. Orth, Judicial Power of the United States: The Eleventh Amendment in American History 9 (1987); see generally id., at 90-109.  Second, at the same time that this Court was articulating broad principles of immunity for States, we refused to recognize similar immunity for municipalities and similar state political subdivisions.  See, e. g., Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529 (1890).  Professor Orth suggests that this seeming inconsistency is traceable to the enforcement difficulties arising from the withdrawal of federal troops from the South. “It just so happened,” he points out, “that counties had tended to issue bonds in the West, while in the South, states had usually done the job.  Property in the form of bonds could be defended in the mid-West and West, but similar property in the South had to be sacrificed to the higher politics of the Compromise of 1877.” Orth, supra, at 111.  Finally, Professor Orth attributes this Court’s recognition (or revival) of the Ex parte Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S. 123</citedDecision> (1908), action as a way around state sovereign immunity to the fact that, by 1908, “the problem of repudiated Southern bonds was clearly a specter from an increasingly distant past.” Orth, supra, at 128.  See also Gibbons, supra, at 2002 (arguing that the Court’s unanimous revival of its power to grant equitable relief against state officers in Pennoyer v. McConnaughy, 140 U. S. 1 (1891), was made possible by the fact that'the ease “did not involve Southern State bonds”).  I am reluctant, to be sure, to ascribe these legal developments to a single, extralegal cause, and at least one commentator has suggested that the Southern debt crisis may not have been the only factor driving the Court’s Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence during this period.  See generally Collins, The Conspiracy Theory of the Eleventh Amendment, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 212 (1988) (reviewing Orth).  But neither would I ignore the pattern of the cases, which tends to show that the presence or absence of enforcement difficulties significantly influenced the path of the law in this area.  See id., at 248 (acknowledging that “[i]t is perfectly conceivable that Compromise-related politics exerted their influence at the margin— in doubtful cases in which the Court might have gone either way”).  Today’s majority condemns my attention to Hans’s historical circumstances as “a disservice to the Court’s traditional method of adjudication.” Ante, at 69.

 Otherwise, the existence of those remedial limitations would provide no reason for the Court to assume that Congress did not intend to permit an action under Young; rather, the limitations would apply regardless of whether the suit was brought against the State or a state officer.  See also Brennan v. Stewart, 834 F. 2d 1248, 1252, n. 6 (CA5 1988) (“[A]lthough not usually conceptualized as Ex parte Young eases, most of the huge number of habeas claims in the federal courts under 28 U. S. C. §2254 are effectively suits against the states.  These suits pass muster under the Eleventh Amendment because the habeas theory of a civil suit against the bad jailer fits perfectly with the Ex parte Young fiction”); United States ex rel. Elliott v. Hendricks, 213 F. 2d 922, 926-928 (CA3) (exercising jurisdiction over a habeas suit despite an Eleventh Amendment challenge on the theory that the suit was against a state officer), cert. denied, 348 U. S. 851 (1954).  Many other federal statutes impose obligations on state officials, the enforcement of which is subject to “intricate provisions” also statutorily provided.  See, e. g., Federal Water Pollution Control Act, 33 U. S. C. § 1365 (a) (citizen-suit provision to enforce States’ obligations under federal environmental law); Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act, 42 U. S. C. § 11001 (privately enforceable requirement that States form commissions, appointed by the Governor, to generate plans for addressing hazardous material emergencies).  In order for any person (whether individual or entity) to be a proper defendant under § 2710(d)(7) (and in order for standing to exist, since one of its requirements is redressability), that person, of course, would need to have some connection to the State’s negotiations.  See Young, <citedDecision>209 U. S., at 157</citedDecision> ; Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U. S. 788, 808 (1992).  The obvious candidates are the responsible state officials.  The scope of the Tenth Amendment’s limitations of congressional power remains a subject of debate.  New York v. United States, 505 U. S. 144 (1992), holds that principles of federalism are “violated by a formal command from the National Government directing the State to enact a certain policy.” United States v. Lopez, 514 U. S., at 583 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  Some suggest that the prohibition extends further than barring the Federal Government from directing the creation of state law. The views I express today should not be understood to take a position on that disputed question.  See also The Federalist No. 46, at 319 (J. Madison) (explaining that the Federal Government “will partake sufficiently of the spirit [of the States], to be disinclined to invade the rights of the individual States, or the pre *184 rogatives of their governments”); Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government, 54 Colum. L. Rev. 543 (1954).
