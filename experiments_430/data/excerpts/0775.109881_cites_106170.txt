 Named as defendants in the action were the Department and its Commissioner, the Board and its Chancellor, and the city of New York and its Mayor.  In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.  3 On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held moot petitioners’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief since the city of New York and the Board, after the filing of the complaint, had changed their policies relating to maternity leaves so that no pregnant employee would have to take leave unless she was medically unable to continue to perform her job.  394 F. Supp. 853, 855 (1975).  No one now challenges this conelu *662 sion.  The court did conclude, however, that the acts complained of were unconstitutional under LaFleur, supra. 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  Nonetheless plaintiffs’ prayers for backpay were denied because any such damages would come ultimately from the city of New York and, therefore, to hold otherwise would be to “circumvenft]” the immunity conferred on municipalities by Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 167</citedDecision> (1961).  See 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  On appeal, petitioners renewed their arguments that the Board of Education 4 was not a “municipality” within the meaning of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape, supra,</citedDecision> and that, in any event, the District Court had erred in barring a damages award against the individual defendants.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions.  The court first held that the Board of Education was not a “person” under § 1983 because “it performs a vital governmental function .  .  ., and, significantly, while it has the right to determine how the funds appropriated to it shall be spent ... , it has no final say in deciding what its appropriations shall be.” 532 F. 2d 259, 263 (1976).  The individual defendants, however, were “persons” under § 1983, even when sued solely in their official capacities.  532 F. 2d, at 264 .  Yet, because a damages award would “have to be paid by a city that was held not to be amenable to such an action in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. Pape," a damages action against officials sued in their official capacities could not proceed.  <citedDecision>Id., at 265</citedDecision> .  We granted certiorari in this case, 429 U. S. 1071 , to consider “Whether local governmental officials and/or local independent school boards are 'persons’ within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. § 1983 when equitable relief in the nature of back pay is sought against them in their official capacities?” Pet. for Cert. 8.  *663 Although, after plenary consideration, we have decided the merits of over a score of cases brought under § 1983 in which the principal defendant was a school board 5 — and, indeed, in some of which § 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U. S. C. § 1343 , provided the only basis for jurisdiction 6 — we indicated in Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 279 (1977), last Term that the question presented here was open and would be decided “another day.” That other day has come and we now overrule <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape, supra,</citedDecision> insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under § 1983.  7 *664 I In <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> , we held that “Congress did not undertake to bring municipal corporations within the ambit of [§ 1983].” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 187</citedDecision> .  The sole basis for this conclusion was an inference drawn from Congress’ rejection of the “Sherman amendment” to the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13 , the precursor of § 1983.  The amendment would have held a municipal corporation liable for damage done to the person or property of its inhabitants by private persons “riotously and tumultuously assembled.” 8 Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 749 (1871) (hereinafter Globe).  Although the Sherman amendment did not seek to amend § 1 of the Act, which is now § 1983, and although the nature of the obligation created by that amendment was vastly different from that created by § 1, the Court nonetheless concluded in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> that Congress must have meant to exclude municipal corporations from the coverage of § 1 because “ 'the House [in voting against the Sherman amendment] had solemnly decided that in their judgment Congress had no constitutional power to impose any obligation upon county and town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the administration of state law.’ ” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 190</citedDecision> (emphasis added), quoting Globe 804 (Rep. Poland).  This statement, we thought, showed that Congress doubted its “constitutional power .  .  .  to impose civil liability on municipalities,” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 190</citedDecision> (emphasis added), and that such doubt would have extended to any type of civil liability.  9 *665 A fresh analysis of the debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and particularly of the case law which each side mustered in its support, shows, however, that <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> incorrectly equated the “obligation” of which Representative Poland spoke with “civil liability.” A. An Overview There are three distinct stages in the legislative consideration of the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  On March 28, 1871, Representative Shellabarger, acting for a House select committee, reported H. R. 320, a bill “to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes.” H. R. 320 contained four sections.  Section 1, now codified as 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , was the subject of only limited debate and was passed without amendment.  10 Sections 2 through 4 dealt primarily with the “other purpose” of suppressing Ku Klux Klan violence in the Southern States.  11 The wisdom and constitutionality of these sections — not § 1, now § 1983 — were the subject of almost all congressional debate and each of these sections was amended.  The House finished its initial debates on H. R. 320 on April 7, 1871, and one week later the Senate also voted out a bill.  12 Again, debate on § 1 of the bill was limited and that section was passed as introduced.

 If a municipality were liable, the judgment against it could be collected “by execution, attachment, mandamus, garnishment, or any other proceeding in aid of execution or applicable to the enforcement of judgments against municipal corporations; and such judgment [would become] a lien as well upon all moneys in the treasury of such county, city, or parish, as upon the other property thereof.” In the ensuing debate on the first conference report, which was the first debate of any kind on the Sherman amendment, Senator Sherman explained that the purpose of his amendment was to enlist the aid of persons of property in the enforcement of the civil rights laws by making their property “responsible” for Ku Klux Klan damage.  16 Statutes drafted on a similar theory, he stated, had long been in force in England and were in force in 1871 in a number of States.  17 *668 Nonetheless there were critical differences between the conference substitute and extant state and English statutes: The conference substitute, unlike most state riot statutes, lacked a short statute of limitations and imposed liability on the government defendant whether or not it had notice of the impending riot, whether or not the municipality was authorized to exercise a police power, whether or not it exerted all reasonable efforts to stop the riot, and whether or not the rioters were caught and punished.  18 The first conference substitute passed the Senate but was rejected by the House.  House opponents, within whose ranks were some who had supported § 1, thought the Federal Government could not, consistent with the Constitution, obligate municipal corporations to keep the peace if those corporations were neither so obligated nor so authorized by their state charters.  And, because of this constitutional objection, opponents of the Sherman amendment were unwilling to impose damages liability for nonperformance of a duty which Congress could not require municipalities to perform.  This position is reflected in Representative Poland's statement that is quoted in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> .  19 Because the House rejected the first conference report a second conference was called and it duly issued its report.  The second conference substitute for the Sherman amendment abandoned municipal liability and, instead, made “any per *669 son or persons having knowledge [that a conspiracy to violate civil rights was afoot], and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the same,” who did not attempt to stop the same, liable to any person injured by the conspiracy.  20 The amendment in this form was adopted by both Houses of Congress and is now codified as 42 U. S. C. § 1986 .  The meaning of the legislative history sketched above can most readily be developed by first considering the debate on the report of the first conference committee.  This debate shows conclusively that the constitutional objections raised against the Sherman amendment — on which our holding in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> was based, see supra, at 664 — would not have prohibited congressional creation of a civil remedy against state municipal corporations that infringed federal rights.  Because § 1 of the Civil Rights Act does not state expressly that municipal corporations come within its ambit, it is finally necessary to interpret § 1 to confirm that such corporations were indeed intended to be included within the “persons” to whom that section applies.  B. Debate on the First Conference Report The style of argument adopted by both proponents and opponents of the Sherman amendment in both Houses of Congress was largely legal, with frequent references to cases decided by this Court and the Supreme Courts of the several States.  Proponents of the Sherman amendment did not, however, discuss in detail the argument in favor of its constitutionality.  Nonetheless, it is possible to piece together such an argument from the debates on the first conference report and those on § 2 of the civil rights bill, which, because it allowed the Federal Government to prosecute crimes “in the States,” had also raised questions of federal power.  The account of Representative Shellabarger, the House sponsor of H. R. 320, is the most complete.  *670 Shellabarger began his discussion of H. R. 320 by stating that “there is a domain of constitutional law involved in the right consideration of this measure which is wholly unexplored.” Globe App. 67.

 Simply because the power to tax involves the power to destroy, and it was not the intent to give the Government of the United States power to destroy the government of the States in any respect.  It was held also in the case of Prigg vs. Pennsylvania [ 16 Pet. 539 (1842)] that it is not within the power of the Congress of the United States to lay duties upon a State officer; that we cannot command a State officer to do any duty whatever, as such; and I ask .  .  .  the difference between that and commanding a municipality, which is equally the creature of the State, to perform a duty.” Globe 795.  Any attempt to impute a unitary constitutional theory to opponents of the Sherman amendment is, of course, fraught *676 with difficulties, not the least of which is that most Members of Congress did not speak to the issue of the constitutionality of the amendment.  Nonetheless, two considerations lead us to conclude that opponents of the Sherman amendment found it unconstitutional substantially because of the reasons stated by Representative Blair: First, Blair’s analysis is precisely that of Poland, whose views were quoted as authoritative in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , see supra, at 664, and that analysis was shared in large part by all House opponents who addressed the constitutionality of the Sherman amendment.  31 Second, Blair’s exegesis of the reigning constitutional theory of his day, as we shall explain, was clearly supported by precedent — albeit precedent that has not survived, see Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 347-348 (1880); Graves v. New York ex rel. O’Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 486 (1939) — and no other constitutional formula was advanced by participants in the House debates.  Collector v. Day , cited by Blair, was the clearest and, at the time of the debates, the most recent pronouncement of a doctrine of coordinate sovereignty that, as Blair stated, placed limits on even the enumerated powers of the National Government in favor of protecting state prerogatives.  There, the Court held that the United States could not tax the income of Day, a Massachusetts state judge, because the independence of the States within their legitimate spheres would be imperiled if the instrumentalities through which States executed their powers were "subject to the control of another and distinct government.” 11 Wall., at 127 .  Although the Court in Day apparently rested this holding in part on the proposition that the taxing "power acknowledges no limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the tax,” id., at 125-126 ; cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), the Court had in other cases limited other national powers in order to avoid interference with the States.  32 *677 In Prigg v. Pennsylvania , for example, Mr. Justice Story, in addition to confirming a broad national power to legislate under the Fugitive Slave Clause, see supra, at 672, held that Congress could not “insist that states .  .

 Mr. Chief Justice Taney, writing for a unanimous Court, refused to enforce that section of the Act: “[W]e think it clear, that the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it; for if it possessed this power, it might overload the officer with duties which would fill up' all his time, and disable him from performing his obligations to the State, and might impose on him duties of a character incompatible with the rank and dignity to which he was elevated by the State.” 24 How., at 107-108.  The rationale of Dennison — that the Nation could not impose duties on state officers since that might impede States in their legitimate activities — is obviously identical to that which animated the decision in Collector v. Day .  See supra, at 676.  And, as Blair indicated, municipalities as instrumen-talities through which States executed their policies could be equally disabled from carrying out state policies if they were also obligated to carry out federally imposed duties.  Although no one cited Dennison by name, the principle for which it *679 stands was well known to Members of Congress, 36 many of whom discussed Day 37 as well as a series of State Supreme Court cases 38 in the mid-1860’s which had invalidated a federal tax on the process of state courts on the ground that the tax threatened the independence of a vital state function.  39 Thus, there was ample support for Blair’s view that the Sherman amendment, by putting municipalities to the Hobson’s choice of keeping the peace or paying civil damages, attempted to impose obligations on municipalities by indirection that could not be imposed directly, thereby threatening to “destroy the government of the States.” Globe 795.  If municipal liability under § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 created a similar Hobson’s choice, we might conclude, as <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> did, that Congress could not have intended municipalities to be among the “persons” to which that section applied.  But this is not the case. Hirst, opponents expressly distinguished between imposing an obligation to keep the peace and merely imposing civil liability for damages on a municipality that was obligated by state law to keep the peace, but which had not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Representative Poland, for example, reasoning from Contract Clause precedents, indicated that Congress could constitutionally confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to entertain suits seeking to hold municipalities *680 liable for using their authorized powers in violation of the Constitution — which is as far as § 1 of the Civil Nights Act went: “I presume .  .  .  that where a State had imposed a duty [to keep the peace] upon [a] municipality ... an action would be allowed to be maintained against them in the courts of the United States under the ordinary restrictions as to jurisdiction.  But the enforcing a liability, existing by their own contract, or by a State law, in the courts, is a very widely different thing from devolving a new duty or liability upon them by the national Government, which has no power either to create or destroy them, and no power or control over them whatever.” Globe 794.

 government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.  Since this case unquestionably involves official policy as the moving force of the constitutional violation found by the District Court, see supra, at *695 660-662, and n. 2, we must reverse the judgment below.  In so doing, we have no occasion to address, and do not address, what the full contours of municipal liability under § 1983 may be.  We have attempted only to sketch so much of the § 1983 cause of action against a local government as is apparent from the history of the 1871 Act and our prior cases, and we expressly leave further development of this action to another day. Ill Although we have stated that stare decisis has more force in statutory analysis than in constitutional adjudication because, in the former situation, Congress can correct our mistakes through legislation, see, e. g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 671 , and n. 14 (1974), we have never applied stare decisis mechanically to prohibit overruling our earlier decisions determining the meaning of statutes.  See, e. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47-49 (1977); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 , 406 n. 1 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  Nor is this a case where we should “place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court’s own error.” Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).  First, <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> , insofar as it completely immunizes municipalities from suit under § 1983, was a departure from prior practice.  See, e. g., Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, 18 F. Cas. 393 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873); City of Manchester v. Leiby, 117 F. 2d 661 (CA1 1941); Hannan v. City of Haverhill, 120 F. 2d 87 (CA1 1941); Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157 (1943); Holmes v. Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 (1955), in each of which municipalities were defendants in § 1983 suits.  59 Moreover, the constitutional de- *696 feet that led to the rejection of the Sherman amendment would not have distinguished between municipalities and school boards, each of which is an instrumentality of state administration.  See supra, at 673-682.  For this reason, our cases — decided both before and after <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , see n. 5, supra— holding school boards liable in § 1983 actions are inconsistent with <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , especially as Monroe’s, immunizing principle was extended to suits for injunctive relief in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507 (1973).  60 And although in many of these cases jurisdiction was not questioned, we ought not “disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years.” Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962); see Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, at 88 (Marshall, C. J.) (“Those decisions are not cited as authority .  .  .  but they have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench”).  Thus, while we have reaffirmed <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> without further examination on three occasions, 61 it can scarcely be said that <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> is so consistent with the warp and woof of civil rights law as to be beyond question.  Second, the principle of blanket immunity established in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> cannot be cabined short of school boards.  Yet such an extension would itself be inconsistent with recent expressions of congressional intent.  In the wake of our decisions, Congress not only has shown no hostility to federal-court decisions against school boards, but it has indeed rejected efforts to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over school boards.  62 Moreover, recognizing that school boards are often *697 defendants in school desegregation suits, which have almost without exception been § 1983 suits, Congress has twice passed legislation authorizing grants to school boards to assist them in complying with federal-court decrees.  63 Finally, in *698 regard to the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641 , 42 U. S. C. § 1988 (1976 ed.), which allows prevailing parties (in the discretion of the court) in § 1983 suits *699 to obtain attorney’s fees from the losing parties, the Senate stated: “[Defendants in these cases are often State or local bodies or State or local officials.  In such cases it is intended that the attorneys’ fees, like other items of costs, will be collected either directly from the official, in his official capacity, from funds of his agency or under his control, or from the State or local government (whether or not the agency or government is a named party).” S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).  Far from showing that Congress has relied on <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , therefore, events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> to school boards and has attempted to allow awards of attorney’s fees against local governments even though Monroe, City of Kenosha v. Bruno , and Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible.  64 Third, municipalities can assert no reliance claim which can *700 support an absolute immunity.  As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , “[t]his is not an area of commercial law in which, presumably, individuals may have arranged their affairs in reliance on the expected stability of decision.” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 221-222</citedDecision> (dissenting in part).  Indeed, municipalities simply cannot “arrange their affairs” on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely since injunctive suits against local officials under § 1983 would prohibit any such arrangement.  And it scarcely need be mentioned that nothing in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> encourages municipalities to violate constitutional rights or even suggests that such violations are anything other than completely wrong.  Finally, even under the most stringent test for the propriety of overruling a statutory decision proposed by Mr. Justice Harlan in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> 65 — “that it appear beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [Monroe] misapprehended the meaning of the [section],” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> (concurring opinion) — the overruling of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> insofar as it holds that local governments are not “persons” who may be defendants in § 1983 suits is clearly proper.  It is simply beyond doubt that, under the 1871 Congress’ view of the law, were § 1983 liability unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state officers.  Yet everyone — proponents and opponents alike — knew § 1983 would be applied to state officers and nonetheless stated that § 1983 was constitutional.  See supra, at 680-682.  And, moreover, there can be no doubt that § 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected *701 rights.  Therefore, absent a clear statement in the legislative history supporting the conclusion that § 1 was not to apply to the official acts of a municipal corporation — which simply is not present — there is no justification for excluding municipalities from the “persons” covered by § 1.  For the reasons stated above, therefore, we hold that stare decisis does not bar our overruling of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> insofar as it is inconsistent with Parts I and II of this opinion.  66 IV Since the question whether local government bodies should be afforded some form of official immunity was not presented as a question to be decided on this petition and was not briefed by the parties or addressed by the courts below, we express no views on the scope of any municipal immunity beyond holding that municipal bodies sued under § 1983 cannot be entitled to an absolute immunity, lest our decision that such bodies are subject to suit under § 1983 “be drained of meaning,” Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 248 (1974).  Cf. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 397-398 (1971).  *702 y For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT As proposed, the Sherman amendment was as follows: “That if any house, tenement, cabin, shop, building, barn, or granary shall be unlawfully or feloniously demolished, pulled down, burned, or destroyed, wholly or in part, by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together; or if any person shall unlawfully and with force and violence be whipped, scourged, wounded, or killed by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together; and if such offense was committed to deprive any person of any right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude, in every such case the inhabitants of the county, city, or parish in which any of the said offenses shall be committed shall be liable to pay full compensation to the person or persons damnified by such offense if living, or to his widow or legal representative if dead; and such compensation may be recovered by such person or his representative by a suit in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in the district in which the offense was committed, to be in the name of the person injured, or his legal representative, and against said county, city, or parish.  And execution may be issued on a judgment rendered in such suit and may be levied upon any property, real or personal, of any person in said county, city, or parish, and the said county, city, or parish may recover the full amount of such judgment, costs and interest, *703 from any person or persons engaged as principal or accessory in such, riot in an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.” Globe 663.  The complete text of the first conference substitute for the Sherman amendment is: “That if any house, tenement, cabin, shop, building, barn, or granary shall be unlawfully or feloniously demolished, pulled down, burned, or destroyed, wholly or in part, by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together; or if any person shall unlawfully and with force and violence be whipped, scourged, wounded, or killed by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together, with intent to deprive any person of any right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude, in every such case the county, city, or parish in which any of the said offenses shall be committed shall be liable to pay full compensation to the person or persons damnified by such offense, if living, or to his widow or legal representative if dead; and such compensation may be recovered in an action on the case by such person or his representative in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in the district in which the offense was committed, such action to be in the name of the person injured, or his legal representative, and against said county, city, or parish, and in which action any of the parties committing such acts may be joined as defendants.

However, we do uphold Monroe v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> insofar as it holds that the doctrine of respondeat superior is not a basis for rendering municipalities *664 liable under § 1983 for the constitutional torts of their employees.  See Part II, infra.  We expressly declined to consider “policy considerations” for or against municipal liability.  See 365 U. S., at 191.  Mr. Justice Douglas, the author of Monroe, has suggested that the municipal exclusion might more properly rest on a theory that Congress sought to prevent the financial ruin that civil rights liability might impose on municipalities.  See City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507, 517-520 *665 (1973).  However, this view has never been shared by the Court, see Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 190</citedDecision> ; Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 708 (1973), and the debates do not support this position.  Globe 522.  Briefly, § 2 created certain federal crimes in addition to those defined in § 2 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, 14 Stat. 27 , each aimed primarily at the Ku Klux Klan.  Section 3 provided that the President could send the militia into any State wracked with Klan violence.  Finally, § 4 provided for suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in enumerated circumstances, again primarily those thought to obtain where Klan violence was rampant.  See Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 335-336 (1871) (hereinafter Globe App.).  Globe 709.

Pool); Globe App. 182 (Rep. Mercur).  Other supporters were quite clear that § 1 of the Act extended a remedy not only where a State had passed an unconstitutional statute, but also *686 where officers of the State were deliberately indifferent to the rights of black citizens: “But the chief complaint is .  .  .  [that] by a systematic maladministration of [state law], or a neglect or refusal to enforce their provisions, a portion of the people are denied equal protection under them.  Whenever such a state of facts is clearly made out, I believe [§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment] empowers Congress to step in and provide for doing justice to those persons who are thus denied equal protection.” Id., at 153 (Rep. Garfield).  See also Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 171-187</citedDecision> .  Importantly for our inquiry, even the opponents of § 1 agreed that it was constitutional and, further, that it swept very broadly.  Thus, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of § 1, said: “This section relates wholly to civil suits.  ... Its whole effect is to give to the Federal Judiciary that which now does not belong to it — a jurisdiction that may be constitutionally conferred upon it, I grant, but that has never yet been conferred upon it.  It authorizes any person who is deprived of any right, privilege, or immunity secured to him by the Constitution of the United States, to bring an action against the wrong-doer in the Federal courts, and that without any limit whatsoever as to the amount in controversy.  .  .
**Concurrence Opinion**
Me. Justice Powell, concurring.  I join the opinion of the Court, and express these additional views.  New cases in the history of the Court have been cited more frequently than Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 167</citedDecision> (1961), decided less than two decades ago.  Focusing new light on 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , that decision widened access to the federal courts and permitted expansive interpretations of the reach of *705 the 1871 measure.  But <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> exempted local governments from liability at the same time it opened wide the courthouse door to suits against officers and employees of those entities— even when they act pursuant to express authorization.  The oddness of this result, and the weakness of the historical evidence relied on by the <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> Court in support of it, are well demonstrated by the Court’s opinion today.  Yet the gravity of overruling a part of so important a decision prompts me to write.  I In addressing a complaint alleging unconstitutional police conduct that probably was unauthorized and actionable under state law, 1 the <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> Court treated the 42d Congress’ rejection of the Sherman amendment as conclusive evidence of an intention to immunize local governments from all liability under the statute for constitutional injury.  That reading, in light of today’s thorough canvass of the legislative history, clearly “misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision,” <citedDecision>Monroe, supra, at 192</citedDecision> (Harlan, J., concurring).  In this case, involving formal, written policies of the Department of Social Services and the Board of Education of the city of New York that are alleged to conflict *706 with the command of the Due Process Clause, cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U. S. 632 (1974), the Court decides “not to reject [wisdom] merely because it comes late,” Henslee v. Union Planters Bank, 335 U. S. 595, 600 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  As the Court demonstrates, the Sherman amendment presented an extreme example of “riot act” legislation that sought to impose vicarious liability on government subdivisions for the consequences of private lawlessness.  As such, it implicated concerns that are of marginal pertinence to the operative principle of § 1 of the 1871 legislation — now § 1983 — that “any person” acting “under color of” state law may be held liable for affirmative conduct that “subjects, or causes to be subjected, any person ... to the deprivation of any” federal constitutional or statutory right.  Of the many reasons for the defeat of the Sherman proposal, none supports Monroe’s observation that the 42d Congress was fundamentally “antagonistic,” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 191</citedDecision> , to the proposition that government entities and natural persons alike should be held accountable for the consequences of conduct directly working a constitutional violation.  Opponents in the Senate appear to have been troubled primarily by the proposal’s unprecedented lien provision, which would have exposed even property held for public purposes to the demands of § 1983 judgment lienors.  Ante, at 673-674, n. 30.  The opposition in the House of Representatives focused largely on the Sherman amendment’s attempt to impose a peacekeeping obligation on municipalities when the Constitution itself imposed no such affirmative duty and when many municipalities were not even empowered under state law to maintain police forces.  Ante, at 673-675, 679-682.  2 *707 The Court correctly rejects a view of the legislative history that would produce the anomalous result of immunizing local government units from monetary liability for action directly causing a constitutional deprivation, even though such actions may be fully consistent with, and thus not remediable under, state law. No conduct of government comes more clearly within the “under color of” state law language of § 1983.  It is most unlikely that Congress intended public officials acting under the command or the specific authorization of the government employer to be exclusively liable for resulting constitutional injury.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 “Stare decisis is usually the wise policy,” Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting), but this cautionary principle must give way to countervailing considerations in appropriate circumstances.  4 I concur in the Court’s view that this is not a case where we should “place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court’s own error.” Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).  Nor is this the usual case in which the Court is asked to overrule a precedent.  Here considerations of stare decisis cut in both directions.  On the one hand, we have a series of rulings that municipalities and counties are not “persons” for purposes of § 1983.  On the other hand, many decisions of this Court have been premised on the amenability of school boards and similar entities to § 1983 suits.  In <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> and its progeny, we have answered a question that was never actually briefed or argued in this Court— whether a municipality is liable in damages for injuries that are the direct result of its official policies.  “The theory of the complaint [in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> was] that under the circumstances [t]here alleged the City [was] liable for the acts of its police officers, by virtue of respondeat superior.” Brief for Petition *709 ers, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 21.  5 Respondents answered that adoption of petitioners’ position would expose “Chicago and every other municipality in the United States ... to Civil Rights Act liability through no action of its own and based on action contrary to its own ordinances and the laws of the state it is a part of.” Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 26.  Thus the ground of decision in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> was not advanced by either party and was broader than necessary to resolve the contentions made in that case. 6 *710 Similarly, in Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973), petitioners asserted that “the County was vicariously liable for the acts of its deputies and sheriff,” id., at 696 , under 42 U. S. C. § 1988 .  In rejecting this vicarious-liability claim, 411 U. S., at 710 , and n. 27, we reaffirmed Monroe’s reading of the statute, but there was no challenge in that case to “the holding in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> concerning the status under § 1983 of public entities such as the County,” 411 U. S., at 700 ; Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1972, No. 72-10, p. 9.  Only in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 607 (1973), did the Court confront a § 1983 claim based on conduct that was both authorized under state law and the direct cause of the claimed constitutional injury.  In Kenosha, however, we raised the issue of the city’s amenability to suit under § 1983 on our own initiative.  7 This line of cases — from <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> to Kenosha — is difficult to reconcile on a principled basis with a parallel series of cases *711 in which the Court has assumed sub silentio that some local government entities could be sued under § 1983.  If now, after full consideration of the question, we continued to adhere to <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , grave doubt would be cast upon the Court’s exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction over school boards.  See ante, at 663 n. 5.  Since “the principle of blanket immunity established in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> cannot be cabined short of school boards,” ante, at 696, the conflict is squarely presented.  Although there was an independent basis of jurisdiction in many of the school board cases because of the inclusion of individual public officials as nominal parties, the opinions of this Court make explicit reference to the school board party, particularly in discussions of the relief to be awarded, see, e. g., Green v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430, 437-439, 441-442 (1968); Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 292-293 (1977) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  And, as the Court points out, ante, at 696-697, and nn. 62, 63, Congress has focused specifically on this Court’s school board decisions in several statutes.  Thus the exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction over school boards, while perhaps not premised on considered holdings, has been longstanding.  Indeed, it predated <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> .  Even if one attempts to explain away the school board decisions as involving suits which “may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either § 1983 or Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908),” post, at 716-717, n. 2, some difficulty remains in rationalizing the relevant body of precedents.  At least two of the school board cases involved claims for monetary relief.  Cohen v. Chesterfield County School Board, 326 F. Supp. 1159, 1161 (ED Va. 1971), rev’d, 474 F. 2d 395 (CA4 1973), rev’d and remanded, 414 U. S. 632 (1974); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 504 (1969).  See also Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U. S. 441, 445 (1973).  Although the point was not squarely presented in this Court, these claims *712 for damages could not have been maintained in official-capacity suits if the government entity were not itself suable.  Cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974).
**Concurrence Opinion**
 In light of the Court’s persuasive re-examination in today’s decision of the 1871 debates, I would have difficulty inferring from § 1983 “an explicit congressional declaration” against municipal liability for the implementation of official policies in violation of the Constitution.  Rather than consti-tutionalize a cause of action against local government that Congress intended to create in 1871, the better course is to confess error and set the record straight, as the Court does today.  9 Ill Difficult questions nevertheless remain for another day. There are substantial line-drawing problems in determining “when execution of a government’s policy or custom” can be said to inflict constitutional injury such that “government as an entity is responsible under § 1983.” Ante, at 694.  This case, however, involves formal, written policies of a municipal department and school board; it is the clear case. The Court also reserves decision on the availability of a qualified municipal immunity.  Ante, at 701.  Initial resolution of the question whether the protection available at common law for municipal corporations, see post, at 720-721, or other principles support a *714 qualified municipal immunity in the context of the § 1983 damages action, is left to the lower federal courts.  The gravamen of the complaint in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> was that Chicago police officers acting “under color of” state law had conducted a warrantless, early morning raid and ransacking of a private home.  Although at least one of the allegations in the complaint could have been construed to charge a custom or usage of the Police Department of the city of Chicago that did not violate state law, see <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 258-259</citedDecision> (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in part), and there is a hint of such a theory in Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1960, No. 39, pp. 41-42, that feature of the case was not highlighted in this Court. The dispute that divided the Court was over whether a complaint alleging police misconduct in violation of state law, for which state judicial remedies were available, stated a § 1983 claim in light of the statutory requirement that the conduct working injury be “under color of” state law. Compare <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 172-183</citedDecision> (opinion of the Court), and <citedDecision>id., at 193-202</citedDecision> (Harlan, J., concurring), with <citedDecision>id., at 202-259</citedDecision> (Frankfurter, J., dissenting in part).  If in the view of House opponents, such as Representatives Poland, Burchard, and Willard, see ante, at 679-680, a municipality obligated by state law to keep the peace could be held liable for a failure to provide equal protection against private violence, it seems improbable that they would have opposed imposition of liability on a municipality for the *707 affirmative implementation of policies promulgated within its proper sphere of operation under state law. Such liability is premised not on a failure to take affirmative action in an area outside the contemplation of the state-law charter — the sort of liability that would have been imposed by the Sherman amendment — but on the consequences of activities actually undertaken within the scope of the powers conferred by state law. The view taken today is consistent with the understanding of the 42d Congress that unless the context revealed a more limited definition, “the word ‘person’ may extend and be applied to bodies politic and corporate Act of Feb. 25, 1871, §2, 16 Stat. 431 .  It also accords with the interpretation given the same word when it was used by Senator Sherman in the antitrust legislation of 1890 bearing his name.  See Lafayette v. Louisiana Power & Light Co., 435 U. S. 389 (1978) (plurality opinion); Chattanooga Foundry v. Atlanta, 203 U. S. 390, 396 (1906); cf. Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U. S. 308 (1978).  See, e. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36 (1977); Machinists v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Comm’n, 427 U. S. 132 (1976); Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Ky., 410 U. S. 484 (1973); Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U. S. 88 (1971); Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks, 398 U. S. 235 (1970); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406-407, n. 1 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting).  The District Court in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> ruled in the municipality’s favor, stating: “[S]inee the liability of the City of Chicago is based on the doctrine of res-pondeat superior, and since I have already held that the complaint fails to state a claim for relief against the agents of the city, there is no claim for relief against the city itself.” Record, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 30.  The Court of Appeals affirmed for the same reason.  272 F. 2d 365 -366 (CA7 1959).  Petitioners in this Court also offered an alternative argument that the city of Chicago was a “person” for purposes of § 1983, Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 25, but the underlying theory of municipal liability remained one of respondeat superior.  The doctrine of stare decisis advances two important values of a rational system of law: (i) the certainty of legal principles and (ii) the wisdom of the conservative vision that existing rules should be presumed rational and not subject to modification “at any time a new thought seems appealing,” dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice RehNquist, post, at 718; of.  O. Holmes, The Common Law 36 (1881).  But, at the same time, the law has recognized the necessity of change, lest rules “simply persis[t] from blind imitation of the past.” Holmes, The Path of the Law, 10 Harv. L. Rev. 457 , 469 (1897).
**Concurrence Opinion**
 But I think we owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations.  That is the premise of the canon of interpretation that language in a decision not necessary to the holding may be accorded less weight in subsequent cases. I also would recognize - the fact that until this case the Court has not had to confront squarely the consequences of holding § 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies.  Of course, the mere fact that an issue was not argued or briefed does not undermine the precedential force of a considered holding.  Marbury *710 v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), cited by the dissent, post, at 718, is a case in point.  But the Court’s recognition of its power to invalidate legislation not in conformity with constitutional command was essential to its judgment in Marbury .  And on numerous subsequent occasions, the Court has been required to apply the full breadth of the Marbury holding.  In <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , on the other hand, the Court’s rationale was broader than necessary to meet the contentions of the parties and to decide the case in a principled manner.  The language in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> cannot be dismissed as dicta, but we may take account of the fact that the Court simply was not confronted with the implications of holding § 1983 inapplicable to official municipal policies.  It is an appreciation of those implications that has prompted today’s re-examination of the legislative history of the 1871 measure.  In Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1, 16 (1976), we reaffirmed <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , but petitioner did not contest the proposition that counties were excluded from the reach of § 1983 under <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , and the question before us concerned the scope of pendent-party jurisdiction with respect to a state-law claim.  Similarly, the parties in Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274 (1977), did not seek a re-examination of our ruling in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> .  To the extent that the complaints in those cases asserted claims against the individual defendants in their personal capacity, as well as official capacity, the court would have had authority to award the relief requested.  There is no suggestion in the opinions, however, that the practices at issue were anything other than official, duly authorized policies.  Mr. Justice RehNquist’s dissent makes a strong argument that “[s]ince <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , municipalities have had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers’ failure to predict this Court’s recognition of new constitutional rights.” Post, at 717.  But it reasonably may be assumed that most municipalities already indemnify officials sued for conduct within the scope of their authority, a policy that furthers the important interest of attracting and retaining competent officers, board members, and employees.  In any event, the possibility of a qualified immunity, as to which the Court reserves decision, may remove some of the harshness of liability for good-faith failure to predict the often uncertain course of constitutional adjudication.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with whom The Chief Justice joins, dissenting.  Seventeen years ago, in Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 167</citedDecision> (1961), this Court held that the 42d Congress did not intend to subject a municipal corporation to liability as a “person” within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. § 1983 .  Since then, the Congress has remained silent, but this Court has reaffirmed that holding on at least three separate occasions.  Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976); City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507 (1973); Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973).  See also Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 277-279 (1977).  Today, the Court abandons this long and consistent line of precedents, offering in justification only an elaborate canvass of the same legislative history which was before the Court in 1961.  Because I cannot agree that this Court is “free to disregard these precedents,” which have been “considered maturely and recently” by this Court, Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 186 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring), I am compelled to dissent.  I As this Court has repeatedly recognized, id., at 175 n. 12; Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 , 671 n. 14 (1974), considerations of stare decisis are at their strongest when this Court confronts its previous constructions of legislation.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 .  .  .  This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation.  But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.” Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406-407 (1932) (dissenting opinion) (footnotes omitted).  Only the most compelling circumstances can justify this Court’s abandonment of such firmly established statutory precedents.  The best exposition of the proper burden of persuasion was delivered by Mr. Justice Harlan in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> itself: “From my point of view, the policy of stare decisis, as it should be applied in matters of statutory construction, and, to a lesser extent, the indications of congressional acceptance of this Court’s earlier interpretation, require that it appear beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [United States v.] Classic, [ 313 U. S. 299 (1941)] and Screws [v. United States, 325 U. S. 91 (1945)] misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision, before a departure from what was decided in those cases would be justified.” <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> (concurring opinion) (footnote omitted; emphasis added).  The Court does not demonstrate that any exception to this general rule is properly applicable here.  The Court’s first assertion, that <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> “was a departure from prior practice,” ante, at 695, is patently erroneous.  Neither in Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157 (1943), nor in Holmes v. Atlanta, *716 350 U. S. 879 (1955), nor in any of the school board cases cited by the Court, ante, at 663 n. 5, was the question now before us raised by any of th'e litigants or addressed by this Court. As recently as four Terms ago, we said in Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528 , 535 n. 5 (1974): “Moreover, when questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions sub silentio, this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us.” The source of this doctrine that jurisdictional issues decided sub silentio are not binding in other cases seems to be Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's remark in United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805).  1 While the Chief Justice also said that such decisions may “have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench,” Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (1809), unconsidered assumptions of jurisdiction simply cannot outweigh four consistent decisions of this Court, explicitly considering and rejecting that jurisdiction.  Nor is there any indication that any later Congress has ever approved suit against any municipal corporation under § 1983.  Of all its recent enactments, only the Civil Rights Attorney’s Fees Awards Act of 1976, § 2, 90 Stat. 2641 , 42 U. S. C. § 1988 (1976 ed.), explicitly deals with the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  2 The 1976 Act provides that attorney’s fees may be awarded *717 to the prevailing party “[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title.” There is plainly no language in the 1976 Act which would enlarge the parties suable under those substantive sections; it simply provides that parties who are already suable may be made liable for attorney’s fees.  As the Court admits, ante, at 699, the language in the Senate Report stating that liability may be imposed “whether or not the agency or government is a named party,” S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976), suggests that Congress did not view its purpose as being in any way inconsistent with the well-known holding of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> .  The Court’s assertion that municipalities have no right to act “on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely,” ante, at 700, is simply beside the point.  Since <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , municipalities have had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers’ failure to predict this Court’s recognition of new constitutional rights.  No doubt innumerable municipal insurance policies and indemnity ordinances have been founded on this assumption, which is wholly justifiable under established principles of stare decisis.  To obliterate those legitimate expectations without more compelling justifications than those advanced by the Court is a significant departure from our prior practice.  I cannot agree with Mr. Justice Powell’s view that “[w]e owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations.” Ante, at 709 n. 6.  Private parties must be able to rely upon explicitly stated holdings of this Court without being *718 obliged to peruse the briefs of the litigants to predict the likelihood that this Court might change its mind.  To cast such doubt upon each of our cases, from Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), forward, in-which the explicit ground of decision "was never actually briefed or argued,” ante, at 708 (Powell, J., concurring), would introduce intolerable uncertainty into the law. Indeed, in Marbury itself, the argument of Charles Lee on behalf of the applicants — which, unlike the arguments in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , is reproduced in the Reports of this Court where anyone can see it — devotes not a word to the question of whether this Court has the power to invalidate a statute duly enacted by the Congress.  Neither this ground of decision nor any other was advanced by Secretary of State Madison, who evidently made no appearance.  1 Cranch, at 153-154 .  More recent landmark decisions of this Court would appear to be likewise vulnerable under my Brother Powell’s analysis.  In Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), none of the parties requested the Court to overrule Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949); it did so only at the request of an amicus curiae.  367 U. S., at 646 n. 3.  That Marbury, Mapp, and countless other decisions retain their vitality despite their obvious flaws is a necessary byproduct of the adversary system, in which both judges and the general public rely upon litigants to present “all the relevant considerations.” Ante, at 709 n. 6 (Powell, J., concurring).  While it undoubtedly has more latitude in the field of constitutional interpretation, this Court is surely not free to abandon settled statutory interpretation at any time a new thought seems appealing.  3 Thus, our only task is to discern the intent of the 42d Congress.  That intent was first expounded in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , and it *719 has been followed consistently ever since.  This is not some esoteric branch of the law in which congressional silence might reasonably be equated with congressional indifference.  Indeed, this very year, the Senate has been holding hearings on a bill, S. 35, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), which would remove the municipal immunity recognized by <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> .  124 Cong. Rec. D117 (daily ed. Feb. 8, 1978).  In these circumstances, it cannot be disputed that established principles of stare decisis require this Court to pay the highest degree of deference to its prior holdings.  <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> may not be overruled unless it has been demonstrated “beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [Monroe] misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision.” Monroe, <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> (Harlan, J., concurring).  The Court must show not only that Congress, in rejecting the Sherman amendment, concluded that municipal liability was not unconstitutional, but also that, in enacting § 1, it intended to impose that liability.  I am satisfied that no such showing has been made.  II Any analysis of the meaning of the word “person” in § 1983, which was originally enacted as § 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13 , must begin, not with the Sherman amendment, but with the Dictionary Act.  The latter Act, which supplied rules of construction for all legislation, provided: “That in all acts hereafter passed .  .  .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 .  .” Act of Feb. 25, 1871, § 2, 16 Stat. 431 .  The Act expressly provided that corporations need not be included within the scope of the word “person” where the coñ-text suggests a more limited reach.  Not a word in the legislative history of the Act gives any indication of the contexts *720 in which Congress felt it appropriate to include a corporation as a person.  Indeed, the chief cause of concern was that the Act’s provision that “words importing the masculine gender may be applied to females,” might lead to an inadvertent extension of the suffrage to women.  Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 777 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Sawyer).  There are other factors, however, which suggest that the Congress which enacted § 1983 may well have intended the word “person” “to be used in a more limited sense,” as <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> concluded.  It is true that this Court had held that both commercial corporations, Louisville R. Co. v. Letson, 2 How. 497, 558 (1844), and municipal corporations, Cowles v. Mercer County, 7 Wall. 118, 121 (1869), were “citizens” of a State within the meaning of the jurisdictional provisions of Art. III. Congress, however, also knew that this label did not apply in all contexts, since this Court, in Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168 (1869), had held commercial corporations not to be “citizens” within the meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U. S. Const., Art. IV, § 2.  Thus, the Congress surely knew that, for constitutional purposes, corporations generally enjoyed a different status in different contexts.  Indeed, it may be presumed that Congress intended that a corporation should enjoy the same status under the Ku Klux Klan Act as it did under the Fourteenth Amendment, since it had been assured that § 1 “was so very simple and really reenact [ed] the Constitution.” Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 569 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Edmunds).  At the time § 1983 was enacted the only federal case to consider the status of corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment had concluded, with impeccable logic, that a corporation was neither a “citizen” nor a “person.” Insurance Co. v. New Orleans, 13 F. Cas. 67 (No. 7,052) (CC La. 1870).  Furthermore, the state courts did not speak with a single voice with regard to the tort liability of municipal corporations.  Although many Members of Congress represented *721 States which had retained absolute municipal tort immunity, see, e. g., Irvine v. Town of Greenwood, 89 S. C. 511, 72 S. E. 228 (1911) (collecting earlier cases), other States had adopted the currently predominant distinction imposing liability for proprietary acts, see generally 2 F. Harper & F. James, Law of Torts § 29.6 (1956), as early as 1842, Bailey v. Mayor of City of New York, 3 Hill 531 (N. Y. 1842).
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The Court is probably correct that the rejection of the Sherman amendment does not lead ineluctably to the conclusion that Congress intended municipalities to be immune from liability under all circumstances.  Nevertheless, it cannot be *723 denied that the debate on that amendment, the only explicit consideration of municipal tort liability, sheds considerable light on the Congress’ understanding of the status of municipal corporations in that context.  Opponents of the amendment were well aware that municipalities had been subjected to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in the context of suits to enforce their contracts, Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 789 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Kerr), but they expressed their skepticism that such jurisdiction should be exercised in cases sounding in tort: “Suppose a judgment obtained under this section, and no property can be found to levy upon except the courthouse, can we levy on the court-house and sell it?  So this section provides, and that too in an action of tort, in an action ex delicto, where the county has never entered into any contract, where the State has never authorized the county to assume any liability of the sort or imposed any liability upon it.  It is in my opinion simply absurd.” Id., at 799 (remarks of Rep. Farnsworth).  Whatever the merits of the constitutional arguments raised against it, the fact remains that Congress rejected the concept of municipal tort liability on the only occasion in which the question was explicitly presented.  Admittedly this fact is not conclusive as to whether Congress intended § 1 to embrace a municipal corporation within the meaning of “person,” and thus the reasoning of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> on this point is subject to challenge.  The meaning of § 1 of the Act of 1871 has been subjected in this case to a more searching and careful analysis than it was in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , and it may well be that on the basis of this closer analysis of the legislative debates a conclusion contrary to the <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> holding could have been reached when that case was decided 17 years ago.  But the rejection of the Sherman amendment remains instructive in that here alone did the legislative debates squarely focus on the liability of municipal corporations, and that liability was rejected.  *724 Any inference which might be drawn from the Dictionary Act or from general expressions of benevolence in the debate on § 1 that the word “person” was intended to include municipal corporations falls far short of showing “beyond doubt” that this Court in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> “misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision.” Errors such as the Court may have fallen into in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> do not end the inquiry as to stare decisis; they merely begin it.  I would adhere to the holding of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> as to the liability of a municipal corporation under § 1983.  Ill The decision in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> was the fountainhead of the torrent of civil rights litigation of the last 17 years.  Using § 1983 as a vehicle, the courts have articulated new and previously unforeseeable interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment.  At the same time, the doctrine of municipal immunity enunciated in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> has protected municipalities and their limited treasuries from the consequences of their officials’ failure to predict the course of this Court’s constitutional jurisprudence.  None of the Members of this Court can foresee the practical consequences of today’s removal of that protection.  Only the Congress, which has the benefit of the advice of every segment of this diverse Nation, is equipped to consider the results of such a drastic change in the law. It seems all but inevitable that it will find it necessary to do so after today’s decision.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  As we pointed out in Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 278-279 (1977), the existence of a claim for relief under § 1983 is “jurisdictional” for purposes of invoking 28 U. S. C. § 1343 , even though the existence of a meritorious constitutional claim is not similarly required in order to invoke jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1331 .  See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946).  The other statutes cited by the Court, ante, at 697-699, n. 63, make no mention of § 1983, but refer generally to suits against “a local educational agency.” As noted by the Court of Appeals, 532 F. 2d 259, 264-266 , such suits may be maintained against board members in their official capacities *717 for injunctive relief under either § 1983 or Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908).  Congress did not stop to consider the technically proper avenue of relief, but merely responded to the fact that relief was being granted.  The practical result of choosing the avenue suggested by petitioners would be the subjection of school corporations to liability in damages.  Nothing in recent congressional history even remotely supports such a result.  I find it somewhat ironic that, in abandoning the supposedly ill-considered holding of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , my Brother Powell relies heavily upon cases involving school boards, although he admits that “the exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction .  .  .  [was] perhaps not premised on considered holdings.” Ante, at 711.  It has not been generally thought, before today, that § 1983 provided an avenue of relief from unconstitutional takings.  Those federal courts which have granted compensation against state and local governments have resorted to an implied right of action under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Richmond Elks Hall Assn. v. Richmond Redevelopment Agency, 561 F. 2d 1327 (CA9 1977), aff’g 389 F. Supp. 486 (ND Cal. 1975); Foster v. Detroit, 405 F. 2d 138, 140 (CA6 1968).  Since the Court today abandons the holding of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> chiefly on the strength of Bingham's arguments, it is indeed anomalous that § 1983 will provide relief only when a local government, not the State itself, seizes private property.  See ante, at 690 n. 54; Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 452 (1976); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 674-677 (1974).
**Combined Opinion**
 Named as defendants in the action were the Department and its Commissioner, the Board and its Chancellor, and the city of New York and its Mayor.  In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.  [3] On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held moot petitioners' claims for injunctive and declaratory relief since the city of New York and the Board, after the filing of the complaint, had changed their policies relating to maternity leaves so that no pregnant employee would have to take leave unless she was medically unable to continue to perform her job.  394 F. Supp. 853, 855 (1975).  No one now challenges this conclusion.  *662 The court did conclude, however, that the acts complained of were unconstitutional under LaFleur, supra. 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  Nonetheless plaintiffs' prayers for backpay were denied because any such damages would come ultimately from the city of New York and, therefore, to hold otherwise would be to "circumven[t]" the immunity conferred on municipalities by Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 167</citedDecision> (1961).  See 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  On appeal, petitioners renewed their arguments that the Board of Education [4] was not a "municipality" within the meaning of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape, supra</citedDecision> , and that, in any event, the District Court had erred in barring a damages award against the individual defendants.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions.  The court first held that the Board of Education was not a "person" under § 1983 because "it performs a vital governmental function .  .  ., and, significantly, while it has the right to determine how the funds appropriated to it shall be spent .  .  ., it has no final say in deciding what its appropriations shall be." 532 F. 2d 259, 263 (1976).  The individual defendants, however, were "persons" under § 1983, even when sued solely in their official capacities.  532 F. 2d, at 264 .  Yet, because a damages award would "have to be paid by a city that was held not to be amenable to such an action in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> , " a damages action against officials sued in their official capacities could not proceed.  <citedDecision>Id., at 265</citedDecision> .  We granted certiorari in this case, 429 U. S. 1071 , to consider "Whether local governmental officials and/or local independent school boards are `persons' within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. § 1983 when equitable relief in the nature of back pay is sought against them in their official capacities?" Pet. for Cert. 8.  *663 Although, after plenary consideration, we have decided the merits of over a score of cases brought under § 1983 in which the principal defendant was a school board [5] and, indeed, in some of which § 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U. S. C. § 1343 , provided the only basis for jurisdiction [6] we indicated in Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 279 (1977), last Term that the question presented here was open and would be decided "another day." That other day has come and we now overrule <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape, supra</citedDecision> , insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under § 1983.  [7] *664 I In <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> , we held that "Congress did not undertake to bring municipal corporations within the ambit of [§ 1983]." <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 187</citedDecision> .  The sole basis for this conclusion was an inference drawn from Congress' rejection of the "Sherman amendment" to the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13 , the precursor of § 1983.  The amendment would have held a municipal corporation liable for damage done to the person or property of its inhabitants by private persons "riotously and tumultuously assembled." [8] Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 749 (1871) (hereinafter Globe).  Although the Sherman amendment did not seek to amend § 1 of the Act, which is now § 1983, and although the nature of the obligation created by that amendment was vastly different from that created by § 1, the Court nonetheless concluded in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> that Congress must have meant to exclude municipal corporations from the coverage of § 1 because "`the House [in voting against the Sherman amendment] had solemnly decided that in their judgment Congress had no constitutional power to impose any obligation upon county and town organizations, the mere instrumentality for the administration of state law.'" <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 190</citedDecision> (emphasis added), quoting Globe 804 (Rep. Poland).  This statement, we thought, showed that Congress doubted its "constitutional power .  .  .  to impose civil liability on municipalities," <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 190</citedDecision> (emphasis added), and that such doubt would have extended to any type of civil liability.  [9] *665 A fresh analysis of the debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1871, and particularly of the case law which each side mustered in its support, shows, however, that <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> incorrectly equated the "obligation" of which Representative Poland spoke with "civil liability." A. An Overview There are three distinct stages in the legislative consideration of the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  On March 28, 1871, Representative Shellabarger, acting for a House select committee, reported H. R. 320, a bill "to enforce the provisions of the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and for other purposes." H. R. 320 contained four sections.  Section 1, now codified as 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , was the subject of only limited debate and was passed without amendment.  [10] Sections 2 through 4 dealt primarily with the "other purpose" of suppressing Ku Klux Klan violence in the Southern States.  [11] The wisdom and constitutionality of these sectionsnot § 1, now § 1983were the subject of almost all congressional debate and each of these sections was amended.
**Combined Opinion**
In the ensuing debate on the first conference report, which was the first debate of any kind on the Sherman amendment, Senator Sherman explained that the purpose of his amendment was to enlist the aid of persons of property in the enforcement of the civil rights laws by making their property "responsible" for Ku Klux Klan damage.  [16] Statutes drafted on a similar theory, he stated, had long been in force in England and were in force in 1871 in a number of States.  [17] *668 Nonetheless there were critical differences between the conference substitute and extant state and English statutes: The conference substitute, unlike most state riot statutes, lacked a short statute of limitations and imposed liability on the government defendant whether or not it had notice of the impending riot, whether or not the municipality was authorized to exercise a police power, whether or not it exerted all reasonable efforts to stop the riot, and whether or not the rioters were caught and punished.  [18] The first conference substitute passed the Senate but was rejected by the House.  House opponents, within whose ranks were some who had supported § 1, thought the Federal Government could not, consistent with the Constitution, obligate municipal corporations to keep the peace if those corporations were neither so obligated nor so authorized by their state charters.  And, because of this constitutional objection, opponents of the Sherman amendment were unwilling to impose damages liability for nonperformance of a duty which Congress could not require municipalities to perform.  This position is reflected in Representative Poland's statement that is quoted in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> .  [19] Because the House rejected the first conference report a second conference was called and it duly issued its report.  The second conference substitute for the Sherman amendment abandoned municipal liability and, instead, made "any person *669 or persons having knowledge [that a conspiracy to violate civil rights was afoot], and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the same," who did not attempt to stop the same, liable to any person injured by the conspiracy.  [20] The amendment in this form was adopted by both Houses of Congress and is now codified as 42 U. S. C. § 1986 .  The meaning of the legislative history sketched above can most readily be developed by first considering the debate on the report of the first conference committee.  This debate shows conclusively that the constitutional objections raised against the Sherman amendmenton which our holding in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> was based, see supra, at 664would not have prohibited congressional creation of a civil remedy against state municipal corporations that infringed federal rights.  Because § 1 of the Civil Rights Act does not state expressly that municipal corporations come within its ambit, it is finally necessary to interpret § 1 to confirm that such corporations were indeed intended to be included within the "persons" to whom that section applies.  B. Debate on the First Conference Report The style of argument adopted by both proponents and opponents of the Sherman amendment in both Houses of Congress was largely legal, with frequent references to cases decided by this Court and the Supreme Courts of the several States.  Proponents of the Sherman amendment did not, however, discuss in detail the argument in favor of its constitutionality.  Nonetheless, it is possible to piece together such an argument from the debates on the first conference report and those on § 2 of the civil rights bill, which, because it allowed the Federal Government to prosecute crimes "in the States," had also raised questions of federal power.  The account of Representative Shellabarger, the House sponsor of H. R. 320, is the most complete.  *670 Shellabarger began his discussion of H. R. 320 by stating that "there is a domain of constitutional law involved in the right consideration of this measure which is wholly unexplored."
**Combined Opinion**
 It was held also in the case of Prigg vs. Pennsylvania [ 16 Pet. 539 (1842)] that it is not within the power of the Congress of the United States to lay duties upon a State officer; that we cannot command a State officer to do any duty whatever, as such; and I ask .  .  .  the difference between that and commanding a municipality, which is equally the creature of the State, to perform a duty." Globe 795.  Any attempt to impute a unitary constitutional theory to opponents of the Sherman amendment is, of course, fraught *676 with difficulties, not the least of which is that most Members of Congress did not speak to the issue of the constitutionality of the amendment.  Nonetheless, two considerations lead us to conclude that opponents of the Sherman amendment found it unconstitutional substantially because of the reasons stated by Representative Blair: First, Blair's analysis is precisely that of Poland, whose views were quoted as authoritative in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , see supra, at 664, and that analysis was shared in large part by all House opponents who addressed the constitutionality of the Sherman amendment.  [31] Second, Blair's exegesis of the reigning constitutional theory of his day, as we shall explain, was clearly supported by precedentalbeit precedent that has not survived, see Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 347-348 (1880); Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 486 (1939)and no other constitutional formula was advanced by participants in the House debates.  Collector v. Day , cited by Blair, was the clearest and, at the time of the debates, the most recent pronouncement of a doctrine of coordinate sovereignty that, as Blair stated, placed limits on even the enumerated powers of the National Government in favor of protecting state prerogatives.  There, the Court held that the United States could not tax the income of Day, a Massachusetts state judge, because the independence of the States within their legitimate spheres would be imperiled if the instrumentalities through which States executed their powers were "subject to the control of another and distinct government." 11 Wall., at 127 .  Although the Court in Day apparently rested this holding in part on the proposition that the taxing "power acknowledges no limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the tax," id., at 125-126 ; cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), the Court had in other cases limited other national powers in order to avoid interference with the States.  [32] *677 In Prigg v. Pennsylvania , for example, Mr. Justice Story, in addition to confirming a broad national power to legislate under the Fugitive Slave Clause, see supra, at 672, held that Congress could not "insist that states .
**Combined Opinion**
 The rationale of Dennison that the Nation could not impose duties on state officers since that might impede States in their legitimate activitiesis obviously identical to that which animated the decision in Collector v. Day .  See supra, at 676.  And, as Blair indicated, municipalities as instrumentalities through which States executed their policies could be equally disabled from carrying out state policies if they were also obligated to carry out federally imposed duties.  Although no one cited Dennison by name, the principle for which it *679 stands was well known to Members of Congress, [36] many of whom discussed Day [37] as well as a series of State Supreme Court cases [38] in the mid-1860's which had invalidated a federal tax on the process of state courts on the ground that the tax threatened the independence of a vital state function.  [39] Thus, there was ample support for Blair's view that the Sherman amendment, by putting municipalities to the Hobson's choice of keeping the peace or paying civil damages, attempted to impose obligations on municipalities by indirection that could not be imposed directly, thereby threatening to "destroy the government of the States." Globe 795.  If municipal liability under § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 created a similar Hobson's choice, we might conclude, as <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> did, that Congress could not have intended municipalities to be among the "persons" to which that section applied.  But this is not the case. First, opponents expressly distinguished between imposing an obligation to keep the peace and merely imposing civil liability for damages on a municipality that was obligated by state law to keep the peace, but which had not in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Representative Poland, for example, reasoning from Contract Clause precedents, indicated that Congress could constitutionally confer jurisdiction on the federal courts to entertain suits seeking to hold municipalities *680 liable for using their authorized powers in violation of the Constitutionwhich is as far as § 1 of the Civil Rights Act went: "I presume .  .  .  that where a State had imposed a duty [to keep the peace] upon [a] municipality .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 Since this case unquestionably involves official policy as the moving force of the constitutional violation found by the District Court, see supra, at *695 660-662, and n. 2, we must reverse the judgment below.  In so doing, we have no occasion to address, and do not address, what the full contours of municipal liability under § 1983 may be.  We have attempted only to sketch so much of the § 1983 cause of action against a local government as is apparent from the history of the 1871 Act and our prior cases, and we expressly leave further development of this action to another day. III Although we have stated that stare decisis has more force in statutory analysis than in constitutional adjudication because, in the former situation, Congress can correct our mistakes through legislation, see, e. g., Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 671 , and n. 14 (1974), we have never applied stare decisis mechanically to prohibit overruling our earlier decisions determining the meaning of statutes.  See, e. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47-49 (1977); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 , 406 n. 1 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  Nor is this a case where we should "place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court's own error." Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).  First, <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> , insofar as it completely immunizes municipalities from suit under § 1983, was a departure from prior practice.  See, e. g., Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, 18 F. Cas. 393 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873); City of Manchester v. Leiby, 117 F. 2d 661 (CA1 1941); Hannan v. City of Haverhill, 120 F. 2d 87 (CA1 1941); Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157 (1943); Holmes v. Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 (1955), in each of which municipalities were defendants in § 1983 suits.  [59] Moreover, the constitutional defect *696 that led to the rejection of the Sherman amendment would not have distinguished between municipalities and school boards, each of which is an instrumentality of state administration.  See supra, at 673-682.  For this reason, our casesdecided both before and after <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , see n. 5, supra  holding school boards liable in § 1983 actions are inconsistent with <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , especially as Monroe's immunizing principle was extended to suits for injunctive relief in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507 (1973).  [60] And although in many of these cases jurisdiction was not questioned, we ought not "disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years." Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962); see Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, at 88 (Marshall, C. J.) ("Those decisions are not cited as authority .  .  .  but they have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench").  Thus, while we have reaffirmed <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> without further examination on three occasions, [61] it can scarcely be said that <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> is so consistent with the warp and woof of civil rights law as to be beyond question.  Second, the principle of blanket immunity established in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> cannot be cabined short of school boards.  Yet such an extension would itself be inconsistent with recent expressions of congressional intent.  In the wake of our decisions, Congress not only has shown no hostility to federal-court decisions against school boards, but it has indeed rejected efforts to strip the federal courts of jurisdiction over school boards.  [62] Moreover, recognizing that school boards are often *697 defendants in school desegregation suits, which have almost without exception been § 1983 suits, Congress has twice passed legislation authorizing grants to school boards to assist them in complying with federal-court decrees.  [63] Finally, in *698 regard to the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, 90 Stat. 2641 , 42 U. S. C. § 1988 (1976 ed.), which allows prevailing parties (in the discretion of the court) in § 1983 suits *699 to obtain attorney's fees from the losing parties, the Senate stated: "[D]efendants in these cases are often State or local bodies or State or local officials.  In such cases it is intended that the attorneys' fees, like other items of costs, will be collected either directly from the official, in his official capacity, from funds of his agency or under his control, or from the State or local government (whether or not the agency or government is a named party)." S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976) (emphasis added; footnotes omitted).  Far from showing that Congress has relied on <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , therefore, events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> to school boards and has attempted to allow awards of attorney's fees against local governments even though Monroe, City of Kenosha v. Bruno , and Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible.  [64] Third, municipalities can assert no reliance claim which can *700 support an absolute immunity.  As Mr. Justice Frankfurter said in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , "[t]his is not an area of commercial law in which, presumably, individuals may have arranged their affairs in reliance on the expected stability of decision." <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 221-222</citedDecision> (dissenting in part).  Indeed, municipalities simply cannot "arrange their affairs" on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely since injunctive suits against local officials under § 1983 would prohibit any such arrangement.  And it scarcely need be mentioned that nothing in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> encourages municipalities to violate constitutional rights or even suggests that such violations are anything other than completely wrong.  Finally, even under the most stringent test for the propriety of overruling a statutory decision proposed by Mr. Justice Harlan in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> [65] "that it appear beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [Monroe] misapprehended the meaning of the [section]," <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> (concurring opinion)the overruling of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> insofar as it holds that local governments are not "persons" who may be defendants in § 1983 suits is clearly proper.  It is simply beyond doubt that, under the 1871 Congress' view of the law, were § 1983 liability unconstitutional as to local governments, it would have been equally unconstitutional as to state officers.  Yet everyoneproponents and opponents alikeknew § 1983 would be applied to state officers and nonetheless stated that § 1983 was constitutional.  See supra, at 680-682.  And, moreover, there can be no doubt that § 1 of the Civil Rights Act was intended to provide a remedy, to be broadly construed, against all forms of official violation of federally protected *701 rights.  Therefore, absent a clear statement in the legislative history supporting the conclusion that § 1 was not to apply to the official acts of a municipal corporationwhich simply is not presentthere is no justification for excluding municipalities from the "persons" covered by § 1.  For the reasons stated above, therefore, we hold that stare decisis does not bar our overruling of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> insofar as it is inconsistent with Parts I and II of this opinion.  [66] IV Since the question whether local government bodies should be afforded some form of official immunity was not presented as a question to be decided on this petition and was not briefed by the parties or addressed by the courts below, we express no views on the scope of any municipal immunity beyond holding that municipal bodies sued under § 1983 cannot be entitled to an absolute immunity, lest our decision that such bodies are subject to suit under § 1983 "be drained of meaning," Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U. S. 232, 248 (1974).  Cf. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U. S. 388, 397-398 (1971).  *702 V For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT As proposed, the Sherman amendment was as follows: "That if any house, tenement, cabin, shop, building, barn, or granary shall be unlawfully or feloniously demolished, pulled down, burned, or destroyed, wholly or in part, by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together; or if any person shall unlawfully and with force and violence be whipped, scourged, wounded, or killed by any persons riotously and tumultuously assembled together; and if such offense was committed to deprive any person of any right conferred upon him by the Constitution and laws of the United States, or to deter him or punish him for exercising such right, or by reason of his race, color, or previous condition of servitude, in every such case the inhabitants of the county, city, or parish in which any of the said offenses shall be committed shall be liable to pay full compensation to the person or persons damnified by such offense if living, or to his widow or legal representative if dead; and such compensation may be recovered by such person or his representative by a suit in any court of the United States of competent jurisdiction in the district in which the offense was committed, to be in the name of the person injured, or his legal representative, and against said county, city, or parish.  And execution may be issued on a judgment rendered in such suit and may be levied upon any property, real or personal, of any person in said county, city, or parish, and the said county, city, or parish may recover the full amount of such judgment, costs and interest, *703 from any person or persons engaged as principal or accessory in such riot in an action in any court of competent jurisdiction." Globe 663.
**Combined Opinion**
 And such county, city, or parish, so paying, shall also be subrogated to all the plaintiff's rights under such judgment." Id., at 749, 755.  The relevant text of the second conference substitute for the Sherman amendment is as follows: "[A]ny person or persons having knowledge that any of the wrongs conspired to be done and mentioned in the second section of this act are about to be committed, and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the same, shall neglect or refuse so to do, and such wrongful act shall be committed, such person or persons shall be liable to the person injured, or his legal representatives." Id., at 804 (emphasis added).  MR. JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.  I join the opinion of the Court, and express these additional views.  Few cases in the history of the Court have been cited more frequently than Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 167</citedDecision> (1961), decided less than two decades ago.  Focusing new light on 42 U. S. C. § 1983 , that decision widened access to the federal courts and permitted expansive interpretations of the reach of *705 the 1871 measure.  But <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> exempted local governments from liability at the same time it opened wide the courthouse door to suits against officers and employees of those entitieseven when they act pursuant to express authorization.  The oddness of this result, and the weakness of the historical evidence relied on by the <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> Court in support of it, are well demonstrated by the Court's opinion today.  Yet the gravity of overruling a part of so important a decision prompts me to write.  I In addressing a complaint alleging unconstitutional police conduct that probably was unauthorized and actionable under state law, [1] the <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> Court treated the 42d Congress' rejection of the Sherman amendment as conclusive evidence of an intention to immunize local governments from all liability under the statute for constitutional injury.  That reading, in light of today's thorough canvass of the legislative history, clearly "misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision," <citedDecision>Monroe, supra, at 192</citedDecision> (Harlan, J., concurring).  In this case, involving formal, written policies of the Department of Social Services and the Board of Education of the city of New York that are alleged to conflict *706 with the command of the Due Process Clause, cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U. S. 632 (1974), the Court decides "not to reject [wisdom] merely because it comes late," Henslee v. Union Planters Bank, 335 U. S. 595, 600 (1949) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  As the Court demonstrates, the Sherman amendment presented an extreme example of "riot act" legislation that sought to impose vicarious liability on government subdivisions for the consequences of private lawlessness.  As such, it implicated concerns that are of marginal pertinence to the operative principle of § 1 of the 1871 legislationnow § 1983that "any person" acting "under color of" state law may be held liable for affirmative conduct that "subjects, or causes to be subjected, any person .  .  .  to the deprivation of any" federal constitutional or statutory right.  Of the many reasons for the defeat of the Sherman proposal, none supports <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> 's observation that the 42d Congress was fundamentally "antagonistic," <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 191</citedDecision> , to the proposition that government entities and natural persons alike should be held accountable for the consequences of conduct directly working a constitutional violation.  Opponents in the Senate appear to have been troubled primarily by the proposal's unprecedented lien provision, which would have exposed even property held for public purposes to the demands of § 1983 judgment lienors.  Ante, at 673-674, n. 30.  The opposition in the House of Representatives focused largely on the Sherman amendment's attempt to impose a peacekeeping obligation on municipalities when the Constitution itself imposed no such affirmative duty and when many municipalities were not even empowered under state law to maintain police forces.  Ante, at 673-675, 679-682.  [2] *707 The Court correctly rejects a view of the legislative history that would produce the anomalous result of immunizing local government units from monetary liability for action directly causing a constitutional deprivation, even though such actions may be fully consistent with, and thus not remediable under, state law. No conduct of government comes more clearly within the "under color of" state law language of § 1983.  It is most unlikely that Congress intended public officials acting under the command or the specific authorization of the government employer to be exclusively liable for resulting constitutional injury.
**Combined Opinion**
 [4] I concur in the Court's view that this is not a case where we should "place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court's own error." Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).  Nor is this the usual case in which the Court is asked to overrule a precedent.  Here considerations of stare decisis cut in both directions.  On the one hand, we have a series of rulings that municipalities and counties are not "persons" for purposes of § 1983.  On the other hand, many decisions of this Court have been premised on the amenability of school boards and similar entities to § 1983 suits.  In <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> and its progeny, we have answered a question that was never actually briefed or argued in this Court whether a municipality is liable in damages for injuries that are the direct result of its official policies.  "The theory of the complaint [in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> was] that under the circumstances [t]here alleged the City [was] liable for the acts of its police officers, by virtue of respondeat superior.  " Brief for Petitioners, *709 O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 21.  [5] Respondents answered that adoption of petitioners' position would expose "Chicago and every other municipality in the United States .  .  .  to Civil Rights Act liability through no action of its own and based on action contrary to its own ordinances and the laws of the state it is a part of." Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1960, No. 39, p. 26.  Thus the ground of decision in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> was not advanced by either party and was broader than necessary to resolve the contentions made in that case. [6] *710 Similarly, in Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973), petitioners asserted that "the County was vicariously liable for the acts of its deputies and sheriff," id., at 696 , under 42 U. S. C. § 1988 .  In rejecting this vicarious-liability claim, 411 U. S., at 710 , and n. 27, we reaffirmed <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> 's reading of the statute, but there was no challenge in that case to "the holding in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> concerning the status under § 1983 of public entities such as the County," 411 U. S., at 700 ; Brief for Petitioners, O. T. 1972, No. 72-10, p. 9.  Only in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507 (1973), did the Court confront a § 1983 claim based on conduct that was both authorized under state law and the direct cause of the claimed constitutional injury.  In Kenosha, however, we raised the issue of the city's amenability to suit under § 1983 on our own initiative.  [7] This line of casesfrom <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> to Kenosha is difficult to reconcile on a principled basis with a parallel series of cases *711 in which the Court has assumed sub silentio that some local government entities could be sued under § 1983.  If now, after full consideration of the question, we continued to adhere to <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , grave doubt would be cast upon the Court's exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction over school boards.  See ante, at 663 n. 5.  Since "the principle of blanket immunity established in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> cannot be cabined short of school boards," ante, at 696, the conflict is squarely presented.  Although there was an independent basis of jurisdiction in many of the school board cases because of the inclusion of individual public officials as nominal parties, the opinions of this Court make explicit reference to the school board party, particularly in discussions of the relief to be awarded, see, e. g., Green v. County School Board, 391 U. S. 430, 437-439, 441-442 (1968); Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U. S. 267, 292-293 (1977) (POWELL, J., concurring in judgment).  And, as the Court points out, ante, at 696-697, and nn. 62, 63, Congress has focused specifically on this Court's school board decisions in several statutes.  Thus the exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction over school boards, while perhaps not premised on considered holdings, has been longstanding.  Indeed, it predated <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> .  Even if one attempts to explain away the school board decisions as involving suits which "may be maintained against board members in their official capacities for injunctive relief under either § 1983 or Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908)," post, at 716-717, n. 2, some difficulty remains in rationalizing the relevant body of precedents.  At least two of the school board cases involved claims for monetary relief.  Cohen v. Chesterfield County School Board, 326 F. Supp. 1159, 1161 (ED Va. 1971), rev'd, 474 F. 2d 395 (CA4 1973), rev'd and remanded, 414 U. S. 632 (1974); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School Dist., 393 U. S. 503, 504 (1969).  See also Vlandis v. Kline, 412 U. S. 441, 445 (1973).  Although the point was not squarely presented in this Court, these claims *712 for damages could not have been maintained in official-capacity suits if the government entity were not itself suable.  Cf. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974).
**Combined Opinion**
Ante, at 694.  This case, however, involves formal, written policies of a municipal department and school board; it is the clear case. The Court also reserves decision on the availability of a qualified municipal immunity.  Ante, at 701.  Initial resolution of the question whether the protection available at common law for municipal corporations, see post, at 720-721, or other principles support a *714 qualified municipal immunity in the context of the § 1983 damages action, is left to the lower federal courts.  MR. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring in part.  Since Parts II and IV of the opinion of the Court are merely advisory and are not necessary to explain the Court's decision, I join only Parts I, III, and V. MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.  Seventeen years ago, in Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S. 167</citedDecision> (1961), this Court held that the 42d Congress did not intend to subject a municipal corporation to liability as a "person" within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. § 1983 .  Since then, the Congress has remained silent, but this Court has reaffirmed that holding on at least three separate occasions.  Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U. S. 1 (1976); City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507 (1973); Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693 (1973).  See also Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 277-279 (1977).  Today, the Court abandons this long and consistent line of precedents, offering in justification only an elaborate canvass of the same legislative history which was before the Court in 1961.  Because I cannot agree that this Court is "free to disregard these precedents," which have been "considered maturely and recently" by this Court, Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 186 (1976) (POWELL, J., concurring), I am compelled to dissent.  I As this Court has repeatedly recognized, id., at 175 n. 12; Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 , 671 n. 14 (1974), considerations of stare decisis are at their strongest when this Court confronts its previous constructions of legislation.
**Combined Opinion**
 .  .  This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation.  But in cases involving the Federal Constitution, where correction through legislative action is practically impossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions." Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406-407 (1932) (dissenting opinion) (footnotes omitted).  Only the most compelling circumstances can justify this Court's abandonment of such firmly established statutory precedents.  The best exposition of the proper burden of persuasion was delivered by Mr. Justice Harlan in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> itself: "From my point of view, the policy of stare decisis, as it should be applied in matters of statutory construction, and, to a lesser extent, the indications of congressional acceptance of this Court's earlier interpretation, require that it appear beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [ United States v.] Classic, [ 313 U. S. 299 (1941)] and Screws [v. United States, 325 U. S. 91 (1945)] misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision, before a departure from what was decided in those cases would be justified." <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> (concurring opinion) (footnote omitted; emphasis added).  The Court does not demonstrate that any exception to this general rule is properly applicable here.  The Court's first assertion, that <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> "was a departure from prior practice," ante, at 695, is patently erroneous.  Neither in Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157 (1943), nor in Holmes v. Atlanta, *716 350 U. S. 879 (1955), nor in any of the school board cases cited by the Court, ante, at 663 n. 5, was the question now before us raised by any of the litigants or addressed by this Court. As recently as four Terms ago, we said in Hagans v. Lavine, 415 U. S. 528 , 535 n. 5 (1974): "Moreover, when questions of jurisdiction have been passed on in prior decisions sub silentio, this Court has never considered itself bound when a subsequent case finally brings the jurisdictional issue before us." The source of this doctrine that jurisdictional issues decided sub silentio are not binding in other cases seems to be Mr. Chief Justice Marshall's remark in United States v. More, 3 Cranch 159, 172 (1805).  [1] While the Chief Justice also said that such decisions may "have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench," Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 88 (1809), unconsidered assumptions of jurisdiction simply cannot outweigh four consistent decisions of this Court, explicitly considering and rejecting that jurisdiction.  Nor is there any indication that any later Congress has ever approved suit against any municipal corporation under § 1983.  Of all its recent enactments, only the Civil Rights Attorney's Fees Awards Act of 1976, § 2, 90 Stat. 2641 , 42 U. S. C. § 1988 (1976 ed.), explicitly deals with the Civil Rights Act of 1871.  [2] The 1976 Act provides that attorney's fees may be awarded *717 to the prevailing party "[i]n any action or proceeding to enforce a provision of sections 1981, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 of this title." There is plainly no language in the 1976 Act which would enlarge the parties suable under those substantive sections; it simply provides that parties who are already suable may be made liable for attorney's fees.  As the Court admits, ante, at 699, the language in the Senate Report stating that liability may be imposed "whether or not the agency or government is a named party," S. Rep. No. 94-1011, p. 5 (1976), suggests that Congress did not view its purpose as being in any way inconsistent with the well-known holding of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> .  The Court's assertion that municipalities have no right to act "on an assumption that they can violate constitutional rights indefinitely," ante, at 700, is simply beside the point.  Since <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , municipalities have had the right to expect that they would not be held liable retroactively for their officers' failure to predict this Court's recognition of new constitutional rights.  No doubt innumerable municipal insurance policies and indemnity ordinances have been founded on this assumption, which is wholly justifiable under established principles of stare decisis.  To obliterate those legitimate expectations without more compelling justifications than those advanced by the Court is a significant departure from our prior practice.  I cannot agree with MR. JUSTICE POWELL's view that "[w]e owe somewhat less deference to a decision that was rendered without benefit of a full airing of all the relevant considerations." Ante, at 709 n. 6.  Private parties must be able to rely upon explicitly stated holdings of this Court without being *718 obliged to peruse the briefs of the litigants to predict the likelihood that this Court might change its mind.  To cast such doubt upon each of our cases, from Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), forward, in which the explicit ground of decision "was never actually briefed or argued," ante, at 708 (POWELL, J., concurring), would introduce intolerable uncertainty into the law. Indeed, in Marbury itself, the argument of Charles Lee on behalf of the applicantswhich, unlike the arguments in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , is reproduced in the Reports of this Court where anyone can see itdevotes not a word to the question of whether this Court has the power to invalidate a statute duly enacted by the Congress.  Neither this ground of decision nor any other was advanced by Secretary of State Madison, who evidently made no appearance.  1 Cranch, at 153-154 .  More recent landmark decisions of this Court would appear to be likewise vulnerable under my Brother POWELL'S analysis.  In Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961), none of the parties requested the Court to overrule Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949); it did so only at the request of an amicus curiae.  367 U. S., at 646 n. 3.  That Marbury, Mapp, and countless other decisions retain their vitality despite their obvious flaws is a necessary byproduct of the adversary system, in which both judges and the general public rely upon litigants to present "all the relevant considerations." Ante, at 709 n. 6 (POWELL, J., concurring).  While it undoubtedly has more latitude in the field of constitutional interpretation, this Court is surely not free to abandon settled statutory interpretation at any time a new thought seems appealing.  [3] Thus, our only task is to discern the intent of the 42d Congress.  That intent was first expounded in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , and it *719 has been followed consistently ever since.  This is not some esoteric branch of the law in which congressional silence might reasonably be equated with congressional indifference.  Indeed, this very year, the Senate has been holding hearings on a bill, S. 35, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. (1977), which would remove the municipal immunity recognized by <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> .  124 Cong. Rec. D117 (daily ed. Feb. 8, 1978).  In these circumstances, it cannot be disputed that established principles of stare decisis require this Court to pay the highest degree of deference to its prior holdings.  <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> may not be overruled unless it has been demonstrated "beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [ <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> ] misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision." Monroe, <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 192</citedDecision> (Harlan, J., concurring).  The Court must show not only that Congress, in rejecting the Sherman amendment, concluded that municipal liability was not unconstitutional, but also that, in enacting § 1, it intended to impose that liability.  I am satisfied that no such showing has been made.  II Any analysis of the meaning of the word "person" in § 1983, which was originally enacted as § 1 of the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13 , must begin, not with the Sherman amendment, but with the Dictionary Act.  The latter Act, which supplied rules of construction for all legislation, provided: "That in all acts hereafter passed .  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 ." Act of Feb. 25, 1871, § 2, 16 Stat. 431 .  The Act expressly provided that corporations need not be included within the scope of the word "person" where the context suggests a more limited reach.  Not a word in the legislative history of the Act gives any indication of the contexts *720 in which Congress felt it appropriate to include a corporation as a person.  Indeed, the chief cause of concern was that the Act's provision that "words importing the masculine gender may be applied to females," might lead to an inadvertent extension of the suffrage to women.  Cong. Globe, 41st Cong., 3d Sess., 777 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Sawyer).  There are other factors, however, which suggest that the Congress which enacted § 1983 may well have intended the word "person" "to be used in a more limited sense," as <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> concluded.  It is true that this Court had held that both commercial corporations, Louisville R. Co. v. Letson, 2 How. 497, 558 (1844), and municipal corporations, Cowles v. Mercer County, 7 Wall. 118, 121 (1869), were "citizens" of a State within the meaning of the jurisdictional provisions of Art. III. Congress, however, also knew that this label did not apply in all contexts, since this Court, in Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168 (1869), had held commercial corporations not to be "citizens" within the meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, U. S. Const., Art. IV, § 2.  Thus, the Congress surely knew that, for constitutional purposes, corporations generally enjoyed a different status in different contexts.  Indeed, it may be presumed that Congress intended that a corporation should enjoy the same status under the Ku Klux Klan Act as it did under the Fourteenth Amendment, since it had been assured that § 1 "was so very simple and really reenact[ed] the Constitution." Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 569 (1871) (remarks of Sen. Edmunds).  At the time § 1983 was enacted the only federal case to consider the status of corporations under the Fourteenth Amendment had concluded, with impeccable logic, that a corporation was neither a "citizen" nor a "person." Insurance Co. v. New Orleans, 13 F. Cas. 67 (No. 7,052) (CC La. 1870).
**Combined Opinion**
 Nevertheless, it cannot be *723 denied that the debate on that amendment, the only explicit consideration of municipal tort liability, sheds considerable light on the Congress' understanding of the status of municipal corporations in that context.  Opponents of the amendment were well aware that municipalities had been subjected to the jurisdiction of the federal courts in the context of suits to enforce their contracts, Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., 789 (1871) (remarks of Rep. Kerr), but they expressed their skepticism that such jurisdiction should be exercised in cases sounding in tort: "Suppose a judgment obtained under this section, and no property can be found to levy upon except the courthouse, can we levy on the court-house and sell it?  So this section provides, and that too in an action of tort, in an action ex delicto, where the county has never entered into any contract, where the State has never authorized the county to assume any liability of the sort or imposed any liability upon it.  It is in my opinion simply absurd." Id., at 799 (remarks of Rep. Farnsworth).  Whatever the merits of the constitutional arguments raised against it, the fact remains that Congress rejected the concept of municipal tort liability on the only occasion in which the question was explicitly presented.  Admittedly this fact is not conclusive as to whether Congress intended § 1 to embrace a municipal corporation within the meaning of "person," and thus the reasoning of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> on this point is subject to challenge.  The meaning of § 1 of the Act of 1871 has been subjected in this case to a more searching and careful analysis than it was in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> , and it may well be that on the basis of this closer analysis of the legislative debates a conclusion contrary to the <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> holding could have been reached when that case was decided 17 years ago.  But the rejection of the Sherman amendment remains instructive in that here alone did the legislative debates squarely focus on the liability of municipal corporations, and that liability was rejected.  *724 Any inference which might be drawn from the Dictionary Act or from general expressions of benevolence in the debate on § 1 that the word "person" was intended to include municipal corporations falls far short of showing "beyond doubt" that this Court in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> "misapprehended the meaning of the controlling provision." Errors such as the Court may have fallen into in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> do not end the inquiry as to stare decisis; they merely begin it.  I would adhere to the holding of <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> as to the liability of a municipal corporation under § 1983.  III The decision in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> was the fountainhead of the torrent of civil rights litigation of the last 17 years.  Using § 1983 as a vehicle, the courts have articulated new and previously unforeseeable interpretations of the Fourteenth Amendment.  At the same time, the doctrine of municipal immunity enunciated in <citedDecision>Monroe</citedDecision> has protected municipalities and their limited treasuries from the consequences of their officials' failure to predict the course of this Court's constitutional jurisprudence.  None of the Members of this Court can foresee the practical consequences of today's removal of that protection.  Only the Congress, which has the benefit of the advice of every segment of this diverse Nation, is equipped to consider the results of such a drastic change in the law. It seems all but inevitable that it will find it necessary to do so after today's decision.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  NOTES [*] Michael H. Gottesman, Robert M.

The District Court held that the 1972 amendments to Title VII did not apply retroactively to discrimination suffered prior to those amendments even when an action challenging such prior discrimination was pending on the date of the amendments.

 The defendants did not deny this, but stated that this policy had been changed after suit was instituted.  Answer ¶ 13, App. 32-33.  The plaintiffs further alleged that the Board had a policy of requiring women to take maternity leave after the seventh month of pregnancy unless that month fell in the last month of the school year, in which case the teacher could remain through the end of the school term. Amended Complaint ¶¶ 39, 42, 45, App. 18-19, 21.  This allegation was denied.  Answer ¶¶ 18, 22, App. 35, 37.  [3]  Amended Complaint ¶ 24, App. 11-12.

[7]  However, we do uphold Monroe v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> insofar as it holds that the doctrine of respondeat superior is not a basis for rendering municipalities liable under § 1983 for the constitutional torts of their employees.  See Part II, infra.  [8]  We expressly declined to consider "policy considerations" for or against municipal liability.  See 365 U. S., at 191.  [9]  Mr. Justice Douglas, the author of Monroe, has suggested that the municipal exclusion might more properly rest on a theory that Congress sought to prevent the financial ruin that civil rights liability might impose on municipalities.  See City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507, 517-520 (1973).  However, this view has never been shared by the Court, see Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 190</citedDecision> ; Moor v. County of Alameda, 411 U. S. 693, 708 (1973), and the debates do not support this position.  [10]  Globe 522.  [11]  Briefly, § 2 created certain federal crimes in addition to those defined in § 2 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, 14 Stat. 27 , each aimed primarily at the Ku Klux Klan.  Section 3 provided that the President could send the militia into any State wracked with Klan violence.  Finally, § 4 provided for suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in enumerated circumstances, again primarily those thought to obtain where Klan violence was rampant.  See Cong. Globe, 42d Cong., 1st Sess., App. 335-336 (1871) (hereinafter Globe App.).  [12]  Globe 709.

 We have also asserted as fully as we can assert the constitutional right of Congress to legislate." Globe 800.  See also id., at 376 (Rep. Lowe); id., at 428-429 (Rep. Beatty); id., at 448 (Rep. Butler); id., at 475-477 (Rep. Dawes); id., at 578-579 (Sen. Trumbull); id., at 609 (Sen. Pool); Globe App. 182 (Rep. Mercur).  Other supporters were quite clear that § 1 of the Act extended a remedy not only where a State had passed an unconstitutional statute, but also where officers of the State were deliberately indifferent to the rights of black citizens: "But the chief complaint is ... [that] by a systematic maladministration of [state law], or a neglect or refusal to enforce their provisions, a portion of the people are denied equal protection under them.  Whenever such a state of facts is clearly made out, I believe [§ 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment] empowers Congress to step in and provide for doing justice to those persons who are thus denied equal protection." Id., at 153 (Rep. Garfield).  See also Monroe v. Pape, <citedDecision>365 U. S., at 171-187</citedDecision> .  Importantly for our inquiry, even the opponents of § 1 agreed that it was constitutional and, further, that it swept very broadly.  Thus, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of § 1, said: "This section relates wholly to civil suits.  .  .  .  Its whole effect is to give to the Federal Judiciary that which now does not belong to it a jurisdiction that may be constitutionally conferred upon it, I grant, but that has never yet been conferred upon it.

 See Sumner v. Philadelphia, 23 F. Cas. 392 (No. 13,611) (CC ED Pa. 1873) (awarding damages of $2,273.36 and costs of $346.35 against the city of Philadelphia).  [48]  Nonetheless, suits could be brought in federal court if the natural persons who were members of the corporation were of diverse citizenship from the other parties to the litigation.  See 5 Cranch, at 91 .  [49]  See n. 28, supra. [50]  See, e. g., Globe 777 (Sen. Sherman); id., at 752 (Rep. Shellabarger) ("[C]ounties, cities, and corporations of all sorts, after years of judicial conflict, have become thoroughly established to be an individual or person or entity of the personal existence, of which, as a citizen, individual, or inhabitant, the United States Constitution does take note and endow with faculty to sue and be sued in the courts of the United States").  [51]  See Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, 18 F. Cas. 393, 394 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873); 2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *278-*279 (12th O. W. Holmes ed. 1873).  See also United States v. Maurice, 2 Brock. 96, 109 (CC Va. 1823) (Marshall, C. J.) ("The United States is a government, and, consequently, a body politic and corporate"); Apps.  D and E to Brief for Petitioners in Monroe v. <citedDecision>Pape</citedDecision> , O. T. 1960, No. 39 (collecting state statutes which, in 1871, defined municipal corporations as bodies politic and corporate).  [52]  The court also noted that there was no discernible reason why persons injured by municipal corporations should not be able to recover.  See 18 F. Cas., at 394 .  [53]  In considering the effect of the Act of Feb. 25, 1871, in Monroe, however, Mr. Justice Douglas, apparently focusing on the word "may," stated: "[T]his definition [of person] is merely an allowable, not a mandatory, one." 365 U. S., at 191.  A review of the legislative history of the Dictionary Act shows this conclusion to be incorrect.  There is no express reference in the legislative history to the definition of "person," but Senator Trumbull, the Act's sponsor, discussed the phrase "words importing the masculine gender may be applied to.
