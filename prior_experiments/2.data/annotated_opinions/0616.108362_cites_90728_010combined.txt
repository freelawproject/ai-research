Going in disguise, in particular, is in this context an activity so little associated with official action and so commonly connected with private marauders that this clause could almost never be applicable under the artificially restrictive construction of Collins. And since the "going in disguise" aspect must include private action, it is hard to see how the conspiracy aspect, joined by a disjunctive, could be read to require the involvement of state officers. The provision continues, specifying the motivation required "for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws." This language is, of course, similar to that of § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, *97 which in terms speaks only to the States, [3] and judicial thinking about what can constitute an equal protection deprivation has, because of the Amendment's wording, focused almost entirely upon identifying the requisite "state action" and defining the offending forms of state law and official conduct. A century of Fourteenth Amendment adjudication has, in other words, made it understandably difficult to conceive of what might constitute a deprivation of the equal protection of the laws by private persons. Yet there is nothing inherent in the phrase that requires the action working the deprivation to come from the State. See, e. g., United States v. Harris, <targetCase>106 U.S. 629</targetCase> , 643. Indeed, the failure to mention any such requisite can be viewed as an important indication of congressional intent to speak in § 1985 (3) of all deprivations of "equal protection of the laws" and "equal privileges and immunities under the laws," whatever their source. The approach of this Court to other Reconstruction civil rights statutes in the years since Collins has been to "accord [them] a sweep as broad as [their] language." United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787 , 801; Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409 , 437. Moreover, very similar language in closely related statutes has early and late received an interpretation quite inconsistent with that given to § 1985 (3) in Collins. In construing the exact criminal counterpart of § 1985 (3), the Court in United States v. Harris, supra , observed that the statute was "not limited to take effect only in case [of state action]," id., at 639, but "was framed to protect from invasion by private persons, the equal privileges *98 and immunities under the laws, of all persons and classes of persons," id., at 637. In United States v. Williams, 341 U.S. 70 , the Court considered the closest remaining criminal analogue to § 1985 (3), 18 U.S. C .

These allegations clearly support the requisite animus to deprive the petitioners of the equal enjoyment of legal rights because of their race. The claims of detention, threats, and battery amply satisfy the requirement of acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. Finally, the petitionerswhether or not the nonparty Grady was the main or only target of the conspiracyallege personal injury resulting from those acts. The complaint, then, states a cause of action under § 1985 (3). Indeed, the conduct here alleged lies so close to the core of the coverage intended by Congress that it is hard to conceive of wholly private conduct that would come within the statute if this does not. We must, accordingly, consider whether Congress had constitutional power to enact a statute that imposes liability under federal law for the conduct alleged in this complaint. *104 V The constitutionality of § 1985 (3) might once have appeared to have been settled adversely by United States v. Harris, <targetCase>106 U.S. 629</targetCase> , and Baldwin v. Franks, 120 U.S. 678 , which held unconstitutional its criminal counterpart, then § 5519 of the Revised Statutes. [11] The Court in those cases, however, followed a severability rule that required invalidation of an entire statute if any part of it was unconstitutionally overbroad, unless its different parts could be read as wholly independent provisions. E. g., Baldwin v. Franks, supra, at 685. This Court has long since firmly rejected that rule in such cases as United States v. Raines, 362 U.S. 17 , 20-24. Consequently, we need not find the language of § 1985 (3) now before us constitutional in all its possible applications in order to uphold its facial constitutionality and its application to the complaint in this case. That § 1985 (3) reaches private conspiracies to deprive others of legal rights can, of itself, cause no doubts of its constitutionality. It has long been settled that 18 U.S. C . § 241, a criminal statute of far broader phrasing (see n. 4, supra ), reaches wholly private conspiracies and is constitutional. E. g., In re Quarles, 158 U.S. 532 ; Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263 , 293-295; United States v. Waddell, 112 U.S. 76 , 77-81; Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U.S. 651 . See generally Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78 , 97-98. Our inquiry therefore, need go only to identifying a source of congressional power to reach the private conspiracy alleged by the complaint in this case. A Even as it struck down Rev. Stat. § 5519 in United States v. <targetCase>Harris</targetCase> , the Court indicated that parts of its coverage would, if severable, be constitutional under the *105 Thirteenth Amendment. 106 U.S. , at 640-641 . And surely there has never been any doubt of the power of Congress to impose liability on private persons under § 2 of that amendment, "for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States." Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 , 20. See also id., at 23; Clyatt v. United States, 197 U.S. 207 , 216, 218; Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S., at 437-440. Not only may Congress impose such liability, but the varieties of private conduct that it may make criminally punishable or civilly remediable extend far beyond the actual imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude. By the Thirteenth Amendment, we committed ourselves as a Nation to the proposition that the former slaves and their descendants should be forever free.
