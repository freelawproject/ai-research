**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.  The Court holds that Congress, in the exercise of its commerce power, cannot require a State to waive its immunity from suit in federal court even where the State engages in activity from which it might readily withdraw, such as federally regulated commercial activity.  This Court has previously held to the contrary.  Parden v. Terminal R. Co. of Ala. Docks Dept., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964).  I would not abandon that precedent.  *694 I Thirty-five years ago this Court unanimously subscribed to the holding that the Court today overrules.  Justice White, writing for four Members of the Court who dissented on a different issue, succinctly described that holding as follows: “[I]t is within the power of Congress to condition a State’s permit to engage in the interstate transportation business on a waiver of the State’s sovereign immunity from suits arising out of such business.  Congress might well determine that allowing regulable conduct such as the operation of a railroad to be undertaken by a body legally immune from liability directly resulting from these operations is so inimical to the purposes of its regulation that the State must be put to the option of either foregoing participation in the conduct or consenting to legal responsibility for injury caused thereby.” <citedDecision>Id., at 198</citedDecision> (opinion of White, J., joined by Douglas, Harlan, and Stewart, JJ.).  The majority, seeking to justify the overruling of so clear a precedent, describes Parden’s holding as a constitutional "anomaly” that “broke sharply with prior cases,” that is “fundamentally incompatible with later ones,” and that has been “narrowed ... in every subsequent opinion.” Ante, at 680.  <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> is none of those things.  Far from being anomalous, Parden’s holding finds support in reason and precedent.  When a State engages in ordinary commercial ventures, it acts like a private person, outside the area of its “core” responsibilities, and in a way unlikely to prove essential to the fulfillment of a basic governmental obligation.  A Congress that decides to regulate those state commercial activities rather than to exempt the State likely believes that an exemption, by treating the State differently from identically situated private persons, would threaten the objectives of a federal regulatory program aimed primarily *695 at private conduct.  Compare, e. g., 12 U. S. C. § 1841 (b) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (exempting state companies from regulations covering federal bank holding companies); 15 U. S. C. §77e(a)(2) (exempting state-issued securities from federal securities laws); and 29 U. S. C. § 652 (5) (exempting States from the definition of “employer[sJ” subject to federal occupational safety and health laws), with 11 U. S. C. § 106 (a) (subjecting States to federal bankruptcy court judgments); 15 U. S. C. § 1122 (a) (subjecting States to suit for violation of Lanham Act); 17 U. S. C. § 511 (a) (subjecting States to suit for copyright infringement); and 35 U. S. C. § 271 (h) (subjecting States to suit for patent infringement).  And a Congress that includes the State not only within its substantive regulatory rules but also (expressly) within a related system of private remedies likely believes that a remedial exemption would similarly threaten that program.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. Co liege Savings Bank, ante, at 656-657 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  It thereby avoids an enforcement gap which, when allied with the pressures of a competitive marketplace, could place the State’s regulated private competitors at a significant disadvantage.  These considerations make Congress’ need to possess the power to condition entry into the market upon a waiver of sovereign immunity (as “necessary and proper” to the exercise of its commerce power) unusually strong, for to deny Congress that power would deny Congress the power effectively to regulate private conduct.  Cf. California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553, 566 (1957).  At the same time they make a State’s need to exercise sovereign immunity unusually weak, for the State is unlikely to have to supply what private firms already supply, nor may it fairly demand special treatment, even to protect the public purse, when it does so. Neither can one easily imagine what the Constitution’s Founders would have thought about the assertion of sovereign immunity in this special context.  These considerations, differing in kind or degree from those that would support a general *696 congressional “abrogation” power, indicate that Pardens holding is sound, irrespective of this Court’s decisions in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, 517 U. S. 44 (1996), and Alden v. Maine, post, p. 706.  Neither did <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> break “sharply.  with prior cases.” <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> itself cited authority that found related “waivers” in at least roughly comparable circumstances.  United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), for example, held that a State, “by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has subjected itself to the commerce power,” id., at 185 , which amounted to a waiver of a (different though related) substantive immunity.  See also Taylor, supra, at 568 .  <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> also relied on authority holding that States seeking necessary congressional approval for an interstate compact had, “by venturing into the [federal] realm 'assume[d] the [waiver of sovereign immunity] conditions .  .  .  attached.’” <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 196</citedDecision> (quoting Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm’n, 359 U. S. 275, 281-282 (1959)).  Earlier case law had found a waiver of sovereign immunity in a State’s decision to bring a creditor’s claim in bankruptcy.  See Gardner v. New Jersey, 329 U. S. 565, 573-574 (1947).  Later case law, suggesting that a waiver may be found in a State’s acceptance of a federal grant, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 247 (1985), supports Parderis conclusion.  Where is the sharp break?  The majority has only one answer to this question.  It believes that this Court’s ease law requires any “waiver” to be “express” and “unequivocal.” Ante, at 680.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 *697 The statement does appeal to an intuition, namely, that it is somehow easier for the State, and hence more voluntary, to forgo “a gift or gratuity” than to refrain from “otherwise lawful activity,” or that it is somehow more compelling or oppressive for Congress to forbid the State to perform an “otherwise lawful” act than to withhold “beneficence.” But the force of this intuition depends upon the example that one chooses as its illustration; and realistic examples suggest the intuition is not sound in the present context.  Given the amount of money at stake, it may be harder, not easier, for a State to refuse highway funds than to refrain from entering the investment services business.  See U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Federal Aid to States for Fiscal Year 1998, p. 17 (Apr. 1999) (Federal Government provided over $20 billion to States for highways in 1998).  It is more compelling and oppressive for Congress to threaten to withhold from a State fluids needed to educate its children than to threaten to subject it to suit when it competes directly with a private investment company.  See id., at 5 (Federal Government provided over $21 billion to States for education in 1998).  The distinction that the majority seeks to make — drawn in terms of gifts and entitlements — does not exist.  The majority is also wrong to say that this Court has “narrowed” <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> in its “subsequent opinion^],” ante, at 680, at least in any way relevant to today’s decision.  <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> considered two separate issues: (1) Does Congress have the power to require a State to waive its immunity?  (2) How clearly must Congress speak when it does so?  The Court has narrowed <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> only in respect to the second issue, not the first; but today we are concerned only with the first.  The Court in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U.S. 279 (1973), for example, discussed whether Congress had, or had not, “lift[ed]” sovereign immunity, not whether it could, or could not, have done so. Id., at 285 *698 (“Congress did not lift the sovereign immunity of the States” (emphasis added)).  And Employees’ limitation of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , to “the area where private persons and corporations normally ran the enterprise,” took place in the context of clarity, not power.  411 U. S., at 284 (specifying that “Congress can act” outside the limited area (emphasis added)).  Although two Justices would have limited Parden’s holding in respect to power, that limitation would simply have required Congress to give the States advance notice of the consequence (loss of sovereign immunity), which, as they noted, happened in Parden.  411 U. S., at 296-297 (Marshall, J., concurring in result).  The remaining cases the majority mentions offer it no greater support.  One said, “We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 488 U. S. 468 , 475 (1987).  Two others also considered legislative clarity, not power.  Atascadero State Hospital, supra, at 247 (Rehabilitation Act “falls far short” of clearly indicating a waiver by a State accepting funds under the Act); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 674 (1974) (same for Social Security Act).  Even Seminole Tribe carefully avoided calling Par-den into question.  While specifying that Congress cannot, in the exercise of its Article I powers, “abrogate unilaterally the States’ immunity from suit,” 517 U. S., at 59 , it left open the scope of the term “unilaterally” by referring to <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , without criticism, as standing for the “unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that the States may waive their sovereign immunity,” 517 U. S., at 65 .  In short, except for those in today’s majority, no member of this Court had ever questioned the holding of <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> that the Court today discards because it cannot find “merit in attempting to salvage any remnant of it.” Ante, at 680.  *699 <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> had never been questioned because, Seminole Tribe or not, it still makes sense.  The line the Court today rejects has been drawn by this Court to place States outside the ordinary dormant Commerce Clause rules when they act as “market participants.” White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204, 206-208 (1988); Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 434-439 (1980); Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 804-810 (1976).  And Congress has drawn this same line in the related context of foreign state sovereign immunity.  28 U. S. C. § 1605 (a)(2).  In doing so, Congress followed the modern trend, which “spread rapidly after the Second World War,” regarding foreign state sovereign immunity.  1 Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States, eh. 5, Introductory Note, p. 391 (1986) (recognizing that “immunity... gave states an unfair advantage in competition with private commercial enterprise”); see also Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of its Thirty-Eighth Session, Art. 11, ¶ 1, p. 7 (United Nations Doe.  A/41/498, Aug. 26, 1986) (when a State engages in a commercial contract with a foreign person, “the State is considered to have consented to the exercise” of foreign jurisdiction in a proceeding arising out of that contract).  Indeed, given the widely accepted view among modern nations that when a State engages in ordinary commercial activity sovereign immunity has no significant role to play, it is today’s holding, not <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> , that creates the legal “anomaly.” II I resist all the more strongly the Courts extension of Seminole Tribe in this case because, although I accept this Court’s -pre-Seminole Tribe sovereign immunity decisions, I am not yet ready to adhere to the proposition of law set forth in Seminole Tribe.  Cf. EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 249-250 (1988) (Stevens, J., concurring).  In my view, Congress does possess the authority to abrogate a State’s sover *700 eign immunity where "necessary and proper” to the exercise of an Article I power.  My reasons include those that Justices Stevens and Souter already have described in detail.  (1) Neither constitutional text nor the surrounding debates support Seminole Tribe's view that Congress lacks the Article I power to abrogate a State’s sovereign immunity in federal-question cases (unlike diversity eases).  Seminole Tribe, 517 U. S., at 82-88 , and nn. 8, 9 (Stevens, J., dissenting); id., at 142-150 (Souter, J., dissenting); ef.  the majority’s characterization of this argument, ante, at 687-688.
