And when the national government lawfully acts through a corporation which it owns and controls, those activities are governmental functions entitled to whatever tax immunity attaches to those functions when carried on by the government itself through its departments. See McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 421- 422; Smith v. Kansas City Title Co., 255 U. S. 180, 208; Federal Land Bank v. Crosland, 261 U. S. 374; New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra. The single question with which we are now concerned is whether the tax laid by the state upon the salary of respondent, employed by a corporate instrumentality of the federal government, imposes an unconstitutional burden upon that government. The theory of the tax immunity of either government, state or national, and its instrumentalities, from taxation by the other, has been rested Upon an implied liniitation on the taxing power of each, such as to forestall undue interference, through the exercise of that power, with the govern *478 mental activities of the other. That the two types of immunity may not, in all respects, stand on a parity has been recognized from the beginning, McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, 435-436, and possible differences in application, deriving from differences in the source, nature and extent of the immunity of the governments and their agencies, were pointed out and discussed by this Court in detail during the last term. Helvering v. <targetCase>Gerhardt, supra</targetCase>, 412-413, 416. So far as now relevant, those differences have been thought to be traceable to the fact that the federal government, is one of delegated powers in the exercise of which Congress is supreme; so that every agency which Congress can constitutionally create is a governmental agency. And since the power to create the -agency includes the implied power to do whatever is needful or appropriate, if not expressly prohibited, to protect the agency, there has been attributed to Congress some scope, the limits of which it is not now necessary to define, for granting or withholding immunity of federal agencies from state taxation. See Van Allen v. The Assessors, 3 Wall. 573, 583, 585; Bank v. Supervisors, 7 Wall. 26, 30, 31; Thomson v. Pacific Railroad, 9 Wall. 579, 588, 590; People v. Weaver, 100 U. S. 539, 543; Mercantile Bank v. New York, 121 U. S. 138, 154; Owensboro National Bank v. Owensboro, 173 U. S. 664, 668; Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U. S. 575, 581; Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries, Inc., 296 U. S. 521, 525-526; Baltimore National Bank v. State Tax Comm’n, 297 U. S. 209, 211-212; British-American Oil Co. v. Board, 299 U. S. 159; James v. Bravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134, 161; Helvering v. <targetCase>Gerhardt, supra</targetCase>, 411, 412, 417; cf. United States v. Bekins, 304 U. S. 27, 52. Whether its power to grant tax exemptions as an incident to the exercise of powers specifically granted by the Constitution can ever, in any circumstances, extend beyond the con *479 stitutional immunity of federal- agencies which courts have implied, is a question which need not now be determined. Congress has declared in § 4 of the Act that the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation is an instrumentality of the United States and that its bonds are exempt, as to principal and interest, from federal and state taxation, except surtaxes, estate, inheritance and gift taxes. The corporation itself, “including its franchise, its capital, reserves and surplus, and its loans and income,” is likewise exempted from taxation; its real property is subject to tax' to the same extent as other real property. But Congress has given no intimation of any purpose either to grant or withhold immunity from state taxation of the salary of the corporation’s employees, and the Congressional intention is not to be gathered from the statute by implication.

Silence of Congress implies immunity no more than does the silence of the Constitution. It follows that when exemption from state taxation is claimed on the ground that the federal government is burdened by the tax, and Congress has disclosed no intention with respect to the claimed immunity, it is in order to consider the nature and effect of the alleged burden, and if it appears that there is no ground for implying a constitutional immunity, there is equally a want o'f any ground for assuming any purpose on the part of Congress to create an immunity. The present tax is a non-discriminatory tax on income applied to salaries at a specified rate. It is not in form or substance a tax upon the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation or its property or income, nor is it paid by the corporation or the government from their funds. It is measured by income which becomes the property of the taxpayer when received as compensation for his services; and the tax laid upon the privilege of receiving it is paid from his private funds and not from the funds of the government, either directly or indirectly. The theory, which once won a qualified approval, that a tax on income is legally or economically a tax oil its source, is no longer tenable, New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, 300 U. S. 308, 313, 314; Hale v. State Board, 302 U. S. 95, 108; Helver- *481 ing v. <targetCase>Gerhardt, supra</targetCase>; cf. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514; Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U. S. 123; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra, 149; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376, and the only possible basis for implying a constitutional immunity from state income tax of the salary of an employee of the national government or of a governmental agency is that the economic burden of the tax is in some way passed on so as to impose a burden oh the national government tantamount to an interference by one government with the other in the performance of its functions. In the four cases in which this Court has held that the salary of an officer or employee of one government or its instrumentality was immune from taxation by the other, it was assumed, without discussion, that the immunity 'of a government or its instrumentality extends to the salaries of its officers and employees. 2 • This assumption made with respect to the salary of a governmental officer *482 in Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435, and in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, was later extended to confer immunity on income derived by a lessee from lands leased to him by a government in the performance of a governmental function, Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501; Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, and cases cited, although the claim of a like exemption from tax on the income of a contractor engaged in' carrying out a governmental project was rejected both in the case of a contractor with a state, Metcalf & Eddy v. *483 Mitchell, supra, and of a contractor with the national government, James v. Dravo Contracting Co., supra. The ultimate repudiation in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., supra, of the doctrine that a tax on the income of a. lessee derived from a lease of government owned or controlled lands is a forbidden interference with the activities of the government concerned led to the reexamination by this Court, in the Gerhardt: case, of the theory underlying the asserted immunity from taxation by one government of salaries of employees of the other.
