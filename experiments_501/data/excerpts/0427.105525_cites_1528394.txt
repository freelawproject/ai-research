 52 With this background it is not surprising that the Declaration of Independence protested that George III had “affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power” and that Americans had been deprived in many cases of “the benefits of Trial by Jury.” 53 And those who adopted the Constitution embodied their profound fear and distrust of military power, as well as their determination to protect trial by jury, in the Constitution and its Amendments.  54 Perhaps they *30 were aware that memories fade and hoped that in this way they could keep the people of this Nation from having to fight again and again the same old battles for individual freedom.  In light of this history, it seems clear that the Founders had no intention to permit the trial of civilians in military courts, where they would be denied jury trials and other constitutional protections, merely by giving Congress the power to make rules which were “necessary and proper” for the regulation of the “land and naval Forces.” Such a latitudinarian interpretation of these clauses would be at war with the well-established purpose of the Founders to keep the military strictly within its proper sphere, subordinate to civil authority.  The Constitution does not say that Congress can regulate “the land and naval Forces and all other persons whose regulation might have some relationship to maintenance of the land and naval Forces.” There is no indication that the Founders contemplated setting up a rival system of military courts to compete with civilian courts for jurisdiction over civilians who might have some contact or relationship with the armed forces.  Courts-martial were not to have concurrent jurisdiction with courts of law over nonmilitary America.  On several occasions this Court has been faced with an attempted expansion of the jurisdiction of military courts.  Ex parte Milligan, <citedDecision>4 Wall. 2</citedDecision> , one of the great landmarks in this Court’s history, held that military authorities were without power to try civilians not in the military or naval service by declaring martial law in an area where the civil *31 administration was not deposed and the courts were not closed.  55 In a stirring passage the Court proclaimed: “Another guarantee of freedom was broken when Milligan was denied a trial by jury.  The great minds of the country have differed on the correct interpretation to be given to various provisions of the Federal Constitution; and judicial decision has been often invoked to settle their true meaning; but until recently no one ever doubted that the right of trial by jury was fortified in the organic law against the power of attack.  It is now assailed; but if ideas can be expressed in words, and language has any meaning, this right — one of the most valuable in a free country — is preserved to everyone accused of crime who is not attached to the army, or navy, or militia in actual service.” 56 In Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304 , the Court reasserted the principles enunciated in Ex parte Milligan and reaffirmed the tradition of military subordination to civil authorities and institutions.  It refused to sanction the military trial of civilians in Hawaii during wartime despite government claims that the needs of defense made martial law imperative.  Just last Term, this Court held in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11 , that military courts could not constitutionally try a discharged serviceman for an offense which he had allegedly committed while in the armed forces.  It was decided (1) that since Toth was a civilian he could not be tried by military court-martial, 57 *32 and (2) that since he was charged with murder, a “crime” in the constitutional sense, he was entitled to indictment by a grand jury, jury trial, and the other protections contained in Art. Ill, § 2 and the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments.

 See Dorr v. United States, 195 U. S. 138, 144-148 .  The right to trial by jury in a criminal case is twice guaranteed by the Constitution.  It is common knowledge that the fear that jury trial might be abolished was one of the principal sources of objection to the Federal Constitution and was an important reason for the adoption of the Bill of Rights.  The Sixth Amendment reaffirmed the right to trial by jury in criminal cases and the Seventh Amendment insured such trial in civil controversies.  See 2 Elliot’s Debates (2d ed. 1836) passim; 3 id. passim.  3 Blackstone’s Commentaries 379.  As to the importance of trial by jury, see also Ex parte Milligan, <citedDecision>4 Wall. 2, 122-123</citedDecision> ; Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343, 349-350 ; United States ex rel. Toth v.

 Apparently the normal method of disciplining camp followers was to expel them from the camp or to take away their ration privileges.  Experts on military law, the Judge Advocate General and the Attorney General have repeatedly taken the position that “in the field” means in an area of actual fighting.  See, e. g., Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents (2d ed., Reprint 1920), 100-102; Davis, Military Law (3d ed. 1915), 478-479; Dudley, Military Law and the Procedures of Courts-Martial (2d ed. 1908), 413-414; 14 Op. Atty. Gen. 22; 16 id., 48; Dig. Op. JAG (1912) 151; id. (1901) 56, 563; id. (1895) 76, 325-326, 599-600; id. (1880) 49, 211, 384.  Cf. Walker v. Chief Quarantine Officer, 69 F. Supp. 980, 987 .  Article 2 (10) of the UCMJ, 50 U. S. C. § 552 (10), provides that in time of war persons serving with or accompanying the armed forces in the field are subject to court-martial and military law. We believe that Art. 2 (10) sets forth the maximum historically recognized extent of military jurisdiction over civilians under the concept of “in the field.” The Government does not attempt — and quite appropriately so — to support military jurisdiction over Mrs. Smith or Mrs. Covert under Art. 2 (10).  Even during time of war the Constitution must be observed.  Ex parte Milligan, <citedDecision>4 Wall. 2, at 120</citedDecision> , declares: “The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances.  No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.” Also see Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., 251 U. S. 146, 156 ; United States v. Commodities Trading Corp., 339 U. S. 121, 125 .  Madsen v. Kinsella, 343 U. S. 341 , is not controlling here.  It concerned trials in enemy territory which had been conquered and held by force of arms and which was being governed at the time by our military forces.  In such areas the Army commander can establish military or civilian commissions as an arm of the occupation to try everyone in the occupied area, whether they are connected with the Army or not.
