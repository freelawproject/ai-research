<author id="b493-6">Mr. Chief Justice Taft</author>
<p id="AIFZ">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b493-7">These cases are here by certiorari from the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 19 F. (2d) 842 and 850: The petition in No. 493 was filed August 30, 1927; in Nos. 532 and 533, September 9, 1927. They were granted with the distinct limitation that the hearing should be confined to the single question whether the use of evidence of private telephone conversations between the defendants and others, intercepted by means of wire tapping, amounted to a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.</p>
<p id="b493-8">The petitioners were convicted in the District Court for the Western District of Washington of a conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act by unlawfully possessing, transporting and importing intoxicating liquors and maintaining nuisances, and by selling intoxicating liquors. Seventy-two others in addition to the petitioners were indicted. Some were not apprehended, some were acquitted and others.pleaded guilty.</p>
<p id="b493-9">The evidehce in the records discloses a conspiracy of amazing magnitude to import, possess and sell liquor un<page-number citation-index="1" label="456">*456</page-number>lawfully. It .involved the employment of not less than fifty persons, of two seagoing vessels for the transportation of liquor to British Columbia, of smaller vessels for coastwise transportation to the State of Washington, the purchase and use of a ranch beyond the suburban limits of Seattle, with a large underground cache for storage and a number of smaller caches in that city, the maintenance of a central office manned with operators, the employment of executives, salesmen, deliverymen, dispatchers, scouts, bookkeepers, collectors and an attorney. In a bad month sales amounted to $176,000; the aggregate for a year must have exceeded.two millions of dollars.</p>
<p id="b494-6">Olmstead was the leading conspirator and the genera] manager of the business. He made a contribution of $10,000 to the capital; eleven others contributed $1,000 each. The profits were divided one-half to Olmstead and the remainder to the other eleven. Of the séveral offices in Seattle the chief one was in a large office building. In this there .were three telephones on three different lines. There were telephones in an office of the manager in his own home, at the homes of his associates, and at .other places in the city. Communication was had frequently with Vancouver, British Columbia. Times were fixed for the deliveries of the “stuff,” to places along Puget Sound néar Seattle and from there the liquor was removed and deposited in the caches already referred to. One of the chief men was always on duty at the main office to receive orders by: telephones and to direct their filling by a corps of men stationed in another room — the “bull peri.” The call numbers of the telephones were given to those known to be likely customers. At times the salés amounted to 200 cases of liquor per day.</p>
<p id="b494-7">The information which led to the discovery of the conspiracy and its nature and extent was largely obtained by intercepting messages on the telephones of the conspirators by four federal prohibition officers. Small <page-number citation-index="1" label="457">*457</page-number>wires were inserted along the ordinary telephone .wires from the residences of four of the petitioners and those leading from the chief office. The insertions were made without trespass upon any property of the defendants. They were made in the basement of the large office building. The taps from house lines were made in the streets near the houses.</p>
<p id="b495-5">The gathering of evidence continued for many months. Conversations of the conspirators of which refreshing stenographic notes were currently made, were testified to by the government witnesses. They revealed the large business transactions of the partners and their subordinates. . Men at the wires heard the orders given for liquor by customers and the acceptances; they became auditors of the conversations between the partners. All this disclosed the conspiracy charged in the indictment. Many of the intercepted conversations were not merely reports but parts of the criminal acts. The evidence also disclosed the difficulties to which the conspirators were subjected, the reported news of the capture of vessels, the arrest of their men and the seizure of cases of liquor in garages and other places. It showed the dealing by Olmstead, the chief conspirator, with members of the Seattle police, the messages to them which, secured the release of arrested members of the conspiracy, and also direct promises to officers of payments as soon as opportunity offered.</p>
<p id="b495-6">The Fourth Amendment provides — “ The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or. affirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.” And the Fifth: “No person . . shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself.”</p>
<p id="b496-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="458">*458</page-number>It will be helpful to consider the chief cases in this Court which bear upon the construction of these Amendments!</p>
<p id="b496-6"><em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States, </em>116 U. S. 616, was an information filed by the District Attorney in the federal court in a cause of seizure and forfeiture against thirty-five cases of plate glass) which charged that the owner and importer, with intent to defraud the revenue, made an entry of the imported merchandise by means of a fraudulent or false invoice. It became important to show the quantity and value of glass contained in twenty-nine cases previously imported. The fifth section of the Act of June 22, 1874, provided that in cases not criminal upder the.revenue laws,, the United States Attorney, whenever he thought an invoice, belonging to the defendant, would tend to prove any allegation made by the United States, might by a written motion describing the invoice and setting forth the allegation which he expected to prove, secure a notice from the court to the defendant to produce the invoice, and if the defendant refused to produce it, the allegations stated in the motion should be taken as confessed, but if produced, the United States Attorney should be permitted, under the direction of the court, to make an examination of the invoice, and might offer the same in evidence. This Act had succeeded the Act of 1867, which provided that in -such cases the District Judge, on affidavit of any person interested, might issue a warrant to the marshal to enter the premises where the invoice was and take possession of it' and hold it subject to the order of the judge. This had been preceded by the Act of 1863 of a similar tenor, except that it directed the warrant to the collector instead of the marshal.. The United States Attorney followed the Act of 1874 and compelled the production of the invoice.</p>
<p id="b496-7">The court held the Act of 1874 repugnant to the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. As to the Fourth Amendment, Justice Bradley said (page 621) :</p>
<p id="b497-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="459">*459</page-number>“ But, in regard to the Fourth Amendment, it is contended that, whatever might hav.e been alleged against the constitutionality of the acts of 1863 and 1867, that of 1874, under which the order in the present case was made, is free from constitutional objection because it does not authorize the search'and seizure of books and papers, but only requires the defendant or claimant to produce them. That is so; but it declares that if he does not produce them, the allegations which it is affirmed they will prove shall be taken as confessed. This is tantamount to compelling their production; for the prosecuting attorney will always be sure to state the evidence expected to be derived from them as strongly as the case will admit of. It is true that certain aggravating incidents of actual search and seizure, such as forcible entry into a man’s house and searching amongst his papers, are wanting, and to this extent the proceeding under the Act of 1874 is a mitigation of that which was authorized by the former acts; but it accomplishes the substantial object of those acts in forcing from a party evidence against himself. It is our opinion, therefore, that a compulsory production of a man’s private papers to establish a criminal charge against him, or to forfeit his property, is within the scope of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, in all cases in which a search and seizure would be; because it is a material ingredient, and effects the sole object and purpose of search and seizure.”</p>
<p id="b497-6">Concurring, Mr. Justice Miller and Chief Justice Waite said that they did not think the machinery used to get this evidence amounted to a search and seizure, but they agreed that the Fifth Amendment had been violated.</p>
<p id="b497-7">The statute provided an official demand for the production of a paper or document by the defendant for official search and use as evidence on penalty that by refusal he- should be conclusively held to admit the incriminat<page-number citation-index="1" label="460">*460</page-number>ing character of the document as charged. It was certainly no straining of the language to construe the search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to include such official procedure.</p>
<p id="b498-6">The next case, and perhaps the most important, is <em>Weeks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>232 U. S. 383, — a, conviction for using the mails to transmit coupons or tickets in a lottery enterprise. The defendant was arrested by a police; officer without a warrant. After his arrest other police officers and the United States marshal went to his house, got the key from a neighbor,; entered the defendant’s room and searched it, and took possession of various papers and articles. Neither the marshal nor the police officers had a search warrant. The defendant filed a petition in court asking the return of all his property. The court ordered the return of everything not pertinent to the charge, but denied return of relevant evidence. After the jury was sworn, the defendant again made objection, and on introduction of the papers contended that the search without warrant was a violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and they were therefore inadmissible. This court held that such taking of papers by an official of the United States, acting under color of his office, was in violation of the constitutional rights of the defendant, and upon making seasonable application he was entitled to have them restored, and that by permitting their use upon the trial, the trial court erred.</p>
<p id="b498-7">The opinion cited with approval language of Mr. Justice Field in <em>Ex parte Jackson, </em>96 U. S. 727, 733, saying that the Fourth Amendment as a principle of protection was applicable to sealed letters and packages in the mail and that, consistently with it, such matter could only be opened and examined upon warrants issued on oath or affirmation particularly describing the thing to be seized.</p>
<p id="b498-8">In <em>Silverthorne Lumber Company </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U. S. 385, the deféndants were arrested at their homes and <page-number citation-index="1" label="461">*461</page-number>detained in custody. While so detained, representatives of the Government without authority went to the office of their company and seized all the books, papers' and documents found there. An application for return of the things was opposed by the District Attorney, who produced a subpoena for certain documents relating to thé charge in the indictment then on file. The court said:</p>
<p id="b499-4">“Thus the case is not that of knowledge acquired through the wrongful act of a stranger, but it must be assumed that the Government planned or at all events ratified the- whole performance.”</p>
<p id="b499-5">And it held that the illegal character of the original seizure characterized the entire proceeding and under the <em>Weeks </em>case the seized papers must be restored.</p>
<p id="b499-6">In' <em>Amos </em>v. <em>United States, </em>255 U. S. 313, the. defendant was convicted of concealing whiskey on which the tax had not been paid. At the trial he presented a petition asking that private property seized in a search of his house and store “ within his curtilage,” without warrant should be returned. This was denied, A woman, who claimed to be his wife, was told by the revenue officers that they had come to search the premises for violation of the revenue law. She opened the door; they entered and found whiskey. Further searches in the house disclosed more. It was held that this action constituted a violation of the Fourth Amendment, and that the denial of the motion to restore the whiskey and to exclude the testimony was error.</p>
<p id="b499-7">In <em>Gouled </em>v. <em>The United States, </em>255 U. S. 298, the facts were these: Gouled and two others were charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States. One pleaded guilty and another was acquitted. Gouled prosecuted error. The matter was presented here on questions propounded by the lower court. The first related to the admission ih evidence of a paper surreptitiously taken from the office of the defendant by one acting under the direc<page-number citation-index="1" label="462">*462</page-number>tion of an officer of the Intelligence Department of the Army of the United States. Gouled was suspected of the crime. A private in the U. S. Army, pretending to make a friendly call on him, gained admission to his office and in his absence, without warrant of any character, seized and carried away several documents. One of these belonging to Gouled, was delivered to the United States Attorney and by him introduced in evidence. When produced, it was a surprise to the defendant. He had had no opportunity to make .a previous motion to secure a return of it. The paper had no pecuniary value, but was relevant to the issue made on the trial. Admission of the paper was considered a violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p id="b500-5"><em>Agnello </em>v. <em>United States, </em>269 U. S. 20, held that the Fourth and Fifth Amendments were violated by admission in evidence of contraband narcotics found in defendant’s house, several blocks distant from the place of arrest, after his arrest, and seized there without a warrant. Under such circumstances the seizure could not be justified as incidental to the arrest.</p>
<p id="b500-6">There is no room in the present case for applying the Fifth Amendment .unless the Fourth Amendment was first violated. There was no evidence of compulsion to induce the defendants to talk over their many telephones. They were continually and voluntarily transacting business without knowledge of the interception. Our consideration must be confined to the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p id="b500-7">The striking outcome of the <em>Weeks </em>case and those which followed it was the sweeping declaration that the Fourth Amendment, although not referring to or limiting the use of evidence in courts, really forbade its introduction if obtained by government officers through a violation of the Amendment. Theretofore many had supposed that under the ordinary common law rules, if the tendered evidence was pertinent, the method of obtaining it was <page-number citation-index="1" label="463">*463</page-number>unimportant. This was held by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>2 Metcalf, 329, 337. There it was ruled that the only remedy open to a defendant whose rights under a state constitutional equivalent of the Fourth Amendment had been invaded was by- suit and judgment for damages, as Lord Camden held in <em>Entick </em>v. <em>Carrington, </em>19 Howell State Trials, 1029. Mr. Justice Bradley made effective use of this case in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States. </em>But in the <em>Weeks </em>case, and those which followed, this Court decided with great emphasis, and established as the law for the federal courts, that the protection of the Fourth Amendment would be much impaired 'unless it was held that not only was the official violator of the rights under the Amendment subject to action at the suit of the injured defendant, but also that the evidence thereby obtained could not be received.</p>
<p id="b501-3">The well known historical purpose of the Fourth Amendment, directed against general warrants and writs of assistance, was to prevent the use of governmental force to search a man’s house, his person, his papers and his effects; and to prevent their seizure against his will. This phase of the misuse of governmental power of compulsion is the emphasis of the opinion of the Court in the <em>Boyd </em>case. This appears too in the <em>Weeks </em>case, in the <em>Silverthorne </em>case and ih the <em>Amos </em>case.</p>
<p id="b501-4"><em>Gouled </em>v. <em>United States </em>carried the inhibition against unreasonable searches and seizures to the extreme limit. Its authority is not to be enlarged by implication and must be confined to the precise state of facts disclosed by the record. A representative of the Intelligence Department of the Army, having by stealth obtained admission to the defendant’s office, seized and carried away certain private papers valuable for evidential purposes. This was held an unreasonable search and seizure within the Fourth Amendment. A stealthy entrance in such cir<page-number citation-index="1" label="464">*464</page-number>cumstances became the equivalent to an entry by force.. There was actual entrance into the private quarters of defendant and the taking away of something tangible. Here we have testimony only of voluntary conversations secretly overheard.</p>
<p id="b502-4">The Amendment itself shows that the search is to be of material things — the person, the house, his papers or his effects. The description of the warrant necessary to make the proceeding lawful, is that it must specify the place to be searched and the person or <em>things </em>to be seized.</p>
<p id="b502-5">It is urged that the language of Mr. Justice Field in <em>Ex parte Jackson, </em>already quoted, offers an analogy to the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment in respect of wire tapping. But the analogy fails. The Fourth Amendment may have proper application to a sealed letter in the mail because of the constitutional provision for the Postoffice Department and the relations between the Government and those who pay to secure protection of their sealed letters. See Revised Statutes, §§ 3978 to 3988, whereby Congress monopolizes the carriage of letters and excludes from that business everyone else, and § 3929 which forbids any postmaster or other person to open any letter not addressed to himself. It is plainly within the words of the Amendment to say that the unlawful rifling by a government agent of a sealed letter is a search and seizure of the sender’s papers or effects. The letter is a paper, an effect, and in the custody of a Government that forbids carriage except under its protection. .</p>
<p id="b502-6">The United States takes no such care of telegraph or telephone messages as of mailed sealed letters. The Amendment does not forbid what was done here. There was no searching. There was no seizure. The evidence, was secured by the use of the sense of hearing and that only. There was no entry of the houses or offices of the defendants, .</p>
<p id="b503-2"><page-number citation-index="1" label="465">*465</page-number>By the invention, of the telephone, fifty years ago, and its .application for the purpose of extending communications, one can talk with another at a far distant place. The language of the Amendment can not be extended and expanded to include telephone wires reaching to the whale, world from-the defendant’s ;house or office. The intervening wires are not part of his house or office any more than are the highways along which they are stretched.</p>
<p id="b503-3">This Court in <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U. S. 132, 149, declared:</p>
<p id="AcSb">“The Fourth Amendment is to be construed in the light of what was deemed an unreasonable- search and seizure when it was adopted and in a manner which will conserve public interests as well as the interests and rights of individual citizens,”</p>
<p id="b503-5">Justice Bradley in the <em>Boyd </em>case, and Justice Clark in the <em>Gouled </em>case, said that the Fifth Amendment-and the Fourth Amendment were to be liberally construed to effect the purpose of the framers of the ..Constitution in the interest of liberty. But that dan riot justify enlargement of the language employed beyond the possible practical meaning of houses, persons, papers, and effects, or so to apply the words search and seizure as to forbid hearing or sight.</p>
<p id="b503-6"><em>Hester </em>v. <em>United States, </em>265 U. S. 57, held that the testimony of two officers of the law who trespassed on the defendant’s land, concealed themselves one hundred yards away from his house and saw him come out and hand a bottle of whiskey to another, was not inadmissible. While there was a trespass,-there was no search of person, house, papers &lt;5r effects. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>274 U. S. 559, 563; <em>Eversole </em>v. <em>State, </em>106 Tex, Cr. 567.</p>
<p id="b503-7">Congress may of course protect the secrecy of telephone messages by making them, when intercepted, inadmissible iri evidence in federal criminal trials, by direct legislation, <page-number citation-index="1" label="466">*466</page-number>and thus depart from the common law of evidence. But the courts may not adopt such a policy by attributing an enlarged and unusual meaning to the Fourth Amendment. The reasonable view is that one who installs in his house a telephone instrument with connecting wires intends to' project his voice to those quite outside, and that the wires beyond his house and messages while passing over them are not within the protection of the Fourth Amendment. Here those who intercepted the projected voices were not in the house of either party to the conversation.</p>
<p id="b504-6">Neither the cases we have cited nor any of the many federal decisions brought to our attention hold the Fourth Amendment to have been violated as against a defendant unless there has been an official search and seizure of his person, or such a seizure of his papers or his tangible material effects, or an actual physical invasion of his house <em>“ </em>or curtilage <em>” </em>for the purpose of making a seizure.</p>
<p id="b504-7">We think, therefore, that the wire tapping here disclosed did not amount to a search or seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</p>
<p id="b504-8">What has been said disposes of the only question that comes within the terms of our order granting certiorari in these cases. But some of our number, departing from that order, have concluded that there is merit in the twofold objection overruled in both courts below that evidence obtained through intercepting of telephone messages by government agents wap inadmissible because the mode of obtaining it was unethical and a misdemeanor under the law of Washington. To avoid any misapprehension of our views of that objection we shall deal with' it in both of its phases.</p>
<p id="b504-9">While a Territory, the English common law prevailed in Washington and thus continued after her admission in 1889. The rules of evidence in criminal cases in courts of the United States sitting there, consequently are those of the common law.' <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>12 How. 361, <page-number citation-index="1" label="467">*467</page-number>363, 366; <em>Logan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>144 U. S. 263, 301; <em>Rosen </em>v. <em>United States, </em>245 U. S. 467; <em>Withaup </em>v. <em>United States, </em>127 Fed. 530, 534; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>292 Fed. 683, 685.</p>
<p id="b505-4">The common law rule is that the admissibility of evidence is not affected by the illegality of the means by which it was obtained. Professor Greenleaf in his work on evidence, vol. 1, 12th ed., by Redfield, § 254(a) says:</p>
<p id="b505-5">“ It may be mentioned in this place, that though papers and other subjects of evidence may have been <em>illegally taken </em>from the possession of the party against whom they are offered, or otherwise unlawfully obtained, this is no valid objection to their admissibility, if they are pertinent to the issue. The court will not take notice how they were obtained, whether lawfully or unlawfully, nor will it form an issue, to determine that question.”</p>
<p id="b505-6">Mr. Jones in his work on the same subject refers to Mr. Greenleaf’s statement, and says: ~</p>
<p id="b505-7">“ Where there is no violation of a constitutional guaranty, the verity of the above statement is absolute.” Yol. 5, § 2075, note 3.</p>
<p id="b505-8">The rule is supported by many English and American cases cited by Jones in vol. 5, § 2075, note'3, and § 2076, note 6; and by Wigmore, vol. 4, § 2183. It is recognized by this Court in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>New York, </em>192 U. S. 585. The <em>Weeks </em>case, announced an exception to the common law rule by excluding all evidence in the procuring of which government officials took part by methods forbidden by the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. Many state courts do not follow the <em>Weeks </em>case. <em>People </em>v. <em>Defore, </em>242 N. Y. 13. But those who do, treat it as an exception to the general common law rule and required by constitutional limitations. <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>State, </em>145 Tenn. 544, 551, 566; <em>State </em>v. <em>Wills, </em>91 W. Va. 659, 677; <em>State </em>v. <em>Slamon, </em>73 Vt. 212, 214, 215; <em>Gindrat </em>v. <em>People, </em>138 Ill. 103, 111; <em>People </em>v. <em>Castree, </em>311 Ill. 392, 396, 397; <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index="1" label="468">*468</page-number><em>Gardner, </em>77 Mont. 8, 21; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fahn, </em>53 N. Dak. 203, 210. The cqmmon law rule must apply in the case at bar;</p>
<p id="b506-6">Nor can we, without the sanction of congressional enactment, subscribe to the suggestion that the courts ‘have a discretion to exclude evidence, the admission of which is not unconstitutional, because unethically secured. This would be at variance with the common law doctrine generally supported by authority. There is no case that sustains, nor any recognized text book that gives color to such a view. Our general experience shows that much evidence has always been receivable although not obtained by conformity to the highest ethics. The history of criminal trials shows numerous cases of prosecutions of oath-bound conspiracies for murder, robbery, and othér crimes, where officers of the law have disguised themselves and joined the Organizations, taken the oaths and given themselves every appearance of active members engaged in the promotion of crime, for the purpose-of securing evidence. Evidence secured by such: means has always been received. .</p>
<p id="b506-7">' A standard which would forbid' the reception of evidence if obtained by other than nice ethical conduct by government officials would make society suffer and give criminals greater immunity than has been known heretofore. In the absence of controlling legislation by Congress, those, who realize the difficulties in'bringing offenders to justice may well 'deem it wise that the exclusion of evidence should be confined to cases where rights under the Constitution would be violated by' admitting it.</p>
<p id="b506-8">The statute of Washington, ádopted.in 1909, provides (Remington Compiled Statutes, 1922, § 2656-18) that:</p>
<p id="b506-9">“Every person . .. . who shall intercept, read or in any manner interrupt .or delay the sending of a message over any telegraph or telephone line . . ; shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.” .</p>
<p id="b507-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="469">*469</page-number>This statute does not declare that evidence obtained by such interception shall be inadmissible, and by the common law, already referred to, it would not be. <em>People </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>177 App. Div. (N. Y.) 806. Whether the State of Washington may prosecute and punish federal officers violating this law and those whose messages were intercepted may sue them civilly is not before us. But clearly a statute, passed twenty years after the admission of the State into the Union can not affect the rules of evidence applicable in courts of the United States in criminal cases. Chief Justice Taney, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>12 How. 361, 363, construing the 34th section of the Judiciary Act, said:</p>
<p id="b507-4">“.But it could not be supposed, without very plain words to show it, that Congress intended to give the states the power of prescribing the rules of evidence in trials for offenses against the United States. For. this construction would place the criminal jurisprudence of one'sovereignty under the control of another.” ‘ See also <em>Withaup </em>v. <em>United States, </em>127 Fed. 530, 534.</p>
<p id="b507-5">The judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals are affirmed. The mandates will go down. forthwith under Rule 31.</p>
