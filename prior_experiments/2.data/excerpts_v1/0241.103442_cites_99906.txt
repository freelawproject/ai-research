Such legislation has often been sustained with respect to powers, other than the commerce power granted to the national government, when the means chosen, although not themselves within the granted power, were nevertheless deemed appropriate aids to the accomplishment of some purpose within an admitted power of the national government. See Jacob Ruppert, Inc. v. Caffey, 251 U.S. 264 ; Everard's Breweries v. Day, 265 U.S. 545 , 560; Westfall v. United States, 274 U.S. 256 , 259. As to state power under the Fourteenth Amendment, compare Otis v. Parker, 187 U.S. 606 , 609; St. John v. New York, 201 U.S. 633 ; Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, 226 U.S. 192 , 201-202. A familiar like exercise of power is the regulation of intrastate transactions which are so commingled with or related to interstate commerce that all must be regulated if the interstate commerce is to be effectively controlled. Shreveport Case, 234 U.S. 342 ; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q.R. Co., 257 U.S. 563 ; United States v. New York Central R. Co., supra, 464; Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1 ; Mulford v. Smith, supra . Similarly Congress may require inspection and preventive treatment of all cattle in a disease infected area in order to prevent shipment in interstate commerce of some of the cattle without the treatment. Thornton v. United States, 271 U.S. 414 . It may prohibit the removal, at destination, of labels required by the Pure Food & Drugs Act to be affixed to articles *122 transported in interstate commerce. McDermott v. Wisconsin, 228 U.S. 115 . And we have recently held that Congress in the exercise of its power to require inspection and grading of tobacco shipped in interstate commerce may compel such inspection and grading of all tobacco sold at local auction rooms from which a substantial part but not all of the tobacco sold is shipped in interstate commerce. Currin v. Wallace, supra, 11, and see to the like effect United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., supra, 568, note 37. We think also that ยง 15 (a) (2), now under consideration, is sustainable independently of ยง 15 (a) (1), which prohibits shipment or transportation of the proscribed goods. As we have said the evils aimed at by the Act are the spread of substandard labor conditions through the use of the facilities of interstate commerce for competition by the goods so produced with those produced under the prescribed or better labor conditions; and the consequent dislocation of the commerce itself caused by the impairment or destruction of local businesses by competition made effective through interstate commerce. The Act is thus directed at the suppression of a method or kind of competition in interstate commerce which it has in effect condemned as "unfair," as the Clayton Act has condemned other "unfair methods of competition" made effective through interstate commerce. See Van Camp & Sons Co. v. American Can Co., 278 U.S. 245 ; Federal Trade Comm'n v. Keppel & Bro., 291 U.S. 304 .
