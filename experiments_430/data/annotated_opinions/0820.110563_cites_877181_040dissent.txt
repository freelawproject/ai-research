 Subcommittee on Fossil Fuel Taxation, supra, at 2.  One of the principal sponsors of the severance tax bill explained to the Montana Legislature: “Most of Montana’s coal is shipped out of state to power plants and utility companies in the Midwest.  In reviewing the [long-term] contracts between the coal companies and the utility companies who purchase the coal, all of the contracts that were shown to our Legislative Committee contain an escalation clause for taxes.  In other words, the local companies simply add the additional taxes to their bill, and the entire cost is passed on to the purchasers in the Midwest or elsewhere.  Because most of the purchasers are regulated Utility companies, it is reasonable to assume these companies will, in turn, pass on their extra costs to their customers.” Towe, Explanation of Reasons for Montana’s Coal Tax 4, cited in Brief for Appellants 34.  The Montana Supreme Court observed that under Montana law, facts well pleaded in the complaint must be accepted as true on review of a judgment of dismissal; it therefore necessarily held that appellants could not prevail “under any view of the alleged facts.” —Mont.  —, —, <citedDecision>615 P. 2d 847, 849</citedDecision> (1980).  See also Tr. of Oral Arg. 17-18.  In addition to the severance tax on coal, Montana imposes a gross proceeds tax, Mont. Code Ann. § 15-6-132 (1979), a resource indemnity trust tax, § 15-38-104, a property tax on mining equipment, § 15-6-138 *643 (b), and a corporation license tax, §15-31-101.  See Krutilla, at 50-54.  Furthermore, all costs of reclamation must be borne by the coal companies under both federal and state law, and Montana requires each company to purchase a reclamation bond prior to the commencement of mining operations.  § 82-4-338.  By federal statute, 50% of the “sales, bonuses, royalties, and rentals” of federal public lands are payable to the State within which the leased land lies “to be used by such State and its subdivisions, as the legislature of the State may direct giving priority to those subdivisions of the State socially or economically impacted by development of minerals leased under this chapter, for (i) planning, (ii) construction and maintenance of public facilities, and (iii) provision of public service .

 In contrast, the pole tax was subjected to stricter scrutiny; the Court stated that while interstate commerce must pay its way, the authority remains in the courts, “on proper application, to determine whether, under the conditions prevailing in a given case, the charge made is reasonably proportionate to the service to be rendered and the liabilities involved, or whether it is a disguised attempt to impose a burden on interstate commerce.” Id., at 260 .  The Court has continued to scrutinize carefully taxes on interstate commerce that are designed to reimburse the State for the particular costs imposed by that commerce.  See, e. g„ Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972); Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939); Ingels v. Morf, 300 U. S. 290 (1937).  In analyzing such taxes, it has required that there be factual evidence in the record that “the fees charged do not appear to be manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered.” Clark, 306 U. S., at 599 .  The Court concludes that this test has no bearing here because the Montana Supreme Court held that the coal severance tax was “ ‘imposed for the *648 general support of the government.’ ” Ante, at 621.  In fact, however, the matter is not nearly so clear as the Court suggests.  The Montana court also implied that the tax was designed at least in part to compensate the State for the special costs attributable to coal mining,-Mont., at-, -, <citedDecision>615 P. 2d, at 850, 855</citedDecision> , as have appellees here.  Brief for Appellees 1-3, 26-27.  Indeed, the stated objectives of the 1975 amendment were to: “(a) preserve or modestly increase revenues going to the general fund, (b) to respond to current social impacts attributable to coal development, and (c) to invest in the future, when new energy technologies reduce our dependence on coal and mining activity may decline.” Statement to Accompany the Report of the Free Joint Conference Committees on Coal Taxation 1 (1975).  Since the tax was designed only to “preserve or modestly increase” general revenues, it is appropriate for a court to inquire here whether the “surplus” revenue Montana has received from this severance tax is “manifestly disproportionate” to the present or future costs attributable to coal development.  Complete Auto Transit gave several examples of “tailored” taxes: property taxes designed to differentiate between property used in transportation and other types of property; an income tax using different rates for different types of business; and a tax on the “privilege of doing business in corporate form” that changed with the nature of the corporate activity involved.  430 U. S., at 288, n. 15 .  A severance tax using different rates for different minerals is, of course, directly analogous to these examples.
