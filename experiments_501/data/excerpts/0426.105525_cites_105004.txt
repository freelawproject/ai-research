Article 2 (10) of the UCMJ, 50 U. S. C. § 552 (10), provides that in time of war persons serving with or accompanying the armed forces in the field are subject to court-martial and military law. We believe that Art. 2 (10) sets forth the maximum historically recognized extent of military jurisdiction over civilians under the concept of “in the field.” The Government does not attempt — and quite appropriately so — to support military jurisdiction over Mrs. Smith or Mrs. Covert under Art. 2 (10).  Even during time of war the Constitution must be observed.  Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, at 120 , declares: “The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances.  No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government.” Also see Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries Co., 251 U. S. 146, 156 ; United States v. Commodities Trading Corp., 339 U. S. 121, 125 .  Madsen v. Kinsella, <citedDecision>343 U. S. 341</citedDecision> , is not controlling here.  It concerned trials in enemy territory which had been conquered and held by force of arms and which was being governed at the time by our military forces.  In such areas the Army commander can establish military or civilian commissions as an arm of the occupation to try everyone in the occupied area, whether they are connected with the Army or not.

The officer who convenes the court-martial also has final authority to determine whether charges will be brought in the first place and to pick the board of inquiry, the prosecutor, the defense counsel, and the law officer who serves as legal adviser to the court-martial.


**Dissenting Opinion**
 Article 2 (11) of the present Uniform Code of Military Justice was taken without material change from this provision of the Articles of War.  At the time of enactment of the earlier provision Congress was plainly concerned with the maintenance of discipline and morale of American expeditionary forces composed of both military and civilian personnel.  As pointed out in the Senate Report to the Sixty-fourth Congress at the time Article 2 (d) was adopted: “The existing articles are further defective in that they do not permit the disciplining of these three classes of camp followers in time of peace in places to which the civil jurisdiction of the United States does not extend and where it is contrary to international policy to subject such persons to the local jurisdiction, or where, for other reasons, the law of the local jurisdiction is not applicable, thus leaving these classes practically without liability to punishment for their unlawful acts under such circumstances — as, for example, .  .  .  where such forces so *81 accompanied are engaged in the nonhostile occupation of foreign territory, as was the case during the intervention of 1906-7 in Cuba.” S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess. 37-38.  Since that time the power of Congress to make civilians amenable to military jurisdiction under such circumstances has been considered and sustained by this Court and other federal courts in a number of cases. In Madsen v. Kinsella, <citedDecision>343 U. S. 341</citedDecision> (1952), we sustained the jurisdiction of a military commission to try a civilian wife for the murder of her husband in Germany in 1949.  Unlike Mrs. Smith, the petitioner in <citedDecision>Madsen</citedDecision> contended that a military court-martial had exclusive jurisdiction to try her pursuant to Article of War 2 (d), the predecessor of Article 2 (11).  In upholding the constitutionality of trial by a military commission, we pointed out that its jurisdiction was concurrent with that of' the military court-martial, <citedDecision>343 U. S., at 345</citedDecision> , and that the jurisdiction of both stemmed directly from Article 2 (d), <citedDecision>343 U. S., at 361</citedDecision> .  It is contended that no holding on the validity of court-martial jurisdiction over civilians was necessary to our decision in <citedDecision>Madsen</citedDecision> and that the case itself is distinguishable because occupied territory was involved and hence the action of Congress could be supported under the War Power.  It is true that our reference to concurrent court-martial jurisdiction — when both petitioner and the Government agreed to it — was a concomitant to that decision, but our recognition of the power of Congress to authorize military trial of civilians under the circumstances provided for in Article 2 (d) was essential to the judgment.  <citedDecision>343 U. S., at 361</citedDecision> .  <citedDecision>Madsen</citedDecision> was factually very similar to the present case, and in terms of the relevant considerations involved it is practically indistinguishable.  In <citedDecision>Madsen</citedDecision> , as here, the crime involved was murder of a serviceman by a dependent wife living as a civilian with *82 our armed forces in a foreign country.  In both cases jurisdiction was exercised by a military tribunal pursuant to an Act of Congress authorizing such jurisdiction over all persons accompanying the armed forces outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.  The distinction that in one case the trial was by court-martial and in the other by a military commission is insubstantial.  The contention that jurisdiction could be sustained in <citedDecision>Madsen</citedDecision> under the War Power of Congress but that this power is unavailable to authorize jurisdiction in Smith is likewise without merit.  3 Aside from the fact that this Court has never restricted so narrowly the action that Congress might take under the War Power, see Ashwander v. T. V. A., 297 U. S. 288 (1936), and Silesian-American Corp. v. Clark, 332 U. S. 469 (1947), there is as much, if not more, justification for employment of the War Power in Japan in 1952 as in Germany in 1949.  At the time Mrs. Smith’s crime was committed, Japan was the logistics and aviation base for actual hostilities then being waged in Korea, just across the Sea of Japan.  And in 1949, Germany, after four years of peaceful and uneventful occupation, could hardly be considered an area where Congress could act only under its War Power.  But the salient feature common to both countries was that the problems of maintaining control, morale, and discipline of our military contingents located there were substantially identical.  These problems were not appreciably affected by the fact that one instance occurred during an occupation and the other shortly after a peace treaty had been signed.  Earlier, in Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 327 U. S. 304, 313 (1946), this Court had recognized the “well-established *83 power of the military” to exercise jurisdiction over persons directly connected with the armed forces, and this power has been repeatedly recognized in cases decided in the lower federal courts.
