 The district's Shared Time program, the one most analogous to Title I, provided remedial and "enrichment" classes, at public expense, to students attending nonpublic schools.  The classes were taught during regular school hours by publicly employed teachers, using materials purchased with public funds, on the premises of nonpublic schools.  The Shared Time courses were in subjects designed to supplement the "core curriculum" of the nonpublic schools.  Id., at 375-376 .  Of the 41 nonpublic schools eligible for the program, 40 were "`pervasively sectarian' " in characterthat is, "`the purpos[e] of [those] schools [was] to advance their particular religions.' " Id., at 379 .  The Court conducted its analysis by applying the threepart test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, <citedDecision>403 U. S. 602</citedDecision> (1971): "First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion." 473 U. S., at 382-383 (quoting <citedDecision>Lemon, supra, at 612-613</citedDecision> ) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court acknowledged that the Shared Time program served a purely secular purpose, thereby satisfying the first *219 part of the so-called <citedDecision>Lemon</citedDecision> test.  473 U. S., at 383.  Nevertheless, it ultimately concluded that the program had the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  Id., at 385.  The Court found that the program violated the Establishment Clause's prohibition against "government-financed or government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith" in at least three ways.  Ibid. First, drawing upon the analysis in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975), the Court observed that "the teachers participating in the programs may become involved in intentionally or inadvertently inculcating particular religious tenets or beliefs." 473 U. S., at 385.

 473 U. S., at 395.  The Ball Court likewise placed no weight on the fact that the program was provided to the student rather than to the school.  Nor was the impermissible effect mitigated by the fact that the program only supplemented the courses offered by the parochial schools.  Id., at 395 397.  The New York City Title I program challenged in Aguilar closely resembled the Shared Time program struck down in Ball , but the Court found fault with an aspect of the Title I program not present in Ball : The Board had "adopted a system for monitoring the religious content of publicly funded Title I classes in the religious schools." 473 U. S., at 409.  Even though this monitoring system might prevent the Title I program from being used to inculcate religion, the Court concluded, as it had in <citedDecision>Lemon</citedDecision> and Meek , that the level of monitoring necessary to be "certain" that the program had an exclusively secular effect would "inevitably resul[t] in the excessive entanglement of church and state," thereby running afoul of <citedDecision>Lemon</citedDecision> `s third prong.  473 U. S., at 409; see Lemon, <citedDecision>403 U. S., at 619</citedDecision> (invalidating Rhode Island program on entanglement grounds because "[a] comprehensive, discriminating, and continuing state surveillance will inevitably be required to ensure that th[e] restrictions [against indoctrination] are obeyed"); Meek, supra, at 370 (invalidating Pennsylvania program on entanglement grounds because excessive monitoring would be required for the State to be certain that public school officials do not inculcate religion).  In the majority's view, New York City's Title I program suffered from the "same critical elements of entanglement" present in <citedDecision>Lemon</citedDecision> and Meek : the aid was provided "in a pervasively *222 sectarian environment .  .  .  in the form of teachers," requiring "ongoing inspection .  .. to ensure the absence of a religious message." 473 U. S., at 412.  Such "pervasive monitoring by public authorities in the sectarian schools infringes precisely those Establishment Clause values at the root of the prohibition of excessive entanglement."

 *232 Applying this reasoning to New York City's Title I program, it is clear that Title I services are allocated on the basis of criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion.  34 CFR § 200.10 (b) (1996); see supra, at 209-210.  The services are available to all children who meet the Act's eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school, 20 U. S. C. § 6312 (c)(1)(F).  The Board's program does not, therefore, give aid recipients any incentive to modify their religious beliefs or practices in order to obtain those services.  3 We turn now to Aguilar `s conclusion that New York City's Title I program resulted in an excessive entanglement between church and state.  Whether a government aid program results in such an entanglement has consistently been an aspect of our Establishment Clause analysis.  We have considered entanglement both in the course of assessing whether an aid program has an impermissible effect of advancing religion, Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 674 (1970), and as a factor separate and apart from "effect," <citedDecision>Lemon</citedDecision> v. Kurtzman, <citedDecision>403 U. S., at 612-613</citedDecision> .  Regardless of how we have characterized the issue, however, the factors we use to assess whether an entanglement is "excessive" are similar to the factors we use to examine "effect." That is, to assess entanglement, we have looked to "the character and purposes of the institutions that are benefited, the nature of the aid that the State provides, and the resulting relationship between the government and religious authority." <citedDecision>Id., at 615</citedDecision> .  Similarly, we have assessed a law's "effect" by examining the character of the institutions benefited ( e. g., whether the religious institutions were "predominantly religious"), see Meek, 421 U. S., at 363-364 ; cf. Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 743-744 (1973), and the nature of the aid that the State provided ( e. g., whether it was neutral and nonideological), see Everson, supra, at 18 ; Wolman, 433 *233 U. S., at 244.  Indeed, in <citedDecision>Lemon</citedDecision> itself, the entanglement that the Court found "independently" to necessitate the program's invalidation also was found to have the effect of inhibiting religion.  See, e. g., <citedDecision>403 U. S., at 620</citedDecision> ("[W]e cannot ignore here the danger that pervasive modern governmental power will ultimately intrude on religion .  .  . ").  Thus, it is simplest to recognize why entanglement is significant and treat itas we did in Walz as an aspect of the inquiry into a statute's effect.  Not all entanglements, of course, have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.  Interaction between church and state is inevitable, see <citedDecision>403 U. S., at 614</citedDecision> , and we have always tolerated some level of involvement between the two.  Entanglement must be "excessive" before it runs afoul of the Establishment Clause.  See, e. g., Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S., at 615-617 (no excessive entanglement where government reviews the adolescent counseling program set up by the religious institutions that are grantees, reviews the materials used by such grantees, and monitors the program by periodic visits); Roemer v. Board of Public Works of Md., 426 U. S. 736, 764-765 (1976) (no excessive entanglement where State conducts annual audits to ensure that categorical state grants to religious colleges are not used to teach religion).  The pre- Aguilar Title I program does not result in an "excessive" entanglement that advances or inhibits religion.  As discussed previously, the Court's finding of "excessive" entanglement in Aguilar rested on three grounds: (i) the program would require "pervasive monitoring by public authorities" to ensure that Title I employees did not inculcate religion; (ii) the program required "administrative cooperation" between the Board and parochial schools; and (iii) the program might increase the dangers of "political divisiveness." 473 U. S., at 413-414.  Under our current understanding of the Establishment Clause, the last two considerations are insufficient by themselves to create an "excessive" *234 entanglement.

 The ban against state endorsement of religion addresses the same historical lessons.  Governmental approval of religion tends to reinforce the religious message (at least in the short run) and, by the same token, to carry a message of exclusion to those of less favored views.  See, e. g., Ball, supra, at 390 ("[A]n important concern of the effects test is whether the symbolic union of church and state effected by the challenged governmental action is sufficiently *244 likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a disapproval, of their individual religious choices"); Lee, supra, at 606-607 (Blackmun, J., concurring) ("When the government puts its imprimatur on a particular religion, it conveys a message of exclusion to all those who do not adhere to the favored beliefs.  A government cannot be premised on the belief that allpersons are created equal when it asserts that God prefers some"); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 429 (1962) ("[A]nguish, hardship and bitter strife" result "when zealous religious groups struggl[e] with one another to obtain the Government's stamp of approval").  The human tendency, of course, is to forget the hard lessons, and to overlook the history of governmental partnership with religion when a cause is worthy, and bureaucrats have programs.  That tendency to forget is the reason for having the Establishment Clause (along with the Constitution's other structural and libertarian guarantees), in the hope of stopping the corrosion before it starts.  These principles were violated by the programs at issue in Aguilar and Ball , as a consequence of several significant features common to both Title I, as implemented in New York City before Aguilar , and the Grand Rapids Shared Time program: each provided classes on the premises of the religious schools, covering a wide range of subjects including some at the core of primary and secondary education, like reading and mathematics; while their services were termed "supplemental," the programs and their instructors necessarily assumed responsibility for teaching subjects that the religious schools would otherwise have been obligated to provide, cf. Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 243 (1977) (provision of diagnostic tests to religious schools provides only an incidental benefit); the public employees carrying out the programs had broad responsibilities involving the exercise of considerable discretion, cf. Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 13 (1993) (sign-language interpreter *245 must transmit exactly what is said); Lemon v. Kurtzman, <citedDecision>403 U. S. 602, 616-617</citedDecision> (1971) (distinguishing, for Establishment Clause purposes, books provided by the State to students from teachers paid by the State); while the programs offered aid to nonpublic school students generally (and Title I went to public school students as well), participation by religious school students in each program was extensive, cf. Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 488 (1986) (only one student sought state tuition assistance for religious education); and, finally, aid under Title I and Shared Time flowed directly to the schools in the form of classes and programs, as distinct from indirect aid that reaches schools only as a result of independent private choice, cf. Zobrest, supra, at 12 ("[A]ny attenuated financial benefit that parochial schools do ultimately receive .  .  .  is attributable to `the private choices of individual parents' ") (quoting Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 400 (1983)); Witters, supra, at 487 (aid issued to students reached religious institution "only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients"); Mueller, supra, at 399-400 (same).  What, therefore, was significant in Aguilar and Ball about the placement of state-paid teachers into the physical and social settings of the religious schools was not only the consequent temptation of some of those teachers to reflect the schools' religious missions in the rhetoric of their instruction, with a resulting need for monitoring and the certainty of entanglement.  See Aguilar, 473 U. S., at 412-414 (monitoring); Ball, 473 U. S., at 388 (risk of indoctrination).  What was so remarkable was that the schemes in issue assumed a teaching responsibility indistinguishable from the responsibility of the schools themselves.

 Nothing in this record suggests that a signlanguage interpreter would do more than accurately interpret whatever material is presented to the class as a whole.  In fact, ethical guidelines require interpreters to `transmit everything that is said in exactly the same way it was intended.' " Id., at 13 .  The signer could thus be seen as more like a hearing aid than a teacher, and the signing could not be understood as an opportunity to inject religious content *249 in what was supposed to be secular instruction.  Zobrest accordingly holds only that in these limited circumstances where a public employee simply translates for one student the material presented to the class for the benefit of all students, the employee's presence in the sectarian school does not violate the Establishment Clause.  Id., at 13-14 .  Cf. <citedDecision>Lemon</citedDecision> v. Kurtzman, <citedDecision>403 U. S., at 617</citedDecision> ("[T]eachers have a substantially different ideological character from books [and] [i]n terms of potential for involving some aspect of faith or morals in secular subjects, a textbook's content is ascertainable, but a teacher's handling of a subject is not").  The Court, however, ignores the careful distinction drawn in Zobrest and insists that a full-time public employee such as a Title I teacher is just like the signer, asserting that "there is no reason to presume that, simply because she enters a parochial school classroom, [this] teacher will depart from her assigned duties and instructions and embark on religious indoctrination .  .  .  ." Ante, at 226.  Whatever may be the merits of this position (and I find it short on merit), it does not enjoy the authority of Zobrest .
