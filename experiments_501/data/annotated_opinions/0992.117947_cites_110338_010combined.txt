 The record does not reveal how Gonzales obtained its certification as a small disadvantaged business.  After losing the guardrail subcontract to Gonzales, Adarand filed suit against various federal officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, claiming that the race-based presumptions involved in the use of subcontracting compensation clauses violate Adarand's right to equal protection.  The District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment.  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner, 790 F. Supp. 240 (1992).  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  16 F. 3d 1537 (1994).  It understood our decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448</citedDecision> (1980), to have adopted "a lenient standard, resembling intermediate scrutiny, in assessing" the constitutionality of federal race-based action.  16 F. 3d, at 1544.  Applying that "lenient standard," as further developed in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990), the Court of Appeals upheld the use of subcontractor compensation clauses.  16 F. 3d, at 1547.  We granted certiorari.  512 U. S. 1288 (1994).  II Adarand, in addition to its general prayer for "such other and further relief as to the Court seems just and equitable," specifically seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against any future use of subcontractor compensation clauses.
**Combined Opinion**
 He concluded that "[r]acial and ethnic distinctions of any sort are inherently suspect and thus call for the most exacting judicial examination." Id., at 291 .  On the other hand, four Justices in Bakke would have applied a less stringent standard of review to racial classifications "designed to further remedial purposes," see id., at 359 (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun, JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  And four Justices thought the case should be decided on statutory grounds.  Id., at 411-412, 421 (Stevens, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Stewart and Rehnquist, *219 JJ., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Two years after Bakke , the Court faced another challenge to remedial race-based action, this time involving action undertaken by the Federal Government.  In Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448</citedDecision> (1980), the Court upheld Congress' inclusion of a 10% set-aside for minority-owned businesses in the Public Works Employment Act of 1977.  As in Bakke , there was no opinion for the Court. Chief Justice Burger, in an opinion joined by Justices White and Powell, observed that "[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination to make sure that it does not conflict with constitutional guarantees." <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 491</citedDecision> .  That opinion, however, "d[id] not adopt, either expressly or implicitly, the formulas of analysis articulated in such cases as [Bakke] ." <citedDecision>Id., at 492</citedDecision> .  It employed instead a two-part test which asked, first, "whether the objectives of th[e] legislation are within the power of Congress," and second, "whether the limited use of racial and ethnic criteria, in the context presented, is a constitutionally permissible means for achieving the congressional objectives." <citedDecision>Id., at 473</citedDecision> .  It then upheld the program under that test, adding at the end of the opinion that the program also "would survive judicial review under either `test' articulated in the several Bakke opinions." Id., at 492.  Justice Powell wrote separately to express his view that the plurality opinion had essentially applied "strict scrutiny" as described in his Bakke opinion i.  e., it had determined that the set-aside was "a necessary means of advancing a compelling governmental interest"and had done so correctly.  <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> (concurring opinion).  Justice Stewart (joined by thenJustice Rehnquist) dissented, arguing that the Constitution required the Federal Government to meet the same strict standard as the States when enacting racial classifications, <citedDecision>id., at 523</citedDecision> , and n. 1, and that the program before the Court failed that standard.  Justice Stevens also dissented, *220 arguing that "[r]acial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification," <citedDecision>id., at 537</citedDecision> , and that the program before the Court could not be characterized "as a `narrowly tailored' remedial measure." <citedDecision>Id., at 541</citedDecision> .  Justice Marshall (joined by Justices Brennan and Blackmun) concurred in the judgment, reiterating the view of four Justices in Bakke that any race-based governmental action designed to "remed[y] the present effects of past racial discrimination" should be upheld if it was "substantially related" to the achievement of an "important governmental objective" i.  e., such action should be subjected only to what we now call "intermediate scrutiny." <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 518-519</citedDecision> .  In Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), the Court considered a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to another form of remedial racial classification.  The issue in Wygant was whether a school board could adopt race-based preferences in determining which teachers to lay off.  Justice Powell's plurality opinion observed that "the level of scrutiny does not change merely because the challenged classification operates against a group that historically has not been subject to governmental discrimination," id., at 273 , and stated the two-part inquiry as "whether the layoff provision is supported by a compelling state purpose and whether the means chosen to accomplish that purpose are narrowly tailored." Id., at 274 .  In other words, "racial classifications of any sort must be subjected to `strict scrutiny.' " Id., at 285 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
**Combined Opinion**
Id., at 295 .  Four Justices dissented, three of whom again argued for intermediate scrutiny of remedial race-based government action.  Id., at 301-302 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan and Blackmun, JJ., dissenting).  The Court's failure to produce a majority opinion in Bakke, Fullilove, and Wygant left unresolved the proper analysis for remedial race-based governmental action.  See United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S., at 166 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.) ("[A]lthough this Court has consistently held that some elevated level of scrutiny is required when a racial or ethnic distinction is made for remedial purposes, it has yet to reach consensus on the appropriate constitutional analysis"); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 480 (1986) (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.).  Lower courts found this lack of guidance unsettling.  See, e. g., Kromnick v. School Dist. of Philadelphia, 739 F. 2d 894 , 901 (CA3 1984) ("The absence of an Opinion of the Court in either Bakke or <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> and the concomitant failure of the Court to articulate an analytic framework supporting the judgments makes the position of the lower federal courts considering the constitutionality of affirmative action programs somewhat vulnerable"), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 1107 (1985); Williams v. New Orleans, 729 F. 2d 1554, 1567 (CA5 1984) (en banc) (Higginbotham, J., concurring specially); South Florida Chapter of Associated General Contractors of America, Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade County, Fla., 723 F. 2d 846, 851 (CA11), cert. denied, 469 U. S. 871 (1984).  The Court resolved the issue, at least in part, in 1989.  Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), concerned a *222 city's determination that 30% of its contracting work should go to minority-owned businesses.  A majority of the Court in Croson held that "the standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification," and that the single standard of review for racial classifications should be "strict scrutiny." Id., at 493-494 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White and Kennedy, JJ.); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("I agree .  .  .

 .  has the authority to eradicate the effects of private discrimination within its own legislative jurisdiction," id., at 491-492 , but the Court thought that the city had not acted with "a `strong basis in evidence for its conclusion that remedial action was necessary,' " id., at 500 (majority opinion) (quoting Wygant, supra, at 277 (plurality opinion)).  The Court also thought it "obvious that [the] program is not narrowly tailored to remedy the effects of prior discrimination." 488 U. S., at 508 .  With Croson, the Court finally agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict scrutiny of all race-based action by state and local governments.  But Croson of course had no occasion to declare what standard of review the Fifth Amendment requires for such action taken by the Federal Government.  Croson observed simply that the Court's "treatment of an exercise of congressional power in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> cannot be dispositive here," because Croson `s facts did not implicate Congress' broad power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Id., at 491 (plurality opinion); see also id., at 522 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) ("[W]ithout revisiting what we held in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> .  .  .  , I do not believe our decision in that case controls the one before us here").  On the other hand, the Court subsequently indicated that Croson had at least some bearing on federal race-based action *223 when it vacated a decision upholding such action and remanded for further consideration in light of Croson.  H. K. Porter Co. v. Metropolitan Dade County, 489 U. S. 1062 (1989); see also Shurberg Broadcasting of Hartford, Inc. v. FCC, 876 F. 2d 902, 915, n. 16 (CADC 1989) (opinion of Silberman, J.) (noting the Court's action in H. K. Porter Co. ), rev'd sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990).  Thus, some uncertainty persisted with respect to the standard of review for federal racial classifications.  See, e. g., Mann v. Albany, 883 F. 2d 999, 1006 (CA11 1989) ( Croson "may be applicable to race-based classifications imposed by Congress"); Shurberg, 876 F. 2d, at 910 (noting the difficulty of extracting general principles from the Court's fractured opinions); id., at 959 (Wald, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (" Croson certainly did not resolve the substantial questions posed by congressional programs which mandate the use of racial preferences"); Winter Park Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 873 F. 2d 347 , 366 (CADC 1989) (Williams, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("The unresolved ambiguity of <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> and Croson leaves it impossible to reach a firm opinion as to the evidence of discrimination needed to sustain a congressional mandate of racial preferences"), aff'd sub nom. Metro Broadcasting, supra .  Despite lingering uncertainty in the details, however, the Court's cases through Croson had established three general propositions with respect to governmental racial classifications.  First, skepticism: "`Any preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination,' " Wygant, 476 U. S., at 273 (plurality opinion of Powell, J.); Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 491</citedDecision> (opinion of Burger, C. J.); see also <citedDecision>id., at 523</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., dissenting) ("[A]ny official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect"); McLaughlin, 379 U. S., at 192 ("[R]acial classifications [are] `constitutionally suspect' "); Hirabayashi, 320 U. S., at 100 ("Distinctions *224 between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people").  Second, consistency: "[T]he standard of review under the Equal Protection Clause is not dependent on the race of those burdened or benefited by a particular classification," Croson, 488 U. S., at 494 (plurality opinion); id., at 520 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also Bakke, 438 U. S., at 289-290 (opinion of Powell, J.), i.  e., all racial classifications reviewable under the Equal Protection Clause must be strictly scrutinized.  And third, congruence: "Equal protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment," Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S., at 93 ; see also Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U. S., at 638, n. 2 ; Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S., at 500 .  Taken together, these three propositions lead to the conclusion that any person, of whatever race, has the right to demand that any governmental actor subject to the Constitution justify any racial classification subjecting that person to unequal treatment under the strictest judicial scrutiny.  Justice Powell's defense of this conclusion bears repeating here: "If it is the individual who is entitled to judicial protection against classifications based upon his racial or ethnic background because such distinctions impinge upon personal rights, rather than the individual only because of his membership in a particular group, then constitutional standards may be applied consistently.  Political judgments regarding the necessity for the particular classification may be weighed in the constitutional balance, [Korematsu] , but the standard of justification will remain constant.
**Combined Opinion**
Post, at 246.  What he fails to recognize is that strict scrutiny does take "relevant differences" into accountindeed, that is its fundamental purpose.  The point of carefully examining the interest asserted by the government in support of a racial classification, and the evidence offered to show that the classification is needed, is precisely to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of race in governmental decisionmaking.  See supra, at 226.  And Justice Stevens concedes that "some cases may be difficult to classify," post, at 245, and n. 4; all the more reason, in our view, to examine all racial classifications carefully.  Strict scrutiny does not "trea[t] dissimilar race-based decisions as though they were equally objectionable," post, at 245; to the contrary, it evaluates carefully all governmental race-based decisions in order to decide which are constitutionally objectionable and which are not.  By requiring strict scrutiny of racial classifications, we require courts to make sure that a governmental classification based on race, which "so seldom provide[s] a relevant basis for disparate treatment," Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 534</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., dissenting), is legitimate, before permitting unequal treatment based on race to proceed.  Justice Stevens chides us for our "supposed inability to differentiate between `invidious' and `benign' discrimination," because it is in his view sufficient that "people understand the difference between good intentions and bad." Post, at 245.  But, as we have just explained, the point of strict scrutiny is to "differentiate between" permissible and impermissible governmental use of race.  And Justice Stevens himself has already explained in his dissent in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> why "good intentions" alone are not enough to sustain *229 a supposedly "benign" racial classification: "[E]ven though it is not the actual predicate for this legislation, a statute of this kind inevitably is perceived by many as resting on an assumption that those who are granted this special preference are less qualified in some respect that is identified purely by their race.  Because that perception especially when fostered by the Congress of the United States can only exacerbate rather than reduce racial prejudice, it will delay the time when race will become a truly irrelevant, or at least insignificant, factor.  Unless Congress clearly articulates the need and basis for a racial classification, and also tailors the classification to its justification, the Court should not uphold this kind of statute." Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 545</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion) (emphasis added; footnote omitted); see also <citedDecision>id., at 537</citedDecision> ("Racial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification"); Croson, 488 U. S., at 516-517 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) ("Although [the legislation at issue] stigmatizes the disadvantaged class with the unproven charge of past racial discrimination, it actually imposes a greater stigma on its supposed beneficiaries"); supra, at 226; but cf. post, at 245-246 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  These passages make a persuasive case for requiring strict scrutiny of congressional racial classifications.  Perhaps it is not the standard of strict scrutiny itself, but our use of the concepts of "consistency" and "congruence" in conjunction with it, that leads Justice Stevens to dissent.  According to Justice Stevens, our view of consistency "equate[s] remedial preferences with invidious discrimination," post, at 246, and ignores the difference between "an engine of oppression" and an effort "to foster equality in society," or, more colorfully, "between a `No Trespassing' sign and a welcome mat," post, at 243, 245.  It does nothing of the kind.  The principle of consistency simply means that whenever the government treats any person unequally because *230 of his or her race, that person has suffered an injury that falls squarely within the language and spirit of the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection.  It says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny.
**Combined Opinion**
 Consistency does recognize that any individual suffers an injury when he or she is disadvantaged by the government because of his or her race, whatever that race may be.  This Court clearly stated that principle in Croson, see 488 U. S., at 493-494 (plurality opinion); id., at 520-521 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); see also Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 643 (1993); Powers v. Ohio, 499 U. S. 400, 410 (1991).  Justice Stevens does not explain how his views square with Croson, or with the long line of cases understanding equal protection as a personal right.  Justice Stevens also claims that we have ignored any difference between federal and state legislatures.  But requiring that Congress, like the States, enact racial classifications only when doing so is necessary to further a "compelling interest" does not contravene any principle of appropriate respect for a coequal branch of the Government.  It is true that various Members of this Court have taken different views of the authority § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment confers upon Congress to deal with the problem of racial discrimination, and the extent to which courts should defer to Congress' exercise of that authority.  See, e. g., Metro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 605-606 (O'Connor, J., dissenting); Croson, 488 U. S., at 486-493 (opinion of O'Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White, J.); id., at 518-519 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 521-524 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 472-473</citedDecision> (opinion of Burger, *231 C. J.); <citedDecision>id., at 500-502</citedDecision> , and nn. 2-3, 515, and n. 14 (Powell, J., concurring); <citedDecision>id., at 526-527</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., dissenting).  We need not, and do not, address these differences today.  For now, it is enough to observe that Justice Stevens' suggestion that any Member of this Court has repudiated in this case his or her previously expressed views on the subject, post, at 249-253, 256-257, is incorrect.  C "Although adherence to precedent is not rigidly required in constitutional cases, any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification." Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 212 (1984).  In deciding whether this case presents such justification, we recall Justice Frankfurter's admonition that " stare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience." Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).
**Combined Opinion**
 We also note that reliance on a case that has recently departed from precedent is likely to be minimal, particularly where, as here, the rule set forth in that case is unlikely to affect primary conduct in any event.  Cf. Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U. S. 265, 272 (1995) (declining to overrule Southland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U. S. 1 (1984), where "private parties have likely written contracts relying upon Southland as authority" in the 10 years since Southland was decided).  Justice Stevens takes us to task for what he perceives to be an erroneous application of the doctrine of stare decisis.  But again, he misunderstands our position.  We have acknowledged that, after Croson, "some uncertainty persisted with respect to the standard of review for federal racial classifications," supra, at 223, and we therefore do not say that we "merely restor[e] the status quo ante " today, post, at 257.  But as we have described supra, at 213-227, we think that well-settled legal principles pointed toward a conclusion different from that reached in Metro Broadcasting, and we therefore disagree with Justice Stevens that "the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the Court reached," post, at 257.  We also disagree with Justice Stevens that Justice Stewart's dissenting opinion in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> supports his "novelty" argument, see post, at 258-259, and n. 13.  Justice Stewart said that "[u]nder our Constitution, any official action that treats a person differently on account of his race or ethnic origin is inherently suspect and presumptively invalid," and that "`[e]qual protection analysis in the Fifth Amendment area is the same as that under the Fourteenth Amendment.' " Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 523</citedDecision> , and n. 1.  He took the view that "[t]he hostility of the Constitution to racial classifications by government has been manifested in many cases decided by this Court," and that "our cases have made clear that the Constitution is *235 wholly neutral in forbidding such racial discrimination, whatever the race may be of those who are its victims." <citedDecision>Id., at 524</citedDecision> .  Justice Stewart gave no indication that he thought he was addressing a "novel" proposition, post, at 259.  Rather, he relied on the fact that the text of the Fourteenth Amendment extends its guarantee to "persons," and on cases like Buckley, Loving, McLaughlin, Bolling, Hirabayashi, and Korematsu, see <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 524-526</citedDecision> , as do we today.  There is nothing new about the notion that Congress, like the States, may treat people differently because of their race only for compelling reasons.  "The real problem," Justice Frankfurter explained, "is whether a principle shall prevail over its later misapplications." Helvering, 309 U. S., at 122 .  Metro Broadcasting `s untenable distinction between state and federal racial classifications lacks support in our precedent, and undermines the fundamental principle of equal protection as a personal right.  In this case, as between that principle and "its later misapplications," the principle must prevail.  D Our action today makes explicit what Justice Powell thought implicit in the <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> lead opinion: Federal racial classifications, like those of a State, must serve a compelling governmental interest, and must be narrowly tailored to further that interest.  See Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> (concurring opinion).  (Recall that the lead opinion in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> "d[id] not adopt .  .  .  the formulas of analysis articulated in such cases as [Bakke] ." <citedDecision>Id., at 492</citedDecision> (opinion of Burger, C. J.).) Of course, it follows that to the extent (if any) that <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> held federal racial classifications to be subject to a less rigorous standard, it is no longer controlling.  But we need not decide today whether the program upheld in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> would survive strict scrutiny as our more recent cases have defined it.  *236 Some have questioned the importance of debating the proper standard of review of race-based legislation.  See, e. g., post, at 247 (Stevens, J., dissenting); Croson, 488 U. S., at 514-515 , and n. 5 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); cf. Metro Broadcasting, 497 U. S., at 610 (O'Connor, J., dissenting) ("This dispute regarding the appropriate standard of review may strike some as a lawyers' quibble over words").  But we agree with Justice Stevens that, "[b]ecause racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment, and because classifications based on race are potentially so harmful to the entire body politic, it is especially important that the reasons for any such classification be clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate," and that "[r]acial classifications are simply too pernicious to permit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification." <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 533-535, 537</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion) (footnotes omitted).  We think that requiring strict scrutiny is the best way to ensure that courts will consistently give racial classifications that kind of detailed examination, both as to ends and as to means.  Korematsu demonstrates vividly that even "the most rigid scrutiny" can sometimes fail to detect an illegitimate racial classification, compare Korematsu, 323 U. S., at 223 ("To cast this case into outlines of racial prejudice, without reference to the real military dangers which were presented, merely confuses the issue.  Korematsu was not excluded from the Military Area because of hostility to him or his race"), with Pub. L. 100-383, § 2 (a), 102 Stat. 903 -904 ("[T]hese actions [of relocating and interning civilians of Japanese ancestry] were carried out without adequate security reasons .  .  .  and were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership").  Any retreat from the most searching judicial inquiry can only increase the risk of another such error occurring in the future.  *237 Finally, we wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is "strict in theory, but fatal in fact." <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 519</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).  The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.  As recently as 1987, for example, every Justice of this Court agreed that the Alabama Department of Public Safety's "pervasive, systematic, and obstinate discriminatory conduct" justified a narrowly tailored racebased remedy.  See United States v. Paradise, 480 U. S., at 167 (plurality opinion of Brennan, J.); id., at 190 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 196 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).  When race-based action is necessary to further a compelling interest, such action is within constitutional constraints if it satisfies the "narrow tailoring" test this Court has set out in previous cases. IV Because our decision today alters the playing field in some important respects, we think it best to remand the case to the lower courts for further consideration in light of the principles we have announced.  The Court of Appeals, following Metro Broadcasting and <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> , analyzed the case in terms of intermediate scrutiny.  It upheld the challenged statutes and regulations because it found them to be "narrowly tailored to achieve [their] significant governmental purpose of providing subcontracting opportunities for small disadvantaged business enterprises." 16 F. 3d, at 1547 (emphasis added).  The Court of Appeals did not decide the question whether the interests served by the use of subcontractor compensation clauses are properly described as "compelling." It also did not address the question of narrow tailoring in terms of our strict scrutiny cases, by asking, for example, whether there was "any consideration of the use of *238 race-neutral means to increase minority business participation" in government contracting, Croson, supra, at 507 , or whether the program was appropriately limited such that it"will not last longer than the discriminatory effects it is designed to eliminate," <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 513</citedDecision> (Powell, J., concurring).  Moreover, unresolved questions remain concerning the details of the complex regulatory regimes implicated by the use of subcontractor compensation clauses.  For example, the SBA's 8(a) program requires an individualized inquiry into the economic disadvantage of every participant, see 13 CFR § 124.106 (a) (1994), whereas the DOT's regulations implementing STURAA § 106(c) do not require certifying authorities to make such individualized inquiries, see 49 CFR § 23.62 (1994); 49 CFR pt. 23, subpt. D, App. C (1994).  And the regulations seem unclear as to whether 8(d) subcontractors must make individualized showings, or instead whether the race-based presumption applies both to social and economic disadvantage, compare 13 CFR § 124.106 (b) (1994) (apparently requiring 8(d) participants to make an individualized showing), with 48 CFR § 19.703 (a)(2) (1994) (apparently allowing 8(d) subcontractors to invoke the racebased presumption for social and economic disadvantage).  See generally Part I, supra. We also note an apparent discrepancy between the definitions of which socially disadvantaged individuals qualify as economically disadvantaged for the 8(a) and 8(d) programs; the former requires a showing that such individuals' ability to compete has been impaired "as compared to others in the same or similar line of business who are not socially disadvantaged, " 13 CFR § 124.106 (a) (1)(i) (1994) (emphasis added), while the latter requires that showing only "as compared to others in the same or similar line of business," § 124.106(b)(1).  The question whether any of the ways in which the Government uses subcontractor compensation clauses can survive strict scrutiny, and any relevance distinctions such as these may have to that question, *239 should be addressed in the first instance by the lower courts.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
**Combined Opinion**
 Unquestionably, "[i]nvidious [racial] discrimination is an engine *241 of oppression," post, at 243 (Stevens, J.,dissenting).  It is also true that "[r]emedial" racial preferences may reflect "a desire to foster equality in society," ibid. But there can be no doubt that racial paternalism and its unintended consequences can be as poisonous and pernicious as any other form of discrimination.  So-called "benign" discrimination teaches many that because of chronic and apparently immutable handicaps, minorities cannot compete with them without their patronizing indulgence.  Inevitably, such programs engender attitudes of superiority or, alternatively, provoke resentment among those who believe that they have been wronged by the government's use of race.  These programs stamp minorities with a badge of inferiority and may cause them to develop dependencies or to adopt an attitude that they are "entitled" to preferences.  Indeed, Justice Stevens once recognized the real harms stemming from seemingly "benign" discrimination.  See Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448, 545</citedDecision> (1980) (Stevens, J.,dissenting) (noting that "remedial" race legislation "is perceived by many as resting on an assumption that those who are granted this special preference are less qualified in some respect that is identified purely by their race").  In my mind, government-sponsored racial discrimination based on benign prejudice is just as noxious as discrimination inspired by malicious prejudice.  [*] In each instance, it is racial discrimination, plain and simple.  *242 Justice Stevens, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.  Instead of deciding this case in accordance with controlling precedent, the Court today delivers a disconcerting lecture about the evils of governmental racial classifications.  For its text the Court has selected three propositions, represented by the bywords "skepticism," "consistency," and "congruence." See ante, at 223-224.  I shall comment on each of these propositions, then add a few words about stare decisis, and finally explain why I believe this Court has a duty to affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I The Court's concept of skepticism is, at least in principle, a good statement of law and of common sense.  Undoubtedly, a court should be wary of a governmental decision that relies upon a racial classification.  "Because racial characteristics so seldom provide a relevant basis for disparate treatment, and because classifications based on race are potentially so harmful to the entire body politic,"a reviewing court must satisfy itself that the reasons for any such classification are "clearly identified and unquestionably legitimate." Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448, 533-535</citedDecision> (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This principle is explicit in Chief Justice Burger's opinion, <citedDecision>id., at 480</citedDecision> ; in Justice Powell's concurrence, <citedDecision>id., at 496</citedDecision> ; and in my dissent in Fullilove, id., at 533-534.  I welcome its renewed endorsement by the Court today.  But, as the opinions in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> demonstrate, substantial agreement on the standard to be applied in deciding difficult cases does not necessarily lead to agreement on how those cases actually should or will be resolved.  In my judgment, because uniform standards are often anything but uniform, we should evaluate the Court's comments on "consistency," "congruence," and stare decisis with the same type of skepticism that the Court advocates for the underlying issue.  *243 II The Court's concept of "consistency" assumes that there is no significant difference between a decision by the majority to impose a special burden on the members of a minority race and a decision by the majority to provide a benefit to certain members of that minority notwithstanding its incidental burden on some members of the majority.  In my opinion that assumption is untenable.  There is no moral or constitutional equivalence between a policy that is designed to perpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicate racial subordination.  Invidious discrimination is an engine of oppression, subjugating a disfavored group to enhance or maintain the power of the majority.  Remedial race-based preferences reflect the opposite impulse: a desire to foster equality in society.
**Combined Opinion**
 In my opinion that assumption is untenable.  It ignores important practical and legal differences between federal and state or local decisionmakers.  These differences have been identified repeatedly and consistently both in opinions of the Court and in separate opinions authored by Members of today's majority.  Thus, in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990), in which we upheld a federal program designed to foster racial diversity in broadcasting, we identified the special "institutional *250 competence" of our National Legislature.  Id., at 563 .  "It is of overriding significance in these cases," we were careful to emphasize, "that the FCC's minority ownership programs have been specifically approvedindeed, mandatedby Congress." Ibid. We recalled the several opinions in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> that admonished this Court to "`approach our task with appropriate deference to the Congress, a coequal branch charged by the Constitution with the power to "provide for the .  .  .  general Welfare of the United States" and "to enforce, by appropriate legislation," the equal protection guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.' [ <citedDecision>Fullilove,</citedDecision> 448 U. S.], at 472; see also <citedDecision>id., at 491</citedDecision> ; <citedDecision>id., at 510</citedDecision> , and 515-516, n. 14 (Powell, J., concurring); <citedDecision>id., at 517-520</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)." 497 U. S., at 563 .  We recalled that the opinions of Chief Justice Burger and Justice Powell in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> had "explained that deference was appropriate in light of Congress' institutional competence as the National Legislature, as well as Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause, the Spending Clause, and the Civil War Amendments." 497 U. S., at 563 (citations and footnote omitted).  The majority in Metro Broadcasting and the plurality in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> were not alone in relying upon a critical distinction between federal and state programs.  In his separate opinion in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469, 520-524 (1989), Justice Scalia discussed the basis for this distinction.  He observed that "it is one thing to permit racially based conduct by the Federal Governmentwhose legislative powers concerning matters of race were explicitly enhanced by the Fourteenth Amendment, see U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 5and quite another to permit it by the precise entities against whose conduct in matters of race that Amendment was specifically directed, see Amdt. 14, § 1." Id., at 521-522.  Continuing, Justice Scalia explained why a "sound distinction between federal and state (or local) action based on race rests not only upon the substance of the *251 Civil War Amendments, but upon social reality and governmental theory." Id., at 522.  "What the record shows, in other words, is that racial discrimination against any group finds a more ready expression at the state and local than at the federal level.
**Combined Opinion**
 An acute awareness of the heightened danger of oppression from political factions in small, rather than large, political units dates to the very beginning of our national history.  See G. Wood, The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787, pp. 499-506 (1969).  As James Madison observed in support of the proposed Constitution's enhancement of national powers: "`The smaller the society, the fewer probably will be the distinct parties and interests composing it; the fewer the distinct parties and interests, the more frequently will a majority be found of the same party; and the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plan of oppression.  Extend the sphere and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens; or if such a common motive exists, it will be more difficult for all who feel it to discover their own strength and to act in unison with each other.' The Federalist No. 10, pp. 82-84 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)." Id., at 523 (opinion concurring in judgment).  In her plurality opinion in Croson, Justice O'Connor also emphasized the importance of this distinction when she responded to the city's argument that <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> was controlling.  She wrote: *252 "What appellant ignores is that Congress, unlike any State or political subdivision, has a specific constitutional mandate to enforce the dictates of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The power to `enforce' may at times also include the power to define situations which Congress determines threaten principles of equality and to adopt prophylactic rules to deal with those situations.  The Civil War Amendments themselves worked a dramatic change in the balance between congressional and state power over matters of race." 488 U. S., at 490 (joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and White, J.) (citations omitted).  An additional reason for giving greater deference to the National Legislature than to a local lawmaking body is that federal affirmative-action programs represent the will of our entire Nation's elected representatives, whereas a state or local program may have an impact on nonresident entities who played no part in the decision to enact it.  Thus, in the state or local context, individuals who were unable to vote for the local representatives who enacted a race-conscious program may nonetheless feel the effects of that program.
**Combined Opinion**
 It provides not a word of direct explanation for its sudden and enormous departure from *253 the reasoning in past cases. Such silence, however, cannot erase the difference between Congress' institutional competence and constitutional authority to overcome historic racial subjugation and the States' lesser power to do so. Presumably, the majority is now satisfied that its theory of "congruence" between the substantive rights provided by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments disposes of the objection based upon divided constitutional powers.  But it is one thing to say (as no one seems to dispute) that the Fifth Amendment encompasses a general guarantee of equal protection as broad as that contained within the Fourteenth Amendment.  It is another thing entirely to say that Congress' institutional competence and constitutional authority entitles it to no greater deference when it enacts a program designed to foster equality than the deference due a state legislature.  [7] The latter is an extraordinary proposition; and, as the foregoing discussion demonstrates, our precedents have rejected it explicitly and repeatedly.  [8] *254 Our opinion in Metro Broadcasting relied on several constitutional provisions to justify the greater deference we owe to Congress when it acts with respect to private individuals.  497 U. S., at 563 .  In the programs challenged in this case, Congress has acted both with respect to private individuals and, as in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> , with respect to the States themselves.  [9] When Congress does this, it draws its power directly from § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  [10] That section reads: *255 "The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article." One of the "provisions of this article" that Congress is thus empowered to enforce reads: "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, § 1.  The Fourteenth Amendment directly empowers Congress at the same time it expressly limits the States.  [11] This is no accident.
**Combined Opinion**
 A rule of "congruence" that ignores a purposeful "incongruity" so fundamental to our system of government is unacceptable.  In my judgment, the Court's novel doctrine of "congruence" is seriously misguided.  Congressional deliberations about a matter as important as affirmative action should be accorded far greater deference than those of a State or municipality.  IV The Court's concept of stare decisis treats some of the language we have used in explaining our decisions as though it *256 were more important than our actual holdings.  In my opinion that treatment is incorrect.  This is the third time in the Court's entire history that it has considered the constitutionality of a federal affirmative-action program.  On each of the two prior occasions, the first in 1980, Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448</citedDecision> , and the second in 1990, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 , the Court upheld the program.  Today the Court explicitly overrules Metro Broadcasting (at least in part), ante, at 227, and undermines <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> by recasting the standard on which it rested and by calling even its holding into question, ante, at 235.  By way of explanation, Justice O'Connor advises the federal agencies and private parties that have made countless decisions in reliance on those cases that "we do not depart from the fabric of the law; we restore it." Ante, at 234.  A skeptical observer might ask whether this pronouncement is a faithful application of the doctrine of stare decisis.  [12] A brief comment on each of the two ailing cases may provide the answer.  In the Court's view, our decision in Metro Broadcasting was inconsistent with the rule announced in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989).  Ante, at 225-226.  But two decisive distinctions separate those two cases. First, Metro Broadcasting involved a federal program, whereas Croson involved a city ordinance.  Metro Broadcasting thus drew primary support from <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> , which predated Croson and which Croson distinguished on the grounds of the federal-state dichotomy that the majority today discredits.  Although Members of today's majority trumpeted the importance of that distinction in Croson, they now reject it in the name of "congruence." It is therefore *257 quite wrong for the Court to suggest today that overruling Metro Broadcasting merely restores the status quo ante, for the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the Court reached.  Today's decision is an unjustified departure from settled law. Second, Metro Broadcasting `s holding rested on more than its application of "intermediate scrutiny." Indeed, I have always believed that, labels notwithstanding, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program we upheld in that case would have satisfied any of our various standards in affirmative-action casesincluding the one the majority fashions today.  What truly distinguishes Metro Broadcasting from our other affirmative-action precedents is the distinctive goal of the federal program in that case. Instead of merely seeking to remedy past discrimination, the FCC program was intended to achieve future benefits in the form of broadcast diversity.  Reliance on race as a legitimate means of achieving diversity was first endorsed by Justice Powell in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 311-319 (1978).  Later, in Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), I also argued that race is not always irrelevant to governmental decisionmaking, see id., at 314-315 (Stevens, J., dissenting); in response, Justice O'Connor correctly noted that, although the school board had relied on an interest in providing black teachers to serve as role models for black students, that interest "should not be confused with the very different goal of promoting racial diversity among the faculty." Id., at 288 , n. She then added that, because the school board had not relied on an interest in diversity, it was not "necessary to discuss the magnitude of that interest or its applicability in this case." Ibid. Thus, prior to Metro Broadcasting, the interest in diversity had been mentioned in a few opinions, but it is perfectly clear that the Court had not yet decided whether that interest had sufficient magnitude to justify a racial classification.  Metro Broadcasting, of course, answered that question in the *258 affirmative.  The majority today overrules Metro Broadcasting only insofar as it is "inconsistent with [the] holding" that strict scrutiny applies to "benign" racial classifications promulgated by the Federal Government.  Ante, at 227.  The proposition that fostering diversity may provide a sufficient interest to justify such a program is not inconsistent with the Court's holding todayindeed, the question is not remotely presented in this caseand I do not take the Court's opinion to diminish that aspect of our decision in Metro Broadcasting.  The Court's suggestion that it may be necessary in the future to overrule <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> in order to restore the fabric of the law, ante, at 235, is even more disingenuous than its treatment of Metro Broadcasting.  For the Court endorses the "strict scrutiny" standard that Justice Powell applied in Bakke , see ante, at 224, and acknowledges that he applied that standard in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> as well, ante, at 218-219.  Moreover, Chief Justice Burger also expressly concluded that the program we considered in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> was valid under any of the tests articulated in Bakke , which of course included Justice Powell's.  <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 492</citedDecision> .  The Court thus adopts a standard applied in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> at the same time it questions that case's continued vitality and accuses it of departing from prior law. I continue to believe that the <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> case was incorrectly decided, see <citedDecision>id., at 532-554</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., dissenting), but neither my dissent nor that filed by Justice Stewart, <citedDecision>id., at 522-532</citedDecision> , contained any suggestion that the issue the Court was resolving had been decided before.  [13] As was true *259 of Metro Broadcasting, the Court in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> decided an important, novel, and difficult question.  Providing a different answer to a similar question today cannot fairly be characterized as merely "restoring" previously settled law. V The Court's holding in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> surely governs the result in this case. The Public Works Employment Act of 1977 (1977 Act), 91 Stat. 116 , which this Court upheld in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> , is different in several critical respects from the portions of the Small Business Act (SBA), 72 Stat. 384 , as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 631 et seq., and STURAA, 101 Stat. 132 , challenged in this case. Each of those differences makes the current program designed to provide assistance to DBE's significantly less objectionable than the 1977 categorical grant of $400 million in exchange for a 10% set-aside in public contracts to "a class of investors defined solely by racial characteristics." Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 532</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., dissenting).  In no meaningful respect is the current scheme more objectionable than the 1977 Act.  Thus, if the 1977 Act was constitutional, then so must be the SBA and STURAA.  Indeed, even if my dissenting views in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> had prevailed, this program would be valid.  Unlike the 1977 Act, the present statutory scheme does not make race the sole criterion of eligibility for participation in the program.  Race does give rise to a rebuttable presumption of social disadvantage which, at least under STURAA, [14] gives rise to a second rebuttable presumption *260 of economic disadvantage.  49 CFR § 23.62 (1994).  But a small business may qualify as a DBE, by showing that it is both socially and economically disadvantaged, even if it receives neither of these presumptions.  13 CFR §§ 124.105 (c), 124.106 (1995); 48 CFR § 19.703 (1994); 49 CFR pt. 23, subpt. D., Apps.  A and C (1994).  Thus, the current preference is more inclusive than the 1977 Act because it does not make race a necessary qualification.  More importantly, race is not a sufficient qualification.  Whereas a millionaire with a long history of financial successes, who was a member of numerous social clubs and trade associations, would have qualified for a preference under the 1977 Act merely because he was an Asian-American or an African-American, see Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 537-538, 540, 543-544</citedDecision> , and n. 16, 546 (Stevens, J., dissenting), neither the SBA nor STURAA creates any such anomaly.  The DBE program excludes members of minority races who are not, in fact, socially or economically disadvantaged.  [15] 13 CFR § 124.106 (a)(ii) (1995); 49 CFR § 23.69 (1994).  The presumption of social disadvantage reflects the unfortunate fact that irrational racial prejudicealong with its lingering effects still survives.  [16] The presumption of economic disadvantage *261 embodies a recognition that success in the private sector of the economy is often attributable, in part, to social skills and relationships.  Unlike the 1977 set-asides, the current preference is designed to overcome the social and economic disadvantages that are often associated with racial characteristics.  If, in a particular case, these disadvantages are not present, the presumptions can be rebutted.
**Combined Opinion**
 13 CFR § 124.603 (1995); 49 CFR § 23.69 (1994).  Such review prevents ineligible firms from taking part in the program solely because of their minority ownership, even when those firms were once disadvantaged but have since become successful.  The emphasis on review also indicates the Administration's anticipation that after their presumed disadvantages have been overcome, firms will "graduate" into a status in which they will be able to compete for business, including prime contracts, on an equal basis.  13 CFR § 124.208 (1995).  As with other phases of the statutory policy of encouraging the formation and growth of small business enterprises, this program is intended to facilitate entry and increase competition in the free market.  Significantly, the current program, unlike the 1977 setaside, does not establish any requirementnumerical or otherwisethat a general contractor must hire DBE subcontractors.  The program we upheld in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> required that 10% of the federal grant for every federally funded project be expended on minority business enterprises.  In contrast, the current program contains no quota.  Although it provides monetary incentives to general contractors to hire DBE subcontractors, it does not require them to hire DBE's, *263 and they do not lose their contracts if they fail to do so. The importance of this incentive to general contractors (who always seek to offer the lowest bid) should not be underestimated; but the preference here is far less rigid, and thus more narrowly tailored, than the 1977 Act.  Cf. Bakke, 438 U. S., at 319-320 (opinion of Powell, J.)(distinguishing between numerical set-asides and consideration of race as a factor).  Finally, the record shows a dramatic contrast between the sparse deliberations that preceded the 1977 Act, see Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 549-550</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., dissenting), and the extensive hearings conducted in several Congresses before the current program was developed.  [18] However we might *264 evaluate the benefits and costsboth fiscal and socialof this or any other affirmative-action program, our obligation to give deference to Congress' policy choices is much more demanding in this case than it was in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> .  If the 1977 program of race-based set-asides satisfied the strict scrutiny dictated by Justice Powell's vision of the Constitutiona vision the Court expressly endorses todayit must follow as night follows the day that the Court of Appeals' judgment upholding this more carefully crafted program should be affirmed.  VI My skeptical scrutiny of the Court's opinion leaves me in dissent.  The majority's concept of "consistency" ignores a difference, fundamental to the idea of equal protection, between oppression and assistance.  The majority's concept of "congruence" ignores a difference, fundamental to our constitutional system, between the Federal Government and the States.  And the majority's concept of stare decisis ignores the force of binding precedent.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.  As this case worked its way through the federal courts prior to the grant of certiorari that brought it here, petitioner Adarand Constructors, Inc., was understood to have raised only one significant claim: that before a federal agency may exceed the goals adopted by Congress in implementing a race-based remedial program, the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments require the agency to make specific findings of *265 discrimination, as under Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S. 469 (1989), sufficient to justify surpassing the congressional objective.  See 16 F. 3d 1537 , 1544 (CA10 1994) ("The gravamen of Adarand's argument is that the CFLHD must make particularized findings of past discrimination to justify its race-conscious SCC program under Croson because the precise goals of the challenged SCC program were fashioned and specified by an agency and not by Congress"); Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner, 790 F. Supp. 240, 242 (Colo. 1992) ("Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment seeks a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction against the DOT, the FHA and the CFLHD until specific findings of discrimination are made by the defendants as allegedly required by City of Richmond v. Croson "); cf. Complaint ¶ 28, App. 20 (federal regulations violate the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments by requiring "the use of racial and gender preferences in the award of federally financed highway construction contracts, without any findings of past discrimination in the award of such contracts").  Although the petition for certiorari added an antecedent question challenging the use, under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, of any standard below strict scrutiny to judge the constitutionality of the statutes under which respondents acted, I would not have entertained that question in this case. The statutory scheme must be treated as constitutional if Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448</citedDecision> (1980), is applied, and petitioner did not identify any of the factual premises on which <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> rested as having disappeared since that case was decided.  As the Court's opinion explains in detail, the scheme in question provides financial incentives to general contractors to hire subcontractors who have been certified as disadvantaged business enterprises (DBE's) on the basis of certain race-based presumptions.  See generally ante, at 206-208.  These statutes (or the originals, of which the current ones are reenactments) have previously been justified as providing *266 remedies for the continuing effects of past discrimination, see, e. g., Fullilove , supra, at 465-466 (citing legislative history describing SBA § 8(a) as remedial); S. Rep. No. 100-4, p. 11 (1987) (Committee Report stating that the DBE provision of STURAA was "necessary to remedy the discrimination faced by socially and economically disadvantaged persons"), and the Government has so defended them in this case, Brief for Respondents 33.  Since petitioner has not claimed the obsolescence of any particular fact on which the <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> Court upheld the statute, no issue has come up to us that might be resolved in a way that would render <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> inapposite.  See, e. g., 16 F. 3d, at 1544 ("Adarand has stipulated that section 502 of the Small Business Act .  .  .  satisfies the evidentiary requirements of <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> "); Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 90-C-1413 (D. Colo.), p. 12 ( <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> is not applicable to the case at bar because "[f]irst and foremost, <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> stands for only one proposition relevant here: the ability of the U. S. Congress, under certain limited circumstances, to adopt a race-base[d] remedy").  In these circumstances, I agree with Justice Stevens's conclusion that stare decisis compels the application of <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> .  Although <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> did not reflect doctrinal consistency, its several opinions produced a result on shared grounds that petitioner does not attack: that discrimination in the construction industry had been subject to government acquiescence, with effects that remain and that may be addressed by some preferential treatment falling within the congressional power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  [1] Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 477-478</citedDecision> (opinion of Burger, *267 C. J.); <citedDecision>id., at 503</citedDecision> (Powell, J., concurring); <citedDecision>id., at 520-521</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).  Once <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> is applied, as Justice Stevens points out, it follows that the statutes in question here (which are substantially better tailored to the harm being remedied than the statute endorsed in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> , see ante, at 259-264 (Stevens, J., dissenting)) pass muster under Fifth Amendment due process and Fourteenth Amendment equal protection.  The Court today, however, does not reach the application of <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> to the facts of this case, and on remand it will be incumbent on the Government and petitioner to address anew the facts upon which statutes like these must be judged on the Government's remedial theory of justification: facts about the current effects of past discrimination, the necessity for a preferential remedy, and the suitability of this particular preferential scheme.  Petitioner could, of course, have raised all of these issues under the standard employed by the <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> plurality, and without now trying to read the current congressional evidentiary record that may bear on resolving these issues I have to recognize the possibility that proof of changed facts might have rendered <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> `s conclusion obsolete as judged under the <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> plurality's own standard.  Be that as it may, it seems fair to ask whether the statutes will meet a different fate from what <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> would have decreed.  The answer is, quite probably not, though of course there will be some interpretive forks in the road before the significance of strict scrutiny for congressional remedial statutes becomes entirely clear.  The result in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> was controlled by the plurality for whom Chief Justice Burger spoke in announcing the judgment.  Although his opinion did not adopt any label for the standard it applied, and although it was later seen as calling for less than strict scrutiny, Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. *268 FCC, 497 U. S. 547, 564 (1990), none other than Justice Powell joined the plurality opinion as comporting with his own view that a strict scrutiny standard should be applied to all injurious race-based classifications.  <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 495-496</citedDecision> (concurring opinion) ("Although I would place greater emphasis than The Chief Justice on the need to articulate judicial standards of review in conventional terms, I view his opinion announcing the judgment as substantially in accord with my views").  Chief Justice Burger's noncategorical approach is probably best seen not as more lenient than strict scrutiny but as reflecting his conviction that the treble-tiered scrutiny structure merely embroidered on a single standard of reasonableness whenever an equal protection challenge required a balancing of justification against probable harm.  See Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U. S. 432, 451 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring, joined by Burger, C. J.).  Indeed, the Court's very recognition today that strict scrutiny can be compatible with the survival of a classification so reviewed demonstrates that our concepts of equal protection enjoy a greater elasticity than the standard categories might suggest.  See ante, at 237 ("[W]e wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is `strict in theory, but fatal in fact.' <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 519</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)"); see also Missouri v. Jenkins , ante, at 112 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("But it is not true that strict scrutiny is `strict in theory, but fatal in fact' ").  In assessing the degree to which today's holding portends a departure from past practice, it is also worth noting that nothing in today's opinion implies any view of Congress's § 5 power and the deference due its exercise that differs from the views expressed by the <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> plurality.  The Court simply notes the observation in Croson "that the Court's `treatment of an exercise of congressional power in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> cannot be dispositive here,' because Croson `s facts did not implicate Congress's broad power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment," ante, at 222, and explains that there is disagreement *269 among today's majority about the extent of the § 5 power, ante, at 230-231.  There is therefore no reason to treat the opinion as affecting one way or another the views of § 5 power, described as "broad," ante, at 269, "unique," Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 500</citedDecision> (Powell, J., concurring), and "unlike [that of] any state or political subdivision," Croson, 488 U. S., at 490 (opinion of O'Connor, J.).  See also Jenkins, ante, at 113 (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("Congress .  .  .  enjoys `"discretion in determining whether and what legislation is needed to secure the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment,"` Croson, 488 U. S., at 490 (quoting Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S., at 651)").  Thus, today's decision should leave § 5 exactly where it is as the source of an interest of the National Government sufficiently important to satisfy the corresponding requirement of the strict scrutiny test.  Finally, I should say that I do not understand that today's decision will necessarily have any effect on the resolution of an issue that was just as pertinent under <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> `s unlabeled standard as it is under the standard of strict scrutiny now adopted by the Court. The Court has long accepted the view that constitutional authority to remedy past discrimination is not limited to the power to forbid its continuation, but extends to eliminating those effects that would otherwise persist and skew the operation of public systems even in the absence of current intent to practice any discrimination.  See Albemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U. S. 405, 418 (1975) ("Where racial discrimination is concerned, `the [district] court has not merely the power but the duty to render a decree which will so far as possible eliminate the discriminatory effects of the past as well as bar like discrimination in the future' "), quoting Louisiana v. United States, 380 U. S. 145, 154 (1965).  This is so whether the remedial authority is exercised by a court, see ibid. ; Green v. School Bd. of New Kent Cty., 391 U. S. 430, 437 (1968), the Congress, see <citedDecision>Fullilove, supra, at 502</citedDecision> (Powell, J., concurring), or some other legislature, see Croson, supra, at 491-492 (opinion *270 of O'Connor, J.).  Indeed, a majority of the Court today reiterates that there are circumstances in which Government may, consistently with the Constitution, adopt programs aimed at remedying the effects of past invidious discrimination.  See, e. g., ante, at 228-229, 237 (opinion of O'Connor, J.); ante, at 243 (Stevens, J., with whom Ginsburg, J., joins, dissenting); post, at 273, 275-276 (Ginsburg, J., with whom Breyer, J., joins, dissenting); Jenkins, ante, at 112 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting the critical difference "between unconstitutional discrimination and narrowly tailored remedial programs that legislatures may enact to further the compelling governmental interest in redressing the effects of past discrimination").  When the extirpation of lingering discriminatory effects is thought to require a catchup mechanism, like the racially preferential inducement under the statutes considered here, the result may be that some members of the historically favored race are hurt by that remedial mechanism, however innocent they may be of any personal responsibility for any discriminatory conduct.  When this price is considered reasonable, it is in part because it is a price to be paid only temporarily; if the justification for the preference is eliminating the effects of a past practice, the assumption is that the effects will themselves recede into the past, becoming attenuated and finally disappearing.  Thus, Justice Powell wrote in his concurring opinion in <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> that the "temporary nature of this remedy ensures that a race-conscious program will not last longer than the discriminatory effects it is designed to eliminate." <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 513</citedDecision> ; ante, at 237-238 (opinion of the Court).  Surely the transition from the <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> plurality view (in which Justice Powell joined) to today's strict scrutiny (which will presumably be applied as Justice Powell employed it) does not signal a change in the standard by which the burden of a remedial racial preference is to be judged as reasonable or not at any given time.  If in the District Court Adarand *271 had chosen to press a challenge to the reasonableness of the burden of these statutes, [2] more than a decade after <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> had examined such a burden, I doubt that the claim would have fared any differently from the way it will now be treated on remand from this Court. Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Breyer joins, dissenting.  For the reasons stated by Justice Souter, and in view of the attention the political branches are currently giving the matter of affirmative action, I see no compelling cause for the intervention the Court has made in this case. I further agree with Justice Stevens that, in this area, large deference is owed by the Judiciary to "Congress' institutional competence and constitutional authority to overcome historic racial subjugation." Ante, at 253 (Stevens, J., dissenting); see ante, at 254-255.  [1] I write separately to underscore not the differences the several opinions in this case display, but the considerable field of agreementthe common understandings and concernsrevealed in opinions that together speak for a majority of the Court. *272 I The statutes and regulations at issue, as the Court indicates, were adopted by the political branches in response to an "unfortunate reality": "[t]he unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country." Ante, at 237 (lead opinion).  The United States suffers from those lingering effects because, for most of our Nation's history, the idea that "we are just one race," ante, at 239 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), was not embraced.  For generations, our lawmakers and judges were unprepared to say that there is in this land no superior race, no race inferior to any other.

 Ante, at 235-237.  But that opinion's elaboration strongly suggests that the strict standard announced is indeed "fatal" for classifications burdening groups that have suffered discrimination in our society.  That seems to me, and, I believe, to the Court, the enduring lesson one should draw from Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944); for in that case, scrutiny the Court described as "most rigid," id., at 216 , nonetheless yielded a pass for an odious, gravely injurious racial classification.  See ante, at 214-215 (lead opinion).  A Korematsu -type classification, as I read the opinions in this case, will never again survive scrutiny: Such a classification, history and precedent instruct, properly ranks as prohibited.  For a classification made to hasten the day when "we are just one race," ante, at 239 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), however, the lead opinion has dispelled the notion that "strict scrutiny" is "`fatal in fact.' " Ante, at 237 (quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448, 519</citedDecision> (1980) (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)).  Properly, a majority of the Court calls for review that is searching, in order to ferret out classifications in reality malign, but masquerading as benign.  See ante, at 228-229 (lead opinion).  The Court's once lax review of sex-based classifications demonstrates the need for such suspicion.  See, e. g., Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U. S. 57, 60 (1961) (upholding women's "privilege" of automatic exemption from jury service); Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948) (upholding Michigan law barring women from employment as bartenders); see also Johnston & Knapp, Sex Discrimination by Law: A Study in Judicial Perspective, 46 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 675 (1971).  Today's decision thus usefully reiterates that the purpose of strict scrutiny "is precisely to distinguish legitimate from *276 illegitimate uses of race in governmental decisionmaking," ante, at 228 (lead opinion), "to `differentiate between' permissible and impermissible governmental use of race," ibid., to distinguish "`between a "No Trespassing" sign and a welcome mat,' " ante, at 229.  Close review also is in order for this further reason.

 In upholding it, we relied in part on the plenary power of Congress to legislate on behalf of Indian tribes.  Id., at 551-552 .  In this case respondents rely, inpart, on the factthat not all members of the preferred minority groups are eligible for the preference, and on the special power to legislateon behalf of minorities granted to Congress by § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  [3]  Forexample, in Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co., 488 U. S.469 (1989), a majority of the members of the city council that enacted the race-based set-aside were of the same race as its beneficiaries.  [4]  In his concurrence, Justice Thomas argues that the most significant cost associated with an affirmative-action program is its adverse stigmatic effect on its intended beneficiaries.  Ante, at 240-241.  Although I agree that this cost may be more significant than many people realize, see Fullilove v. Klutznick, <citedDecision>448 U. S. 448, 545</citedDecision> (1980) (Stevens, J., dissenting), I do not think it applies to the facts of this case.First, this is not an argument that petitioner Adarand, a white-owned business, has standing to advance.  No beneficiaries of the specific program under attack today have challenged its constitutionalityperhaps because they do not find the preferences stigmatizing, or perhaps because their ability to opt out of the program provides them all the relief they would need.  Second, even if the petitioner in this case were a minority-owned business challenging the stigmatizing effect of this program, I would not find Justice Thomas' extreme propositionthat there is a moral and constitutional equivalence between an attempt to subjugate and an attempt to redress the effects of a caste system, ante, at 240at all persuasive.  It is one thing to question the wisdom of affirmative-action programs: There are many responsible arguments against them, including the one based upon stigma, that Congress might find persuasive when it decides whether to enact or retain race-based preferences.  It is another thing altogether to equate the many well-meaning and intelligent lawmakers and their constituents whether members of majority or minority raceswho have supported affirmative action over the years, to segregationists and bigots.  Finally, although Justice Thomas is more concerned about the potential effects of these programs than the intent of those who enacted them (a proposition at odds with this Court's jurisprudence, see Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976), but not without a strong element of common sense, see id., at 252-256 (Stevens, J., concurring); id., at 256-270 (Brennan, J., dissenting)), I am not persuaded that the psychological damage brought on by affirmative action is as severe as that engendered by racial subordination.  That, in any event, is a judgment the political branches can be trusted to make.  In enacting affirmative-action programs, a legislature intends to remove obstacles that have unfairly placed individuals of equal qualifications at a competitive disadvantage.  See Fullilove, <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 521</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).  I do not believe such action, whether wise or unwise, deserves such an invidious label as "racial paternalism," ante, at 240 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  If the legislature is persuaded that its program is doing more harm than good to the individuals it is designed to benefit, then we can expect the legislature to remedy the problem.  Significantly, this is not true of a government action based on invidious discrimination.  [5]  As I noted in Wygant : "There is .  .  .

 Congress, then, can expand the coverage of § 1 by exercising its power under § 5 when it acts to foster equality.  Congress has done just that here; it has decided that granting certain preferences to minorities best serves the goals of equal protection.  [11]  Our skeptical observer might also notice that Justice O'Connor's explanation for departing from settled precedent is joined only by Justice Kennedy.  Ante, at 204.  Three Members of the majority thus provide no explanation whatsoever for their unwillingness to adhere to the doctrine of stare decisis.  [12]  Of course, Justice Stewart believed that his view, disapproving of racial classifications of any kind, was consistent with this Court's precedents.  See ante, at 234-235, citing <citedDecision>448 U. S., at 523-526</citedDecision> .  But he did not claim that the question whether the Federal Government could engage in raceconscious affirmative action had been decided before <citedDecision>Fullilove</citedDecision> .  The fact that a Justice dissents from an opinion means that he disagrees with the result; it does not usually mean that he believes the decision so departs from the fabric of the law that its reasoning ought to be repudiated at the next opportunity.  Much less does a dissent bind or authorize a later majority to reject a precedent with which it disagrees.  [13]  STURAA accords arebuttable presumption of both social and economic disadvantage to members of racial minority groups.  49 CFR § 23.62 (1994).  In contrast, § 8(a) of the SBA accords a presumption only of social disadvantage, 13 CFR § 124.105 (b) (1995); the applicant has the burden of demonstrating economic disadvantage, id., § 124.106.  Finally, § 8(d)of the SBA accords at least a presumption of social disadvantage, but it is ambiguous as to whether economic disadvantage is presumed or must be shown.
