See, e. g., Ball, supra, at 390 (“[A]n important concern of the effects test is whether the symbolic union of church and state effected by the challenged governmental action is sufficiently *244 likely to be perceived by adherents of the controlling denominations as an endorsement, and by the nonadherents as a disapproval, of their individual religious choices”); Lee, supra, at 606-607 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (“When the government puts its imprimatur on a particular religion, it conveys a message of exclusion to all those who do not adhere to the favored beliefs. A government cannot be premised on the belief that all persons are created equal when it asserts that God prefers some”); Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 429 (1962) (“[AJnguish, hardship and bitter strife” result “when zealous religious groups struggle] with one another to obtain the Government’s stamp of approval”). The human tendency, of course, is to forget the hard lessons, and to overlook the history of governmental partnership with religion when a cause is worthy, and bureaucrats have programs. That tendency to forget is the reason for having the Establishment Clause (along with the Constitution’s other structural and libertarian guarantees), in the hope of stopping the corrosion before it starts. These principles were violated by the programs at issue in Aguilar and Ball, as a consequence of several significant features common to both Title I, as implemented in New York City before Aguilar, and the Grand Rapids Shared Time program: each provided classes on the premises of the religious schools, covering a wide range of subjects including some at the core of primary and secondary education, like reading and mathematics; while their services were termed “supplemental,” the programs and their instructors necessarily assumed responsibility for teaching subjects that the religious schools would otherwise have been obligated to provide, cf. Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 243 (1977) (provision of diagnostic tests to religious schools provides only an incidental benefit); the public employees carrying out the programs had broad responsibilities involving the exercise of considerable discretion, cf. Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 13 (1993) (sign-language interpreter *245 must transmit exactly what is said); Lemon v. Kurtzman, <targetCase>403 U. S. 602</targetCase>, 616-617 (1971) (distinguishing, for Establishment Clause purposes, books provided by the State to students from teachers paid by the State); while the programs offered aid to nonpublic school students generally (and Title I went to public school students as well), participation by religious school students in each program was extensive, cf. Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 488 (1986) (only one student sought state tuition assistance for religious education); and, finally, aid under Title I and Shared Time flowed directly to the schools in the form of classes and programs, as distinct from indirect aid that reaches schools only as a result of independent private choice, cf. Zobrest, supra, at 12 (“[A]ny attenuated financial benefit that parochial schools do ultimately receive ... is attributable to ‘the private choices of individual parents’ ”) (quoting Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 400 (1983)); Witters, supra, at 487 (aid issued to students reached religious institution “only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients”); Mueller, supra, at 399-400 (same). What, therefore, was significant in Aguilar and Ball about the placement of state-paid teachers into the physical and social settings of the religious schools was not only the consequent temptation of some of those teachers to reflect the schools’ religious missions in the rhetoric of their instruction, with a resulting need for monitoring and the certainty of entanglement. See Aguilar, 473 U. S., at 412-414 (monitoring); Ball, 473 U. S., at 388 (risk of indoctrination).
**Dissenting Opinion**
Nothing in this record suggests that a sign-language interpreter would do more than accurately interpret whatever material is presented to the class as a whole. In fact, ethical guidelines require interpreters to ‘transmit everything that is said in exactly the same way it was intended.’ ” Id., at 13. The signer could thus be seen as more like a hearing aid than a teacher, and the signing could not be understood as an opportunity to inject religious content *249 in what was supposed to be secular instruction. Zobrest accordingly holds only that in these limited circumstances where a public employee simply translates for one student the material presented to the class for the benefit of all students, the employee’s presence in the sectarian school does not violate the Establishment Clause. Id., at 13-14. Cf. <targetCase>Lemon</targetCase> v. <targetCase>Kurtzman</targetCase>, <targetCase>403 U. S., at 617</targetCase> (“[T]eachers have a substantially different ideological character from books [and] [i]n terms of potential for involving some aspect of faith or morals in secular subjects, a textbook’s content is ascertainable, but a teacher’s handling of a subject is not”). The Court, however, ignores the careful distinction drawn in Zobrest and insists that a full-time public employee such as a Title I teacher is just like the signer, asserting that “there is no reason to presume that, simply because she enters a parochial school classroom, [this] teacher will depart from her assigned duties and instructions and embark on religious indoctrination . . . .” Ante, at 226. Whatever may be the merits of this position (and I find it short on merit), it does not enjoy the authority of Zobrest. The Court may disagree with Ball’s assertion that a publicly employed teacher working in a sectarian school is apt to reinforce the pervasive inculcation of religious beliefs, but its disagreement is fresh law. The Court tries to press Zobrest into performing another service beyond its reach. The Court says that Ball and Aguilar assumed “that the presence of a public employee on private school property creates an impermissible ‘symbolic link’ between government and religion,” ante, at 224, and that Zobrest repudiated this assumption, <targetCase>ibid.</targetCase> First, Ball and Aguilar said nothing about the “mere presence” of public employees at religious schools. It was Ball that specifically addressed the point and held only that when teachers employed by public schools are placed in religious schools to provide instruction to students during the schoolday a symbolic union of church and state is created and will reasonably *250 be seen by the students as endorsement, see Ball, 473 U. S., at 390-392; Aguilar adopted the same conclusion by reference, see 473 U. S., at 409. Zobrest did not, implicitly or otherwise, repudiate the view that the involvement of public teachers in the instruction provided within sectarian schools looks like a partnership or union and implies approval of the sectarian aim. On the subject of symbolic unions and the strength of their implications, the lesson of Zobrest is merely that less is less. B The Court next claims that Ball rested on the assumption that “any and all public aid that directly aids the educational function of religious schools impermissibly finances religious indoctrination, even if the aid reaches such schools as a consequence of private decisionmaking.” Ante, at 222. After Ball, the opinion continues, the Court departed from the rule that “all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.” Ante, at 225. But this mischaracterizes Ball’s discussion on the point, and misreads Witters and Zobrest as repudiating the more modest proposition on which Ball in fact rested.
