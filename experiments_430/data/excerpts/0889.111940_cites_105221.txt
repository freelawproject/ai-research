**Lead Opinion**
 The explicit and long-settled nature of the command, contained in a constitutional provision and a statute substantially unchanged for 200 years, eliminates the possibility that state officers will be subjected to inconsistent direction.  Because the duty is directly imposed upon the States by the Constitution itself, there can be no need to weigh the performance of the federal obligation against the powers reserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment.  Respondents contend, however, that an “executive common law” of extradition has developed through the efforts of Governors to employ the discretion accorded them under Dennison , and that this “common law” provides a superior alternative to the “ministerial duty” to extradite provided for by the Constitution.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 21.  Even assum *229 ing the existence of this tradition of “executive common law,” no weight can be accorded io it.  Long continuation of decisional law or administrative practice incompatible with the requirements of the Constitution cannot overcome our responsibility to enforce thos'e requirements.  See, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, <citedDecision>347 U. S. 483</citedDecision> (1954); Green v. New Kent County School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968).  Though not articulated in theise terms, respondents’ argument is in essence a request thkt we reconsider our construction of the Extradition Clause to establish as a matter of constitutional interpretation a discretion which has hitherto been exercised solely because the Constitution’s explicit command has gone unenforced.  This, for the reasons previously stated, we decline to do.  C Respondents further contend that even if the holding in Kentucky v. Dennison cannot Withstand contemporary scrutiny, petitioner would not prbfit from its demise because Puerto Rico is not a State, and has no right to demand rendition of fugitives under the Extradition Clause.  It is true that the words of the Clause apply only to “States,” and we have never held that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is entitled to all the benefits confer]'ed upon the States under the Constitution.  We need not decide today what applicability the Extradition Clause may have to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, however, for the Extradition Act clearly applies.  The Act requires rendition of fugitives at the request of a demanding “Territory,” as 'well as State.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice O’Connor, with whom Justice Powell joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join Parts I, II-A, II-C, and III of the Court’s opinion. Because the Court ultimately resolves this case under the *231 Extradition Act, 18 U. S. C. § 3182 , I do not find Part II-B, and its statements concerning the Extradition Clause of the Constitution, necessary to the decision of this case. Accordingly, I do not subscribe to that part of the Court’s opinion. See, e. g., Jean v. Nelson, 472 U. S. 846, 854 (1985); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U. S. 352, 361, n. 10 (1983); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U. S. 288, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).
