**Dissenting Opinion**
 It may be that for the purposes of that state the petitioners have been released from their marital vows, consistently with the procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, on the basis of compliance with its residential requirements and constructive service of process on the non-resident spouses.  But conceding the validity in Nevada of its decrees dissolving the marriages, it does not mechanically follow that the Full Faith and Credit Clause compels North Carolina to accept them.  We have recognized an area of flexibility in the application of the Clause to preserve and protect state policies in matters of vital public concern.  We have said that conflicts between such state policies should be resolved, “not by giving automatic effect to the full faith and credit clause, .  .  .  but by appraising the governmental interests of each jurisdiction, and turning the scale of decision according to their weight.” Alaska Packers Assn. v. Comm’n, <citedDecision>294 U. S. 532, 547</citedDecision> .  (See also Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U. S. 268, 273-274 , and compare the dissenting opinion in Yarborough v. Yarborough, 290 U. S. *310 202, 213-227 .) That Clause should no more be read “with literal exactness like a mathematical formula” than are other great and general clauses of the Constitution placing limitations upon the States to weld us into a Nation.  Cf. Home Bldg. & L. Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 428 .  Rather it should be construed to harmonize its direction “with the necessary residuum of state power.” Id., at p. 435.  Prominent in the residuum of state power, as pointed out above, is the right of a state to deal with the marriage relations of its citizens and to pursue its chosen domestic policy of public morality in that connection.  Both Nevada and North Carolina have rights in this regard which are entitled to recognition.
