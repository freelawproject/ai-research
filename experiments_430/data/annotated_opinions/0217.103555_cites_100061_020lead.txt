 R. S. § 720; *133 see Proposed Draft of Revision of U. S. Statutes (1872), vol. 1, pp. 418.  (2) Removal of actions.  The Removal Acts, ever since the Act of September 24, 1789, 1 Stat. 73 , 79, have provided that whenever any party entitled to remove a suit shall file with the state court a proper petition for removal and a bond with good and sufficient surety, it shall then be the duty of the state court to accept such petition and bond “and proceed no further in the cause.” Section 265 has always been deemed inapplicable to removal proceedings.  Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U. S. 494 ; Madisonville Traction Co. v. Mining Co., 196 U. S. 239 .  The true rationale of these decisions is that the Removal Acts qualify pro tanto the Act of 1793.  Subsequent decisions have clarified the loose ground advanced in French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250, 253 .  See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., <citedDecision>260 U. S. 226</citedDecision> ; Taylor and Willis, The Power of Federal Courts to Enjoin Proceedings in State Courts, 42 Yale L. J. 1169, 1174-75; compare Bryant v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 92 F. 2d 569, 571 .  (3) Limitation of shipowners’ liability.  The Act of 1851 limiting the liability of shipowners provides that after a shipowner transfers his interest in the vessel to a trustee for the benefit of the claimants, “all claims and proceedings against the owner or owners shall cease.” 9 Stat. 635 , 636.  Being a “subsequent statute” to the Act of 1793, this provision operates as an implied legislative amendment to it.  Providence & N. Y. S. S. Co. v. Hill Mfg. Co., 109 U. S. 578, 599 ; see Admiralty Rule 51, 254 U. S., appendix, p. 26.  (4) Interpleader.  The Interpleader Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 416 , amended the 1917 Interpleader Act, 39 Stat. 929 , to provide as follows: “Notwithstanding any provision of the Judicial Code to the contrary, said [district] court shall have power to issue its process for all such claimants and to issue an order of injunction against each of them, enjoining them from instituting or prose- *134 cubing any suit or proceeding in any State court or in any other Federal court .

 See Kalb v. Feuerstein, 308 U. S. 433 .  Third.  This brings us to applications of § 265 apart from these statutory qualifications.  The early decisions of this Court applied the Act of 1793 as a matter of course.  5 However, a line of cases beginning with Hagan *135 v. Lucas, 10 Pet. 400 , holds that the court, whether federal or state, which first takes possession of a res withdraws the property from the reach of the other.  Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 583, 597 ; Freeman v. Howe, 24 How. 450 .  See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., <citedDecision>260 U. S. 226</citedDecision> , 235: “The rank and authority of the [federal and state] courts are equal but both courts cannot possess or control the same thing at the same time, and any attempt to do so would result in unseemly conflict.  The rule, therefore, that the court first acquiring jurisdiction shall proceed without interference from a court of the other jurisdiction is a rule of right and of law based upon necessity, and where the necessity, actual or potential, does not exist, the rule does not apply.  Since that necessity does exist in actions in rem and does not exist in actions in -personam, involving a question of personal liability only, the rule applies in the former but does not apply in the latter.” The Act of 1793 expresses the desire of Congress to avoid friction between the federal government and the states resulting from the intrusion of federal authority into the orderly functioning of a state’s judicial process.  The reciprocal doctrine of the res cases is but an application of the reason underlying the Act.  Contest between the representatives of two distinct judicial systems over the same physical property would give rise to actual physical friction.  The rule has become well settled, therefore, that § 265 does not preclude the use of the injunction by a federal court to restrain state proceedings seeking to interfere with property in the custody of the court. 6 Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street R. Co., 177 *136 U. S. 51, 61 ; Kline v. Burke Construction Co., <citedDecision>260 U. S. 226, 229, 235</citedDecision> ; Lion Bonding Co. v. Karatz, 262 U. S. 77, 88-89 ; see Warren, Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345 , 359-66.  And where a state court first acquires control of the res, the federal courts are disabled from exercising any power over it, by injunction or otherwise.  Palmer v. Texas, 212 U. S. 118 .  Another group of cases is said to constitute an exception to § 265, namely, where federal courts have enjoined litigants from enforcing judgments fraudulently obtained in the state courts.  Marshall v. Holmes, 141 U. S. 589 ; Simon v. Southern Railway Co., 236 U. S. 115 ; Essanay Film Co. v. Kane, 258 U. S. 358 ; Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. Co. v. Wells, 265 U. S. 101 ; Wells Fargo & Co. v. Taylor, 254 U. S. 175 .  In the Simon case, Mr. Justice Lamar undertook to rationalize this class of cases by regarding a state court “proceeding” as completed once judgment is secured, with the result that an injunction against levying execution does not stay a judicial “proceeding.” 236 U. S. at 124 .  But this construction of § 265 was rejected in Hill v. Martin, 296 U. S. 393 , 403: “That term [proceedings] is comprehensive.

 These grounds for decision were, of course, alternative, and either alone was sufficient to dispose of the case. However, they were entirely separate and distinct, and there *138 is no basis for any inference that the Court might have upheld an injunction if Reynolds had been properly joined.  Nor need we consider common-law refinements in actions for ejectment, for the Court went explicitly on its duty to obey the Act of 1793.  Root v. Woolworth, 150 U. S. 401 , is erroneously regarded as illustrating a “relitigation” exception to § 265.  The case holds merely that courts of equity have jurisdiction to “effectuate their own decrees by injunctions or writs of assistance in order to avoid the relitigation of questions once settled between the same parties.” 150 U. S. at 411-12 .  The Court did not uphold a federal injunction against a state suit to relitigate a claim already settled by a previous federal decree — no such state suit had been brought.  Consequently, there was no occasion to consider the applicability of § 265.  The “first come, first served” rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537 , was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., <citedDecision>260 U. S. 226, 235</citedDecision> .  Cf. Haines v. Carpenter, 91 U. S. 254, 257 .  There is no warrant for the assumption that, in the proposals for the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress had before it the “relitigation” exception as settled doctrine, and that by § 265 gave it legislative confirmation.  The Report of the Special Joint Committee on Revision and Codification of the Laws of the United States annotated the Act of 1793 with citations to twenty-six decisions of this Court. Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 470.  Yet no reference was made to four of the five decisions of this Court prior to the *140 Judicial Code which are supposed to justify the “relitigation” doctrine: Ro ot v. Woolworth, 150 U. S. 401 ; Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537 ; Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U. S. 188 ; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273 .  (As we have already seen, “removal” cases like French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250 , and Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U. S. 494 , rest upon an entirely different footing.) None of the reports submitted to Congress contains any discussion of § 5 of the Act of 1793 and the decisions construing it.
