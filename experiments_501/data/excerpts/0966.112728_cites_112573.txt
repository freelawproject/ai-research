 433 U. S., at 88 .  We observed that procedural rules that contribute to error-free state trial proceedings are thoroughly desirable.  We applied a cause-and-prejudice standard to a petitioner’s failure to object at trial and limited *7 Fay to its facts.  433 U. S., at 87-88 , and n. 12.  We have consistently reaffirmed that the “cause-and-prejudice” standard embodies the correct accommodation between the competing concerns implicated in a federal court’s habeas power.  Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 11 (1984); Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 129 (1982).  In McCleskey v. Zant, <citedDecision>499 U. S. 467</citedDecision> (1991), we held that the same standard used to excuse state procedural defaults should be applied in habeas corpus cases where abuse of the writ is claimed by the government.  <citedDecision>Id., at 493</citedDecision> .  This conclusion rested on the fact that the two doctrines are similar in purpose and design and implicate similar concerns.  <citedDecision>Id., at 493-494</citedDecision> .  The writ strikes at finality of a state criminal conviction, a matter of particular importance in a federal system.  <citedDecision>Id., at 491</citedDecision> , citing Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 487 (1986).  Federal habeas litigation also places a heavy burden on scarce judicial resources, may give litigants incentives to withhold claims for manipulative purposes, and may create disincentives to present claims when evidence is fresh.  <citedDecision>499 U. S., at 491-492</citedDecision> .  See also Reed v. Ross, supra, at 13 ; Wainwright, supra, at 89 .  Again addressing the issue of state procedural default in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), we described Fay as based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules, 501 U. S., at 750 , and went on to hold that the cause-and-prejudice standard applicable to failure to raise a particular claim should apply as well to failure to appeal at all. Ibid. “All of the State’s interests — in channeling the resolution of claims to the most appropriate forum, in finality, and in having an opportunity to correct its own errors — are implicated whether a prisoner defaults one claim or all of them.” Id., at 750 .  We therefore applied the cause-and-prejudice standard uniformly to state procedural defaults, eliminating the “irrational” distinction between Fay and subsequent cases. 501 U. S., at 751 .  In light of these decisions, it is similarly *8 irrational to distinguish between failing to properly assert a federal claim in state court and failing in state court to properly develop such a claim, and to apply to the latter a remnant of a decision that is no longer upheld with regard to the former.  The concerns that motivated the rejection of the deliberate bypass standard in Wainwright, Coleman, and other cases are equally applicable to this case. 3 As in cases of state procedural default, application of the cause-and-prejudice standard to excuse a state prisoner’s failure to develop material facts in state court will appropriately accommodate concerns of finality, comity, judicial economy, and channeling the resolution of claims into the most appropriate forum.  Applying the cause-and-prejudice standard in cases like this will obviously contribute to the finality of convictions, for requiring a federal evidentiary hearing solely on the basis of a habeas petitioner’s negligent failure to develop facts in *9 state-court proceedings dramatically increases the opportunities to relitigate a conviction.

 Finally, it is worth noting that applying the cause-and-prejudice standard in this case also advances uniformity in the law of habeas corpus.  There is no good reason to maintain in one area of habeas law a standard that has been rejected in the area in which it was principally enunciated.  And little can be said for holding a habeas petitioner to one standard for failing to bring a claim in state court and excusing the petitioner under another, lower standard for failing to develop the factual basis of that claim in the same forum.  A different rule could mean that a habeas petitioner would not be excused for negligent failure to object to the introduction of the prosecution’s evidence, but nonetheless would be excused for negligent failure to introduce any evidence of his own to support a constitutional claim.  5 *11 Respondent Tamayo-Reyes is entitled to an evidentiary hearing if he can show cause for his failure to develop the facts in state-court proceedings and actual prejudice resulting from that failure.  We also adopt the narrow exception *12 to the cause-and-prejudice requirement: A habeas petitioner’s failure to develop a claim in state-court proceedings will be excused and a hearing mandated if he can show that a fundamental miscarriage of justice would result from failure to hold a federal evidentiary hearing.  Cf. <citedDecision>McCleskey</citedDecision> v. Zant, <citedDecision>499 U. S., at 494</citedDecision> ; Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S., at 496 .  The State concedes that a remand to the District Court is appropriate in order to afford respondent the opportunity to bring forward evidence establishing cause and prejudice, Brief for Petitioner 21, and we agree that respondent should have that opportunity.  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  So ordered.  With respect to respondent’s claim that the plea form and plea proceeding were not adequately translated, the Court of Appeals concluded that state postconviction proceedings afforded petitioner ample opportunity to *5 contest the translations, that the material facts surrounding these issues were adequately developed, and that the state court’s findings were adequately supported by the record.  The Court of Appeals therefore held that a federal evidentiary hearing on that claim was not required.  926 F. 2d, at 1602 .

*24 Justice Kennedy, dissenting.  By definition, the cases within the ambit of the Court’s holding are confined to those in which the factual record developed in the state-court proceedings is inadequate to resolve the legal question.  I should think those cases will be few in number.  Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 318 (1963), has been the law for almost 30 years and there is no clear evidence that this particular classification of habeas proceedings has burdened the dockets of the federal courts.  And in my view, the concept of factual inadequacy comprehends only those petitions with respect to which there is a realistic possibility that an evidentiary hearing will make a difference in the outcome.  This serves to narrow the number of cases in a further respect and to ensure that they are the ones, as Justice O’Connor points out, in which we have valid concerns with constitutional error.  Our recent decisions in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), McCleskey v. Zant, <citedDecision>499 U. S. 467</citedDecision> (1991), and Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), serve to protect the integrity of the writ, curbing its abuse and ensuring that the legal questions presented are ones which, if resolved against the State, can invalidate a final judgment.  So we consider today only those habeas actions which present questions federal courts are bound to decide in order to protect constitutional rights.  We ought not to take steps which diminish the likelihood that those courts will base their legal decision on an accurate assessment of the facts.  For these reasons and all those set forth by Justice O’Connor, I dissent from the opinion and judgment of the Court.
