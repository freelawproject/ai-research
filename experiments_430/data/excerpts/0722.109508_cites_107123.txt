Marine Engineers, <citedDecision>382 U.

The charge was based on union activities that occurred during good-faith bargaining over the terms of a collective-bargaining agreement.  During the negotiations, the union directed concerted on-the-job activities by its members of a harassing nature designed to interfere with the conduct of the employer’s business, for the avowed purpose of putting economic pressure on the employer to accede to the union’s bargaining demands.  The harassing activities, all peaceful, by the member insurance agents included refusal for a time to solicit new business, and refusal (after the writing of new business was resumed) to comply with the employer insurance company’s reporting procedures; refusal to participate in a company campaign to solicit new business; reporting late at district offices the days the agents were scheduled to attend them; refusing to perform customary duties at the office, instead engaging there in “sit-in-mornings,” “doing what comes naturally,” and leaving at noon as a group; absenting themselves from special business conferences arranged by the company; picketing and distributing leaflets outside the various offices of the company on specified days and hours as directed by the union; distributing leaflets each day to policyholders and others and soliciting policyholders’ signatures on petitions directed to the company; and presenting the signed policyholders’ petitions to the company at its home office while simultaneously engaging in mass demonstrations there.  361 U. S., at 480-481 .  We held that such tactics would not support a finding by the NLRB that the union had failed to bargain in good faith as required by § 8 (b) (3) and rejected the per se rule applied by the Board that use of “economically harassing activities” alone sufficed to prove a vio *143 lation of that section.

 The employer in this case invoked the Wisconsin law because it was unable to overcome the Union tactic with its own economic self-help means.  9 Although it did employ economic weapons putting pressure on the Union when it terminated the pre *149 vious agreement, supra, at 134, it apparently lacked sufficient economic strength to secure its bargaining demands under “the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy,” Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S., at 260 .  10 But the economic weakness of the affected party cannot justify state aid contrary to federal law for, as we have developed, “the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is not a grudging exception [under] .  .  .  the [federal] Act; it is part and parcel of the process of collective bargaining.” Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 495 .  The state action in this case is not filling “a regulatory void which Congress plainly assumed would not exist,” Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, <citedDecision>382 U. S., at 196</citedDecision> (Brennan, J., concurring).  Rather, it is clear beyond question that Wisconsin “[entered] into the substantive aspects of the bargaining process to an extent Congress has not countenanced.” NLRB v. Insurance Agents, supra, at 498 .  Our decisions hold that Congress meant that these activities, whether of employer or employees, were not to be regulable by States any more than by the NLRB, for neither States nor the Board is “afforded flexibility in picking and choosing which economic devices of labor and management shall be branded as unlawful.” Ibid.

 .  strikes,” and therefore “[p]olicing of such conduct is left wholly to the states.” 67 Wis. 2d, at 26 , 226 N. W. 2d, at 209 .  Since Briggs-Stratton is today overruled, and as we hold further that the Union’s refusal to work overtime is peaceful conduct constituting activity which must be free of regulation by the States if the congressional intent in enacting the comprehensive federal law of labor relations is not to be frustrated, the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is Reversed.  Wisconsin Stat. § 111.06 (2) (1974) provides: “It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employe individually or in concert with others: “(h) To take unauthorized possession of property of the employer or to engage in any concerted effort to interfere with production except by leaving the premises in an orderly manner for the purpose of going on strike.” Thus Automobile Workers v. Russell, 356 U. S. 634 (1958), upheld state-court jurisdiction of a common-law tort action against *137 a union to recover compensatory and punitive damages for malicious interference with the plaintiff's lawful occupation by mass picketing and threats of violence that prevented the plaintiff from entering the plant and engaging in his employment; Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., 355 U. S. 131 (1957), sustained state-court power to enjoin striking employees from threatening or provoking violence or obstructing or attempting to obstruct the free use of the streets adjacent to the struck plant, or free ingress and egress to and from the property; Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 351 U. S. 266 (1956), sustained state authority to vest jurisdiction in a state labor relations board to enjoin violent union conduct; United Constr. Workers v. Laburnum Constr. Corp., 347 U. S. 656 (1954), held a state court not precluded from hearing and determining a common-law tort action based on conduct which, although an unfair labor practice under federal law, constituted threats of violence and intimidation that forced an employer to abandon all of its projects in the area.  In short, a State still may exercise “its historic powers over such traditionally local matters as public safety and order and the use of streets and highways,” Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 315 U. S. 740, 749 (1942), for “[policing of such conduct is left wholly to the states.” Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 336 U. S. 245, 253 (1949).  Thus Machinists v. Gonzales, 356 U. S. 617 (1958), held that a state court was not precluded from ordering the reinstatement by a union of a wrongfully expelled member and awarding him damages, even though the union’s conduct might also involve an unfair labor practice, since there was only a remote possibility of conflict with enforcement by the National Labor Relations Board of national policy.  And in Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, <citedDecision>382 U. S. 181</citedDecision> (1965), we resolved the “troublesome question of where lies the line between permissible and federally preempted state regulation of [the] union activities” there presented, <citedDecision>id., at 183</citedDecision> , by concluding that the Act's amendment expressly to exclude supervisory employees from the critical definition of “employees” eliminated any serious problems of pre-emption since “many provisions of the Act *138 employing that pivotal term would cease to operate where supervisors were the focus of concern.” <citedDecision>Id., at 188</citedDecision> .  Further, in Linn v. Plant Guard Workers, 383 U. S. 53 (1966), we held that the availability of a state judicial remedy for malicious libel would not impinge upon the national labor policy.  See Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1337 , 1352 (1972): "An appreciation of the true character of the national labor policy-expressed in the NLRA and the LMRA indicates that in providing a legal framework for union organization, collective bargaining, and the conduct of labor disputes, Congress struck a balance of protection, prohibition, and laissez-faire in respect to union organization, collective bargaining, and labor disputes that would be upset if a state could also enforce statutes or rules of decision resting upon its views concerning accommodation of the same interests.” Cf. Lesnick, Preemption Reconsidered: The Apparent Reaffirmation of Garmon , 72 Col. L. Rev. 469, 478, 480 (1972): “[T]he failure of Congress to prohibit certain conduct warrant [s a] negative inference that it was deemed proper, indeed desirable— at least, desirable to be left for the free play of contending economic forces.  Thus, the state is not merely filling a gap when it outlaws what federal law fails to outlaw; it is denying one party to an economic contest a weapon that Congress meant him to have available.  “The premise is .  .  .  that Congress judged whether the conduct was illicit or legitimate, and that ‘legitimate' connotes, not simply that federal law is neutral, but that the conduct is to be assimilated to the large residual area in which a regime of free collective bargaining — ‘economic warfare,’ if you prefer — is thought to be the course of regulatory wisdom.” It is true, of course, that the seeds of the Garmon “primary jurisdiction of the NLRB” approach to labor law pre-emption are also contained within the Garner opinion.  See, in addition to the textual quotation, Gamer, 346 U. S., at 490-491 .  Although Mr. Justice Harlan took issue with the statement in Garmon that States may “be powerless to act when the underlying activities are clearly ‘neither protected nor prohibited’ by the federal Act,” 359 U. S., at 253 (concurring in result), his later opinions make plain that the point of disagreement concerned the use of the term “protected” rather than the substantive concept.  “In the context of labor relations law, this word is fraught with ambiguity, ‘Protected conduct’ may, for example,, refer to employee conduct which the States may not prohibit, ... or to conduct against which the employer may not retaliate.” Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S. 369 , 382 n. 17 (19.69).  Indeed, Mr. Justice Harlan thereafter expressly adopted the Garmon formulation.  Hanna Mining v. Marine Engineers, <citedDecision>382 U. S., at 187</citedDecision> , It has been suggested that rather than “protected,” ‘[p]ermitted activities’ would be better shorthand for this category of employee conduct because it may be — indeed is — protected against state, but not employer interference.” Cox, supra, n. 4, at 1346 (footnote omitted).  “[T]he Taft-Hartley Act was, to a marked degree, the result of conflict and compromise between strong contending forces and deeply held views on the .  .  .  appropriate balance to be struck between the uncontrolled power of management and labor to further their respective interests.” Carpenters Union v. NLRB, 357 U.‘ S. 93, 99-100 (1958).  See also NLRB v. Truck Drivers Union, 353 U. S. 87, 96 (1957): “Although the Act protects the right of the employees to strike in support of their demands, this protection is not so absolute as to deny self-help by employers when legitimate interests of employees and employers collide.” “Although Kearney and.  Trecker could have suspended, discharged, or even locked out its employees, such steps would have only increased its already enormous production problems [and] exacerbated the already substantial strain on the bargaining process .. .
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Powell, with whom The Chief Justice joins, concurring. The Court correctly identifies the critical inquiry with respect to pre-emption as whether “the exercise of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act’s processes.” Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S. 369, 380 (1969). See ante, at 147-148. This is equally true whether the self-help activities *156 are those of the employer or the Union. I agree with the Court that the Wisconsin law, as applied in this case, is pre-empted since it directly curtails the self-help capability of the Union and its members, resulting in a significant shift in the balance of free economic bargaining power struck by Congress. I write to make clear my understanding that the Court’s opinion does not, however, preclude the States from enforcing, in the context of a labor dispute, “neutral” state statutes or rules of decision: state laws that are not directed toward altering the bargaining positions of employers or unions but which may have an incidental effect on relative bargaining strength. Except where Congress has specifically provided otherwise, the States generally should remain free to enforce, for example, their law of torts or of contracts, and other laws reflecting neutral public policy. * See Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L. Rev. 1337 , 1355-1356 (1972). With this understanding, I join the opinion of the Court. State laws should not be regarded as neutral if they reflect an accommodation of the special interests of employers, unions, or the public in areas such as employee self-organization, labor disputes, or collective bargaining.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 In all events, while I recognize that I may be misreading the Court’s opinion, I assume that its holding rests on the predicate that the concerted refusal to work overtime in this case, like the partial strike activity in Briggs-Stratton, is unprotected by § 7.  A scholar who has criticized Briggs-Stratton has observed: “The omission of a federal prohibition against 'quickie’ strikes certainly could not have implied a desire that unions be free to embrace the tactic without restraint; congressional silence almost surely is attributable to the happy circumstance that no prohibition is urgently required because American labor unions have almost unanimously *158 fected such tactics.” Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L, Rev. 1337, 1347 (1972).  The Union argues that Congress focused upon partial strike activity during passage of the Taft-Hartley Act, 61 Stat. 136 , relying upon a provision passed by the House, but rejected in the Conference Committee, that declared unlawful “any sit-down strike or other concerted interference with an employer’s operations conducted by remaining on the employer’s premises.” H. R. 3020, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., § 12 (a)(3)(A) (1947).  See H. R. Rep. No. 245, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 27-28, 43-44 (1947); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 510, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38-39, 42-43, 58-59 (1947).  The concerted refusal to work overtime in this ease does not involve “concerted interference with an employer’s operations conducted by remaining on the employer’s premises.” In NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , the Court held that the partial strike activity in that case did not violate the union’s duty to bargain in good faith; in other words, even though the activity was not protected by § 7, it was not prohibited by § 8.  Contrary to the Court’s implication, ante, at 141, the case did not hold that the States could not prohibit such activity, but only that the NLRB had not been authorized to do so. Congress’ failure to grant power over such activity to the NLRB hardly amounts to withdrawal of the same power from the States.  The Court’s quotation, Ibid., from Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, <citedDecision>382 U. S. 181, 187</citedDecision> , when read in context, is nothing more than a reference to a statement in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 , which poses, but does not answer, the question whether pre-emption extends to activity that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.  See n. 2, supra. I cannot agree with the Court’s conclusion that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, overruled today, numbers among those that have been eroded rather than preserved.  See ante, at 151-154, and n. 12.  The decision in Insurance Agents, supra, is readily distinguishable.  See n. 3, supra. It is true that Briggs-Stratton has been limited to its facts insofar as it sanctions judicial determination whether conduct arguably protected by § 7 or prohibited by § 8 is actually protected or prohibited.  Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 291 ; San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra, at 245 n. 4; see Insurance Agents, supra, at 492-494 , and nn. 22, 23.  But the rule established in Garmon , and reaffirmed in Lockridge , is fully consistent with the conclusion that the States may regulate conduct that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.
