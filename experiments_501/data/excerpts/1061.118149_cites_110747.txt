**Combined Opinion**
 After reviewing legal and economic aspects of price fixing, the court concluded'that State Oil’s pricing scheme was a per se antitrust violation under Albrecht v. Herald Co., supra. Although the Court of Appeals characterized Albrecht as “unsound when decided” and “inconsistent with later decisions” of this Court, it felt constrained to follow that decision.  93 F. 3d, at 1363 .  In light of Albrecht and Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., 495 U. S. 328 (1990) (ARCO), the court found that respondents could have suffered antitrust injury from not being able to adjust gasoline prices.  We granted certiorari to consider two questions, whether State Oil’s conduct constitutes a per se violation of the Sherman Act and whether respondents are entitled to recover damages based on that conduct.  519 U. S. 1107 (1997).  *10 II A Although the Sherman Act, by its terms, prohibits every agreement “in restraint of trade,” this Court has long recognized that Congress intended to outlaw only unreasonable restraints.  See, e. g., Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Soc., <citedDecision>457 U. S. 332, 342-343</citedDecision> (1982) (citing United States v. Joint Traffic Assn., 171 U. S. 505 (1898)).  As a consequence, most antitrust claims are analyzed under a “rule of reason,” according to which the finder of fact must decide whether the questioned practice imposes an unreasonable restraint on competition, taking into account a variety of factors, including specific information about the relevant business, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, and the restraint’s history, nature, and effect.  <citedDecision>457 U. S., at 343</citedDecision> , and n. 13 (citing Board of Trade of Chicago v. United States, 246 U. S. 231, 238 (1918)).  Some types of restraints, however, have such predictable and pernicious anticompetitive effect, and such limited potential for proeompetitive benefit, that they are deemed unlawful per se. Northern Pacific R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S. 1, 5 (1958).  Per se treatment is appropriate “[ojnce experience with a particular kind of restraint enables the Court to predict with confidence that the rule of reason will condemn it.” Maricopa County, supra, at 344; see also Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc., 441 U. S. 1, 19, n. 33 (1979).  Thus, we have expressed reluctance to adopt per se rules with regard to “restraints imposed in the context of business relationships where the economic impact of certain practices is not immediately obvious.” FTC v. Indiana Federation of Dentists, 476 U. S. 447, 458-459 (1986).  A review of this Court’s decisions leading up to and beyond Albrecht is relevant to our assessment of the continuing validity of the per se rule established in Albrecht .  Beginning *11 with Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co., 220 U. S. 373 (1911), the Court recognized the illegality of agreements under which manufacturers or suppliers set the minimum resale prices to be charged by their distributors.  By 1940, the Court broadly declared all business combinations “formed for the purpose and with the effect of raising, depressing, fixing, pegging, or stabilizing the price of a commodity in interstate or foreign commerce” illegal per se. United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co., 310 U. S. 150, 223 (1940).

 See id., *14 at 54-57 (citing, e. g., Posner, Antitrust Policy and the Supreme Court: An Analysis of the Restricted Distribution, Horizontal Merger and Potential Competition Decisions, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 282 (1975); Preston, Restrictive Distribution Arrangements: Economic Analysis and Public Policy Standards, 30 Law & Contemp.  Prob. 506 (1965)).  The Court concluded that, because “departure from the rule-of-reason standard must be based upon demonstrable economic effect rather than — as in Schwinn — upon formalistic line drawing,” the appropriate course would be “to return to the rule of reason that governed vertical restrictions prior to Schwinn.” GTE Sylvania, supra, at 58-59.  In GTE Sylvania, the Court declined to comment on Albrechts per se treatment of vertical maximum price restrictions, noting that the issue “involve[d] significantly different questions of analysis and policy.” 483 U. S., at 51, n. 18.  Subsequent decisions of the Court, however, have hinted that the analytical underpinnings of Albrecht were substantially weakened by GTE Sylvania.  We noted in Mari-copa County that vertical restraints are generally more defensible than horizontal restraints.  See <citedDecision>457 U. S., at 348, n. 18</citedDecision> .  And we explained in 324 Liquor Corp. v. Duffy, 479 U. S. 335, 341-342 (1987), that decisions such as GTE Sylvania “recognize the possibility that a vertical restraint imposed by a single manufacturer or wholesaler may stimulate interbrand competition even as it reduces intrabrand competition.” Most recently, in ARCO, 495 U. S. 328 (1990), although Al-brecht’s continuing validity was not squarely before the Court, some disfavor with that decision was signaled by our statement that we would “assume, arguendo, that Albrecht correctly held that vertical, maximum price fixing is subject to the per se rule.” 495 U. S., at 335, n. 5 .  More significantly, we specifically acknowledged that vertical maximum price fixing “may have procompetitive interbrand effects,” and pointed out that, in the wake of GTE Sylvania, “[t]he *15 proeompetitive potential of a vertical maximum price restraint is more evident.  .  .  than it was when Albrecht was decided, because exclusive territorial arrangements and other nonprice restrictions were unlawful per se in 1968.” 495 U. S., at 348 , n. 13 (citing several commentators identifying proeompetitive effects of vertical maximum price fixing, including, e. g., P. Areeda & H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law ¶ 340.30b, p. 378, n. 24 (1988 Supp.); Blair & Harrison, Rethinking Antitrust Injury, 42 Vand. L. Rev. 1539 , 1553 (1989); Easterbrook, Maximum Price Fixing, 48 U. Chi. L. Rev. 886 , 887-890 (1981)) (hereinafter Easterbrook).  B Thus, our reconsideration of Albrecht’s continuing validity is informed by several of our decisions, as well as a considerable body of scholarship discussing the effects of vertical restraints.

 In addition, Albrecht noted that vertical maximum price fixing could effectively channel distribution through large or specially advantaged dealers.  390 U. S., at 153 .  It is unclear, however, that a supplier would profit from limiting its market by excluding potential dealers.  See, e. g., Easterbrook 905-908.  Further, although vertical maximum price fixing might limit the viability of inefficient dealers, that consequence is not necessarily harmful to competition and consumers.  See, e. g., id., at 907; Lopatka, supra, at 60.  Finally, Albrecht reflected the Court’s fear that maximum price fixing could be used to disguise arrangements to fix minimum prices, 390 U. S., at 153 , which remain illegal per se. Although we have acknowledged the possibility that maximum pricing might mask minimum pricing, see Maricopa County, <citedDecision>457 U. S., at 348</citedDecision> , we believe that such conduct — as with the other concerns articulated in Albrecht— can be appropriately recognized and punished under the rule of reason.  See, e. g., Easterbrook 901-904; see also Pitofsky, In Defense of Discounters: The No-Frills Case for a Per Se *18 Rule Against Vertical Price Fixing, 71 Geo. L. J. 1487, 1490, n. 17 (1983).  Not only are the potential injuries cited in Albrecht less serious than the Court imagined, the per se rule established therein could in fact exacerbate problems related to the unrestrained exercise of market power by monopolist-dealers.  Indeed, both courts and antitrust scholars have noted that Albrecht’s rule may actually harm consumers and manufacturers.  See, e. g., Caribe BMW, Inc. v. Bayerische Motoren Werke Aktiengesellschaft, 19 F. 3d 745, 753 (CA1 1994) (Breyer, C. J.); Areeda ¶ 1636a, at 395; G. Mathewson & R. Winter, Competition Policy and Vertical Exchange 13-14 (1985).  Other commentators have also explained that Al-brecht’s per se rule has even more potential for deleterious effect on competition after our decision in GTE Sylvania, because, now that vertical nonprice restrictions are not unlawful per se, the likelihood of dealer monopoly power is increased.  See, e. g., Easterbrook 890, n. 20; see also ARCO, 495 U. S., at 343, n. 13 .
