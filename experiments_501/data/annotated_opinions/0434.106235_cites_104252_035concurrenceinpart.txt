 .  .  .” It has long been settled that Congress’ broad statutory definitions of taxable income were intended' “to use the full measure of [the Sixteenth Amendment’s] taxing power.” Helvering v. Clifford, 309 U. S. 331, 334 ; Douglas v. Willcuts, 296 U. S. 1, 9 .  Equally well settled is the principle that the Sixteenth Amendment “is to be taken as written and is not to be extended beyond the meaning clearly indicated by the language used.” Edwards v. Cuba R. Co., 268 U. S. 628, 631 .  1 The language of the Sixteenth Amendment, as well as our prior controlling decisions, *249 compels me to conclude that the question now before us— whether an embezzler receives taxable income at the time of his unlawful taking — must be answered negatively.  Since the prevailing opinion reaches an opposite conclusion, I must respectfully dissent from that holding, although I concur in the Court’s judgment reversing petitioner’s conviction.  I am convinced that Commissioner v. Wilcox, <citedDecision>327 U. S. 404</citedDecision> , which is today overruled, was correctly decided on the basis of every controlling principle used in defining taxable income since the Sixteenth Amendment’s adoption.  The Chief Justice’s opinion, although it correctly recites Wilcox’s holding that “embezzled money does not constitute taxable income to the embezzler in the year of the embezzlement” (emphasis added), fails to explain or to answer the true basis of that holding.  <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> did not hold that embezzled funds may never constitute taxable income to the embezzler.  To the contrary, it expressly recognized that an embezzler may realize a taxable gain to the full extent of the amount taken, if and when it ever becomes his.  The applicable test of taxable income, i.  e., the “presence of a claim of right to the alleged gain,” of which <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> spoke, was but a correlative statement of the factor upon which the decision placed its whole emphasis throughout, namely, the “absence of a definite, unconditional obligation to repay or return [the money].” <citedDecision>327 U. S., at 408</citedDecision> .  In holding that this test was not met at the time of the embezzlement, the <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> opinion repeatedly stressed that the embezzler had no “bona fide legal or equitable claim” to the embezzled funds, ibid.; that the victim never “condoned or forgave the taking of the money and still holds him liable to restore it,” <citedDecision>id., at 406</citedDecision> ; and that the “debtor-creditor relationship was definite and unconditional.” <citedDecision>Id., at 409</citedDecision> .  These statements all express the same basic fact — the fact which is emphasized most strongly in the opinion’s conclusion explaining *250 why the embezzler had not yet received taxable income: “Sanctioning a tax under the circumstances before us would serve only to give the United States an unjustified preference as to part of the money which rightfully and completely belongs to the taxpayer’s employer.” Id., at 410.  (Emphasis added.) However, <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> plainly stated that “if the unconditional indebtedness is cancelled or retired, taxable income may adhere, under certain circumstances, to the taxpayer.” <citedDecision>327 U. S., at 408</citedDecision> .  More specifically,.it recognized that had the embezzler’s victim “condoned or forgiven any part of the [indebtedness], the [embezzler] might have been subject to tax liability to that extent,” <citedDecision>id., at 410</citedDecision> , i.  e., in the tax year of such forgiveness.  These statements reflect an understanding of, and regard for, substantive tax law concepts solidly entrenched in our prior decisions.  Since our landmark case of United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., 284 U. S. 1 , it has been settled that, upon a discharge of indebtedness by an event other than full repayment, the debtor realizes a taxable gain in the year of discharge to the extent of the indebtedness thus extinguished.  Such gains are commonly referred to as ones realized through “bargain cancellations” of indebtedness, and it was in this area, and indeed, in Kirby Lumber Co. itself, that the “accession” theory or “economic gain” concept of taxable income, upon which The Chief Justice’s opinion today mistakenly, relies, found its genesis.  In that case, the taxpayer, a corporation, had reduced a portion of its debt, with a corresponding gain in assets, by purchasing its bonds in the open market at considerably less than their issue price.  Mr. Justice Holmes, who wrote the Court’s opinion, found it unnecessary to state the elementary principle that, so long as the bonds remained a fully enforceable debt obligation of the taxpayer, there could be no taxable gain.  However, when the taxpayer retired the debt by purchasing *251 the bonds for less than their face, value, it “made a clear [taxable] gain” and “realized within the year an accession to income” in the amount of its bargain.  284 U. S., at 3 .  This doctrine has since been reaffirmed and strengthened by us, see, e. g., Helvering v. American Chicle Co., 291 U. S. 426 ; Commissioner v. Jacobson, 336 U. S. 28 , and by the lower federal courts in numerous decisions involving a variety of “bargain cancellations” of indebtedness, as by a creditor’s release condoning or forgiving the indebtedness in whole or in part, 2 or by the running of a Statute of Limitations barring the legal enforceability of the obligation.  3 In none of these cases has it been suggested that a taxable gain might be realized by the debtor at any time prior to the effective date of discharge, and as <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> recognized, there is no rational basis on which to justify such a rule where the debt arises through embezzlement.  An embezzler, like a common thief, acquires not a semblance of right, title, or interest in his plunder, and whether he spends it or not, he is indebted to his victim in the full amount taken as surely as if he had left a signed promissory note at the scene of the crime.  Of no consequence from any standpoint is the absence of such formalities as (in the words of the prevailing opinion) “the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay.” The law readily implies whatever “consensual recognition” is needed for the rightful owner to assert an immediately ripe and enforceable obligation of *252 repayment against the wrongful taker.  These principles are not “attenuated subtleties” but are among the clearest and most easily applied rules of our law. They exist to protect the rights of the innocent victim, and we should accord them full recognition and respect.  The fact that an embezzler’s victim may have less chance of success than other creditors in seeking repayment from his debtor is not a valid reason for us further to diminish his prospects by adopting a rule that would allow the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to assert and enforce a prior federal tax lien against that which “rightfully and completely belongs” to the victim.  Commissioner v. <citedDecision>Wilcox, supra, at 410</citedDecision> .  The Chief Justice’s opinion quite understandably expresses much concern for “honest taxpayers,” but it attempts neither to deny nor justify the manifest injury that its holding will inflict on those honest taxpayers, victimized by embezzlers, who will find their claims for recovery subordinated to federal tax liens.  Statutory provisions, by which we are bound, clearly and unequivocally accord priority to federal tax liens over the claims of others, including “judgment creditors.” 4 *253 However, if it later happens that the debtor-creditor relationship between the embezzler and his victim is discharged by something other than full repayment, such as-by the running of a Statute of Limitations against the victim’s claim, or by a release given for less than the full amount owed, the embezzler at that time, but not before, will have made a clear taxable gain and realized “an accession to income” which he will be required under full penalty of the law to report in his federal income tax return for that year.  No honest taxpayer could be harmed by this rule.  The inherent soundness of this rule could not be more clearly demonstrated than as applied to the facts of the case before us.  Petitioner, a labor union official, concededly embezzled sums totaling more than $738,000 from the union’s funds, over a period extending from 1951 to 1954.  When the shortages were discovered in 1956, the union at once filed civil actions against petitioner to compel repayment.

 U. S. 417, is the case which introduced the principle since used to facilitate uniformity and certainty in annual tax accounting procedure, i.  e., that a taxpayer must report in gross income, in the year in which received, money or property acquired under a ''claim of right” — a colorable claim of the right to exclusive possession of the money or property.  Thus, in its complete form, the sentence in North American Oil from which the above-quoted fragment was extracted reads: “If a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without *257 restriction as to its [sic] disposition, he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.” Id., at 424.  (Emphasis added.) But embezzled funds, like stolen property generally, are not “earnings” in any sense and are held without a vestige of a colorable claim of right; they constitute the principal of a debt.  Of no significance whatever is the formality of “consensual recognition, express or implied” of an obligation to repay.  By substituting this meaningless abstraction in place of the omitted portion of the North American Oil test of when a receipt constitutes taxable income, the prevailing opinion today goes far beyond overruling <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> — it reduces a substantial body of tax law into uncertainty and confusion.  The above-cited case of United States v. Lewis, 340 U. S. 590 , decided 19 years after North American Oil, demonstrates the truth of this.  For there we said: “The ‘claim of right’ interpretation of the tax laws has long been used to give finality to [the accounting] period, and is now deeply rooted in the federal tax system.  .  .  .  We see no reason why the Court should depart from this well-settled interpretation merely because it results in an advantage or disadvantage to a taxpayer.” 340 U. S., at 592 .  The same principle was reiterated and applied in Healy v. Commissioner, 345 U. S. 278 .  The supposed conflict between <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> and Rutkin, upon which The Chief Justice’s opinion seeks to justify its repudiation of Wilcox, 7 has been adequately treated in *258 the opinion of Mr. Justice Black, and I agree with him that those cases were fully intended to be, and are, reconcilable, both on their controlling facts and applicable law. If the unnecessarily broad language used in the Rutkin opinion has misled any of the lower federal courts in their understanding of the principles underlying <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> , we should clarify their understanding at this time, and continue our adherence to “a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 .  “A proper regard for its genesis, as well as its very clear language, requires also that [the Sixteenth] Amendment shall not be extended by loose construction .... Congress cannot by any definition [of income] it may adopt conclude the matter, since it cannot by legislation alter the Constitution, from which alone it derives its power to legislate, and within whose limitations alone that power can be lawfully exercised.” Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U. S. 189, 206 .  See, e. g., Spear Box Co. v. Commissioner, 182 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir.); Helvering v. Jane Holding Corp., 109 F. 2d 933 (C. A. 8th Cir.); Pacific Magnesium, Inc., v. Westover, 86 F. Supp. 644 (D. C. S. D. Cal.).  See, e. g., Schweppe v. Commissioner, 168 F. 2d 284 (C. A. 9th Cir.); North American Coal Corp. v. Commissioner, 97 F. 2d 325 (C. A. 6th Cir.); Securities Co. v. United States, 85 F. Supp. 532 (D. C. S. D. N.Y.).  26 U. S. C. §§ 6321-6323 , 6331; Bankruptcy Act, § 64 (a), 11 U. S. C. § 104 (a).  Moreover, R. S. §3466 (1876), now codified in 31 U. S. C. § 191 , pertaining to state insolvency proceedings against debtors, commands that “the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.” We long ago established that the term “debts” in this statute' includes delinquent federal taxes.  Price v. United States, 269 U. S. 492, 499-500 .

Patterson, Essentials of Insurance Law (2d ed. 1957), § 43, at 186.  I cannot agree with The Chief Justice's assertion that <citedDecision>Wilcox</citedDecision> has been “thoroughly devitalized” by Rutkin .  See, e. g., the recent case of United States v. Peelle, 159 F. Supp. 45 (D. C. E. D. N. Y., 1958).  There the Government sought to enforce liens for federal income taxes claimed to be due on items of “income” aggregating *258 $678,461.22, which the taxpayer had embezzled from his corporate employer during the years 1945 through 1949.  The items in question consisted of customers’ payments intended for the corporation, and had been embezzled by the taxpayer and kept by him in secret bank accounts.  In 1951 and 1952, he discharged his indebtedness by making full restitution of the embezzled funds to the corporation.  The corporation, which used the accrual method of accounting, paid deficiencies which the Government determined in its 1945-1949 income tax returns, based on its accrued right to receive the embezzled customers’ payments in those years.  Not satisfied with this, the Government took the position that the payments were taxable twice during the same years — once to the corporation when it accrued the right to receive them, and again to the embezzler when he diverted them into the secret bank accounts.  Had this effort at double taxation succeeded, the Government’s combined tax claims would have been far in excess of the amount being taxed.  In rejecting the Government’s argument that the embezzler received taxable income at the time of the embezzlements, the District Court relied wholly upon the decision which the Court today overrules, Commissioner v. <citedDecision>Wilcox, supra.</citedDecision>
