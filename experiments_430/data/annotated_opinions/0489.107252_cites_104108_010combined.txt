 We also fully recognize the obligation of all citizens to aid in enforcing the criminal laws.  This Court, while protecting individual rights, has always given ample latitude to law enforcement agencies in the legitimate exercise of their duties.  The limits we have placed on the interrogation process should not constitute an undue interference with a proper system of law enforcement.  As we have noted, our decision does not in any way preclude police from carrying out their traditional investigatory functions.  Although confessions may play an important role in some convictions, the cases before us present graphic examples of the overstatement of the "need" for confessions.  In each case authorities conducted interrogations ranging up to five days in duration despite the presence, through standard investigating practices, of considerable evidence against each defendant.  [51] Further examples are chronicled in our prior cases. See, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 518-519 (1963); Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 541 (1961); Malinski v. New York, <citedDecision>324 U. S. 401, 402</citedDecision> (1945).  [52] *482 It is also urged that an unfettered right to detention for interrogation should be allowed because it will often redound to the benefit of the person questioned.  When police inquiry determines that there is no reason to believe that the person has committed any crime, it is said, he will be released without need for further formal procedures.  The person who has committed no offense, however, will be better able to clear himself after warnings with counsel present than without.  It can be assumed that in such circumstances a lawyer would advise his client to talk freely to police in order to clear himself.  Custodial interrogation, by contrast, does not necessarily afford the innocent an opportunity to clear themselves.  A serious consequence of the present practice of the interrogation alleged to be beneficial for the innocent is that many arrests "for investigation" subject large numbers of innocent persons to detention and interrogation.

 We reverse.  From the testimony of the officers and by the admission of respondent, it is clear that Miranda was not in any way apprised of his right to consult with an attorney and to have one present during the interrogation, nor was his right not to be compelled to incriminate himself effectively protected in any other manner.  Without these warnings the statements were inadmissible.  The mere fact that he signed a statement which contained a typed-in clause stating that he had "full knowledge" of his "legal rights" does not approach the knowing and intelligent waiver required to relinquish constitutional rights.  Cf. Haynes v. Washington , 373 U. S. *493 503, 512-513 (1963); Haley v. Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 601 (1948) (opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS).  No. 760.  Vignera v. <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> .  Petitioner, Michael Vignera, was picked up by New York police on October 14, 1960, in connection with the robbery three days earlier of a Brooklyn dress shop.  They took him to the 17th Detective Squad headquarters in Manhattan.  Sometime thereafter he was taken to the 66th Detective Squad.  There a detective questioned Vignera with respect to the robbery.  Vignera orally admitted the robbery to the detective.  The detective was asked on cross-examination at trial by defense counsel whether Vignera was warned of his right to counsel before being interrogated.

 *503 III. I would continue to follow that rule.  Under the "totality of circumstances" rule of which my Brother Goldberg spoke in Haynes , I would consider in each case whether the police officer prior to custodial interrogation added the warning that the suspect might have counsel present at the interrogation and, further, that a court would appoint one at his request if he was too poor to employ counsel.  In the absence of warnings, the burden would be on the State to prove that counsel was knowingly and intelligently waived or that in the totality of the circumstances, including the failure to give the necessary warnings, the confession was clearly voluntary.  Rather than employing the arbitrary Fifth Amendment rule [4] which the Court lays down I would follow the more pliable dictates of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments which we are accustomed to administering and which we know from our cases are effective instruments in protecting persons in police custody.  In this way we would not be acting in the dark nor in one full sweep changing the traditional rules of custodial interrogation which this Court has for so long recognized as a justifiable and proper tool in balancing individual rights against the rights of society.  It will be soon enough to go further when we are able to appraise with somewhat better accuracy the effect of such a holding.  I would affirm the convictions in Miranda v. Arizona, No. 759; Vignera v. <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> , No. 760; and Westover v. United States , No. 761.  In each of those cases I find from the circumstances no warrant for reversal.  In *504 California v. Stewart, No. 584, I would dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of a final judgment, 28 U. S. C. § 1257 (3) (1964 ed.); but if the merits are to be reached I would affirm on the ground that the State failed to fulfill its burden, in the absence of a showing that appropriate warnings were given, of proving a waiver or a totality of circumstances showing voluntariness.  Should there be a retrial, I would leave the State free to attempt to prove these elements.  MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART and MR. JUSTICE WHITE join, dissenting.  I believe the decision of the Court represents poor constitutional law and entails harmful consequences for the country at large.  How serious these consequences may prove to be only time can tell.

 Despite the Court's disclaimer, the practical effect of the decision made today must inevitably be to handicap seriously sound efforts at reform, not least by removing options necessary to a just compromise of competing interests.  Of course legislative reform is rarely speedy or unanimous, though this Court has been more patient in the past.  [25] But the legislative reforms when they come would have the vast advantage of empirical data and comprehensive study, they would allow experimentation and use of solutions not open to the courts, and they would restore the initiative in criminal law reform to those forums where it truly belongs.  IV. CONCLUSIONS.  All four of the cases involved here present express claims that confessions were inadmissible, not because of coercion in the traditional due process sense, but solely because of lack of counsel or lack of warnings concerning counsel and silence.  For the reasons stated in this opinion, I would adhere to the due process test and reject the new requirements inaugurated by the Court. On this premise my disposition of each of these cases can be stated briefly.  In two of the three cases coming from state courts, Miranda v. Arizona (No. 759) and Vignera v. <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> (No. 760), the confessions were held admissible and no other errors worth comment are alleged by petitioners.  *525 I would affirm in these two cases. The other state case is California v. Stewart (No. 584), where the state supreme court held the confession inadmissible and reversed the conviction.  In that case I would dismiss the writ of certiorari on the ground that no final judgment is before us, 28 U. S. C. § 1257 (1964 ed.); putting aside the new trial open to the State in any event, the confession itself has not even been finally excluded since the California Supreme Court left the State free to show proof of a waiver.  If the merits of the decision in Stewart be reached, then I believe it should be reversed and the case remanded so the state supreme court may pass on the other claims available to respondent.  In the federal case, Westover v. United States (No. 761), a number of issues are raised by petitioner apart from the one already dealt with in this dissent.  None of these other claims appears to me tenable, nor in this context to warrant extended discussion.  It is urged that the confession was also inadmissible because not voluntary even measured by due process standards and because federal-state cooperation brought the McNabb-Mallory rule into play under Anderson v. United States, 318 U. S. 350 .

Of course, they had a right to undress him to look for bullet scars, and keep the clothes off him.  That was quite proper police procedure.  That is some more psychologylet him sit around with a blanket on him, humiliate him there for a while; let him sit in the corner, let him think he is going to get a shellacking."

 To the same effect, see Brief for the United States, pp. 40-49, n. 44, Anderson v. United States, 318 U. S. 350 (1943); Brief for the United States, pp. 17-18, McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943).  [32]  Our decision today does not indicate in any manner, of course, that these rules can be disregarded.  When federal officials arrest an individual, they must as always comply with the dictates of the congressional legislation and cases thereunder.  See generally, Hogan & Snee, The McNabb-Mallory Rule: Its Rise, Rationale and Rescue, 47 Geo. L. J. 1 (1958).  [33]  The decisions of this Court have guaranteed the same procedural protection for the defendant whether his confession was used in a federal or state court. It is now axiomatic that the defendant's constitutional rights have been violated if his conviction is based, in whole or in part, on an involuntary confession, regardless of its truth or falsity.  Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 544 (1961); Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1 (1924).  This is so even if there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction, e. g., Malinski v. New York, <citedDecision>324 U. S. 401, 404</citedDecision> (1945); Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532, 540-542 (1897).  Both state and federal courts now adhere to trial procedures which seek to assure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession offered at trial, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964); United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 38 (1951); see also Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 624 (1896).  Appellate review is exacting, see Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199 (1960).  Whether his conviction was in a federal or state court, the defendant may secure a post-conviction hearing based on the alleged involuntary character of his confession, provided he meets the procedural requirements, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963).  In addition, see Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U. S. 52 (1964).  [34]  See Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 241 (1941); Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 (1944); Malinski v. New York, <citedDecision>324 U. S. 401</citedDecision> (1945); Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315 (1959); Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 (1963); Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963).  [35]  The police also prevented the attorney from consulting with his client.  Independent of any other constitutional proscription, this action constitutes a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel and excludes any statement obtained in its wake.  See People v. Donovan, 13 N. Y. 2d 148, 193 N. E. 2d 628 , 243 N. Y. S. 2d 841 (1963) (Fuld, J.).  [36] In re Groban, 352 U. S. 330, 340-352 (1957) (BLACK, J., dissenting); Note, 73 Yale L.

Lord Devlin has commented: "It is probable that even today, when there is much less ignorance about these matters than formerly, there is still a general belief that you must answer all questions put to you by a policeman, or at least that it will be the worse for you if you do not."
