 Id., at 819 .  The infringement on prisoners’ rights, the Court held, was reasonable because prisoners could write letters to the media — a means of communication less disruptive than the physical entry of reporters into the prison.  Id., at 824 .  The reporters’ assertion of a special right of access could not prevail, the Court explained, because the First Amendment does not give the media greater access to public events or institutions — including prisons — than it gives ordinary citizens.  9 Id., at 835 .  Pell in no way diluted the basic distinction articulated in Martinez .  Inmates in Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, Inc., <citedDecision>433 U. S. 119</citedDecision> (1977), had maintained that First *426 Amendment associational rights protected their efforts to form a union.  The Court concluded that the administrators’ grounds for preventing union organizing within the prison— an activity occurring largely among inmates — were reasonable.  <citedDecision>Id., at 129</citedDecision> .  It also approved the officials’ refusal to deliver bulk packets of union literature to specific inmates for distribution to others.  Applying Equal Protection Clause as well as First Amendment standards, the Court held that the restriction was reasonable because it was limited in scope and because the union retained “other avenues of outside informational flow .  .  .  .” <citedDecision>Id., at 131</citedDecision> ; see <citedDecision>id., at 133, 136</citedDecision> .  In the third case, Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979), the Court upheld a regulation that allowed only publishers, bookstores, and book clubs to mail hardbound books to pretrial detainees.  Hardbacks might serve as containers for contraband, jail administrators argued.  Since the risk of improper use by publishers and similar sources was low, the jail delivered books from them but not from other outsiders.  Id., at 549 .  The Court found this explanation acceptable and held that the rule did not violate the detainees’ First Amendment rights.  Id., at 550 .

 See Abbott v. Meese, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 193, 824 F. 2d 1166, 1173 (1987).  The term “detrimental” invites so many interpretations that it scarcely checks administrators’ actions.  Similarly, “might facilitate” —in contrast with “encourage” or “advocate” — so attenuates the causal connection between expression and proscribed conduct that the warden has virtually free rein to censor incoming publications.  Despite this vagueness, the Court accepts petitioners’ assertion that they need “broad discretion” to prevent internal disorder, and thus holds that all the regulations are facially valid.  See ante, at 416.  This premature leap of faith creates a presumption that rejections pursuant to these regulations are “reasonable” — a presumption that makes likely far less judicial protection of publishers’ rights than I believe the First Amendment requires.  As was Justice Blackmun in *429 Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 593 (1984) (concurring in judgment), I am concerned that the Court today too readily “shbstitute[s] the rhetoric of judicial deference for meaningful scrutiny of constitutional claims in the prison setting.” Cf. O’Lone v. Estate of Shabazz, 482 U. S. 342, 358 (1987) (Brennan, J., dissenting); Jones, <citedDecision>433 U. S., at 142-143</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., dissenting).  The feeble protection provided by a “reasonableness” standard applied within the framework of these regulations is apparent in this record.  12 Like the Labyrinth issue, many of the 46 rejected publications criticized prison conditions or otherwise presented viewpoints that prison administrators likely would not welcome.  13 Testimony by one mail clerk 14 *430 and the rote explanations for decisions 15 suggest that rejections were based on personal prejudices or categorical assumptions rather than individual assessments of risk.  Cf. Martinez, 416 U. S., at 415 .  These circumstances belie the Court’s interpretation of these regulations as “content-neutral” and its assertion that rejection decisions are made individually.  See ante, at 414-417.

 Therefore, I believe that that is the questionable area and they are the ones that I refer.” App. 97-98.  Statements of reasons for returning different publications were identical even in their misspelling.  See J. L. 5, 46, 47, 48 (“fT]his publication is used in part to glorify problem inmates and prison unions which could cause problems to inmates and staff in the security and orderly running of this institution.  This publication also propagets /sic/ an adversary attitude by inmates toward staff”); cf. id., at 40 (“|T]his type of material on institutions has a tendency to develop an adversary attitude by inmates toward staff, which can cause an unhealthy environment in this institution").  The Court makes this assumption on the basis of a 14 statement by petitioners at oral argument.  See ante, at 413 (quoting Tr. of Oral Arg. 10).  But each publication at issue was addressed to a single inmate, making this case more analogous to the personal correspondence in Martinez than to the bulk mailings in Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc., <citedDecision>433 U. S. 119</citedDecision> (1977).  The prison regulations in Martinez raised the specter of disruptive dissemination as a justification for censorship, 416 U. S., at 399, n. 3 ; the Court nevertheless found those regulations unconstitutional.  Iquote, in its entirety, the discussion of the record that preceded the District Court’s finding that the all-or-nothing rule was reasonable: “The plaintiffs offered evidence that a less restrictive policy, at no cost to security, would be to tear out the rejected portions and admit the rest of the publication.  But the defendants contend that such censorship would create more discontent than the current practice, and one of the plaintiffs’ witnesses agreed." ” App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  The District Court’s footnote cites to the following trial testimony by a witness whom respondents offered as an expert in the field of corrections: “Q Are you familiar with the policy of the Bureau of Prisons concerning what we call the all-or-nothing rule?  “A As I understand it, if a publication is approved for admission, it may be approved in toto.
