 The Geer analysis has also been eroded to the point of virtual extinction in cases involving regulation of wild animals.  The first challenge to Geer 's theory of a State's power over wild animals came in Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920).  The State of Missouri, relying on the theory of state ownership of wild animals, attacked the Migratory Bird Treaty Act on the ground that it interfered with the State's control over wild animals within its boundaries.  Writing for the Court, Mr. Justice Holmes upheld the Act as a proper *332 exercise of the treatymaking power.  He commented in passing on the artificiality of the Geer rationale: "To put the claim of the State upon title is to lean upon a slender reed." 252 U. S., at 434 .  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, <citedDecision>278 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1928), undermined Geer even more directly.  A Louisiana statute forbade the transportation beyond the State of shrimp taken in Louisiana waters until the heads and shells had been removed.  [10] The statute clearly relied on the Geer state-control-of-ownership rationale.  [11] Anyone lawfully taking shrimp from Louisiana waters was granted "a qualified interest which may be sold within the State." Only after the head and shell *333 had been removed within the State did the taker or possessor acquire "title and the right to sell and ship the same `beyond the limit[s] of the State, without restriction or reservation.' " <citedDecision>278 U. S., at 8</citedDecision> .  Ignoring the niceties of "title" to the shrimp and concentrating instead on the purposes and effects of the statute, Foster-Fountain Packing struck down the statute as economic protectionism abhorrent to the Commerce Clause.  The analysis resembled that employed in the natural gas cases, which were cited with approval, <citedDecision>id., at 10-11, 13</citedDecision> .  [12] Geer was distinguished on the ground that there "[n]o part of the game was permitted by the statute to become an article of interstate commerce." <citedDecision>278 U. S., at 12</citedDecision> .  [13] Limiting Geer to cases involving complete embargoes on interstate commerce in a wild animal created the anomalous result that the most burdensome laws enjoyed the most protection from Commerce Clause attack.  Foster-Fountain Packing 's implicit shift away from Geer 's formalistic "ownership" analysis became explicit in Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385, 402 (1948), which struck down as violations of the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and *334 Immunities Clause certain South Carolina laws discriminating against out-of-state commercial fishermen: "The whole ownership theory, in fact, is now generally regarded as but a fiction expressive in legal shorthand of the importance to its people that a State have power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of an important resource.  And there is no necessary conflict between that vital policy consideration and the constitutional command that the State exercise that power, like its other powers, so as not to discriminate without reason against citizens of other States." Although stated in reference to the Privileges and Immunities Clause challenge, this reasoning is equally applicable to the Commerce Clause challenge.  [14] Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 (1977), dispelled any doubts on that score.  In rejecting the argument that Virginia's "ownership" of fish swimming in its territorial waters empowered the State to forbid fishing by federally licensed ships owned by nonresidents while permitting residents to fish, Seacoast Products explicitly embraced the analysis of the Geer dissenters: "A State does not stand in the same position as the owner of a private game preserve and it is pure fantasy to talk of `owning' wild fish, birds, or animals.

 Under that general rule, we must inquire (1) whether the challenged statute regulates evenhandedly with only "incidental" effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce either on its face or in practical effect; (2) whether the statute serves a legitimate local purpose; and, if so, (3) whether alternative means could promote this local purpose as well without discriminating against interstate commerce.  The burden to show discrimination rests on the party challenging the validity of the statute, but "[w]hen discrimination against commerce .  .  .  is demonstrated, the burden falls on the State to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of non-discriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve the local interests at stake." Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333, 353 (1977).  Furthermore, when considering the purpose of a challenged statute, this Court is not bound by "[t]he name, description or characterization given it by the legislature or the courts of the State," but will determine for itself the practical impact of the law. Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545, 550 (1924); see Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, <citedDecision>278 U. S., at 10</citedDecision> ; Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., supra .  Section 4-115 (B) on its face discriminates against interstate commerce.  It forbids the transportation of natural minnows *337 out of the State for purposes of sale, and thus "overtly blocks the flow of interstate commerce at [the] State's borders." Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 624 .  Such facial discrimination by itself may be a fatal defect, regardless of the State's purpose, because "the evil of protectionism can reside in legislative means as well as legislative ends." Id., at 626 .  [17] At a minimum such facial discrimination invokes the strictest scrutiny of any purported legitimate local purpose and of the absence of nondiscriminatory alternatives.

 This Court long has recognized that the ownership *342 language of Geer and similar cases is simply a shorthand way of describing a State's substantial interest in preserving and regulating the exploitation of the fish and game and other natural resources within its boundaries for the benefit of its citizens.  436 U. S., at 386 ; Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 284; Toomer v. Witsell, supra, at 402 .  In recognition of this important state interest, the Court has upheld a variety of regulations designed to conserve and maintain the natural resources of a State.  See, e. g., Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, supra ; Huron Portland Cement Co. v. Detroit, 362 U. S. 440 (1960); Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545 (1924); Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 138 (1914); Geer v. Connecticut, supra ; Manchester v. Massachusetts, 139 U. S. 240 (1891); McCready v. Virginia, 94 U. S. 391 (1877); Smith v. Maryland, 18 How. 71 (1855).  To be sure, a State's power to preserve and regulate wildlife within its borders is not absolute.  [6] But the State is accorded wide latitude in fashioning regulations appropriate for protection of its wildlife.  Unless the regulation directly conflicts with a federal statute or treaty, Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., supra, at 283-285; Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529, 546 (1976); Missouri v. Holland, supra, at 434 ; allocates access in a manner that violates the Fourteenth Amendment, Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, 334 U. S. 410 (1948); or represents a naked attempt to discriminate against out-of-state enterprises in favor of in-state businesses unrelated to any purpose of conservation, Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, <citedDecision>278 U. S. 1, 13</citedDecision> (1928), the State's special interest in preserving its wildlife *343 should prevail.  And this is true no matter how "Balkanized" the resulting pattern of commercial activity.  [7] The Oklahoma law at issue in this case serves the special interest of the State, as representative of its citizens, in preserving and regulating exploitation of free-swimming minnows found within its waters.  "[T]he law serve[s] to protect against the depletion of minnows in Oklahoma's natural streams through commercial exportation." 572 P. 2d 573, 575 (Okla. Crim. App. 1977).  Oklahoma's statutory scheme may not be the most artfully designed to accomplish its purpose.  [8] *344 But the range of regulations that a State may adopt under these circumstances is extremely broad, particularly where, as here, the burden on interstate commerce is, at most, minimal.

 This is not a case where a State's regulation permits residents to export naturally seined minnows but prohibits nonresidents from so doing.  No person is allowed to export natural minnows for sale outside of Oklahoma; the statute is evenhanded in its application.  See Okla. Stat., Tit. 29, ยง 4-115 (B) (Supp. 1978).  The State has not used its power to protect its own citizens from outside competition.  See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U. S. 333 (1977); H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525 (1949).  Nor is this a *345 case where a State requires a nonresident business, as a condition to exporting minnows, to move a significant portion of its operations to the State or to use certain state resources in pursuit of its business for the benefit of the local economy.  See Toomer v. Witsell, 334 U. S. 385 (1948); Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, <citedDecision>278 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1928); Johnson v. Haydel, 278 U. S. 16 (1928); cf. Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 145 (1970).  And, notwithstanding the Court's protestations to the contrary, Oklahoma has not blocked the flow of interstate commerce in minnows at the State's borders.  See ante, at 336-337.  Appellant, or anyone else, may freely export as many minnows as he wishes, so long as the minnows so transported are hatchery minnows and not naturally seined minnows.  On this record, I simply fail to see how interstate commerce in minnows, the commodity at issue here, is impeded in the least by Oklahoma's regulatory scheme.  [9] Oklahoma does regulate the manner in which both residents and nonresidents procure minnows to be sold outside the State.  But there is no showing in this record that requiring appellant to purchase his minnows from hatcheries instead of from persons licensed to seine minnows from the State's waters in any way increase appellant's costs of doing business.

 Takahashi v. Fish & Game Comm'n, 334 U. S. 410, 420-421 (1948), decided the same day as Toomer , reviewed the cases distinguishing and questioning Geer and found the State's claim to "ownership" inadequate to justify a ban on commercial fishing by alien residents.  [15]  "In more recent years .  .  .  the Court has recognized that the States' interest in regulating and controlling those things they claim to `own,' including wildlife, is by no means absolute.  States may not compel the confinement of the benefits of their resources, even their wildlife, to their own people whenever such hoarding and confinement impedes interstate commerce.  Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, <citedDecision>278 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1928); Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923); West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911)." Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, 436 U. S. 371, 385-386 (1978).  [16]  See, e. g., Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 , 285 n. 21 (1977).  [17]  "[W]hatever [a State's] ultimate purpose, it may not be accomplished by discriminating against articles of commerce coming from outside the State unless there is some reason, apart from their origin, to treat them differently." Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S., at 626-627 .  [18]  See n. 1, supra. [19]  Section 4-115 (B) does not apply to persons transporting three dozen or less natural minnows outside the State.  See n. 1, supra. [20]  In its brief, Oklahoma argues, apparently for the first time, that the discrimination against out-of-state sales of natural minnows is justified because minnows purchased in the State are more likely to be used for bait in state waters.
