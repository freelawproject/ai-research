 383 F. 2d 709 (1967).  Recognizing that the District Courts had correctly applied McNally , the Court of Appeals declined to adhere to that decision.  Writing for a unanimous court, Chief Judge Haynsworth reasoned that this Court would no longer follow McNally , which in his view represented a “doctrinaire approach” based on an “old jurisdictional concept” which had been “thoroughly rejected by the Supreme Court in recent cases.” 6 Id., *58 at 714.  We are in complete agreement with this conclusion and the considerations underlying it.  The writ of habeas corpus is a procedural device for subjecting executive, 7 judicial, 8 or private 9 restraints on liberty to judicial scrutiny.  Where it is available, it assures among other things that a prisoner may require his jailer to justify the detention under the law. 10 In England where it originated and in the United States, this high purpose has made the writ both the symbol and guardian of individual liberty.  3 Blackstone, Commentaries *131-138; see Ex parte Bollman, 4 Cranch 75 (1807); Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163 (1874); Moore v. Dempsey, <citedDecision>261 U. S. 86</citedDecision> (1923); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953); Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963).  The habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal courts is enumerated in 28 U. S. C. § 2241 .  Like the predecessor statute which controlled in McNally , 11 § 2241 provides for *59 the issuance of writs on behalf of persons “in custody.” But the statute does not attempt to define the terms “habeas corpus” or “custody.” Confronted with this fact, the Court in McNally reasoned that “[t]o ascertain its meaning and the appropriate use of the writ in the federal courts, recourse must be had to the common law .  .  .  and to the decisions of this Court interpreting and applying the common law principles .. ..” McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S., at 136 .  We need not look very far to discover three principal characteristics of the writ as it had developed in the federal courts even before the decision in McNally .  First, though the writ in England had been utilized largely to secure the admission to bail and discharge of prisoners, 12 its major office in the federal courts since the Civil War has been to provide post-conviction relief.  13 Second, the partial codifications of the common-law writ in England and more recent legislation in this country have contained specific and detailed provisions requiring prompt adjudication of the validity of the challenged restraint.  See and compare Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. 2, c. 2; Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, 14 Stat. 385 ; and 28 U. S. C. § 2243 .  Third, at least tentatively in Frank v. Mangum, 237 U. S. 309 *60 (1915), and more clearly in Moore v. Dempsey, <citedDecision>261 U. S. 86</citedDecision> (1923), this Court had recognized that a district court was authorized to look behind the bare record of a trial proceeding and conduct a factual hearing to determine the merits of alleged deprivations of constitutional rights 14 — a procedure that reached full flowering in Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938).  Thus, by the time McNally was decided, the federal writ of habeas corpus was substantially a post-conviction device which could afford prompt adjudication of factual as well as legal issues.  Keeping these purposes of the writ in mind, we turn to consideration of the McNally holding and the reasons which compel us to overrule it.  A federal jury had found McNally guilty of three counts of an indictment charging offenses under the Motor Vehicle Theft Act (now 18 U. S. C. §§ 2312-2313 ).  15 He had been sentenced to two years on the first count and four years each on the second and third counts, the sentences on the first and second counts to run con *61 currently and the sentence on the third consecutively.  In his application in a district court for a writ of habeas corpus, McNally claimed that the indictment failed to state an offense as to the third count.  He did not attack the convictions under the first and second counts.

 Of course prejudice to meritorious claims resulting from the kind of delay which McNally imposes is not limited to situations involving ineffective assistance of counsel.  To name but a few examples, factual determinations are often dispositive of claims of coerced confession, e. g., Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433 (1961), Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556 (1954); lack of competency to stand trial, e. g., Pate v. Robinson, 383 U. S. 375 (1966); and denial of a fair trial, e. g., Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U. S. 333 (1966).  Postponement of the adjudication of such issues for years can harm both the prisoner and the State and lessens the probability that final disposition of the case will do substantial justice.  16 As the Court of Appeals observed: “Years hence, the prisoner, at least, may be expected to give testimonial support to the allegations of his petition, but if they are false in fact, the Commonwealth of Virginia may be unable to refute them because of the unavailability of records and of the testimony of responsible officials and participants in the trial. The greater the lapse of time, the more unlikely it becomes that the state could re-prosecute if retrials are held to be necessary.  It *63 is to the great interest of the Commonwealth and to the prisoner to have these matters determined as soon as possible when there is the greatest likelihood the truth of the matter may be established.” 17 383 F. 2d, at 715.  Clearly, to the extent that the rule of McNally postpones plenary consideration of issues by the district courts, it undermines the character of the writ of habeas corpus as the instrument for resolving fact issues not adequately developed in the original proceedings.  To that extent, it also undermines <citedDecision>Moore</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Dempsey, supra,</citedDecision> and is inconsistent with subsequent decisions of this Court which have reaffirmed Moore.  E. g., Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 (1938); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953); Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963).  McNally is also at odds with the purpose of the writ of habeas corpus in another respect.  As noted above, a principal aim of the writ is to provide for swift judicial review of alleged unlawful restraints on liberty.  Calendar congestion, considerations of federalism, see, e. g., Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S., at 415-420 ; Ex parte Royall, *64 117 U. S. 241 (1886), and the exigencies of appellate review account for largely unavoidable delays in the processing of criminal cases. But the prematurity rule of McNally in many instances extends without practical justification the time a prisoner entitled to release must remain in confinement.  Rowe and Thacker eventually may establish that the convictions they challenge were obtained in violation of the Constitution.  If they do, each day they are incarcerated under those convictions while their cases are in the courts will be time that they might properly have enjoyed as free men.

 12 The celebrated Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. 2, c. 2, was concerned exclusively with providing an efficacious remedy for pretrial imprisonment.  See W. Church, A Treatise on the Writ of Habeas Corpus 21-32, 48-58 (2d ed. 1893).  13 This development is explained in part by this Court’s recognition that certain trial or sentencing defects could invalidate the proceedings in a court which had jurisdiction over the crime and the defendant, e. g., Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163 (1874), by the Court’s decisions holding that some of the safeguards of criminal procedure embodied in the Bill of Rights are applicable to state criminal proceedings by virtue of the Due.  Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and by the requirement that a state prisoner exhaust state remedies before applying for federal habeas corpus.  Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886); 28 U. S. C. § 2254 ; see Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 415-420 (1963).  14 The Court in Frank recognized that the Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, 14 Stat. 385 , substituted “for the bare legal review that seems to have been the limit of judicial authority under the common-law practice ... a more searching investigation, in which the applicant is put upon his oath to set forth the truth of the matter respecting the causes of his detention, and the court, upon determining the actual facts, is to ‘dispose of the party as law and justice require.’ ” 237 U. S., at 330-331 .  In <citedDecision>Moore</citedDecision> , the Court remanded the case to the District Court for determination of the truth of allegations that the pervading influence of a mob had denied the appellants a fair trial in the state court. <citedDecision>261 U. S., at 92</citedDecision> .  15 Because McNally was imprisoned by federal authorities, his application for habeas corpus relief could have rested on the clause of Rev. Stat. § 753 (1874) which authorized federal courts to entertain petitions from prisoners in the custody of the United States.  However, the Court’s interpretation of the custody requirement in McNally was equally applicable to state prisoners claiming their incarceration violated the Constitution.  E. g., Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 203 (1950).  16 Even where resolution of constitutional claims turns on record evidence, loss or destruction of a relevant document or failure to transcribe the record over a period of years, cf. Norvell v. Illinois, 373 U. S. 420 (1963), could mean that a claim relegated to the limbo of prematurity might never be adequately determined.  17 This consideration has led at least two States which previously followed the prematurity doctrine to reject it in recent years.  See Commonwealth ex rel. Stevens v. Myers, 419 Pa. 1 , 213 A. 2d 613 (1965); Ore. Rev. Stat. § 138.510 (1961).
