      <p class="indent">Until 1983, judges appointed under Article III of the Constitution, like most federal employees, did not participate in the Social Security program.  Most legislative and executive federal employees acquired a retirement annuity by contributing to the Civil Service Retirement System.  5 U.S.C. Secs. 8331-51 (1994).  After meeting age and service requirements, however, Article III judges receive a retirement annuity equal to their judicial salaries without making additional payments.  28 U.S.C.

      <span class="num">14</span>
      <p class="indent">This case raises the question whether imposition of new taxes on judges after they have taken office unconstitutionally diminishes their compensation.  The Supreme Court addressed this very issue in Evans.   In Evans, the Court held that the Compensation Clause prohibited imposition of the newly enacted income tax on sitting judges.  Examining the broad constitutional protection for judicial independence, the Court wrote:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p15">
      <span class="num">15</span>
      <p>The prohibition is general, contains no excepting words and appears to be directed against all diminution, whether for one purpose or another;  and the reasons for its adoption ... make with impelling force for the conclusion that the fathers of the Constitution intended to prohibit diminution by taxation as well as otherwise,--that they regarded the independence of the judges as of far greater importance than any revenue that could come from taxing their salaries.</p>

      <p class="indent">When the judges in Evans first assumed office, Congress had not charged them with the duty of paying income taxes.  Thus, the imposition of these taxes on their salaries acted as a reduction in their salary.  As the Court observed:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p18">
      <span class="num">18</span>
      <p>Here the Constitution expressly forbids diminution of the judge's compensation, meaning, as we have shown, diminution by taxation or otherwise....  [T]he compensation suffers a diminution to the extent that it is taxed.</p>

      <p class="indent"><span class="citation" data-id="99610"><a href="/opinion/99610/evans-v-gore/">Id. at 264</a></span>.  The Court therefore invalidated application of the income tax to judges who had taken office prior to the tax.</p>

      <p class="indent">Evans controls this case.  The claimants here are Article III judges who took office prior to imposition of the Social Security taxes in question.  Federal law did not charge the claimants with the duty of paying Social Security taxes when they first assumed office.  Subsequent imposition of the taxes reduced the claimants' salaries, as in Evans.</p>

In that case, the Court held that newly appointed Article III judges must continue to pay income taxes just as they had prior to appointment:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p22">
      <span class="num">22</span>

      <p class="indent">Because the claimants in O'Malley took office after Congress had made income taxes applicable to judges' salaries, those judicial claimants suffered no diminishment in compensation after taking office.  The tax was a pre-existing obligation factored into the new judges' compensation.  On this basis O'Malley is distinguishable from Evans and the facts of this case.  In Evans and this case, the claimants were already judges when the Social Security taxes took effect.  The taxes therefore affected the claimants' established compensation.  Thus, Congress's imposition of the Social Security tax on the claimants triggered scrutiny under the Compensation Clause.</p>

      <p class="indent">The Supreme Court has stated that O'Malley "undermined the reasoning of Evans."  United States v.

This court's predecessor has made the same point.  See Atkins v. United States, <span class="citation no-link">556 F.2d 1028</span>, 1044, <span class="citation no-link">214 Ct.Cl. 186</span> (1977) (en banc), cert. denied, <span class="citation no-link">434 U.S. 1009</span>, <span class="citation no-link">98 S.Ct. 718</span>, <span class="citation no-link">54 L.Ed.2d 751</span> (1978).  Neither of these pronouncements, however, are sufficient to overrule Evans.   Had changes in judicial doctrine in fact "removed or weakened the conceptual underpinnings" of Evans, the Court itself would have overruled the case.  Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, <span class="citation" data-id="112296"><a href="/opinion/112296/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/">491 U.S. 164</a></span>, 173, <span class="citation" data-id="112296"><a href="/opinion/112296/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/">109 S.Ct. 2363</a></span>, 2370-71, <span class="citation" data-id="112296"><a href="/opinion/112296/patterson-v-mclean-credit-union/">105 L.Ed.2d 132</a></span> (1989).

      <span class="num">28</span>
      <p class="indent">The trial court erred by upholding the imposition of Social Security taxes on the claimants on the grounds that such taxation was both "generally applicable" and "non-discriminatory."   See O'Malley, <span class="citation" data-id="103214"><a href="/opinion/103214/omalley-v-woodrough/">307 U.S. at 282</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="103214"><a href="/opinion/103214/omalley-v-woodrough/">59 S.Ct. at 840</a></span>;  see also Atkins, 556 F.2d at 1045.   The trial court holding thus interprets the Constitution's Compensation Clause to forbid only discriminatory taxes which single out the federal judiciary.  In other words, the trial court in effect read the term "compensation" as synonymous with "salary," and "diminished" as synonymous with "intentionally reduced."   This reading limited the protections for judicial independence to discriminatory attacks on the judiciary in the form of direct reductions in salary.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p29">
      <span class="num">29</span>
      <p class="indent">The words of the Constitution are not so limited, nor are its protections for judicial independence.  "Compensation" embraces all forms of remuneration, not merely salary.  "Diminished" embraces all means of decreasing, regardless of the intent or target of the reduction.  Thus, the Constitution protects judicial compensation against all forms of diminishment.</p>

    <div class="num" id="p30">
      <span class="num">30</span>
      <p class="indent">The Constitution's enactment history supports this reading of the Compensation Clause.  On June 13, 1787, the Constitutional Convention's Committee of the Whole drafted a resolution prohibiting Congress from either increasing or decreasing the compensation of judges.  Clinton Rossiter, 1787:  The Grand Convention 365 (1966).  Gouveneur Morris opposed the prohibition on increases, as he believed that Congress should have the power to augment judicial compensation "as circumstances might require" to avoid "any improper dependence in the judges."   2 Max Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 at 44 (1911).  Benjamin Franklin agreed and specified two circumstances--increases in workload and inflation of the currency--which would justify an increase.  Id. at 44-45.</p>

    <div class="num" id="p31">
      <span class="num">31</span>
      <p class="indent">James Madison favored retaining the ban on increases in compensation.  He feared that judges might unduly defer to Congress during legislative consideration of pay raises.  Id. at 45.  In other words, the Convention was unanimous on the overriding concern of protecting the judicial branch against meddling with its compensation.  Further, the Convention voiced grave concerns about potential compromises in judicial independence if judges faced the prospect of seeking legislative redress of compensation concerns.  In sum, the Convention perceived only mischief in the prospect of judges approaching the legislative branch to seek proper compensation.  Ultimately, on a vote of 6-2, with one state absent, the Convention permitted increases and forbade all decreases in judicial compensation.  Id. at 45.</p>

      <p>It will readily be understood that the fluctuations in the value of money and in the state of society rendered a fixed rate of compensation in the Constitution inadmissible.  What might be extravagant today might in half a century become penurious and inadequate.  It was therefore necessary to leave it to the discretion of the legislature to vary its provisions in conformity to the variations in circumstances, yet under such restrictions as to put it out of the power of that body to change the condition of the individual [judge] for the worse.</p>

In such circumstances, the taxation formed part of that judge's compensation scheme from the outset of his tenure.  See O'Malley, <span class="citation" data-id="103214"><a href="/opinion/103214/omalley-v-woodrough/">307 U.S. at 282</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="103214"><a href="/opinion/103214/omalley-v-woodrough/">59 S.Ct. at 838</a></span>.</p>

      <p class="indent">Nor does Atkins provide support for application of a nondiscrimination test to the taxes imposed in this case.  In Atkins, the United States Court of Claims found that Congress' failure to raise judicial salaries during a period of high inflation was not an actionable diminution under the Compensation Clause, because the plaintiff judges could not show that Congress intended an attack on the judiciary's independence.</p>

      <p class="indent">However appropriate it may be to consider whether inflation diminishes judicial compensation in a discriminatory fashion, as in Atkins, or applies taxes of general applicability to judges taking office after such taxes are effective, as in O'Malley, neither the Compensation Clause nor Supreme Court precedent supports applying a non-discrimination test to the imposition of a new tax, even though generally applicable, on sitting judges.  As indicated above, the controlling Supreme Court precedent, Evans, instructs otherwise.  Evans, <span class="citation" data-id="99610"><a href="/opinion/99610/evans-v-gore/">253 U.S. at 254-55</a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="99610"><a href="/opinion/99610/evans-v-gore/">40 S.Ct. at 553-54</a></span>.   Under Evans, only judges who took office prior to the imposition of the new Social Security taxes suffered a diminution.</p>

      <p class="indent">The trial court did not determine whether the Social Security taxes in this case in fact diminished the claimants' compensation.  Although noting that inclusion in Social Security might not result in an overall reduction of compensation, Hatter, 31 Fed.Cl. at 441 n. 9, the trial court assumed a reduction, noting the decrease at least in take-home pay, for the purpose of resolving the summary judgment motions before it and proceeding to the constitutional issue.</p>

      <p class="indent">As noted, the term "compensation" extends beyond mere salary, and includes all forms of remuneration attached to the judicial office.  Therefore, the claimants' new Social Security retirement benefits, if any, are part of their compensation.  These future benefits, however, are not vested in any manner.  They thus do not give the claimants a certain entitlement to any offsetting sum.  In addition, innumerable individual scenarios could eliminate a claimant's potential Social Security benefit, or greatly reduce the amount of the potential benefit.  Because of all the variables that would have to be taken into account in arriving at even a rough estimate of a current discounted value for Social Security benefits that might be payable in the future, it is impossible accurately to weigh these benefits against the taxes withheld from the claimants.</p>

      <p class="indent">It is certain, however, that the Social Security taxes diminished the claimants' salaries by specific amounts.  The reduction was concrete, while the potential future benefit is entirely speculative.  A speculative, incalculable future benefit cannot offset a concrete, present reduction.<a class="footnote" href="#fn-s" id="fn-s_ref">*</a>  The Social Security taxes therefore diminished the claimants' compensation in violation of the Compensation Clause.CONCLUSION</p>
