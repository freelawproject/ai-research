 The court explained that Queensgate did not control because it involved a far narrower alcohol advertising regulation.  Id., at 745-746.  By contrast, in Oklahoma Telecasters Assn. v. Crisp, 699 F. 2d 490, 495-497 (1983), rev’d on other grounds sub nom. Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S. 691, 697 (1984), the Tenth Circuit relied on Queensgate in considering a prohibition against broadcasting alcohol advertisements.  The Court of Appeals concluded that Queensgate stood-for the proposition that the Twenty-first Amendment gives the State greater authority to regulate liquor advertising than the First Amendment would otherwise allow.  699 F. 2d, at 495-497 .  Other than the two Rhode Island Supreme Court decisions upholding the constitutionality of the statutes at issue in this case, only one published state court opinion has considered our summary action in Queensgate in passing on a liquor advertising restriction.  See Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Assn. v. Attorney General, <citedDecision>142 Mich. App. 294</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>370 N. W. 2d 328</citedDecision> (1985).  There, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that Queens-gate did not control because it involved a far narrower restriction on liquor advertising than the one that Michigan had imposed.  <citedDecision>142 Mich. App., at 304-305</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>370 N. W. 2d, at 333-335</citedDecision> .  By contrast, the First Amendment does not protect commercial speech about unlawful activities.  See Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm’n on Human Relations, 413 U. S. 376 (1973).  See Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U. S. 350 , 355 (1977) (ban on lawyer advertising); Carey v. Population Services Int’l, 431 U. S. 678, 700 (1977) (ban on contraceptive advertising); Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Willingboro, 431 U. S. 85, 92-94 (1977) (ban on “For Sale” signs); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976) (ban on prescription drug prices); Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 825 (1975) (ban on abortion advertising).  Although Linmark involved a prohibition against a particular means of advertising the sale of one’s home, we treated the restriction as if it were a complete ban because it did not leave open “satisfactory” alternative channels of communication.  431 U. S., at 92-94.  In other words, the regulation failed the fourth step in the four-part inquiry that the majority announced in its opinion.

 Indeed, the State’s own expert conceded that “plaintiffs’ expectation of realizing additional profits through price advertising has no necessary relationship to increased overall consumption.” 829 F. Supp., at 549 .  Moreover, we attach little significance to the fact that some studies suggest that people budget the amount of money that they will spend on alcohol.  39 F. 3d 5, 7 (CA1 1994).  These studies show only that, in a competitive market, people will tend to search for the cheapest product in order to meet their budgets.  The studies do not suggest that the amount of money budgeted for alcohol consumption will remain fixed in the face of a marketwide price increase.  Although the Court of Appeals concluded that the regulation directly advanced the State’s interest, it did not dispute the District Court’s conclusion that the evidence suggested that, at most, a price advertising ban would have a marginal impact on overall alcohol consumption.  Id., at 7-8 ; cf. Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Assn. v. Attorney General, <citedDecision>142 Mich. App., at 311</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>370 N. W. 2d, at 336</citedDecision> (explaining that “any additional impact on the level of consumption attributable to the absence of price advertisements would be negligible”).  Outside the First Amendment context, we have refused to uphold alcohol advertising bans premised on similarly speculative assertions about their impact on consumption.  See Capital Cities Cable, Inc. v. Crisp, 467 U. S., at 715-716 (holding ban pre-empted by Federal Communications Commission regulations); California Retail Liquor Dealers Assn. v. Midcal Aluminum, Inc., 445 U. S. 97 (1980) (holding ban violated the Sherman Act).  It would be anomalous if the First Amendment were more tolerant of speech bans than federal regulations and statutes.  “Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.” The International Thesaurus of Quotations 646 (compiled by R. Tripp 1970).  It is also no answer to say that it would be “strange” if the First Amendment tolerated a seemingly “greater” regulatory measure while forbidding a “lesser” one.  We recently held that although the government had the power to proscribe an entire category of speech, such as obscenity or so-called fighting words, it could not limit the scope of its ban to obscene or fighting words that expressed a point of view with which the government disagrees.
