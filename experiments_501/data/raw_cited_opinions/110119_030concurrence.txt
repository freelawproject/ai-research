<judges id="AbH">with whom Mr. Justice Stevens joins,</judges>
<p id="A7r">concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="b812-8">I concur in the Court’s judgment but cannot join its unnecessarily broad opinion, which seems to treat this case as if it involved the “automobile” exception to the warrant requirement. It is not such a case.</p>
<p id="b812-9">Because the police officers had probable cause to believe that respondent’s green suitcase contained marihuana before it was placed in the trunk of the taxicab, their duty to obtain a search warrant before opening it is clear under <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chadwick, </em>433 U. S. 1 (1977). The essence of our holding in <em>Chadwick </em>is that there is a legitimate expectation of privacy in the contents of a trunk or suitcase accompanying or being carried by a person; that expectation of privacy is not <page-number citation-index="1" label="767">*767</page-number>diminished simply because the owner’s arrest occurs in a public place. Whether arrested in a hotel lobby, an airport, a railroad terminal, or on a public street, as here, the owner has the right to expect that the contents of his luggage will not, without his consent, be exposed on demand of the police. If not carrying contraband, many persons arrested in such circumstances might choose to consent to a search of their luggage to obviate any delay in securing their release. But even if wholly innocent, some persons might well prefer not to have the contents of their luggage exposed in a public place. They may stand on their right to privacy and require a search warrant. The warrant requirement is not so onerous as to command suspension of Fourth Amendment guarantees once the receptacle involved is securely in the control of the police, as it was here after Sanders’ arrest.</p>
<p id="b813-4">The breadth of the Court’s opinion and its repeated references to the “automobile” from which respondent’s suitcase was seized at the time of his arrest, however, might lead the reader to believe — as the dissenters apparently do — that this case involves the “automobile” exception to the warrant requirement. See <em>ante, </em>at 762-765, and n. 14. It does not. Here, as in <em>Chadwick, </em>it was the <em>luggage </em>being transported by respondent at the time of the arrest, not the automobile in which it was being carried, that was the suspected locus of the contraband. The relationship between the automobile and the contraband was purely coincidental, as in <em>Chadwick. </em>The fact that the suitcase was resting in the trunk of the automobile at the time of respondent’s arrest does not turn this into an “automobile” exception case. The Court need say no more.</p>
<p id="b813-5">This case simply does not present the question of whether a warrant is required before opening luggage when the police have probable cause to believe contraband is located <em>somewhere </em>in the vehicle, but when they do <em>not </em>know whether, for example, it is inside a piece of luggage in the trunk, in the glove compartment, or concealed in some part of the car’s structure. <page-number citation-index="1" label="768">*768</page-number>I am not sure whether that would be a stronger or weaker case for requiring a warrant to search the suitcase when a warrantless search of the automobile is otherwise permissible. But it seems to me it would be better to await a case in which the question must be decided.</p>
<p id="b814-5">The dissent complains that the Court does not adopt a “clear” rule, presumably one capable of resolving future Fourth Amendment litigation. That is not cause for lament, however desirable it might be to fashion a universal prescription governing the myriad Fourth Amendment cases that might arise. We are construing the Constitution, not writing a statute or a manual for law enforcement officers. My disagreement with the Court’s opinion is very different from that of the dissenters. Our institutional practice, based on hard experience, generally has been to refrain from deciding questions not presented by the facts of a case; there are risks in formulating constitutional rules broader than required by the facts to which they are applied. See <em>Ashwander </em>v. <em>TVA, </em>297 U. S. 288, 346-348 (1936).</p>
