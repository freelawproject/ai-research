<p id="AWZ">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>
<p id="b621-7">I join the opinion of the Court except the discussion and holding with respect to body-cavity searches. In view of the serious intrusion on oneâ€™s privacy occasioned by such a search, I think at least some level of cause, such as a reasonable suspicion, should be required to justify the anal and genital searches described in this case. I therefore dissent on this issue.</p>
