 Accordingly he was enjoined on supplemental bill, inter alia, "from bringing any action or actions touching the title to or possession of the said premises .  .  ." Until dissolved, that injunction forbade proceedings in state and federal courts alike.  Although § 265 was not discussed, the case is cited as a convenient summary of the then law, and because it promptly became a precedent for enforcement of decrees even when the problem of § 265 was raised.  The authority of this case has not been doubted until now.  Prout v. Starr, <citedDecision>188 U.S. 537, 544</citedDecision> , forbade a state suit in violation of a federal court stipulation for a decree, treated the stipulation as a decree, and enjoined an action in personam in the state court for the collection of penalties under an unconstitutional statute.  The state action was in violation of the original federal decree.  This Court said: "The jurisdiction of the Circuit Court could not be *147 defeated or impaired by the institution, by one of the parties, of subsequent proceedings, whether civil or criminal, involving the same legal questions, in the state court." In 193 U.S. appeared the case of Julian v. Central Trust Company .  A railroad property in North Carolina had been sold under foreclosure proceedings in the federal circuit court. The decree was that the property be sold free of all claims of parties and the judicial sale was confirmed to the Southern Railway Company.  Some years later a cause of action arose which was prosecuted to judgment in a state court against the original mortgagor without notice to or claim against the purchaser, the Southern.  In the face of a threat to sell the property formerly conveyed by the federal decree, the circuit court enjoined the state proceedings.  This Court said, pp. 112, 114: "In such case we are of opinion that a supplemental bill may be filed in the original suit with a view to protecting the prior jurisdiction of the Federal court and to render effectual its decree.

 The case in our view may be properly cited as a relitigation decision.  It forcefully declares, albeit by alternative ruling, for the position here taken.  A federal court had enjoined a state tax on the ground of unconstitutionality.  The state was a party.  Years later the state brought an action in the state court for the tax which the decree prohibited.  An ancillary bill sought and obtained an injunction from the federal court. This Court said, p. 292, "Indeed, the proposition that the Eleventh Amendment, or section 720 of the Revised Statutes, control a court of the United States in administering relief, although the court was acting in a matter ancillary to a decree rendered in a cause over which it had jurisdiction, is not open for discussion.  Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U.S. 494 ; Prout v. Starr, <citedDecision>188 U.S. 537</citedDecision> ; Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U.S. 93, 112 ." It cannot fairly be said, we think, that this was not a holding that a federal court has the duty to protect its parties against relitigation.  This seems quite certain when we examine the cases cited which are discussed heretofore in this opinion.  The Terry case, cited under the Riverdale Mills case, supra, is a good illustration of the permeation of our law by the principle of protection of federal decrees by injunctions against prosecuting state suits which relitigate settled issues.  In Sharon v. Terry , a former decree had determined the fraudulent character of a marriage contract, and had enjoined all efforts to establish rights under any of its provisions.  Notwithstanding this decree, a party thereafter sought and obtained a judgment of the highest court of the state determining the marriage contract valid.  There was no plea of res judicata in the state proceedings.

 Nor need we consider common-law refinements in actions for ejectment, for the Court went explicitly on its duty to obey the Act of 1793.  [9] Root v. Woolworth, 150 U.S. 401 , is erroneously regarded as illustrating a "relitigation" exception to § 265.  The case holds merely that courts of equity have jurisdiction to "effectuate their own decrees by injunctions or writs of assistance in order to avoid the relitigation of questions once settled between the same parties." 150 U.S. at 411-12 .  The Court did not uphold a federal injunction against a state suit to relitigate a claim already settled by a previous federal decree  no such state suit had been brought.  Consequently, there was no occasion to consider the applicability of § 265.  The "first come, first served" rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr, <citedDecision>188 U.S. 537</citedDecision> , was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U.S. 226, 235 .  Cf. Haines v. Carpenter, 91 U.S. 254, 257 .  [10]  There is no warrant for the assumption that, in the proposals for the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress had before it the "relitigation" exception as settled doctrine, and that by § 265 gave it legislative confirmation.  The Report of the Special Joint Committee on Revision and Codification of the Laws of the United States annotated the Act of 1793 with citations to twenty-six decisions of this Court. Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 470.  Yet no reference was made to four of the five decisions of this Court prior to the Judicial Code which are supposed to justify the "relitigation" doctrine: Root v. Woolworth, 150 U.S. 401 ; Prout v. Starr, <citedDecision>188 U.S. 537</citedDecision> ; Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U.S. 188 ; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U.S. 273 .  (As we have already seen, "removal" cases like French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250 , and Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U.S. 494 , rest upon an entirely different footing.) None of the reports submitted to Congress contains any discussion of § 5 of the Act of 1793 and the decisions construing it.  See H. Rept. No. 818, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., referring to H. Doc. No. 783, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.; Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.; Final Report of the Commission to Revise and Codify the Laws of the United States (1906), pp. 29, 244.  Nor do the debates disclose any consideration of the question.  See 45 Cong. Rec., pts. III and IV, and 46 Cong. Rec., pts. I-V, passim.  [1]  R.S. § 905; 28 U.S.C. § 687 ; Hancock National Bank v.
