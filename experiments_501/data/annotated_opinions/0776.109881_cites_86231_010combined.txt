 "These three are: first, that as to fugitives from justice; [22] second, that as to fugitives from service, (or slaves;) [23] third, that declaring that the `citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.' [24] *672 "And, sir, every one of thesethe only provisions where it was deemed that legislation was required to enforce the constitutional provisionsthe only three where the rights or liabilities of persons in the States, as between these persons and the States, are directly provided for, Congress has by legislation affirmatively interfered to protect .  .  .  such persons." Globe App. 69-70.  Of legislation mentioned by Shellabarger, the closest analog of the Sherman amendment, ironically, was the statute implementing the fugitives from justice and fugitive slave provisions of Art. IVthe Act of Feb. 12, 1793, 1 Stat. 302the constitutionality of which had been sustained in 1842, in Prigg v. Pennsylvania, <citedDecision>16 Pet. 539</citedDecision> .  There, Mr. Justice Story, writing for the Court, held that Art. IV gave slaveowners a federal right to the unhindered possession of their slaves in whatever State such slaves might be found. <citedDecision>16 Pet., at 612</citedDecision> .  Because state process for recovering runaway slaves might be inadequate or even hostile to the rights of the slaveowner, the right intended to be conferred could be negated if left to state implementation.  <citedDecision>Id., at 614</citedDecision> .  Thus, since the Constitution guaranteed the right and this in turn required a remedy, Story held it to be a "natural inference" that Congress had the power itself to ensure an appropriate (in the Necessary and Proper Clause sense) remedy for the right.  <citedDecision>Id., at 615</citedDecision> .  Building on <citedDecision>Prigg</citedDecision> , Shellabarger argued that a remedy against municipalities and counties was an appropriateand hence constitutionalmethod for ensuring the protection which the Fourteenth Amendment made every citizen's federal right.  [25] This much was clear from the adoption of such statutes by the several States as devices for suppressing riot.  [26] Thus, said Shellabarger, the only serious question remaining *673 was "whether, since a county is an integer or part of a State, the United States can impose upon it, as such, any obligations to keep the peace in obedience to United States laws." [27] This he answered affirmatively, citing Board of Comm'rs v. Aspinwall, 24 How. 376 (1861), the first of many cases [28] upholding the power of federal courts to enforce the Contract Clause against municipalities.  [29] House opponents of the Sherman amendmentwhose views are particularly important since only the House voted down the amendmentdid not dispute Shellabarger's claim that the Fourteenth Amendment created a federal right to protection, see n. 21, supra, but they argued that the local units of government upon which the amendment fastened liability were not obligated to keep the peace at state law and further that the Federal Government could not constitutionally require local governments to create police forces, whether this requirement was levied directly, or indirectly by imposing damages for breach of the peace on municipalities.  The most complete statement of this position is that of Representative Blair: [30] "The proposition known as the Sherman amendment *674 .  .

 "Now, only the other day, the Supreme Court .  .  .  decided [in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871)] that there is no power in the Government of the United States, under its authority to tax, to tax the salary of a State officer.  Why?  Simply because the power to tax involves the power to destroy, and it was not the intent to give the Government of the United States power to destroy the government of the States in any respect.  It was held also in the case of Prigg vs. Pennsylvania [ <citedDecision>16 Pet. 539</citedDecision> (1842)] that it is not within the power of the Congress of the United States to lay duties upon a State officer; that we cannot command a State officer to do any duty whatever, as such; and I ask .  .  .  the difference between that and commanding a municipality, which is equally the creature of the State, to perform a duty." Globe 795.  Any attempt to impute a unitary constitutional theory to opponents of the Sherman amendment is, of course, fraught *676 with difficulties, not the least of which is that most Members of Congress did not speak to the issue of the constitutionality of the amendment.  Nonetheless, two considerations lead us to conclude that opponents of the Sherman amendment found it unconstitutional substantially because of the reasons stated by Representative Blair: First, Blair's analysis is precisely that of Poland, whose views were quoted as authoritative in Monroe , see supra, at 664, and that analysis was shared in large part by all House opponents who addressed the constitutionality of the Sherman amendment.  [31] Second, Blair's exegesis of the reigning constitutional theory of his day, as we shall explain, was clearly supported by precedentalbeit precedent that has not survived, see Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 347-348 (1880); Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 486 (1939)and no other constitutional formula was advanced by participants in the House debates.  Collector v. Day , cited by Blair, was the clearest and, at the time of the debates, the most recent pronouncement of a doctrine of coordinate sovereignty that, as Blair stated, placed limits on even the enumerated powers of the National Government in favor of protecting state prerogatives.  There, the Court held that the United States could not tax the income of Day, a Massachusetts state judge, because the independence of the States within their legitimate spheres would be imperiled if the instrumentalities through which States executed their powers were "subject to the control of another and distinct government." 11 Wall., at 127 .  Although the Court in Day apparently rested this holding in part on the proposition that the taxing "power acknowledges no limits but the will of the legislative body imposing the tax," id., at 125-126 ; cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 (1819), the Court had in other cases limited other national powers in order to avoid interference with the States.  [32] *677 In <citedDecision>Prigg</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Pennsylvania</citedDecision> , for example, Mr. Justice Story, in addition to confirming a broad national power to legislate under the Fugitive Slave Clause, see supra, at 672, held that Congress could not "insist that states .  .  .  provide means to carry into effect the duties of the national government." <citedDecision>16 Pet., at 615-616</citedDecision> .  [33] And Mr. Justice McLean agreed that, "[a]s a general principle," it was true "that Congress had no power to impose duties on state officers, as provided in the [Act of Feb. 12, 1793]." Nonetheless he wondered whether Congress might not impose "positive" duties on state officers where a clause of the Constitution, like the Fugitive Slave Clause, seemed to require affirmative government assistance, rather than restraint of government, to secure federal rights.  See <citedDecision>id., at 664-665</citedDecision> .  Had Mr. Justice McLean been correct in his suggestion that, where the Constitution envisioned affirmative government assistance, the States or their officers or instrumentalities could be required to provide it, there would have been little doubt that Congress could have insisted that municipalities afford by "positive" action the protection [34] owed individuals under § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment whether or not municipalities were obligated by state law to keep the peace.  However, any such argument, largely foreclosed by <citedDecision>Prigg</citedDecision> , was made *678 impossible by the Court's holding in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861).  There, the Court was asked to require Dennison, the Governor of Ohio, to hand over Lago, a fugitive from justice wanted in Kentucky, as required by § 1 of the Act of Feb. 12, 1793, [35] which implemented Art. IV, § 2, cl. 2, of the Constitution.  Mr. Chief Justice Taney, writing for a unanimous Court, refused to enforce that section of the Act: "[W]e think it clear, that the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it; for if it possessed this power, it might overload the officer with duties which would fill up all his time, and disable him from performing his obligations to the State, and might impose on him duties of a character incompatible with the rank and dignity to which he was elevated by the State." 24 How., at 107-108.  The rationale of Dennison that the Nation could not impose duties on state officers since that might impede States in their legitimate activitiesis obviously identical to that which animated the decision in Collector v. Day .  See supra, at 676.  And, as Blair indicated, municipalities as instrumentalities through which States executed their policies could be equally disabled from carrying out state policies if they were also obligated to carry out federally imposed duties.

 do not have any control of the police .  .  .  ." Id., at 795.  See also the views of Rep. Willard, discussed at n. 30, supra. Second, the doctrine of dual sovereignty apparently put no limit on the power of federal courts to enforce the Constitution against municipalities that violated it.  Under the theory of dual sovereignty set out in <citedDecision>Prigg</citedDecision> , this is quite understandable.  So long as federal courts were vindicating the Federal Constitution, they were providing the "positive" government action *681 required to protect federal constitutional rights and no question was raised of enlisting the States in "positive" action.  The limits of the principles announced in Dennison and Day are not so well defined in logic, but are clear as a matter of history.  It must be remembered that the same Court which rendered Day also vigorously enforced the Contract Clause against municipalitiesan enforcement effort which included various forms of "positive" relief, such as ordering that taxes be levied and collected to discharge federal-court judgments, once a constitutional infraction was found. [40] Thus, federal judicial enforcement of the Constitution's express limits on state power, since it was done so frequently, must, notwithstanding anything said in Dennison or Day , have been permissible, at least so long as the interpretation of the Constitution was left in the hands of the judiciary.  Since § 1 of the Civil Rights Act simply conferred jurisdiction on the federal courts to enforce § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendmenta situation precisely analogous to the grant of diversity jurisdiction under which the Contract Clause was enforced against municipalitiesthere *682 is no reason to suppose that opponents of the Sherman amendment would have found any constitutional barrier to § 1 suits against municipalities.  Finally, the very votes of those Members of Congress, who opposed the Sherman amendment but who had voted for § 1, confirm that the liability imposed by § 1 was something very different from that imposed by the amendment.  Section 1 without question could be used to obtain a damages judgment against state or municipal officials who violated federal constitutional rights while acting under color of law. [41] However, for Prigg-Dennison-Day purposes, as Blair and others recognized, [42] there was no distinction of constitutional magnitude between officers and agentsincluding corporate agentsof the State: Both were state instrumentalities and the State could be impeded no matter over which sort of instrumentality the Federal Government sought to assert its power.  Dennison and Day , after all, were not suits against municipalities but against officers, and Blair was quite conscious that he was extending these cases by applying them to municipal corporations.  [43] Nonetheless, Senator Thurman, who gave the most exhaustive critique of § 1 inter alia, complaining that it would be applied to state officers, see Globe App. 217and who opposed both § 1 and the Sherman amendment, the latter on <citedDecision>Prigg</citedDecision> grounds, agreed unequivocally that § 1 was constitutional.  [44] *683 Those who voted for § 1 must similarly have believed in its constitutionality despite Prigg, Dennison, and Day .  C. Debate on § 1 of the Civil Rights Bill From the foregoing discussion, it is readily apparent that nothing said in debate on the Sherman amendment would have prevented holding a municipality liable under § 1 of the Civil Rights Act for its own violations of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The question remains, however, whether the general language describing those to be liable under § 1"any person"covers more than natural persons.  An examination of the debate on § 1 and application of appropriate rules of construction show unequivocally that § 1 was intended to cover legal as well as natural persons.  Representative Shellabarger was the first to explain the function of § 1: "[Section 1] not only provides a civil remedy for persons whose former condition may have been that of slaves, but also to all people where, under color of State law, they or any of them may be deprived of rights to which they are entitled under the Constitution by reason and virtue of their national citizenship." Globe App. 68.

 See, e. g., ibid. See also Meriwether v. Garrett, 102 U. S. 472, 501, 513 (1880) (recognizing principle that public property of a municipality was not subject to execution); 2 J. Dillon, The Law of Municipal Corporations §§ 445-446 (1873 ed.) (same).  Although the arguments of the Senate opponents appear to be a correct analysis of then-controlling constitutional and common-law principles, their arguments are not relevant to an analysis of the constitutionality of § 1 of the Civil Rights Act since any judgment under that section, as in any civil suit in the federal courts in 1871, would have been enforced pursuant to state laws under the Process Acts of 1792 and 1828.  See Act of May 8, 1792, ch. 36, 1 Stat. 275 ; Act of May 19, 1828, 4 Stat. 278 .  [31]  See n. 30, supra. [32]  In addition to the cases discussed in the text, see Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 77, 81 (1869), in which the Court held that the federal Legal Tender Acts should not be construed to require the States to accept taxes tendered in United States notes since this might interfere with a legitimate state activity.  [33]  Mr. Chief Justice Taney agreed: "The state officers mentioned in the law [of 1793] are not bound to execute the duties imposed upon them by Congress, unless they choose to do so, or are required to do so by a law of the state; and the state legislature has the power, if it thinks proper, to prohibit them.  The act of 1793, therefore, must depend altogether for its execution upon the officers of the United States named in it." <citedDecision>16 Pet., at 630</citedDecision> (concurring in part).
