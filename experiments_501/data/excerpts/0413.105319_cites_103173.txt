 And see Baldwin Co. v. Maner, - Ark. -, 273 S. W. 2d 28 .  While Carroll was receiving weekly payments under the Missouri Act, he decided to sue Lanza for common-law damages in the Arkansas courts.  Lanza had the case removed to the Federal District Court where judgment was rendered for Carroll.  2 116 F. Supp. 491 .  The Court of Appeals, while agreeing with the District Court that the judgment was sustainable as a matter of -Arkansas law, reversed on the ground that the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution 3 (Art. IV, § 1) barred recovery.  216 F. 2d 808 .  The case is here by petition for certiorari which we granted ( 348 U. S. 870 ) because of doubts as to the correctness of the decision raised by Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission, <citedDecision>306 U. S. 493</citedDecision> .  The Court of Appeals thought Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Hunt, 320 U. S. 430 , to be controlling.  There the employee having received a final award for compensation *411 in the forum of the injury returned to his home State and sued to recover under its Compensation Act.  We held that the latter suit was precluded by the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  But here there was no final award under the Missouri Act.  Under that Act the statutory payments apparently start automatically on receipt of notice of the injury.  Mo. Rev. Stat., 1949, §§ 287.380, 287.400.

 Rather we have the naked question whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause makes Missouri’s statute a bar to Arkansas’ common-law remedy.  A statute is a “public act” within the meaning of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  See Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145 , 154-155, and cases cited; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Commission, 294 U. S. 532 .  It was indeed held in the Clapper case that a Vermont Compensation Act, which purported to give an exclusive remedy, barred a common-law action on the same claim in the New Hampshire courts by a Vermont employee against a Vermont employer, even though the injury occurred in New Hampshire.  The Clapper case allowed a State to fix one exclusive remedy for personal injuries involving its residents, and required the other States to refuse to enforce any inconsistent remedy.  Thus, as respects persons residing or businesses located in a State, a remedy was provided employees that was “both expeditious and independent of proof of fault,” and a liability was imposed on employers that was “limited and determinate.” 286 U. S., at 159.  *412 Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission, <citedDecision>306 U. S. 493</citedDecision> , departed, however, from the Clapper decision.  There a resident of Massachusetts regularly employed in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts corporation was injured while doing temporary duty in California.  The Massachusetts Compensation Act purported to give an exclusive remedy, even for injuries incurred beyond its borders.  But California also had a Compensation Act which undertook to fix liability on employers, irrespective of any contract, rule, or regulation, a provision which the California courts strictly enforced.  The Court, therefore, held that the exclusive nature of the Massachusetts Act was “obnoxious” to the policy of California.  The Court proceeded on the premise, repeated over and again in the cases, that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not require a State to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the statute of another State reflecting a conflicting and opposed policy.  Id., at 502.

 Bond v. Hume, 243 U. S. 15 ; Ohio v. Chattanooga Boiler & Tank Co., 289 U. S. 439 ; Industrial Commission v. McCartin, 330 U. S. 622 .  See also Bonaparte v. Tax Court, 104 U. S. 592 ; American Fire Insurance Co. v. King Lumber & Mfg. Co., 250 U. S. 2 .  These cases prove that, where the statute of either the forum or the outside State is not found to be exclusive regarding remedies or rights elsewhere, the statute need not be accorded exclusive effect.  Further, the Court has stated that, in the area of workmen’s compensation, “unmistakable language” is required before exclusiveness will be attributed.  See Industrial Commission v. McCartin, 330 U. S., at 628 .  *416 (3) Those in which the forum applied its own substantive law, statutory or judicial, when clearly in conflict with the out-of-state statute.

S. 469 ; Order of United Commercial Travelers v. Wolfe, 331 U. S. 586 .  These cases have arisen in three principal fields: (a) commercial law; (b) insurance; and (c) workmen's compensation.  As a statistical matter, in 21 cases of direct conflict the Court held for the forum 10 times and for the sister State 11 times.  (a) In commercial law a number of cases have involved statutory assessment against out-of-state shareholders under the laws of the State of incorporation of an insolvent corporation.  The Court’s consistent position has *417 been that the law of the incorporating State must be given effect by the forum.  E. g., Converse v. Hamilton, supra. That law is deemed to create a transitory cause of action based on the contractual relation between the corporation and the shareholder by which the shareholder is held to have consented to reasonable state regulation.  The Court has relied on the fact that in each case a judicial proceeding in the incorporating State had previously passed upon the necessity and amount of the assessment, and that, although shareholders in the forum were not parties to such a proceeding, their interest was adequately represented by other shareholders.

 3 To make the interest of Arkansas prevail over the interest of Missouri on the basis of the Full Faith and Credit Clause would require that Clapper be explicitly overruled and that, in the area of workmen’s compensation law, the place of injury be decisive.  And if Clapper is to be overruled, on which I and those who join me express no opinion, it should be done with reasons making manifest why Mr. Justice Brandéis’ long-matured, weighty opinion in that *422 case was ill-founded.  It should not be cast aside on the presupposition that full faith and credit need not be given to a sister-state workmen's compensation statute if the law of the forum happens to be more favorable to the claimant.  (3) Furthermore, the new provision of 28 U. S. C. § 1738 cannot be disregarded.  In 1948 Congress for the first time dealt with the full faith and credit effect to be given statutes.  4 The absence of such a provision was used by-Mr.  Justice Stone to buttress the Court’s opinions both in Alaska Packers, 294 U. S., at 547 , and Pacific Employers, <citedDecision>306 U. S., at 502</citedDecision> .  Hence, if § 1738 has any effect, it would seem to tend toward respecting Missouri’s legislation.  See Reese, Full Faith and Credit to Statutes: The Defense of Public Policy, 19 U. of Chi. L. Rev. 339, 343 et seq. There is, however, a readily available alternative short of overruling Clapper which dispenses with the difficulties inherent in applying the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  This alternative proceeds along the following lines: Missouri’s workmen’s compensation statute is in terms applicable and exclusive as to workmen injured outside the State under Missouri employment contracts.  5 Hogan *423 (the subcontractor here) was a Missouri employer and had a Missouri employment contract with Carroll (the injured workman).  Thus when Carroll sought workmen’s compensation in Arkansas (where he was hurt), Hogan and his insurer could have relied on the Missouri statute and the Clapper case as a defense.  They did not, presumably since Arkansas workmen’s compensation cost them no more than Missouri’s and they had an opportunity to recoup from the prime contractor as a third party under Arkansas law. 6 But Lanza (the prime contractor) was not a Missouri employer, nor does the record disclose that he had a Missouri employment contract either with Hogan or Carroll.
