 After the picketing had continued for approximately 30 minutes, the shopping center manager again informed the pickets that if they did not leave they would be arrested for trespassing.  The pickets departed.  The union subsequently filed with the Board an unfair labor practice charge against Hudgens, alleging interference.  with rights protected by § 7 of the Act, 29 *510 U. S. C. § 157 .  2 Relying on this Court’s decision in Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza, 391 U. S. 308 , the Board entered a cease-and-desist order against Hudgens, reasoning that because the warehouse employees enjoyed a First Amendment right to picket on the shopping center property, the owner’s threat of arrest violated § 8 (a)(1) of the Act, 29 U. S. C. § 158 (a)(1).  3 Hudgens filed a petition for review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  Soon thereafter this Court decided Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 551</citedDecision> , and Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB, 407 U. S. 539 , and the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Board for reconsideration in light of those two decisions.  The Board, in turn, remanded to an Administrative Law Judge, who made findings of fact, recommendations, and conclusions to the effect that Hudgens had committed an unfair labor practice by excluding the pickets.  *511 This result was ostensibly reached under the statutory criteria set forth in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105 , a case which held that union organizers who seek to solicit for union membership may intrude on an employer’s private property if no alternative means exist for communicating with the employees.  But the Administrative Law Judge’s opinion also relied on this Court’s constitutional decision in Logan Valley for a “realistic view of the facts.” The Board agreed with the findings and recommendations of the Administrative Law Judge, but departed somewhat from his reasoning.  It concluded that the pickets were within the scope of Hudgens’ invitation to members of the public to do business at the shopping center, and that it was, therefore, immaterial whether or not there existed an alternative means of communicating with the customers and employees of the Butler store.  4 Hudgens again petitioned for review in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and there the Board changed its tack and urged that the case was controlled not by Babcock & Wilcox, but by Republic Aviation Corp. v. NLRB, 324 U. S. 793 , a case which held that an employer commits an unfair labor practice if he enforces a no-solicitation rule against employees on his premises who are also union organizers, unless he can prove that the rule is necessitated by special circumstances.  The Court of Appeals enforced the Board’s cease-and-desist order but on the basis of yet another theory.  While acknowledging that the source of the pickets’ rights was § 7 of the Act, the Court of Appeals held that the competing constitutional and property .right considerations discussed in Lloyd Corp. v. <citedDecision>Tanner, supra,</citedDecision> “burde[n] the General Counsel with the duty to *512 prove that other locations less intrusive upon Hudgens’ property rights than picketing inside the mall were either unavailable or ineffective,” 501 F. 2d, at 169 , and that the Board’s General Counsel had met that burden in this case. In this Court the petitioner Hudgens continues to urge that Babcock & Wilcox Co. is the controlling precedent, and that under the criteria of that case the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.  The respondent union agrees that a statutory standard governs, but insists that, since the § 7 activity here was not organizational as in Babcock but picketing in support of a lawful economic strike, an appropriate accommodation of the competing interests must lead to an affirmance of the Court of Appeals’ judgment.  The respondent Board now contends that the conflict between employee picketing rights and employer property rights in a case like this must be measured in accord with the commands of the First Amendment, pursuant to the Board’s asserted understanding of Lloyd Corp. v. <citedDecision>Tanner, supra,</citedDecision> and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed on the basis of that standard.  II As the above recital discloses, the history of this litigation has been a history of shifting positions on the part of the litigants, the Board, and the Court of Appeals.  It has been a history, in short, of considerable confusion, engendered at least in part by decisions of this Court that intervened during the course of the litigation.  In the present posture of the case the most basic question is whether the respective rights and liabilities of the parties are to be decided under the criteria of the National Labor Relations Act alone, under a First Amendment standard, or under some combination of the two.  It is to that question, accordingly, that we now turn.  *513 It is, of course, a commonplace that the constitutional guarantee of free speech is a guarantee only against abridgment by government, federal or state.  See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Comm., 412 U. S. 94 .

 e., ‘residential buildings, streets, a system of sewers, a sewage disposal plant and a “business block” on which business places are situated.’ 326 U. S., at 502 .  I *517 can find nothing in Marsh which indicates that if one of these features is present, e. g., a business district, this is sufficient for the Court to confiscate a part of an owner’s private property and give its use to people who want to picket on it.” Id., at 332.  “To hold that store owners are compelled by law to supply picketing areas for pickets to drive store customers away is to create a court-made law wholly disregarding the constitutional basis on which private ownership of property rests in this country.  .  .  .” Id., at 332-333.  Four years later the Court had occasion to reconsider the Logan Valley doctrine in Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner, <citedDecision>407 U. S. 551</citedDecision> .  That case involved a shopping center covering some 50 acres in downtown Portland, Ore. On a November day in 1968 five young people entered the mall of the shopping center and distributed handbills protesting the then ongoing American military operations in Vietnam.  Security guards told them to leave, and they did so, “to avoid arrest.” <citedDecision>Id., at 556</citedDecision> .  They subsequently brought suit in a Federal District Court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.  The trial court ruled’ in their favor, holding that the distribution of handbills on the shopping center’s property was protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment, 446 F. 2d 545 , expressly relying on this Court’s Marsh and Logan Valley decisions.  This Court reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The Court in its Lloyd opinion did not say that it was overruling the Logan Valley decision.  Indeed, a substantial portion of the Court’s opinion in Lloyd was devoted to pointing out the differences between the two cases, noting particularly that, in contrast to the hand-billing in Lloyd, the picketing in Logan Valley had been *518 specifically directed to a store in the shopping center and the pickets had had no other reasonable opportunity to reach their intended audience.
