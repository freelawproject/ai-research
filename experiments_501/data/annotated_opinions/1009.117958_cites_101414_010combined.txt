**Combined Opinion**
2 J. Bishop, Commentaries on Law of Criminal Procedure § 935, p. 508 (2d ed.).  May's 1881 treatise reported that "[w]hether materiality is a question of law for the court or of fact for a jury, is a point upon which the authorities are about equally divided." J. May, Law of Crimes § 188, p. 205.  Greenleaf, writing in 1883, sided with Bishop ("It seems that the materiality of the matter assigned is a question for the jury"), 3 S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence § 195, p. 189, n. (b) (14th ed.)but two editions later, in 1899, said that the question was one for the judge, 3 S. Greenleaf, Law of Evidence § 195, p. 196, n. 2 (16th ed.).  In sum, we find nothing like a consistent historical tradition supporting the proposition that the element of materiality in perjury prosecutions is to be decided by the judge. Since that proposition is contrary to the uniform general understanding *519 (and we think the only understanding consistent with principle) that the Fifth and Sixth Amendments require conviction by a jury of all elements of the crime, we must reject those cases that have embraced it.  Though uniform postratification practice can shed light upon the meaning of an ambiguous constitutional provision, the practice here is not uniform, and the core meaning of the constitutional guarantees is unambiguous.  C The Government's final argument is that the principle of stare decisis requires that we deny respondent's constitutional claim, citing our decision in Sinclair v. United States, <citedDecision>279 U. S. 263</citedDecision> (1929).  That case is not controlling in the strictest sense, since it involved the assertion of a Sixth Amendment right to have the jury determine, not "materiality" under § 1001, but rather "pertinency" under that provision of Title 2 making it criminal contempt of Congress to refuse to answer a "question pertinent to [a] question under [congressional] inquiry," Rev. Stat. § 102, 2 U. S. C. § 192 .  The two questions are similar, however, and the essential argument made by respondent here was made by appellant in that case, who sought reversal of his conviction because of the trial court's failure to submit the question of pertinency to the jury: "[I]t has been said over and over again, that every essential ingredient of the crime must be proven to the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt." Brief for Appellant in <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> v. United States , O. T. 1928, No. 555, p. 109; <citedDecision>279 U. S., at 277</citedDecision> (argument for appellant).  Though we did not address the constitutional argument explicitly, we held that the question of pertinency was "rightly decided by the court as one of law." <citedDecision>Id., at 298</citedDecision> .  And tying the case even closer to the present one was our dictum that pertinency "is not essentially different from .  .  .  materiality of false testimony," which "when an element in the crime of perjury, is one for the court." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Thus, while <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> is not strictly controlling, it is fair to say that we cannot hold *520 for respondent today while still adhering to the reasoning and the holding of that case. But the reasoning of <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> has already been repudiated in a number of respects.  The opinion rested upon the assumption that "pertinency" is a pure question of lawthat is, it does "not depend upon the probative value of evidence." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> We contradicted that assumption in Deutch v. United States, 367 U. S. 456 (1961), reversing a conviction under § 192 because "the Government at the trial failed to carry its burden of proving the pertinence of the questions." Id., at 469.  Though it had introduced documentary and testimonial evidence "to show the subject of the subcommittee's inquiry," it had failed to provide evidence to support the conclusion that the petitioner's false statement was pertinent to that subject.  Our holding in <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> rested also upon the assertion that "[i]t would be incongruous and contrary to well-established principles to leave the determination of [the] matter [of pertinency] to a jury," <citedDecision>279 U. S., at 299</citedDecision> , citing ICC v. Brimson, 154 U. S. 447, 489 (1894), and Horning v. District of Columbia, 254 U. S. 135 (1920).  Both the cases cited to support that assertion have since been repudiated.  Brimson `s holding that no right to jury trial attaches to criminal contempt proceedings was overruled in Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194, 198-200 (1968).  Horning `s holding that it was harmless error, if error at all, for a trial judge effectively to order the jury to convict, see 254 U. S., at 138 , has been proved an unfortunate anomaly in light of subsequent cases. See Quercia v. United States, 289 U. S. 466, 468, 472 (1933); Bihn v. United States, 328 U. S. 633, 637-639 (1946).  Other reasoning in <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> , not yet repudiated, we repudiate now.  It said that the question of pertinency "may be likened to those concerning relevancy at the trial of issues in court," which "is uniformly held [to be] a question of law" for the court. <citedDecision>279 U. S., at 298</citedDecision> .  But how relevancy is treated for purposes of determining the admissibility of evidence *521 says nothing about how relevancy should be treated when (like "pertinence" or "materiality") it is made an element of a criminal offense.  It is commonplace for the same mixed question of law and fact to be assigned to the court for one purpose, and to the jury for another.  The question of probable cause to conduct a search, for example, is resolved by the judge when it arises in the context of a motion to suppress evidence obtained in the search; but by the jury when it is one of the elements of the crime of depriving a person of constitutional rights under color of law, see 18 U. S. C. §§ 241-242 .  Cf. United States v. McQueeney, 674 F. 2d 109, 114 (CA1 1982); United States v. Barker, 546 F. 2d 940, 947 (CADC 1976).  That leaves as the sole prop for <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> its reliance upon the unexamined proposition, never before endorsed by this Court, that materiality in perjury cases (which is analogous to pertinence in contempt cases) is a question of law for the judge. But just as there is nothing to support <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> except that proposition, there is,as we have seen, nothing to support that proposition except <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> .  While this perfect circularity has a certain esthetic appeal, it has no logic.  We do not minimize the role that stare decisis plays in our jurisprudence.  See Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989).  That role is somewhat reduced, however, in the case of a procedural rule such as this, which does not serve as a guide to lawful behavior.  See Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991).  It is reduced all the more when the rule is not only procedural but rests upon an interpretation of the Constitution.  See ibid. And we think stare decisis cannot possibly be controlling when, in addition to those factors, the decision in question has been proved manifestly erroneous, and its underpinnings eroded, by subsequent decisions of this Court. Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 480-481 (1989); Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320 (1972).  *522 The Government also claims stare decisis benefit from our decision in Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S. 759 (1988), which held that, in appellate review of a District Court (nonjury) denaturalization proceeding, the appellate court's newly asserted standard of materiality could be applied to the facts by the appellate court itself, rather than requiring remand to the District Court for that application.  Id., at 772 .  But as we have observed, the characterization of a mixed question of law and fact for one purpose does not govern its characterization for all purposes.  It is hard to imagine questions more diverse than, on the one hand, whether an appellate court must remand to a district court for a determination of materiality in a denaturalization proceeding (Kungys) and, on the other hand, whether the Constitution requires the finding of the element of materiality in a criminal prosecution to be made by the jury (the present case).  It can be argued that Kungys itself did not heed this advice, since it relied upon both our prior decision in <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> , see 485 U. S., at 772 , and a decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that materiality in a § 1001 prosecution is a question of "`law' " for the court, ibid. (quoting United States v. Abadi, 706 F. 2d 178, 180 , cert. denied, 464 U. S. 821 (1983)).  But the result in Kungys could be thought to follow a fortiori from the quite different cases of <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> and Abadi , whereas nonentitlement under the Sixth Amendment to a jury determination cannot possibly be thought to follow a fortiori from Kungys .  In any event, Kungys assuredly did not involve an adjudication to which the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial attaches, see Luria v. United States, 231 U. S. 9 (1913), and hence had no reason to explore the constitutional ramifications of <citedDecision>Sinclair</citedDecision> and Abadi , as we do today.  Whatever support it gave to the validity of those decisions was obiter dicta, and may properly be disregarded.  * * * The Constitution gives a criminal defendant the right to have a jury determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, his guilt *523 of every element of the crime with which he is charged.  The trial judge's refusal to allow the jury to pass on the "materiality" of Gaudin's false statements infringed that right.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.  It is so ordered.  Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O'Connor and Justice Breyer join, concurring.

" Ibid. Second, "the error [must] be `plain.' " Id., at 734 .  Thus, "[a]t a minimum, a *527 court of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule 52(b) unless the error is clear under current law." Ibid. Third, the plain error must "`affec[t] substantial rights,' " ibid., i.  e., "in most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial," ibid. Finally, if these three prerequisites are met, the decision to correct forfeited error remains within the sound discretion of the court of appeals.  A court of appeals, however, should not exercise that discretion unless the error "` "seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings. "` " Id., at 732 .  In affirming the Court of Appeals, the Court concludes that "it is fair to say that we cannot hold for respondent today while still adhering to the reasoning and the holding of [ Sinclair v. United States, <citedDecision>279 U. S. 263</citedDecision> (1929)]." Ante, at 519-520.  Before today, every Court of Appeals that has considered the issue, except for the Ninth Circuit, has held that the question of materiality is one of law. See 28 F. 3d, at 955 (Kozinski, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  Thus, it is certainly subject to dispute whether the error in this case was "clear under current law." Olano, supra, at 734 .  The Court, however, does not review the Court of Appeals' determination that the failure to submit the issue of materiality to the jury constituted "plain error." 28 F. 3d, at 952 .
