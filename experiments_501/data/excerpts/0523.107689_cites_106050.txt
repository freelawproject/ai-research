 But first we must consider the State’s contention that this case is now moot because petitioner has been unconditionally released from custody.  Petitioner applied to the United States District Court for a writ of habeas corpus in June 1963.  He was in custody at that time.  On March 6, 1967, petitioner’s sentence expired, 2 and he was discharged from the parole status in which he had been since October 4, 1964.  We issued our writ of certiorari on October 16, 1967 ( 389 U. S. 896 ).  *237 The issue presented, then, is whether the expiration of petitioner’s sentence, before his application was finally adjudicated and while it was awaiting appellate review, terminates federal jurisdiction with respect to the application.  Respondent relies upon Parker v. Ellis, <citedDecision>362 U. S. 574</citedDecision> (1960), and unless this case is overruled, it stands as an insuperable barrier to our further consideration of petitioner’s cause or to the grant of relief upon his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  <citedDecision>Parker</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Ellis</citedDecision> held that when a prisoner was released from state prison after having served his full sentence, this Court could not proceed to adjudicate the merits of the claim for relief on his petition for habeas corpus which he had filed with the Federal District Court. This Court held that upon petitioner’s unconditional release the case became "moot.” <citedDecision>Parker</citedDecision> was announced in a per curiam decision.  3 It is clear that petitioner’s cause is not moot. In consequence of his conviction, he cannot engage in certain businesses; 4 he cannot serve as an official of a labor union for a specified period of time; 5 he cannot vote in any election held in New York State; 6 he cannot serve as a juror.  7 Because of these “disabilities or burdens [which] may flow from” petitioner’s conviction, he has “a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on him.” Fiswick v. United States, 329 U. S. 211, 222 (1946).  On account of these “collateral consequences,” 8 the case is *238 not moot. Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629, 633-634, n. 2 (1968); Fiswick v. United States, supra, at 222, n. 10; United States v. Morgan, 346 U. S. 502, 512-513 (1954).  The substantial issue, however, which is posed by <citedDecision>Parker</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Ellis</citedDecision> , is not mootness in the technical or constitutional sense, but whether the statute defining the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the federal judiciary in respect of persons in state custody is available here.  In <citedDecision>Parker</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Ellis</citedDecision> , as in the present case, petitioner’s application was filed in the Federal District Court when he was in state custody, and in both the petitioner was unconditionally released from state custody before his case could be heard in this Court. For the reasons which we here summarize and which are stated at length in the dissenting opinions in <citedDecision>Parker</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Ellis</citedDecision> , we conclude that under the statutory scheme, once the federal jurisdiction has attached in the District Court, it is not defeated by the release of the petitioner prior to completion of proceedings on such application.  The federal habeas corpus statute requires that the applicant must be “in custody” when the application for habeas corpus is filed.  This is required not only by the repeated references in the statute, 9 but also by the history of the great writ.  10 Its province, shaped to guarantee the most fundamental of all rights, 11 is to provide an effective and speedy instrument by which judicial inquiry may be had into the legality of the detention of a person.  See Peyton v. Rowe, ante, p. 54.  12 *239 But the statute does not limit the relief that may be granted to discharge of the applicant from physical custody.  Its mandate is broad with respect to the relief that may be granted.

 Cf. Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S. 546 (1941).  In the present case, petitioner filed his application shortly after June 20, 1963, while he was in custody.  He was not released from custody until March 6, 1967, two weeks before he filed his petition for certiorari here.  During the intervening period his application was under consideration in various courts.  Petitioner is entitled to consideration of his application for relief on its merits.  He is suffering, and will continue to suffer, serious disabilities because of the law’s complexities and not because of his fault, if his claim that he has been illegally convicted is meritorious.  There is no need in the statute, the Constitution, or sound jurisprudence for denying to petitioner his ultimate day in court. This case illustrates the validity of The Chief Justice’s criticism that the doctrine of <citedDecision>Parker</citedDecision> simply aggravates the hardships that may result from the “intolerable delay[s] in affording justice.” <citedDecision>Parker</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Ellis, supra, at 585</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  The petitioner in this case was sentenced in 1960.  He has been attempting to liti *240 gate his constitutional claim ever since.  His path has been long — partly because of the inevitable delays in our court processes and partly because of the requirement that he exhaust state remedies.  13 He should not be thwarted now and required to bear the consequences of assertedly unlawful conviction simply because the path has been so long that he has served his sentence.  14 The federal habeas corpus statute does not require this result, and <citedDecision>Parker</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Ellis</citedDecision> must be overruled.  We turn now to the substance of the question as to which we granted certiorari.  Petitioner’s first hearing on the merits in the Federal District Court was held on November 5, 1965.  15 The District Court dismissed the petition for habeas corpus, denying petitioner’s claim that evidence used against him had been obtained by an illegal search and seizure.  The District Court issued a *241 certificate of probable cause pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 2253 and ordered that the notice of appeal be filed without prepayment of the prescribed fee.  A notice of appeal was filed, and the petitioner applied in the Court of Appeals for an order allowing him to appeal in forma pauperis.  28 U. S. C. § 1915 .

 See generally Note, Civil Disabilities of Felons, 53 Va. L. Rev. 403 (1967).  See 28 U. S. C. §§ 2241 , 2242, 2243, 2244, 2245, 2249, 2252, 2254.  See 9 W. Holdsworth, History of English Law 108-125 (1926).  E. g., Article 39 of the Magna Carta (see 9 W. Holdsworth, at 112-125).  The federal habeas corpus statute grants jurisdiction to inquire into violations of the United States Constitution.  If there has been, or will be, an unconditional release from custody before inquiry can be made into the legality of detention, it has been held that there is no habeas corpus jurisdiction.  See *239 <citedDecision>Parker</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Ellis, supra, at 582, n. 8</citedDecision> (WARREN, C. J., dissenting); Ex parte Baez, 177 U. S. 378 (1900); United States ex rel. Rivera v. Reeves, 246 F. Supp. 599 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1965); Burnett v. Gladden, 228 F. Supp. 527 (D. C. D. Ore. 1964).  Petitioner was convicted in 1960.  He took his case through the state appellate process, and this Court denied a writ of certiorari in March 1963.  372 U. S. 948 .  In June 1963 petitioner began his quest for a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts.  The District Court denied the petition without prejudice, suggesting, in view of what the judge thought was the unsettled state of New York law, that petitioner reapply to the state courts.  See 28 U. S. C. § 2254 .
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring.  Although we joined the per curiam decision in Parker v. Ellis, <citedDecision>362 U. S. 574</citedDecision> , we are now persuaded that what the Court there decided was wrong insofar as it held that even though a man be in custody when he initiates *243 a habeas corpus proceeding, the statutory power of the federal courts to proceed to a final adjudication of his claims depends upon his remaining in custody.  Consequently we concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court. Mr. Justice Harlan also notes that his views upon the issue discussed in his separate concurring opinion in <citedDecision>Parker, id., at 576</citedDecision> , have not changed.
