 332 U. S. 789 .  Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 , invalidating a New Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community, or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, “except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected.” See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 12 .  Two of this Court’s early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action.  Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 ; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17.  But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra, actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322 .  See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 797-804 .  And of course the Civil Rights Cases, supra, which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 335 , did not'involve the present statute at all. It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31 , characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, <citedDecision>271 U. S. 323</citedDecision> , as having “held” that “[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute .  .  .  [are] directed is governmental action.” 334 U. S., at 31.  But no such statement appears in the <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> opinion, and a careful examination of <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> reveals that it cannot be read as authority for the proposition attributed to it in Hurd .  In <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> , suits had been brought to enjoin a threatened violation of certain restrictive covenants in the District of Columbia.  The courts of the District had granted relief, see 55 App. D. C. 30, 299 F. 899 , and the case reached this Court on appeal.  As the opinion in <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> specifically recognized, no claim that the covenants could not validly be enforced against the appellants had been raised in the lower courts, and no such claim was properly before this Court. <citedDecision>271 U. S., at 330-331</citedDecision> .  The only question presented for decision was whether the restrictive covenants themselves violated the Fifth, Thirteenth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and §§ 1977, 1978, and 1979 of the Revised Statutes *421 (now 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981 , 1982, and 1983).  Ibid. Addressing itself to that narrow question, the Court said that none of the provisions relied upon by the appellants prohibited private individuals from “enter[ing] into .  .  .  [contracts] in respect to the control and disposition of their own property.” Id., at 331 .  Nor, added the Court, had the appellants even claimed that the provisions in question “had, in and of themselves, .  .  .  [the] effect” of prohibiting such contracts.  Ibid. Even if <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> should be regarded as an adjudication that 42 U. S. C. § 1982 (then § 1978 of the Revised Statutes) does not prohibit private individuals from agreeing not to sell their property to Negroes, <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> would not settle the question whether § 1982 prohibits an actual refusal to sell to a Negro.  Moreover, since the appellants in <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> had not even argued in this Court that the statute prohibited private agreements of the sort there involved, it would be a mistake to treat the <citedDecision>Corrigan</citedDecision> decision as a considered judgment even on that narrow issue.  379 F. 2d 33 , 43.  Ibid. Act of April 9, 1866, c. 31, § 1, 14 Stat. 27 , re-enacted by § 18 of the Enforcement Act of 1870, Act of May 31, 1870, c. 114, § 18, 16 Stat. 140 , 144, and codified in §§ 1977 and 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, now 42 U. S. C. §§ 1981 and 1982.  For the text of § 1981, see n. 78, infra.  It is, of course, immaterial that § 1 ended with the words “any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, to the contrary not *423 withstanding.” The phrase was obviously inserted to qualify the reference to “like punishment, pains, and penalties, and to none other,” thus emphasizing the supremacy of the 1866 statute over inconsistent state or local laws, if any.  It was deleted, presumably as surplusage, in § 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874.  " Several weeks before the House began its debate on the Civil Rights Act of 1866, Congress had passed a bill (S. 60) to enlarge the powers of the Freedmen’s Bureau (created by Act of March 3, 1865, c. 90, 13 Stat. 507 ) by extending military jurisdiction over certain areas in the South where, “in consequence of any State or local law, .
