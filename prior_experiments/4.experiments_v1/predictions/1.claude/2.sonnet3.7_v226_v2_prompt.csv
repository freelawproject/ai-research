Boren cites Frontiero multiple times as precedent to support its reasoning. The passages show that Craig relies on Frontiero as an underpinning for decisions that invalidated statutes employing gender as an inaccurate proxy.

Rather, it represents a refinement of the standard of review for gender-based classifications.""
