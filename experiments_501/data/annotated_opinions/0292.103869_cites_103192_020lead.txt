 The principal clause of the bill dealing with taxation is that which continues a limited land tax-exemption for twenty-five years.  On two separate occasions, in two Congresses, the bill’s sponsor assured the House of Representatives: “This [bill] only applies to restricted and tax-exempt land.  This does not increase tax-exempt land at all.” 9 Such a bill, carefully drawn so as not to widen tax exemptions for land, and without a word of such intent in its legislative history, cannot be supposed by implication to have prohibited estate taxes.  If there could be any doubt of this proposition it is surely removed by a later clause of the 1933 statute which provides that all minerals extracted from the land should be subject to state taxation.  10 Congress could not have intended that the minerals themselves should be subject to taxation, but that the proceeds of their sale, even further removed from the land itself, should be immune.  This Court has repeatedly said that tax exemptions are not granted by implication.  United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, <citedDecision>307 U. S. 57, 60</citedDecision> .  It has applied that rule to taxing acts affecting Indians as to all others.  As was said of an excise tax on tobacco produced by the Cherokee Indians in 1870, “If the exemption had been intended, it would doubtless have been expressed.” Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616, 620 .  In holding the income tax applicable to Indians, the Court said, “The terms of the 1928 Revenue Act are very broad, and nothing there *607 indicates that Indians are to be excepted.  ... If exemption exists it must derive plainly from agreements with the Creeks or some Act of Congress dealing with their affairs.” Superintendent v. Commissioner, supra, 420.  If Congress intends to prevent the State of Oklahoma from levying a general non-discriminatory estate tax applying alike to all its citizens, it should say so in plain words.  Such a conclusion cannot rest on dubious inferences.

 75 Cong. Rec. 8163.  74 Cong. Rec. 7222 and, similarly, 75 Cong. Rec. 8170.  See the last clause of the statute as set forth in Note 6, supra. See, for examples, Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567 , tract made “inalienable and nontaxable”; Act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861 , tract made “nontaxable and inalienable”; Act of June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 500 , tract to remain “nontaxable, inalienable, and free from any incumbrance”; Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137 , “all lands upon which restrictions are removed shall be subject to taxation, and the other lands shall be exempt from taxation.” Cf. for special treatment of the Quapaw Indians the Act of April 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 68 .  Cert. den., 315 U. S. 810 .  The Department of the Interior in the Landman ease made substantially the same argument it makes here against taxation of Indians’ estates.  It emphasizes that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals would lead to similar taxation by states.  The Solicitor General, opposing the Department of Interior in the Landman case, insisted that under Superintendent v. Commissioner, 295 U. S. 418 , and Chotean v. Burnet, 283 U. S. 691 , the Indians’ estates should be subjected to taxation; and that even if the Indians’ lands were exempt from direct taxation, the estate tax should be upheld as an excise tax, indirect in its nature, citing United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, <citedDecision>307 U. S. 57</citedDecision> ; Plummer v. Coler, 178 U. S. 115 ; Greiner v. Lewellyn, 258 U. S. 384 .  In other words, the Solicitor General in seeking to uphold the validity of a federal estate tax as applied to Indian estates opposed the argument which the Department of the Interior made then and which it makes now, the only difference being that in the instant case the Department of the Interior is seeking to invalidate a state instead of a federal tax. It must not be assumed that the Oklahoma Indians are all unable to pay estate taxes.  The estates of the three Indians here involved, as has been noted, total well over $1,200,000.  Oil and gas receipts of the Five Civilized Tribes from 1904 to 1937 were in excess of one hundred million dollars.  Hearing on S. Res. 168, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, 75th Cong., 3d Sess., p. 36.  The Osages in the same period received $261,000,000.  p. 34.
