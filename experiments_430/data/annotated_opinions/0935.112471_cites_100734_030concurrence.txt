**Concurrence Opinion**
 “We are of opinion that the State did not acquire upon its admission into the Union the power to provide, in respect of felonies committed within its limits while it was a Territory, that they should be tried otherwise than by a jury such as is provided by the Constitution of the United States.  When Thompson’s crime was committed, it was his constitutional right to demand that his liberty should not be taken from him except by the joint action of the court and the unanimous verdict of a jury of twelve persons.  To hold that a State could deprive him of his liberty by the concurrent action of a court and eight jurors, would recognize the power of the State not only to do what the United States in respect of Thompson’s crime could not, at any time, have done by legislation, but to take from the accused a substantial right belonging to him when the offence was committed.  “It is not necessary to review the numerous cases in which the courts have determined whether particular statutes come within the constitutional prohibition of ex post facto laws.  It is sufficient now to say that a statute belongs to that class which by its necessary operation and ‘in its relation to the offence, or its consequences, alters the situation of the accused to his disadvantage.’ United States v. Hall, 2 Wash. C. C. 366 ; Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221, 228 ; Medley, Petitioner, 134 U. S. *57 160, 171 .  Of course, a statute is not of that class unless it materially impairs the right of the accused to have the question of his guilt determined according to the law as it was when the offence was committed.” Id., at 350-351.  In Beazell v. Ohio, <citedDecision>269 U. S. 167</citedDecision> (1925), we made it clear that the question whether a particular procedural change has a sufficiently drastic impact on a defendant to be characterized as “substantial” is a matter of degree.  In that case we held that the rule applied in Kring and Thompson did not preclude the retrospective application of a rule allowing two codefendants to be tried jointly for a noncapital offense.  We summarized our earlier cases construing the Ex Post Facto Clause and explained: “The constitutional prohibition and the judicial interpretation of it rest upon the notion that laws, whatever their form, which purport to make innocent acts criminal after the event, or to aggravate an offense, are harsh and oppressive, and that the criminal quality attributable to an act, either by the legal definition of the offense or by the nature or amount of the punishment imposed for its commission, should not be altered by legislative enactment, after the fact, to the disadvantage of the accused.” <citedDecision>269 U. S., at 170</citedDecision> .  “And there may be procedural changes which operate to deny to the accused a defense available under the laws in force at the time of the commission of his offense, or which otherwise affect him in such a harsh and arbitrary manner as to fall within the constitutional prohibition.  Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221 ; Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 .  But it is now well settled that statutory changes in the mode of trial or the rules of evidence, which do not deprive the accused of a defense and which operate only in a limited and unsubstantial manner to his disadvantage, are not prohibited.” Ibid. *58 “Just what alterations of procedure will be held to be of sufficient moment to transgress the constitutional prohibition cannot be embraced within a formula or stated in a general proposition.  The distinction is one of degree.  But the constitutional provision was intended to secure substantial personal rights against arbitrary and oppressive legislation, see Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 183 , and not to limit the legislative control of remedies and modes of procedure which do not affect matters of substance.” Id., at 171.  h — I » — I The foregoing cases make it clear that the mere fact that this case involves a procedural change in Texas law is not sufficient to exclude it from the coverage of the Ex Post Facto Clause.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 Respondent does not claim that he was denied any procedural protections relevant to the determination of his guilt or innocence.  Nor does he claim that his life sentence was unauthorized by law or that it was the consequence of improper procedures.  Finally, he does not argue that he has been deprived of any avenue of review for correcting errors that may have vitiated the validity of his conviction or sentence.  For example, respondent does not contend — and we do not see how he could plausibly contend — that the State has deprived him of any opportunity to challenge his conviction on the ground that the improper *60 sentencing instruction somehow infected the jury’s deliberations about his guilt or about the propriety of life imprisonment.  Respondent instead claims, as did the defendant in Mallett , that an unrelated error must bar the State from relying upon his concededly valid conviction, and predicates this claim solely on a restriction upon the State’s access to appellate — or, more precisely in this case, postconviction— remedies.  4 Unlike the defendants in Thompson and Kring, Youngblood wishes to have a new trial according to the same procedures, regulated by the same laws, open to the same evidence, and capped by the same sentencing limitations that resulted in his conviction and his life sentence.  5 Obviously, as our decision in <citedDecision>Beazell</citedDecision> itself makes clear, a procedural protection does not become substantial merely because it meets the low threshold that I have discussed.  It does, however, become insubstantial by failing to do so. Whatever else may be said of the factors that determine whether a procedural protection affects substantial rights, it is difficult to imagine how a retroactive law could, when viewed from the standpoint of the date the offense was committed, implicate substantial rights of any defendant if the law does no more than expand the flexibility of postconviction processes available to the State with respect to a defendant *61 who is subject to a valid conviction and sentence.  Indeed, respondent has barely even attempted to articulate any justification for the Texas procedure that the legislature abolished.  The mere possibility of a capricious and unlikely windfall is not the sort of procedural protection that could reasonably be judged substantial from the perspective of the defendant at the time the offense was committed.  Accordingly, I concur in the Court’s judgment, but not in its opinion.  Art. I, § 10, of the Constitution provides in part: “No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.” At the time of respondent’s offense, it apparently was well established under Texas law that, as a general proposition, when a criminal jury rendered a verdict not authorized by law the verdict was void at its inception.  See, e. g., Ex parte McIver, 586 S. W. 2d 851, 854 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979); Ocker v. State, 477 S. W. 2d 288, 290 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972).
