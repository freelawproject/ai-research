**Combined Opinion**
The decision of the Court of Appeals is Reversed. JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE POWELL joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join Parts I, II-A, II-C, and III of the Court's opinion. Because the Court ultimately resolves this case under the *231 Extradition Act, 18 U.S. C . ยง 3182, I do not find Part II-B, and its statements concerning the Extradition Clause of the Constitution, necessary to the decision of this case. Accordingly, I do not subscribe to that part of the Court's opinion. See, e. g., Jean v. Nelson, 472 U.S. 846 , 854 (1985); Kolender v. Lawson, <targetCase>461 U.S. 352</targetCase> , 361, n. 10 (1983); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288 , 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I concur in the result, and in the portions of the Court's opinion applying 18 U.S. C . ยง 3182 and overruling Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861), insofar as it interpreted the predecessor of that statute. I note that no party before us has asserted the lack of power of Congress to require extradition from a State to a Territory.
