 If we assume that the reduction in company revenues is warranted we then come to the question of translating the allowed return into rates for consumers or classes of consumers.  Here the Commission fixed a single rate for all gas delivered irrespective of its use despite the fact that Hope has established what amounts to two rates — a high one for domestic use and a lower one for industrial contracts.  46 The Commission can fix two prices for interstate gas as readily as one — a price for resale to domestic users and another for resale to industrial users.  This is the pattern Hope itself has established in the very contracts over which the Commission is expressly given jurisdiction.  Certainly the Act is broad enough to permit two prices to be fixed instead of one, if the concept of the “public interest” is not unduly narrowed.  The Commission’s concept of the public interest in natural gas cases which is carried today into the Court’s opinion was first announced in the opinion of the minority in the Pipeline case. It enumerated only two “phases of the public interest: (1) the investor interest; (2) the consumer interest,” which it emphasized to the exclusion of all others.  <citedDecision>315 U. S. 575, 606</citedDecision> .  This will do well enough in dealing with railroads or utilities supplying manufactured gas, electric power, a communications service or transportation, where utilization of facilities does not impair their future usefulness.  Limitation of supply, however, brings into a natural gas case another phase of the public interest that to my mind overrides both the owner *657 and the consumer of that interest.  Both producers and industrial consumers have served their immediate private interests at the expense of the long-range public interest.  The public interest, of course, requires stopping unjust enrichment of the owner.  But it also requires stopping unjust impoverishment of future generations.  The public interest in the use by Hope’s half million domestic consumers is quite a different one from the public interest in use by a baker’s dozen of industries.

 Whether the Commission will assert its apparently broad statutory authorization over prices and discrimina-tions is, of course, its own affair, not ours. It is entitled to its own notion of the “public interest” and its judgment of policy must prevail.  However, where there is ground for thinking that views of this Court may have constrained the Commission to accept the rate-base method of decision and a particular single formula as “all important” for a rate base, it is appropriate to make clear the reasons why I, at least, would not be so understood.  The Commission is free to face up realistically to the nature and peculiarity of the resources in its control, to foster their duration in fixing price, and to consider future interests in addition to those of investors and present consumers.  If we return this case it may accept or decline the proffered freedom.  This problem presents the Commission an unprecedented opportunity if it will boldly make sound economic considerations, instead of legal and accounting theories, the foundation of federal policy.  I would return the case to the Commission and thereby be.clearly quit of what now may appear to be some responsibility for perpetrating a short-sighted pattern of natural gas regulation.  <citedDecision>315 U.S. 575</citedDecision> .  Judge Dobie, dissenting below, pointed out that the majority opinion in the Pipeline case “contains no express discussion of the Prudent Investment Theory” and that the concurring opinion contained a clear one, and said, “It is difficult for me to believe that the majority of the Supreme Court, believing otherwise, would leave such a statement unchallenged.” The fact that two other Justices had as matter of record in our books long opposed the reproduction cost theory of rate bases and had commented favorably on the pru *629 dent investment theory may have influenced that conclusion.  See opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in Driscoll v. Edison Light & Power Co., 307 U. S. 104, 122 , and my brief as Solicitor General in that case. It should be noted, however, that these statements were made, not in a natural gas case, but in an electric power case — a very important distinction, as I shall try to make plain.  Natural gas from the Appalachian field averages about 1,050 to 1,150 B. T. U. content, while by-product manufactured gas is about 530 to 540.
