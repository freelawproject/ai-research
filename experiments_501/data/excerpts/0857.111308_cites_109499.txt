*530 Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court. We revisit in these cases an issue raised in National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976).  In that litigation, this Court, by a sharply divided vote, ruled that the Commerce Clause does not empower Congress to enforce the minimum-wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) against the States “in areas of traditional governmental functions.” <citedDecision>Id., at 852</citedDecision> .  Although <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> supplied some examples of “traditional governmental functions,” it did not offer a general explanation of how a “traditional” function is to be distinguished from a “nontraditional” one.  Since then, federal and state courts have struggled with the task, thus imposed, of identifying a traditional function for purposes of state immunity under the Commerce Clause.  In the present cases, a Federal District Court concluded that municipal ownership and operation of a mass-transit system is a traditional governmental function and thus, under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , is exempt from the obligations imposed by the FLSA.  Faced with the identical question, three Federal Courts of Appeals and one state appellate court have reached the opposite conclusion.  1 *531 Our examination of this “function” standard applied in these and other cases over the last eight years now persuades us that the attempt to draw the boundaries of state regulatory immunity in terms of “traditional governmental function” is not only unworkable but is also inconsistent with established principles of federalism and, indeed, with those very federalism principles on which <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> purported to rest. That case, accordingly, is overruled.  I The history of public transportation in San Antonio, Tex., is characteristic of the history of local mass transit in the United States generally.  Passenger transportation for hire within San Antonio originally was provided on a private basis by a local transportation company.  In 1913, the Texas Legislature authorized the State’s municipalities to regulate vehicles providing carriage for hire.  1913 Tex. Gen. Laws, ch. 147, § 4, ¶ 12, now codified, as amended, as Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann., Art. 1175, §§ 20 and 21 (Vernon 1963).  Two years later, San Antonio enacted an ordinance setting forth franchising, insurance, and safety requirements for passenger vehicles operated for hire.  The city continued to rely on such publicly regulated private mass transit until 1959, when it purchased the privately owned San Antonio Transit Company and replaced it with a public authority known as the San Antonio Transit System (SATS).

 The application of the FLSA to public schools and hospitals was ruled to be within Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968).  The FLSA obligations of public mass-transit systems like SATS were expanded in 1974 when Congress provided for the progressive repeal of the surviving overtime exemption for mass-transit employees.  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, § 21(b), 88 Stat. 68 .  Congress simultaneously brought the States and their subdivisions further within the ambit of the FLSA by extending FLSA coverage to virtually all state and local-government employees.  §§ 6(a)(1) and (6), 88 Stat. 58 , 60, 29 U. S. C. §§ 203 (d) and (x).  SATS complied with the FLSA’s overtime requirements until 1976, when this Court, in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , overruled Maryland v. Wirtz , and held that the FLSA could not be *534 applied constitutionally to the “traditional governmental functions” of state and local governments.  Four months after <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> was handed down, SATS informed its employees that the decision relieved SATS of its overtime obligations under the FLSA.  3 Matters rested there until September 17, 1979, when the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor issued an opinion that SAMTA’s operations “are not constitutionally immune from the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act” under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  Opinion WH-499, 6 LRR 91:1138.  On November 21 of that year, SAMTA filed this action against the Secretary of Labor in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.  It sought a declaratory judgment that, contrary to the Wage and Hour Administration’s determination, <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> precluded the application of the FLSA’s overtime requirements to SAMTA’s operations.  The Secretary counterclaimed under 29 U. S. C. §217 for enforcement of the overtime and recordkéeping requirements of the FLSA.  On the same day that SAMTA filed its action, appellant Garcia and several other SAMTA employees brought suit against SAMTA in the same District Court for overtime pay under the FLSA.  Garcia v. SAMTA, Civil Action No. SA 79 CA 458.  The District Court has stayed that action pending the outcome of these cases, but it allowed Garcia to intervene in the present litigation as a defendant in support of the Secretary.  One month after SAMTA brought suit, the Department of Labor formally amended its FLSA interpretive regulations to provide that publicly owned local mass-transit systems are not entitled to immunity under *535 <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  44 Fed. Reg. 75630 (1979), codified as 29 CFR § 775.3 (b)(3) (1984).  On November 17, 1981, the District Court granted SAMTA’s motion for summary judgment and denied the Secretary’s and Garcia’s cross-motion for partial summary judgment.  Without further explanation, the District Court ruled that “local public mass transit systems (including [SAMTA]) constitute integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions” under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> .  App. D to Juris. Statement in No. 82-1913, p. 24a.  The Secretary and Garcia both appealed directly to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1252 .  During the pendency of those appeals, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678 (1982), was decided.  In that case, the Court ruled that commuter rail service provided by the state-owned Long Island Rail Road did not constitute a “traditional governmental function” and hence did not enjoy constitutional immunity, under <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , from the requirements of the Railway Labor Act.  Thereafter, it vacated the District Court’s judgment in the present cases and remanded them for further consideration in the light of Long Island.  457 U. S. 1102 (1982).  On remand, the District Court adhered to its original view and again entered judgment for SAMTA.  557 F. Supp. 445 (1983).  The court looked first to what it regarded as the “historical reality” of state involvement in mass transit.  It recognized that States not always had owned and operated mass-transit systems, but concluded that they had engaged in a longstanding pattern of public regulation, and that this regulatory tradition gave rise to an “inference of sovereignty.” Id., at 447-448 .  The court next looked to the record of federal involvement in the field and concluded that constitutional immunity would not result in an erosion of federal authority with respect to state-owned mass-transit systems, because many federal statutes themselves contain exemptions for States and thus make the withdrawal of fed *536 eral regulatory power over public mass-transit systems a supervening federal policy.  Id., at 448-450 .  Although the Federal Government’s authority over employee wages under the FLSA obviously would be eroded, Congress had not asserted any interest in the wages of public mass-transit employees until 1966 and hence had not established a longstanding federal interest in the field, in contrast to the century-old federal regulatory presence in the railroad industry found significant for the decision in Long Island.  Finally, the court compared mass transit to the list of functions identified as constitutionally immune in <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and concluded that it did not differ from those functions in any material respect.  The court stated: “If transit is to be distinguished from the exempt [National League of Cities] functions it will have to be by identifying a traditional state function in the same way pornography is sometimes identified: someone knows it when they see it, but they can’t describe it.” 557 F. Supp., at 453 .  4 The Secretary and Garcia again took direct appeals from the District Court’s judgment.  We noted probable jurisdiction.  464 U. S. 812 (1983).  After initial argument, the cases were restored to our calendar for reargument, and the parties were requested to brief and argue the following additional question: “Whether or not the principles of the Tenth Amendment as set forth in National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), should be reconsidered?” 468 U. S. 1213 (1984).  Reargument followed in due course.  *537 II Appellees have not argued that SAMTA is immune from regulation under the FLSA on the ground that it is a local transit system engaged in intrastate commercial activity.  In a practical sense, SAMTA’s operations might well be characterized as “local.” Nonetheless, it long has been settled that Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause extends to intrastate economic activities that affect interstate commerce.  See, e. g., Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 276-277 (1981); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc. v. United States, 379 U. S. 241, 258 (1964); Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U. S. 111, 125 (1942); United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941).  Were SAMTA a privately owned and operated enterprise, it could not credibly argue that Congress exceeded the bounds of its Commerce Clause powers in prescribing minimum wages and overtime rates for SAMTA’s employees.  Any constitutional exemption from the requirements of the FLSA therefore must rest on SAMTA’s status as a governmental entity rather than on the “local” nature of its operations.  The prerequisites for governmental immunity under National League of Cities were summarized by this Court in Hodel, supra. Under that summary, four conditions must be satisfied before a state activity may be deemed immune from a particular federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.  First, it is said that the federal statute at issue must regulate “the ‘States as States.’” Second, the statute must “address matters that are indisputably ‘attribute[s] of state sovereignty.’” Third, state compliance with the federal obligation must “directly impair [the States’] ability ‘to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions.’ ” Finally, the relation of state and federal interests must not be such that “the nature of the federal interest .  .  .  justifies state submission.” 452 U. S., at 287-288 , and n. 29, quoting National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845, 852, 854</citedDecision> .  *538 The controversy in the present cases has focused on the third Hodel requirement — that the challenged federal statute trench on “traditional governmental functions.” The District Court voiced a common concern: “Despite the abundance of adjectives, identifying which particular state functions are immune remains difficult.” 557 F. Supp., at 447 .  Just how troublesome the task has been is revealed by the results reached in other federal cases. Thus, courts have held that regulating ambulance services, Gold Cross Ambulance v. City of Kansas City, 538 F. Supp. 956, 967-969 (WD Mo. 1982), aff’d on other grounds, 705 F. 2d 1005 (CA8 1983), cert. pending, No. 83-138; licensing automobile drivers, United States v. Best, 573 F. 2d 1095, 1102-1103 (CA9 1978); operating a municipal airport, Amersbach v. City of Cleveland, 598 F. 2d 1033, 1037-1038 (CA6 1979); performing solid waste disposal, Hybud Equipment Corp. v. City of Akron, 654 F. 2d 1187, 1196 (CA6 1981); and operating a highway authority, Molina-Estrada v. Puerto Rico Highway Authority, 680 F. 2d 841, 845-846 (CA1 1982), are functions protected under National League of Cities.  At the same time, courts have held that issuance of industrial development bonds, Woods v. Homes and Structures of Pittsburg, Kansas, Inc., 489 F. Supp. 1270, 1296-1297 (Kan. 1980); regulation of intrastate natural gas sales, Oklahoma ex rel. Derryberry v. FERC, 494 F. Supp. 636, 657 (WD Okla. 1980), aff’d, 661 F. 2d 832 (CA10 1981), cert. denied sub nom. Texas v. FERC, 457 U. S. 1105 (1982); regulation of traffic on public roads, Friends of the Earth v. Carey, 552 F. 2d 25, 38 (CA2), cert. denied, 434 U. S. 902 (1977); regulation of air transportation, Hughes Air Corp. v. Public Utilities Comm’n of Cal., 644 F. 2d 1334 , 1340-1341 (CA9 1981); operation of a telephone system, Puerto Rico Tel. Co. v. FCC, 553 F. 2d 694, 700-701 (CA1 1977); leasing and sale of natural gas, Public Service Co. of N. C. v. FERC, 587 F. 2d 716 , 721 (CA5), cert. denied sub nom. Louisiana v. FERC, 444 U. S. 879 (1979); operation of a mental health facility, Williams v. Eastside Mental *539 Health Center, Inc., 669 F. 2d 671, 680-681 (CA11), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 976 (1982); and provision of in-house domestic services for the aged and handicapped, Bonnette v. California Health and Welfare Agency, 704 F. 2d 1465 , 1472 (CA9 1983), are not entitled to immunity.  We find it difficult, if not impossible, to identify an organizing principle that places each of the cases in the first group on one side of a line and each of the cases in the second group on the other side.  The constitutional distinction between licensing drivers and regulating traffic, for example, or between operating a highway authority and operating a mental health facility, is elusive at best.  Thus far, this Court itself has made little headway in defining the scope of the governmental functions deemed protected under National League of Cities.  In that case the Court set forth examples of protected and unprotected functions, see <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 851, 854, n. 18</citedDecision> , but provided no explanation of how those examples were identified.  The only other case in which the Court has had occasion to address the problem is Long Island.  5 We there observed: “The determination of whether a federal law impairs a state’s authority with respect to ‘areas of traditional [state] functions’ may at times be a difficult one.” 455 U. S., at 684 , quoting National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 852</citedDecision> .  The accuracy of that statement is demonstrated by this Court’s own difficulties in Long Island in developing a workable standard for “traditional governmental functions.” We relied in large part there on “the historical reality that the operation of railroads is not among the functions traditionally performed by state and local governments,” but we *540 simultaneously disavowed “a static historical view of state functions generally immune from federal regulation.” 455 U. S., at 686 (first emphasis added; second emphasis in original).  We held that the inquiry into a particular function’s “traditional” nature was merely a means of determining whether the federal statute at issue unduly handicaps “basic state prerogatives,” id., at 686-687 , but we did not offer an explanation of what makes one state function a “basic prerogative” and another function not basic.  Finally, having disclaimed a rigid reliance on the historical pedigree of state involvement in a particular area, we nonetheless found it appropriate to emphasize the extended historical record of federal involvement in the field of rail transportation.  Id., at 687-689 .  Many constitutional standards involve “undoubte[d] .  .

 See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 248 (1983) (concurring opinion).  It is equally true, however, that the text of the Constitution provides the beginning rather than the final answer to every inquiry into questions of federalism, for “[bjehind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control.” Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 322 (1934).  National League of Cities reflected the general conviction that the Constitution precludes “the National Government [from] devouring] the essentials of state sovereignty.” Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 205 (dissenting opinion).  In order to be faithful to the underlying federal premises of the Constitution, courts must look for the “postulates which limit and control.” What has proved problematic is not the perception that the Constitution’s federal structure imposes limitations on the Commerce Clause, but rather the nature and content of those limitations.  One approach to defining the limits on Con *548 gress’ authority to regulate the States under the Commerce Clause is to identify certain underlying elements of political sovereignty that are deemed essential to the States’ “separate and independent existence.” Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869).  This approach obviously underlay the Court’s use of the “traditional governmental function” concept in National League of Cities.  It also has led to the separate requirement that the challenged federal statute “address matters that are indisputably ‘attribute^] of state sovereignty.’” Hodel, 452 U. S., at 288 , quoting National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845</citedDecision> .  In National League of Cities itself, for example, the Court concluded that decisions by a State concerning the wages and hours of its employees are an “undoubted attribute of state sovereignty.” <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 845</citedDecision> .  The opinion did not explain what aspects of such decisions made them such an “undoubted attribute,” and the Court since then has remarked on the uncertain scope of the concept.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S., at 238, n. 11 .  The point of the inquiry, however, has remained to single out particular features of a State’s internal governance that are deemed to be intrinsic parts of state sovereignty.  We doubt that courts ultimately can identify principled constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress’ Commerce Clause powers over the States merely by relying on a priori definitions of state sovereignty.  In part, this is because of the elusiveness of objective criteria for “fundamental” elements of state sovereignty, a problem we have witnessed in the search for “traditional governmental functions.” There is, however, a more fundamental reason: the sovereignty of the States is limited by the Constitution itself.  A variety of sovereign powers, for example, are withdrawn from the States by Article I, § 10.

 But the principal and basic limit on the federal commerce power is that inherent in all congressional action — the built-in restraints that our system provides through state participation in federal governmental action.  The political process ensures that laws that unduly burden the States will not be promulgated.  In the factual setting of these cases the internal safeguards of the political process have performed as intended.  These cases do not require us to identify or define what affirmative limits the constitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce Clause.  See Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  We note and accept Justice Frankfurter’s observation in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 583 (1946): “The process of Constitutional adjudication does not thrive on conjuring up horrible possibilities that never happen in the real world and devising doctrines sufficiently comprehensive in detail to cover the remotest contingency.  Nor need we go beyond what is required for a reasoned disposition of the kind of controversy now before the Court.” Though the separate concurrence providing the fifth vote in National League of Cities was “not untroubled by certain possible implications” of the decision, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 856</citedDecision> , the Court in that case attempted to articulate affirmative limits on the Commerce Clause power in terms of core governmental functions and fundamental attributes of state sovereignty.  But the model of democratic decisionmaking the *557 Court there identified underestimated, in our view, the solicitude of the national political process for the continued vitality of the States.  Attempts by other courts since then to draw guidance from this model have proved it both impracticable and doctrinally barren.  In sum, in National League of Cities the Court tried to repair what did not need repair.  We do not lightly overrule recent precedent.  22 We have not hesitated, however, when it has become apparent that a prior decision has departed from a proper understanding of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.  See United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 116-117 (1941).  Due respect for the reach of congressional power within the federal system mandates that we do so now.  National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), is overruled.  The judgment of the District Court is reversed, and these cases are remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  See Dove v. Chattanooga Area Regional Transportation Authority, 701 F. 2d 50 (CA6 1983), cert. pending sub nom. City of Macon v. Joiner, No. 82-1974; Alewine v. City Council of Augusta, Ga., 699 F. 2d 1060 (CA111983), cert. pending, No. 83-257; Kramer v. New Castle Area Transit Authority, 677 F. 2d 308 (CA3 1982), cert. denied, 459 U. S. 1146 (1983); Francis v. City of Tallahassee, 424 So. 2d 61 (Fla. App. 1982).  Urban Mass Transportation: Hearings on H. R. 6663 et al. before the Subcommittee on Housing of the House Committee on Banking and Currency, 91st Cong., 2d Sess., 419 (1970) (statement of F. Norman Hill).  Neither SATS nor SAMTA appears to have attempted to avoid the FLSA’s minimum-wage provisions.  We are informed that basic wage levels in the mass-transit industry traditionally have been well in excess of the minimum wages prescribed by the FLSA.

 In Powers , the Court upheld the application of the federal income tax to the income of trustees of a state-operated commuter railroad; the Court reiterated that “the State cannot withdraw sources of revenue from the federal taxing power by engaging in businesses which constitute a departure from usual governmental functions and to which, by reason of their nature, the federal taxing power would normally extend,” regardless of the *542 fact that the proprietary enterprises “are undertaken for what the State conceives to be the public benefit.” 293 U. S., at 225 .  Accord, Allen v. Regents, 304 U. S. 439, 451-453 (1938).  That concern was especially weighty in South Carolina because liquor taxes, the object of the dispute in that case, then accounted for over one-fourth of the Federal Government’s revenues.  See New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 598, n. 4 (1946) (dissenting opinion).  Indeed, the “traditional” nature of a particular governmental function can be a matter of historical nearsightedness; today’s self-evidently “traditional” function is often yesterday’s suspect innovation.  Thus, National League of Cities offered the provision of public parks and recreation as an example of a traditional governmental function.  <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 851</citedDecision> .  A scant 80 years earlier, however, in Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282 (1893), the Court pointed out that city commons originally had been provided not for recreation but for grazing domestic animals “in common,” and that “[i]n the memory of men now living, a proposition to take private property [by eminent domain] for a public park .  .  .  would have been regarded as a novel exercise of legislative power.” Id,, at 297.  For much the same reasons, the existence vel non of a tradition of federal involvement in a particular area does not provide an adequate standard for state immunity.  Most of the Federal Government’s current regulatory activity originated less than 50 years ago with the New Deal, and a good portion of it has developed within the past two decades.

Justice O’Connor, with whom Justice Powell and Justice Rehnquist join, dissenting.  The Court today surveys the battle scene of federalism and sounds a retreat.  Like Justice, Powell,.  I would prefer to hold the field and, at the very least, render a little aid to the wounded.  I join Justice Powell's opinion.  I also write separately to note my fundamental disagreement with the majority’s views of federalism and the duty of this Court. The Court overrules National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), on the grounds that it is not “faithful to the role of federalism in a democratic society.” Ante, at 546.  “The essence of our federal system,” the Court concludes, “is that within the realm of authority left open to them under the Constitution, the States must be equally free to engage in any activity that their citizens choose for the common weal.  ...” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> National League of Cities is held to be inconsistent with this narrow view of federalism because it attempts to protect only those fundamental aspects of state sovereignty that are essential to the States’ separate and independent existence, rather than protecting all state activities “equally.” In my view, federalism cannot be reduced to the weak “essence” distilled by the majority today.  There is more to federalism than the nature of the constraints that can be imposed on the States in “the realm of authority left open to them by the Constitution.” The central issue of federalism, *581 of course, is whether any realm is left open to the States by the Constitution — whether any area remains in which a State may act free of federal interference.  “The issue ... is whether the federal system has any legal substance, any core of constitutional right that courts will enforce.” C. Black, Perspectives in Constitutional Law 30 (1963).  The true “essence” of federalism is that the States as States have legitimate interests which the National Government is bound to respect even though its laws are supreme.  Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 44 (1971).  If federalism so conceived and so carefully cultivated by the Framers of our Constitution is to remain meaningful, this Court cannot abdicate its constitutional responsibility to oversee the Federal Government’s compliance with its duty to respect the legitimate interests of the States.  Due to the emergence of an integrated and industrialized national economy, this Court has been required to examine and review a breathtaking expansion of the powers of Congress.

 For example, Congress might rationally conclude that the location a State chooses for its capital may affect interstate commerce, but the Court has suggested that Congress would nevertheless be barred from dictating that location because such an exercise of a delegated power would undermine the state sovereignty inherent in the Tenth Amendment.  Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559, 565 (1911).  Similarly, Congress in the exercise of its taxing and spending powers can protect federal savings and loan associations, but if it chooses to do so by the means of converting quasi-public state savings and loan associations into federal associations, the Court has held that it contravenes the reserved powers of the States because the conversion is not a reasonably necessary exercise of power to reach the desired end.  Hopkins Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Cleary, 296 U. S. 315 (1935).  The operative language of these cases varies, but the underlying principle is consistent: state autonomy is a relevant factor in assessing the means by which Congress exercises its powers.  *587 This principle requires the Court to enforce affirmative limits on federal regulation of the States to complement the judicially crafted expansion of the interstate commerce power.  <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Usery</citedDecision> represented an attempt to define such limits.  The Court today rejects <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and washes its hands of all efforts to protect the States.  In the process, the Court opines that unwarranted federal encroachments on state authority are and will remain “‘horrible possibilities that never happen in the real world.”’ Ante, at 556, quoting New York v. United States, supra, at 583 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  There is ample reason to believe to the contrary.  The last two decades have seen an unprecedented growth of federal regulatory activity, as the majority itself acknowledges.  Ante, at 544-545, n. 10.  In 1954, one could still speak of a “burden of persuasion on those favoring national intervention” in asserting that “National action has .  .

 always been regarded as exceptional in our polity, an intrusion to be justified by some necessity, the special rather than the ordinary case.” Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government, 54 Colum. L. Rev. 543 , 544-545 (1954).  Today, as federal legislation and coercive grant programs have expanded to embrace innumerable activities that were once viewed as local, the burden of persuasion has surely shifted, and the extraordinary has become ordinary.  See Engdahl, Sense and Nonsense About State Immunity, 2 Constitutional Commentary 93 (1985).  For example, recently the Federal Government has, with this Court’s blessing, undertaken to tell the States the age at which they can retire their law enforcement officers, and the regulatory standards, procedures, and even the agenda which their utilities commissions must consider and follow.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742 (1982).  The political process *588 has not protected against these encroachments on state activities, even though they directly impinge on a State’s ability to make and enforce its laws.  With the abandonment of <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , all that stands between the remaining essentials of state sovereignty and Congress is the for self-restraint.  The problems of federalism in an integrated national economy are capable of more responsible resolution than holding that the States as States retain no status apart from that which Congress chooses to let them retain.  The proper resolution, I suggest, lies in weighing state autonomy as a factor in the balance when interpreting the means by which Congress can exercise its authority on the States as States.  It is insufficient, in assessing the validity of congressional regulation of a State pursuant to the commerce power, to ask only whether the same regulation would be valid if enforced against a private party.  That reasoning, embodied in the majority opinion, is inconsistent with the spirit of our Constitution.  It remains relevant that a State is being regulated, as <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and every recent case have recognized.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, supra; Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 684 (1982); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 287-288 (1981); National League of Cities, <citedDecision>426 U. S., at 841-846</citedDecision> .  As far as the Constitution is concerned, a State should not be equated with any private litigant.  Cf. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 428 (1979) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (criticizing the ability of a state court to treat a sister State no differently than a private litigant).  Instead, the autonomy of a State is an essential component of federalism.  If state autonomy is ignored in assessing the means by which Congress regulates matters affecting commerce, then federalism becomes irrelevant simply because the set activities remaining beyond the reach of such a commerce power “may well be negligible.” Ante, at 545.  It has been difficult for this Court to craft bright fining the scope of the state autonomy protected by National *589 League of Cities.  Such difficulty is to be expected whenever constitutional concerns as important as federalism and the effectiveness of the commerce power come into conflict.  Regardless of the difficulty, it is and will remain the duty of this Court to reconcile these concerns in the final instance.  That the Court shuns the task today by appealing to the “essence of federalism” can provide scant comfort to those who believe our federal system requires something more than a unitary, centralized government.  I would not shirk the duty acknowledged by <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and its progeny, and I share Justice Rehnquist’s belief that this Court will in time again assume its constitutional responsibility.  I I respectfully dissent.

Justice O’Connor, with whom Justice Powell and Justice Rehnquist join, dissenting.  The Court today surveys the battle scene of federalism and sounds a retreat.  Like Justice, Powell,.  I would prefer to hold the field and, at the very least, render a little aid to the wounded.  I join Justice Powell's opinion.  I also write separately to note my fundamental disagreement with the majority’s views of federalism and the duty of this Court. The Court overrules National League of Cities v. Usery, <citedDecision>426 U. S. 833</citedDecision> (1976), on the grounds that it is not “faithful to the role of federalism in a democratic society.” Ante, at 546.  “The essence of our federal system,” the Court concludes, “is that within the realm of authority left open to them under the Constitution, the States must be equally free to engage in any activity that their citizens choose for the common weal.  ...” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> National League of Cities is held to be inconsistent with this narrow view of federalism because it attempts to protect only those fundamental aspects of state sovereignty that are essential to the States’ separate and independent existence, rather than protecting all state activities “equally.” In my view, federalism cannot be reduced to the weak “essence” distilled by the majority today.  There is more to federalism than the nature of the constraints that can be imposed on the States in “the realm of authority left open to them by the Constitution.” The central issue of federalism, *581 of course, is whether any realm is left open to the States by the Constitution — whether any area remains in which a State may act free of federal interference.  “The issue ... is whether the federal system has any legal substance, any core of constitutional right that courts will enforce.” C. Black, Perspectives in Constitutional Law 30 (1963).  The true “essence” of federalism is that the States as States have legitimate interests which the National Government is bound to respect even though its laws are supreme.  Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 44 (1971).  If federalism so conceived and so carefully cultivated by the Framers of our Constitution is to remain meaningful, this Court cannot abdicate its constitutional responsibility to oversee the Federal Government’s compliance with its duty to respect the legitimate interests of the States.  Due to the emergence of an integrated and industrialized national economy, this Court has been required to examine and review a breathtaking expansion of the powers of Congress.

 For example, Congress might rationally conclude that the location a State chooses for its capital may affect interstate commerce, but the Court has suggested that Congress would nevertheless be barred from dictating that location because such an exercise of a delegated power would undermine the state sovereignty inherent in the Tenth Amendment.  Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559, 565 (1911).  Similarly, Congress in the exercise of its taxing and spending powers can protect federal savings and loan associations, but if it chooses to do so by the means of converting quasi-public state savings and loan associations into federal associations, the Court has held that it contravenes the reserved powers of the States because the conversion is not a reasonably necessary exercise of power to reach the desired end.  Hopkins Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Cleary, 296 U. S. 315 (1935).  The operative language of these cases varies, but the underlying principle is consistent: state autonomy is a relevant factor in assessing the means by which Congress exercises its powers.  *587 This principle requires the Court to enforce affirmative limits on federal regulation of the States to complement the judicially crafted expansion of the interstate commerce power.  <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Usery</citedDecision> represented an attempt to define such limits.  The Court today rejects <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and washes its hands of all efforts to protect the States.  In the process, the Court opines that unwarranted federal encroachments on state authority are and will remain “‘horrible possibilities that never happen in the real world.”’ Ante, at 556, quoting New York v. United States, supra, at 583 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  There is ample reason to believe to the contrary.  The last two decades have seen an unprecedented growth of federal regulatory activity, as the majority itself acknowledges.  Ante, at 544-545, n. 10.  In 1954, one could still speak of a “burden of persuasion on those favoring national intervention” in asserting that “National action has .  .

 always been regarded as exceptional in our polity, an intrusion to be justified by some necessity, the special rather than the ordinary case.” Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government, 54 Colum. L. Rev. 543 , 544-545 (1954).  Today, as federal legislation and coercive grant programs have expanded to embrace innumerable activities that were once viewed as local, the burden of persuasion has surely shifted, and the extraordinary has become ordinary.  See Engdahl, Sense and Nonsense About State Immunity, 2 Constitutional Commentary 93 (1985).  For example, recently the Federal Government has, with this Court’s blessing, undertaken to tell the States the age at which they can retire their law enforcement officers, and the regulatory standards, procedures, and even the agenda which their utilities commissions must consider and follow.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742 (1982).  The political process *588 has not protected against these encroachments on state activities, even though they directly impinge on a State’s ability to make and enforce its laws.  With the abandonment of <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> , all that stands between the remaining essentials of state sovereignty and Congress is the for self-restraint.  The problems of federalism in an integrated national economy are capable of more responsible resolution than holding that the States as States retain no status apart from that which Congress chooses to let them retain.  The proper resolution, I suggest, lies in weighing state autonomy as a factor in the balance when interpreting the means by which Congress can exercise its authority on the States as States.  It is insufficient, in assessing the validity of congressional regulation of a State pursuant to the commerce power, to ask only whether the same regulation would be valid if enforced against a private party.  That reasoning, embodied in the majority opinion, is inconsistent with the spirit of our Constitution.  It remains relevant that a State is being regulated, as <citedDecision>National League of Cities</citedDecision> and every recent case have recognized.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, supra; Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 684 (1982); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U.
