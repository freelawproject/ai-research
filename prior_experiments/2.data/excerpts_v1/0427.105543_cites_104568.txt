207 Misc. 294 , 138 N. Y. S. 2d 222. The New York Court of Appeals upheld the support order. 1 N.Y. 2d 342, 135 N.E.2d 553 . Petitioner then applied to this Court for certiorari contending that § 1170-b, as applied, is unconstitutional because it contravenes the Full Faith and Credit Clause. [5] We granted certiorari, 352 U.S. 820 . In Estin v. Estin, 334 U.S. 541 , this Court decided that a Nevada divorce court, which had no personal jurisdiction over the wife, had no power to terminate a husband's obligation to provide her support as required in a preexisting New York separation decree. The factor which distinguishes the present case from Estin is that here the wife's right to support had not been reduced to judgment prior to the husband's ex parte divorce. In our opinion this difference is not material on the question before us. Since the wife was not subject to its jurisdiction, the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which she had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband. It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. [6] Here, the Nevada divorce court *419 was as powerless to cut off the wife's support right as it would have been to order the husband to pay alimony if the wife had brought the divorce action and he had not been subject to the divorce court's jurisdiction. Therefore, the Nevada decree, to the extent it purported to affect the wife's right to support, was void and the Full Faith and Credit Clause did not obligate New York to give it recognition. [7] Petitioner claims that this case is governed by Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551 . For the reasons given in a concurring opinion in Armstrong v. Armstrong, 350 U.S. 568 , 575, at 580-581, the Thompson case, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling. Affirmed. THE CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, dissenting. The question in this case is whether Nevada, which was empowered to grant petitioner a divorce without personal jurisdiction over respondent that must be respected, by command of the Constitution, by every other State, Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287 , *420 was at the same time empowered by virtue of its domiciliary connection with petitioner to make, incidental to its dissolution of the marriage, an adjudication denying alimony to which sister States must also give full faith and credit. Whatever the answer to the question may be, Estin v. Estin, 334 U.S. 541 , does not supply it. What the Court now states to be "not material" was crucial to the decision in that case, namely, the prior New York support order, which the Court held Nevada was required to respect by virtue of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, § 1, of the Constitution. That this fact was crucial to the Court's decision in that case is made clear by the Court's reference to the prior New York judgment in its two statements of the question presented and more than a half dozen times throughout the course of its opinion. The Court rightly regarded the fact as crucial because of the requirement of Art. IV, § 1, that Nevada give full faith and credit to the prior New York "judicial Proceedings." The Court now chooses to regard the existence of a prior New York support order as "not material," holding for the first time that "the Nevada divorce court had no power to extinguish any right which [respondent] had under the law of New York to financial support from her husband.

See de Meli v. de Meli, 120 N.Y. 485 , 24 N.E. 996 . On the other hand, the opinion below intimates that the one-year *435 residency can be regarded as merely a procedural prerequisite to filing suit under § 1170-b, and does not affect Mrs. Vanderbilt's status as a domiciliary of New York ab initio. [5] In view of this uncertainty in the state law, I would remand to the state court for reconsideration in light of the above-stated principles. NOTES [1] It seems clear that in Nevada the effect of this decree was to put an end to the husband's duty to support the wifeprovided, of course, that the Nevada courts had power to do this. Sweeney v. Sweeney, 42 Nev. 431 , 438-439, 179 P. 638 , 639-640; Herrick v. Herrick, 55 Nev. 59 , 68, 25 P.2d 378 , 380. See Estin v. Estin, 334 U.S. 541 , 547. [2] See Pennington v. Fourth Natl. Bank of Cincinnati, 243 U.S. 269 ; Harris v. Balk, 198 U.S. 215 . [3] Art. IV, § 1. "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof."

[1] Custody over children presents an entirely different problem. See May v. Anderson, 345 U.S. 528 . The interests of independent human beings, the children, are involved. Also, insofar as the spouses' interests are concerned, the divorce may terminate their relations with each other as husband and wife, but it cannot terminate their relation to their children. They are still parents. [2] "The deceptive appeal of the phrase `divisible divorce' should not be permitted to obscure the basic concepts involved. A finding of divisibility may be appropriate where, as in Estin, the particular right at issue is a distinct property right, embodied in a previously granted judgment, which is no longer dependent, for its recognition or enforcement, upon the marital relationship, or where, as in Armstrong, the court rendering the divorce has itself severed the issue of support and left it subject to separate adjudication in the future. The situation is, however, decidedly different where, as in the case before us, the claim asserted depends for its very existence on the continuance of the marital status and that status and its incidents have both been terminated by a jurisdictionally valid judgment of divorce." Judge Fuld, dissenting in this case in the New York Court of Appeals, 1 N.Y. 2d 342, 356-357, 135 N.E.2d 553 , 561. I would add that the concept of "divisible divorce" is a misnomer. The divorce is not divisible. It is the cause of action for terminating the marital relation and making a property arrangement that is divided. [3] We are not told what a third State is to do if suit is brought there.
