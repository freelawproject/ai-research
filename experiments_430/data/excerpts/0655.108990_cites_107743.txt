 It follows, however, from our conclusion that New York’s program is incompatible with §402 (a) (23), that petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief and an appropriate injunction by the District Court against the payment of federal monies according to the new schedules, should the State not develop a conforming plan within a reasonable period of time.  “We have considered and rejected the argument that a federal court is without power to review state welfare provisions or prohibit the use of federal funds by the States in view of the fact that Congress has lodged in the Department of HEW the power to cut off federal funds for noncompliance with statutory requirements.  We are most reluctant to assume Congress has closed the avenue of effective judicial review to those individuals most directly affected by the administration of its program.  .  .  .  We adhere to King v. Smith, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 309</citedDecision> (1968), which implicitly rejected the argument that the statutory provisions for HEW review of plans should be read to curtail judicial relief and held Alabama’s ‘substitute father’ regulation to be inconsistent with the federal statute.  While <citedDecision>King</citedDecision> did not advert specifically to the remedial problem, the unarticulated premise was that the State had alternative choices of assuming the additional cost of paying benefits to families with substitute fathers or not using federal funds to pay welfare benefits according to a plan that was inconsistent with federal requirements.” <citedDecision>Id., at 420-421</citedDecision> .  Respondent urges that this language is “tantamount to a finding that Congress conditioned the participation of a state in the categorical assistance program on the forfeiture of immunity from suit in a federal forum .  .  .  irrespective of the relief sought, [since] the intent of Congress remains constant.” Brief for Respondent 42-43.

 The Court went on to say that a state official seeking to enforce in the name of a State an unconstitutional act “comes into conflict with the superior authority of that Constitution, and he is in that case stripped of his official or representative character and is subjected in his person to the consequence of his individual conduct.  The State has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States.” Id., at 159-160 .  As the complaint in the instant case alleges violations by officials of Illinois of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it seems that the case is governed by Ex parte Young so far as injunctive relief is concerned.  The main thrust of the argument is that the.  instant case asks for relief which if granted would .affect the treasury of the State.  Most welfare decisions by federal courts have a fi *681 nancial impact on the States.  Under the existing federal-state cooperative system, a state desiring to participate, submits a “state plan” to HEW for approval; once HEW approves the plan the State is locked into the cooperative scheme until it withdraws, 3 all as described in King v. Smith, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 309</citedDecision> , 316 et seq. The welfare cases coming here have involved ultimately the financial responsibility of the State to beneficiaries claiming they were deprived of federal rights.  <citedDecision>King</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Smith</citedDecision> required payment to children even though their mother was co-habitating with a man who could not pass muster as a *682 “parent.” Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397 , held that under this state-federal cooperative program a State could not reduce its standard of need in conflict with the federal standard.  It is true that Rosado did not involve retroactive payments as are involved here.  But the distinction is not relevant or material because the result in every welfare case coming here is to increase or reduce the financial responsibility of the participating State.  In no case when the responsibility of the State is increased to meet the lawful demand of the beneficiary, is there any levy on state funds.  Whether the decree is prospective only or requires payments for the weeks or months wrongfully skipped over by the state officials, the nature of the impact on the state treasury is precisely the same.  We have granted relief in other welfare cases which included retroactive assistance benefits or payments.  In State Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Services v. Zarate, 407 U. S. 918 , the sole issue presented to us 4 was whether the Eleventh Amendment barred a judgment against state officers for retroactive welfare assistance benefits or payments.

 MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN joins, dissenting.  The Social Security Act's categorical assistance programs, including the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD) program involved here, are fundamentally different from most federal legislation.  Unlike the Fair Labor Standards Act involved in last Term's decision in Employees v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973), or the Federal Employers' Liability Act at issue in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), the Social Security Act does not impose federal standards and liability upon all who engage in certain regulated activities, including often-unwilling state agencies.  Instead, the Act seeks to induce state participation in the federal welfare programs by offering federal matching funds in exchange for the State's voluntary assumption of the Act's requirements.  I find this basic distinction crucial: it leads me to conclude that by participation in the programs, the States waive whatever immunity they might otherwise have from federal court *689 orders requiring retroactive payment of welfare benefits.  [1] In its contacts with the Social Security Act's assistance programs in recent years, the Court has frequently described the Act as a "scheme of cooperative federalism." See, e. g., King v. Smith, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 309, 316</citedDecision> (1968); Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U. S. 535, 542 (1972).  While this phrase captures a number of the unique characteristics of these programs, for present purposes it serves to emphasize that the States' decision to participate in the programs is a voluntary one.  In deciding to participate, however, the States necessarily give up their freedom to operate assistance programs for the needy as they see fit, and bind themselves to conform their programs to the requirements of the federal statute and regulations.  As the Court explained in <citedDecision>King</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Smith, supra, at 316-317</citedDecision> (citations omitted): "States are not required to participate in the program, but those which desire to take advantage of the substantial federal funds available for distribution to needy children [or needy aged, blind or disabled] are required to submit an AFDC [or AABD] plan for the approval of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).  The plan must conform with several requirements of the Social Security Act and with rules and regulations promulgated by HEW." So here, Illinois elected to participate in the AABD program, and received and expended substantial federal funds in the years at issue.  It thereby obligated itself to comply with federal law, including the requirement *690 of former 42 U. S. C. § 1382 (a) (8) that "such aid or assistance shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals." In Townsend v. Swank, 404 U. S. 282, 286 (1971), we held that participating States must strictly comply with the requirement that aid be furnished "to all eligible individuals," and that the States have no power to impose additional eligibility requirements which exclude persons eligible for assistance under federal standards.  Today's decision, ante, at 659-660, n. 8.  properly emphasizes that participating States must also comply strictly with the "reasonable promptness" requirement and the more detailed regulations adding content to it.
