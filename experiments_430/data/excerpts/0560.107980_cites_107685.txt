 Federal double jeopardy standards were not applicable against the States.  Only when a kind of jeopardy subjected a defendant to “a hardship so acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it,” id., at 328 , did the Fourteenth Amendment apply.  The order *794 for a new trial was affirmed.  In subsequent appeals from state courts, the Court continued to apply this lesser Palko standard.  See, e. g., Brock v. North Carolina, 344 U. S. 424 (1953).  Recently, however, this Court has “increasingly looked to the specific guarantees of the [Bill of Rights] to determine whether a state criminal trial was conducted with due process of law.” Washington v. Texas, 388 U. S. 14, 18 (1967).  In an increasing number of cases, the Court “has rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a ‘watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights ....’” Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10-11 (1964) , 12 Only last Term we found that the right to trial by jury in criminal cases was “fundamental to the American scheme of justice,” Duncan v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 145, 149</citedDecision> (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  13 For the same reasons, we today find that the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents a fundamental ideal in our constitutional heritage, and that it should apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Insofar as it is inconsistent with this holding, Palko v. Connecticut is overruled.  Palko represented an approach to basic constitutional rights which this Court’s recent decisions have rejected.  It was cut of the same cloth as Betts v. Brady, 316 IT.  S. 455 (1942), the case which held that a criminal defendant’s right to counsel was to be determined by deciding in each case whether the denial of that right was “shocking to the universal sense of justice.” Id., at 462 .  It *795 relied upon Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78 (1908), which held that the right against compulsory self-incrimination was not an element of Fourteenth Amendment due process.  Betts was overruled by Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963); Twining , by Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964).  Our recent cases have thoroughly rejected the Palko notion that basic constitutional rights can be denied by the States as long as the totality of the circumstances does not disclose a denial of “fundamental fairness.” Once it is decided that a particular Bill of Rights guarantee is “fundamental to the American scheme of justice,” <citedDecision>Duncan</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Louisiana, supra, at 149</citedDecision> , the same constitutional standards apply against both the State and Federal Governments.  Palko’s roots had thus been cut away years ago.  We today only recognize the inevitable.  The fundamental nature of the guarantee against double jeopardy can hardly be doubted.  Its origins can be traced to Greek and Roman times, and it became established in the common law of England long before this Nation’s independence.  14 See Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, 151-155 (1959) (Black, J., dissenting).  As with many other elements of the common law, it was carried into the jurisprudence of this Country through the medium of Blackstone, who codified the doctrine in his Commentaries.

 That issue is not, however, presented by this case, and accordingly we express no opinion on it.  Compare Meade v. State, 198 Md. 489 , 84 A. 2d 892 (1951), with Marks v. State, 230 Md. 108 , 185 A. 2d 909 (1962).  See n. 7, supra. See n. 1, supra, and Part V, infra.  A stronger ease for total abolition of the concurrent sentence doctrine may well be made in cases on direct appeal, as compared to convictions attacked collaterally by suits for post-conviction relief.  Because of our disposition of this case, we need not reach this question.  Quoting from Ohio ex rel. Eaton v. Price, 364 U. S. 263, 275 (1960) (opinion of BrennaN, J.).  A list of those Bill of Rights guarantees which have been held “incorporated” in the Fourteenth Amendment can be found in <citedDecision>Duncan, supra, at 148</citedDecision> .  J. Sigler, Double Jeopardy 1-37 (1969).  4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *335.  Sigler, supra, n. 14, at 78-79; Brock v. North Carolina, 344 U. S. 424, 435, n. 6 (1953) (Vinson, C. J., dissenting).  There is no danger here that the jury might have been tempted to compromise on a lesser charge because of an erroneous retrial on a greater charge.  See United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F. 2d 844, 866 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, sub nom. Mancusi v. Hetenyi, 383 U. S. 913 (1966).  Larceny is a lesser offense than burglary.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice White, concurring. While I agree with the Court’s extension of the prohibition against double jeopardy to the States, and with the Court’s conclusion that the concurrent sentence rule constitutes no jurisdictional bar, additional comment on the wisdom and effects of applying a concurrent sentence rule seems appropriate. In a time of increasingly congested judicial dockets, often requiring long delays before trial and upon appeal, *799 judicial resources have become scarce. Where a man has been convicted on several counts and sentenced concurrently upon each, and where judicial review of one count sustains its validity, the need for review of the other counts is not a pressing one since, regardless of the outcome, the prisoner will remain in jail for the same length of time under the count upheld. Rather than permit other cases to languish while careful review of these redundant counts is carried to its futile conclusion, judicial resources might be better employed by moving on to more pressing business. This is not a rule of convenience to the judge, but rather of fairness to other litigants. This is not to say, however, that the fact of conviction under the unreviewed counts could never be of importance to the prisoner. After his release it is possible they might be used against him in a recidivism prosecution, or used to impeach his testimony in a trial for another offense, to pick two obvious examples. Nevertheless, the unreviewed counts are, by hypothesis, not of immediate importance to his confinement, and our experience gives us no indication that they are frequently of such importance later that the concurrent sentence rule should not be applied. The unreviewed count is often one which, but for the concurrent sentence rule, the prisoner would have a right to challenge, either directly or on collateral attack. Arguably, to deny him that right when another man, convicted after a separate trial on each count, or sentenced consecutively, could not be denied that right under the applicable state or federal law, raises an equal protection question. But clearly so long as the denied review is of no significance to the prisoner the denial of equal protection is not invidious but only theoretical. But should a situation arise in which the convict can demonstrate that the unreviewed count is being used *800 against him, so as to work some harm to him additional to that stemming from the reviewed count, his grievance becomes real. At that point it may be that the unreviewed count may not be used against him, unless it is determined that the lack of earlier review can be cured by then supplying the convict the review to which he would earlier have been entitled but for his concurrent sentence on another count. For myself, postponed review, a question which the Court reserves {ante, at 791, n. 7), presents no insuperable difficulties. Appellate review is always conducted on a cold record, and collateral proceedings frequently deal with a stale record and stale facts. There is nothing inherently unfair in permitting the record to become colder while it is irrelevant to any human need, and other litigants’ demands are more pressing. Whether reversal on such a record, after delayed review, would permit retrial or a hearing on a claim involving, for example, a coerced confession, is yet a further question which there is no present need to address. Should a satisfactory hearing or retrial prove impossible this would be an unfortunate byproduct of an initially crowded docket. For the foregoing reasons, I agree with the Court that the concurrent sentence rule, while not of jurisdictional dimensions, should be preserved as a matter of proper judicial administration both on direct appeal and collateral attack, although at least in theory it raises a number of questions concerning the subsequent effects of the unreviewed counts. It may be that where it can be reliably predicted in a particular case that each count would entail concrete prejudicial consequences at a later date, the appellate court at the time of initial review would prefer to deal with all counts rather than to apply the concurrent sentence rule.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Since the case was brought here on a writ of certiorari limited to the “double jeopardy” question, decision of which would affect only the larceny conviction, I would dismiss the writ as improvidently granted.  II.  Having concluded that the writ should be dismissed, I would ordinarily not go further.  However, as indicated at the outset, I feel impelled to continue with *808 some observations respecting what can only be regarded as a complete overruling of one of this Court’s truly great decisions, and with an expression of my views as to how petitioner’s claim respecting his retrial for larceny should fare under the traditional due process approach.  A. I would hold, in accordance with Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 (1937), that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not take over the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth, as such.  Today Palko becomes another casualty in the so far unchecked march toward “incorporating” much, if not all, of the Federal Bill of Rights into the Due Process Clause.  This march began, with a Court majority, in 1961 when Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , was decided and, before the present decision, found its last stopping point in Duncan v. Louisiana, <citedDecision>391 U. S. 145</citedDecision> (1968), decided at the end of last Term. I have at each step in the march expressed my opposition, see, e. g., my opinions in Mapp v. Ohio, supra, at 672 (dissenting); Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 44 (1963) (concurring in result); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 14 (1964) (dissenting); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 408 (1965) (concurring in result); Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 615 (1965) (concurring); Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226 (1967) (concurring in result); and <citedDecision>Duncan</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Louisiana, supra, at 171</citedDecision> (dissenting); more particularly in the <citedDecision>Duncan</citedDecision> case 1 undertook to show that the “selective incorporation” doctrine finds no support either in history or in reason.  12 Under the pressures of the closing days of *809 the Term, I am content to rest on what I have written in prior opinions, save to raise my voice again in protest against a doctrine which so subtly, yet profoundly, is eroding many of the basics of our federal system.  More broadly, that this Court should have apparently become so impervious to the pervasive wisdom of the constitutional philosophy embodied in Palko , and that it should have felt itself able to attribute to the perceptive and timeless words of Mr. Justice Cardozo nothing more than a “watering down” of constitutional rights, are indeed revealing symbols of the extent to which we are weighing anchors from the fundamentals of our constitutional system.  B. Finally, how should the validity of petitioner’s larceny conviction be judged under Palko , that is, under due process standards?  A brief recapitulation of the facts first seems advisable.  Petitioner was indicted and tried simultaneously for burglary and larceny.  He was acquitted of larceny but convicted of burglary.

 Cf., e. g., Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40, 55-56 (1968).  See Supplementary Brief for Respondent 20, n. 6.  So far as I have been able to discover, there is no State in which petitioner’s larceny conviction could have habitual offender consequences.  See, e. g., Cichos v. Indiana, 385 U. S. 76 (1966); Hamm v. City of Rock Hill, 379 U. S. 306 (1964); Bell v. Maryland, 378 U. S. 226 (1964); Machinists v. Street, 367 U. S. 740 (1961); Rice v. Sioux City Cemetery, 349 U. S. 70 (1955).  See, e. g., United States v. Gainey, 380 U. S. 63 (1965); Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U. S. 109 (1959).  In the interest of strict accuracy, it should be pointed out that Mr. Justice Stewart cannot and does not fully join in the above sentence of this opinion.  He joined my dissenting opinion in <citedDecision>Duncan</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Louisiana, supra,</citedDecision> but wrote a separate memorandum in Mapp v. Ohio, supra, at 672 ; joined the opinion of Mr. Justice Clark in Ker v. California, supra; joined Mr. Justice White’s dissenting *809 opinion in Malloy v. Hogan, supra, at 33 ; wrote an opinion concurring in the result in Pointer v. Texas, supra, at 409 ; wrote a dissenting opinion in Griffin v. California, supra, at 617; and separately concurred in the result in Klopfer v. North Carolina, supra, at 226 .  The “double jeopardy” concept has been an established part of the English common law since at least 1700, and was contained in the constitutions or common law of many American jurisdictions prior to 1787.  See J. Sigler, Double Jeopardy 1-37 (1969); Bartkus v. Illinois, 359 U. S. 121, 151-155 (1959) (Black, J., dissenting).  See Sigler, supra, at 77-117.  In the federal realm, the Trono decision was, of course, limited to its “peculiar factual setting” by Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 197 (1957), in which I joined the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter, id., at 198 .  Mr. Justice Stewart was not a member of the Court at the time Green was decided.  Trono was the only federal decision cited by the State of Georgia in its brief in Brantley .
