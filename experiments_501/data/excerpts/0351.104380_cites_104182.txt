 If the North Carolina action had been dismissed because it was brought in one North Carolina court rather than in another, of course no federal issue would have been involved.  See, e. g., Woods v. Nierstheimer, 328 U. S. 211 .  Had that been the case, a suit for the same cause of action could have been initiated in a North Carolina federal district court, just as another suit could have been brought in the proper North Carolina State court. But that is not the present situation.  A quite different situation is before us.  Being somewhat unusual, it calls for a critical consideration of the scope and purpose of the doctrine of res judicata.  2.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina would clearly bar this suit had it been brought anew *187 in a state court. For purposes of diversity jurisdiction a federal court is, “in effect, only another court of the State.” Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 99, 108</citedDecision> ; see Traction Company v. Mining Company, 196 U. S. 239 , 253; Ex parte Schollenberger, 96 U. S. 369, 377 .  Of course, Bullington could not have succeeded in the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina after an adverse judgment in the State courts, had the decision in this case involved no federal ground.  That is equally true where a federal question was decided in the State courts.  That the adjudication of federal questions by the North Carolina Supreme Court may have been erroneous is immaterial for purposes of res judicata.  Baltimore S. S. Co. v. Phillips, 274 U. S. 316, 325 .  A higher court was available for an authoritative adjudication of the federal questions involved.  And so the question is whether federal rights were necessarily involved and adjudicated in the litigation in the State courts.

 But the very multiplicity of the constitutional questions enumerated in the Court’s opinion which were or might have been pertinent made that chance slim indeed.  What is more important is that if the j udgment had been thus reversed and remanded, it would have been *208 wiped out and he then, would have been free to dismiss the suit and start over again in the federal courts sitting in the state or in the state courts.  Bucher v. Cheshire R. R. Co., 125 U. S. 555, 578-579 .  15 On the other hand, if the case had gone against him here, then his right to start over in the federal court in North Carolina would depend upon whether one of two grounds were accepted for this Court’s decision, namely, on the one hand, that North Carolina had power to bar his substantive claim and had done so in effect though not in words, thus closing the doors of the federal court to it under the Erie rule; on the other, that the state had power to close its courts against his claim without adjudicating its substantive validity, thus leaving him free to go to the federal court under the Erie rule.  Either result was a conceivable one, depending on whether the Court should conclude that a "right without a remedy” remains a right, for this purpose, or becomes none at all. But the only chance for Bullington’s ultimate success, in the event of adverse deci *209 sion here, would have been for the decision to have turned out on the latter ground.  That chance was hardly worth the gamble.  For this Court has declared in Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 99, 108-109</citedDecision> , that a right without a remedy is no right at all for purposes of enforcement by a diversity suit in a federal court sitting in the state.  16 And the nature of the North Carolina statute as construed by the state court reaches exactly the result which the <citedDecision>York</citedDecision> case says precludes resort to the federal court on the same cause in a diversity suit.  17 Indeed this seems to be an alternative basis for the present decision.  18 Bullington’s chance to get to the federal court on such a basis was therefore practically nil.  Should he now be barred because he did not take the extremely remote chance of securing a favorable decision, reversing the state court’s judgment and forcing the state to hear his case on the merits ?  Not, I think, unless we can say he then would have been forced, if successful, to continue the litigation in the state courts and could not withdraw to start over in the North Carolina federal court. This we could not say unless we were to overrule the Bucher case, which Bullington had a right to assume we would not do.  Why he should be barred from doing now, because he did not take his almost hopeless appeal, what he would have been at liberty to do if he had taken it successfully, I am not able to understand.  No sound policy of ending litigation, conserving judicial time or litigants’ rights or in any other respect can possibly be served by *210 such a ruling.  19 Moreover, the very difficulties in his way for securing a successful determination here, which would give him some certain remedy either in the state or in the federal courts, were sufficient reason, in my opinion, to justify his foregoing that dubious procedure and starting over again in the federal court. The real trouble here is not with the law of res judicata, for that law has no valid application to these facts.  It is that the doctrine is used as an escape from facing squarely the real question presented.  This is whether North Carolina’s decision made the Erie doctrine applicable.  The Court’s opinion does state expressly that the effect of the North Carolina decision was to create a policy of the state against the validity of all claims for deficiency judgments, and comes almost but not quite to saying this requires the case to go off on application of the <citedDecision>York</citedDecision> rule.  That issue is inescapable here.  The Erie rule did not purport to change the law of federal jurisdiction in diversity cases, taking it out of the hands of Congress and the federal courts and putting it within the states’ power to determine.  It purported only to prescribe the rule federal courts should follow in applying the substantive law. If the North Carolina decision was exclusively a jurisdic *211 tiónal one, it had no effect on the power of the federal courts in that state to hear controversies excluded by it from the state courts, and the decision neither reached the merits of the controversy "in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation” nor barred Bullington from going to the federal court. See Lupton’s Sons Co. v. Automobile Club, 225 U. S. 489 .  If on the other hand the decision was in effect, although not in words, a determination of the merits in that sense, it both adjudicated Bullington’s substantive rights and barred him from maintaining the later suit successfully in the federal court. That question is here and until it is resolved he is deprived of any day in court except to go from one to another without securing decision either on the merits substantially or “on the merits” jurisdictionally.  From the Court’s opinion I cannot say whether the question has been resolved.  Its discussion of North Carolina’s “policy” and its overruling of the Lupton’s Sons case, supra, would seem to indicate that it is applying <citedDecision>York</citedDecision> , though without saying so frankly.  But, if so, why speak also of res judicata?  The law should not be made into such a merry-go-round.  Bullington is entitled to one full day in court on the substance of his claim.  This he has not had.  I hardly need add that I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Reed.  Mr. Justice Jackson joins in this opinion.

 With respect to the right of plaintiff to take a voluntary nonsuit, it stands in the same relative position which it occupied before the trial in the first instance.” Shell Petroleum Corp. v. Shore, 80 F. 2d 785, 786 .  This is the general rule.  89 A. L. R. 109; 126 A. L. R. 305.  It would seem to apply in North Carolina.  North Carolina follows both the doctrine that the trial court, upon remand by an appellate court, is to proceed as if there had been no previous trial and the doctrine that judgments not on the merits do not constitute an estoppel to subsequent actions.  Hickory v. Railroad, 138 N. C. 311, 318 ; Grimes v. Andrews, 170 N. C. 515 ; cf. Gen. Stat. N. C. (1943) § 1-25, as interpreted in Grimes v. Andrews, 170 N. C. at 522 .  The <citedDecision>York</citedDecision> case however did not purport to apply or extend the rule to a cause of action arising under and governed by the laws of another state than that in which the federal court was sitting.  But cf. Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U. S. 487 .  Except for the factor noted in note 16.  See text infra.  “The application of the principle of res judicata has not in any way been made to depend upon whether the judgment in question is subject to review in another tribunal.  Except in so far as it may affect the question of its finality, as in the case of orders on motions, the fact that a judgment may or may not be appealable should have no bearing upon its effect as res judicata.” 2 Freeman, Judgments (5th ed.) 1339.  Thus, there is no doctrine of exhaustion of judicial remedies.
