 It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.” At p. 635.  In this jealous regard for maintaining the integrity of individual rights, the Court gave life to Madison’s prediction that “independent tribunals of justice .  .  .  will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights.” I Annals of Cong. 439 (1789).  Concluding, the Court specifically referred to the use of the evidence there seized as “unconstitutional.” At p. 638.  Less than 30 years after Boyd , this Court, in Weeks v. United States, <citedDecision>232 U. S. 383</citedDecision> (1914), stated that “the Fourth Amendment .  .  .  put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints [and] .  .  .  forever secure [d] the people, their persons, houses, papers and effects against all unreasonable searches and seizures under the guise of law .  .  .  and the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon all entrusted under our Federal system with the enforcement of the laws.” At pp. 391-392.  *648 Specifically dealing with the use of the evidence unconstitutionally seized, the Court concluded: “If letters and private documents can thus be seized and held and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense, the protection of the Fourth Amendment declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures is of no value, and, so far as those thus placed are concerned, might as well be stricken from the Constitution.' The efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment, praiseworthy as they are, are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established by years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land.” At p. 393.  Finally, the Court in that case clearly stated that use of the seized evidence involved “a denial of the constitutional rights of the accused.” At p. 398.  Thus, in the year 1914, in the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> case, this Court “for the first time” held that “in a federal prosecution the Fourth Amendment barred the use of evidence secured through an illegal search and seizure.” Wolf v. Colorado, supra, at 28 .  This Court has ever since required of federal law officers a strict adherence to that command which this Court has held to be a clear, specific, and constitutionally required — even if judicially implied — deterrent safeguard without insistence upon which the Fourth Amendment would have been reduced to “a form of words.” Holmes, J., Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385, 392 (1920).  It meant, quite simply, that “conviction by means of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions .  .  .  should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts .  .  .  ,” <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 392, and that such evidence “shall not be used at all.” Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, at 392.  *649 There are in the cases of this Court some passing references to the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule as being one of evidence.  But the plain and unequivocal language of <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> — and its later paraphrase in Wolf — to the effect that the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule is of constitutional origin, remains entirely undisturbed.  In Byars v. United States, 273 U. S. 28 (1927), a unanimous Court declared that “the doctrine [cannot] ... be tolerated under our constitutional system, that evidences of crime discovered by a federal officer in making a search without lawful warrant may be used against the victim of the unlawful search where a timely challenge has been interposed.” At pp. 29-30 (emphasis added).  The Court, in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), in unmistakable language restated the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule: “The striking outcome of the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> case and those which followed it was the sweeping declaration that the Fourth Amendment, although not referring to or limiting the use of evidence in courts, really forbade its introduction if obtained by government officers through a violation of the Amendment.” At p. 462.  In McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943), we note this statement: “[A] conviction in the federal courts, the foundation of which is evidence obtained in disregard of liberties deemed fundamental by the Constitution, cannot stand.  Boyd v. United States .  .  .  <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> v. United States .... And this Court has, on Constitutional grounds, set aside convictions, both in the federal and state courts, which were based upon confessions ‘secured by protracted and repeated questioning of ignorant and untutored persons, in whose minds the power of officers was greatly mag *650 nified' ... or ‘who have been unlawfully held incommunicado without advice of friends or counsel’ .  .  .  .” At pp. 339-340.  Significantly, in McNabb , the Court did then pass on to formulate a rule of evidence, saying, “[i]n the view we take of the case, however, it becomes unnecessary to reach the Constitutional issue [for] .  .  .  [t]he principles governing the admissibility of evidence in federal criminal trials have not been restricted ... to those derived solely from the Constitution.” At pp. 340-341.  II.  In 1949, 35 years after <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> was announced, this Court, in Wolf v. Colorado, supra, again for the first time, 6 discussed the effect of the Fourth Amendment upon the States through the operation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  It said: “[W]e have no hesitation in saying that were a State affirmatively to sanction such police incursion into privacy it would run counter to the guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment.” At p. 28.  Nevertheless, after declaring that the “security of one’s privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police” is “implicit in 'the concept of ordered liberty’ and as such enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause,” cf. Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 (1937), and announcing that it “stoutly adhere [d]” to the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> decision, the Court decided that the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> exclusionary rule would not then be imposed upon the States as “an essential ingredient of the right.” 338 U. S., at 27-29 .  The Court’s reasons for not considering essential to the *651 right to privacy, as a curb imposed upon the States by the Due Process Clause, that which decades before had been posited as part and parcel of the Fourth Amendment’s limitation upon federal encroachment of individual privacy, were bottomed on factual considerations.  While they are not basically relevant to a decision that the exclusionary rule is an essential ingredient of the Fourth Amendment as the right it embodies is vouchsafed against the States by the Due Process Clause, we will consider the current validity of the factual grounds upon which Wolf was based.  The Court in Wolf first stated that “[t]he contrariety of views of the States” on the adoption of the exclusionary rule of <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> was “particularly impressive” (at p. 29) ; and, in this connection, that it could not “brush aside the experience of States which deem the incidence of such conduct by the police too slight to call for a deterrent remedy ... by overriding the [States’] relevant rules of evidence.” At pp. 31-32.  While in 1949, prior to the Wolf case, almost two-thirds of the States were opposed to the use of the exclusionary rule, now, despite the Wolf case, more than half of those since passing upon it, by their own legislative or judicial decision, have wholly or partly adopted or adhered to the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule.  See Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 , Appendix, pp. 224-232 (1960).  Significantly, among those now following the rule is California, which, according to its highest court, was “compelled to reach tha(t conclusion because other remedies have completely failed to secure compliance with the constitutional provisions .  .  .  .” People v. Cohan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445 , 282 P. 2d 905, 911 (1955).  In connection with this California case, we note that the second basis elaborated in Wolf in support of its failure to enforce the exclusionary doctrine against the States was that “other means of protection” have been afforded “the *652 right to privacy.” 7 338 U. S., at 30 .  The experience of California that such other remedies have been worthless and futile is buttressed by the experience of other States.  The obvious futility of relegating the Fourth Amendment to the protection of other remedies has, moreover, been *653 recognized by this Court since Wolf .  See Irvine v. California, 347 U. S. 128, 137 (1954).  Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the “weighty testimony” of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13 , 150 N. E. 585 (1926).  There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> exclusionary rule in New York, had said that “[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax.” 242 N. Y., at 22 , 150 N. E., at 588 .  However, the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court. These include the recent discarding of the “silver platter” doctrine which allowed federal judicial use.  of evidence seized in violation of the Constitution by state agents, Elkins v. United States, supra; the relaxation of the formerly strict requirements as to standing to challenge the use of evidence thus seized, so that now the procedure of exclusion, “ultimately referable to constitutional safeguards;” is available to anyone even “legitimately on [the] premises” unlawfully searched, Jones v. United States, 362 U. S. 257, 266-267 (1960); and, finally, the formulation of a method to prevent state use of evidence unconstitutionally seized by federal agents, Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 (1956).  Because there can be no fixed formula, we are admittedly met with “recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches,” but less is not to be expected when dealing with a Constitution, and, at any rate, “ [r] easonableness is in the first instance for the [trial court] ... to determine.” United States v. Rabinowits, 339 U. S. 56, 63 (1950).  It, therefore, plainly appears that the factual considerations supporting the failure of the Wolf Court to include the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> exclusionary rule when it recognized the enforceability of the right to privacy against the States in 1949, while not basically relevant to the constitutional consideration, could not, in any analysis, now be deemed controlling.  *654 III. Some five years after Wolf , in answer to a plea made here Term after Term that we overturn its doctrine on applicability of the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> exclusionary rule, this Court indicated that such should not be done until the States had “adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the [Weeks] rule.” Irvine v. California, supra, at 134 .  There again it was said: “Never until June of 1949 did this Court hold the basic search-and-seizure prohibition in any way applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.” Ibid. And only last Term, after again carefully re-examining the Wolf doctrine in Elkins v. United States, supra, the Court pointed out that “the controlling principles” as to search and seizure and the problem of admissibility “seemed clear” (at p. 212) until the announcement in Wolf “that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not itself require state courts to adopt the exclusionary rule” of the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> case. At p. 213.  At the same time, the Court pointed out, “the underlying constitutional doctrine which Wolf established .  .  .  that the Federal Constitution .  .  .

 .  .  .” Ibid. The Court concluded that it was therefore obliged to hold, although it chose the narrower ground on which to do so, that all evidence obtained by an unconstitutional search and seizure was inadmissible in a federal court regardless of.  its source.  Today we once again examine Wolf’s constitutional documentation of the right to privacy free from unreasonable state intrusion, and, after its dozen years on our books, are led by it to close the only *655 courtroom door remaining open to evidence secured by official lawlessness in flagrant abuse of that basic right, reserved to all persons as a specific guarantee against that very same unlawful conduct.  We hold that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, 'inadmissible in a state court. IV. Since the Fourth Amendment's right of privacy has been declared enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth, it is enforceable against them by the same sanction of exclusion as is used against the Federal Government.  Were it otherwise, then just as without the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule the assurance against unreasonable federal searches and seizures would be “a form of words,” valueless and undeserving of mention in a perpetual charter of inestimable human liberties, so too, without that rule the freedom from state invasions of privacy would be so ephemeral and so neatly severed from its conceptual nexus with the freedom from all brutish means of coercing evidence as not to merit this Court’s high regard as a freedom “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” At the time that the Court held in Wolf that the Amendment was applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause, the cases of this Court, as we have seen, had steadfastly held that as.  to federal officers the Fourth Amendment included the exclusion of the evidence seized in violation of its provisions.  Even Wolf “stoutly adhered” to that proposition.  The right to privacy, when conceded operatively enforceable against the States, was not susceptible of destruction by avulsion of the sanction upon which its protection and enjoyment had always been deemed dependent under the Boyd, Weeks and Silverthorne cases. Therefore, in extending the substantive protections of due process to all constitutionally unreasonable searches — state or federal — it was *656 logically and constitutionally necessary that the exclusion doctrine — an essential part of the right to privacy — be also insisted upon as an essential ingredient of the right newly recognized by the Wolf case. In short, the admission of the new constitutional right by Wolf could not consistently tolerate denial of its most important constitutional privilege, namely, the exclusion of the evidence which an accused had been forced to give by reason of the unlawful seizure.  To hold otherwise is to grant the right but in reality to withhold its privilege and enjoyment.  Only last year the Court itself recognized that the purpose of the exclusionary rule “is to deter — to compel respect for the constitutional guaranty in the only effectively available way — by removing the incentive to disregard it.” Elkins v. United States, supra, at 217.  Indeed, we are aware of no restraint, similar to that rejected today, conditioning the enforcement of any other basic constitutional right.

 The criminal goes free, if he must, but it is the law that sets him free. Nothing can destroy a government more quickly than its failure to observe its own laws, or worse, its disregard of the chartei of its own existence.  As Mr. Justice Brandéis, dissenting, said in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 485 (1928): “Our Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.  ... If the Government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy.” Nor can it lightly be assumed that, as a practical matter, adoption of the exclusionary rule fetters law enforcement.  Only last year this Court expressly considered that contention and found that “pragmatic evidence of a sort” to the contrary was not wanting.  Elkins v. United States, supra, at 218.  The Court noted that “The federal courts themselves have operated under the exclusionary rule of <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> for almost half a cen *660 tury; yet it has not been suggested.  either that the Federal Bureau of Investigation 10 has thereby been rendered ineffective, or that the administration of criminal justice in the federal courts has thereby been disrupted.  Moreover, the experience of the states is impressive.  .  .  .  The movement towards the rule of exclusion has been halting but seemingly inexorable.” Id., at 218-219.

As is always the case, however, state procedural requirements governing assertion and pursuance of direct and collateral constitutional challenges to criminal prosecutions must be respected.
