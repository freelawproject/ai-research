**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Stevens, with whom Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Rehnquist join, dissenting.  If the partial strike activity in this case were protected, or even arguably protected, by § 7 of the National Labor Relations Act, the Court’s conclusion would be supported by San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 .  But in Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, <citedDecision>336 U. S. 245</citedDecision> (Briggs-Strait on), the Court rejected the argument that comparable activity was protected by § 7.  And as I understand the Court’s holding today, it as *157 sumes that this activity remains unprotected.  1 Moreover, if such activity were prohibited, or arguably prohibited, by § 8 of the Act, the Court's conclusion would also be supported by Garmon .  But ever since NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , it has been clear that this activity is not even arguably prohibited.  If Congress had focused on the problems presented by partial strike activity, and had enacted special legislation dealing with this subject matter, but left the form of the activity disclosed by this record unregulated, the Court's conclusion would be supported by Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 .  But this is not such a case. Despite the numerous statements in the Court’s opinion about Congress’ intent to leave partial strike activity wholly unregulated, I have found no legislative expression of any such intent nor any evidence that Congress has scrutinized such activity.  2 *158 If this Court had previously held that the no-man’s land in which conduct is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited by federal law is nevertheless preempted by an unexpressed legislative intent, I would follow such a holding.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The concerted refusal to work overtime in this ease does not involve “concerted interference with an employer’s operations conducted by remaining on the employer’s premises.” In NLRB v. Insurance Agents, 361 U. S. 477 , the Court held that the partial strike activity in that case did not violate the union’s duty to bargain in good faith; in other words, even though the activity was not protected by § 7, it was not prohibited by § 8.  Contrary to the Court’s implication, ante, at 141, the case did not hold that the States could not prohibit such activity, but only that the NLRB had not been authorized to do so. Congress’ failure to grant power over such activity to the NLRB hardly amounts to withdrawal of the same power from the States.  The Court’s quotation, Ibid., from Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S. 181, 187 , when read in context, is nothing more than a reference to a statement in San Diego Unions v. Garmon, 359 U. S. 236 , which poses, but does not answer, the question whether pre-emption extends to activity that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.  See n. 2, supra. I cannot agree with the Court’s conclusion that the holding in Briggs-Stratton, overruled today, numbers among those that have been eroded rather than preserved.  See ante, at 151-154, and n. 12.  The decision in Insurance Agents, supra, is readily distinguishable.  See n. <citedDecision>3, supra. </citedDecision> It is true that Briggs-Stratton has been limited to its facts insofar as it sanctions judicial determination whether conduct arguably protected by § 7 or prohibited by § 8 is actually protected or prohibited.  Motor Coach Employees v. Lockridge, 403 U. S. 274, 291 ; San Diego Unions v. Garmon, supra, at 245 n. 4; see Insurance Agents, supra, at 492-494 , and nn. 22, 23.  But the rule established in Garmon , and reaffirmed in Lockridge , is fully consistent with the conclusion that the States may regulate conduct that is neither arguably protected nor arguably prohibited.
