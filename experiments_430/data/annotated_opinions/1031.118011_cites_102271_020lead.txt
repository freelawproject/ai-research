 We adhere in this case, however, not to mere obiter dicta, but rather to the well-established rationale upon which the *67 Court based the results of its earlier decisions.  When an opinion issues for the Court, it is not only the result but also those portions of the opinion necessary to that result by which we are bound.  Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 613 (1990) (exclusive basis of a judgment is not dicta) (plurality); County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 668 (1989) (“As a general rule, the principle of stare decisis directs us to adhere not only to the holdings of our prior cases, but also to their explications of the governing rules of law”) (Kennedy, J., concurring and dissenting); Sheet Metal Workers v. EEOC, 478 U. S. 421, 490 (1986) (“Although technically dicta,... an important part of the Court’s rationale for the result that it reache[s] ... is entitled to greater weight.  .  .”) (O’Connor, J., concurring).  For over a century, we have grounded our decisions in the oft-repeáted understanding of state sovereign immunity as an essential part of the Eleventh Amendment.  In Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>292 U. S. 313</citedDecision> (1934), the Court held that the Eleventh Amendment barred a suit brought against a State by a foreign state.  Chief Justice Hughes wrote for a unanimous Court: “[NJeither the literal sweep of the words of Clause one of § 2 of Article III, nor the absence of restriction in the letter of the Eleventh Amendment, permits the conclusion that in all controversies of the sort described in Clause one, and omitted from the words of the Eleventh Amendment, a State may be sued without her consent.  Thus Clause one specifically provides that the judicial Power shall extend ‘to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority.’ But, although a case may arise under the Constitution and laws of the United States, the judicial power does not extend to it if the suit is *68 sought to be prosecuted against a State, without her consent, by one of her own citizens.  .  .  .  “Manifestly, we cannot rest with a mere literal application of the words of §2 of Article III, or assume that the letter of the Eleventh Amendment exhausts the restrictions upon suits against non-consenting States.

 See, e. g., post, at 152, n. 47.  Its undocumented and highly speculative extralegal explanation of *69 the decision in Hans is a disservice to the Court’s traditional method of adjudication.  See post, at 120-123.  The dissent mischaracterizes the Hans opinion.  That decision found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental “ ‘jurisprudence in all civilized nations.’” Hans, 134 U. S., at 17 , quoting Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858); see also The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (sovereign immunity “is the general sense and the general practice of mankind”).  The dissent’s proposition that the common law of England, where adopted by the States, was open to change by the Legislature is wholly unexceptionable and largely beside the point: that common law provided the substantive rules of law rather than jurisdiction.  Cf. <citedDecision>Monaco, supra, at 323</citedDecision> (state sovereign immunity, like the requirement that there be a “justiciable” controversy, is a constitutionally grounded limit on federal jurisdiction).  It also is noteworthy that the principle of state sovereign immunity stands distinct from other principles of the common law in that only the former prompted a specific constitutional amendment.  Hans — with a much closer vantage point than the dissent — recognized that the decision in Chisholm was contrary to the well-understood meaning of the Constitution.  The dissent’s conclusion that the decision in Chisholm was “reasonable,” post, at 106, certainly would have struck the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment as quite odd: That decision created “such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted.” <citedDecision>Monaco, supra, at 325</citedDecision> .  The dissent’s lengthy analysis of the text of the Eleventh Amendment is directed at a straw man — we long have recognized that blind reliance upon the text of the Eleventh Amendment is “ ‘to strain the Constitution and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of.’ ” <citedDecision>Monaco, supra, at 326</citedDecision> , quoting Hans, supra, at 15 .  The text dealt in terms only with the problem presented by the decision in Chisholm ; in light of the fact that the federal courts did not *70 have federal-question jurisdiction at the time the Amendment was passed (and would not have it until 1875), it seems unlikely that much thought was given to the prospect of federal-question jurisdiction over the States.  That same consideration causes the dissent’s criticism of the views of Marshall, Madison, and Hamilton to ring hollow.  The dissent cites statements made by those three influential Framers, the most natural reading of which would preclude all federal jurisdiction over an unconsenting State.  12 Struggling against this reading, however, the dissent finds significant the absence of any contention that sovereign immunity would affect the new federal-question jurisdiction.  Post, at 142-150.  But the lack of any statute vesting general federal-question jurisdiction in the federal courts until much later makes the dissent’s demand for greater specificity about a then-dormant jurisdiction overly exacting.
