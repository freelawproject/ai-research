 Instead, the jury’s attention is directed to the specific circumstances of the crime: Was it committed hr the course of another capital felony?  Was it committed for money?  Was it committed upon a peace officer or judicial officer?  Was it committed in a particularly heinous way or in a manner that endangered the lives of many persons?  In addition, the jury’s attention is focused on the characteristics of the person who committed the crime: Does he have a record of prior convictions for capital offenses?  Are there any special facts about this defendant that mitigate against imposing capital punishment (e. g., his youth, the extent of his cooperation with the police, his emotional state at the time of the crime).  49 As a result, while *198 some jury discretion still exists, “the discretion to be exercised is controlled by clear and objective standards so as to produce non-discriminatory application.” Coley v. State, <citedDecision>231 Ga. 829, 834</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>204 S. E. 2d 612, 615</citedDecision> (1974).  As an important additional safeguard against arbitrariness and caprice, the Georgia statutory scheme provides for automatic appeal of all death sentences to the State’s Supreme Court. That court is required by statute to review each sentence of death and determine whether it was imposed under the influence of passion or prejudice, whether the evidence supports the jury’s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and whether the sentence is disproportionate compared to those sentences imposed in similar cases. § 27-2537 (c) (Supp. 1975).  In short, Georgia’s new sentencing procedures require as a prerequisite to the imposition of the death penalty, specific jury findings as to the circumstances of the crime or the character of the defendant.  Moreover, to guard further against a situation comparable to that presented in Furman , the Supreme Court of Georgia compares each death sentence with the sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants to ensure that the sentence of death in a particular case is not disproportionate.  On their face these procedures seem to satisfy the concerns of Furman .  No longer should there be “no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which [the death penalty] is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.” 408 U. S., at 313 (White, J., concurring).  The petitioner contends, however, that the changes in the Georgia sentencing procedures are only cosmetic, that the arbitrariness and capriciousness condemned by Furman continue to exist in Georgia — both in traditional practices that still remain and in the new sentencing procedures adopted in response to Furman .

 See, e. g., Brown v. State, 235 Ga. 644 , 220 S. E. 2d 922 (1975).  So long as the *204 evidence introduced and the arguments made at the pre-sentence hearing do not prejudice a defendant, it is preferable not to impose restrictions.  We think it desirable for the jury to have as much information before it as possible when it makes the sentencing decision.  See supra, at 189-190.  3 Finally, the Georgia statute has an additional provision designed to assure that the death penalty will not be imposed on a capriciously selected group of convicted defendants.  The new sentencing procedures require that the State Supreme Court review every death sentence to determine whether it was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, whether the evidence supports the findings of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and “[wjhether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.” § 27-2537 (c) (3) (Supp. 1975).  56 In per *205 forming its sentence-review function, the Georgia court has held that “if the death penalty is only rarely imposed for an act or it is substantially out of line with sentences imposed for other acts it will be set aside as excessive.” Coley v. State, <citedDecision>231 Ga., at 834</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>204 S. E. 2d, at 616</citedDecision> .  The court on another occasion stated that “we view it to be our duty under the similarity standard to assure that no death sentence is affirmed unless in similar cases throughout the state the death penalty has been imposed generally .  .  .  Moore v. State, 233 Ga. 861, 864 , 213 S. E. 2d 829, 832 (1975).  See also Jarrell v. State, supra, at 425, 216 S. E. 2d, at 270 (standard is whether “juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty”); Smith v. State, 236 Ga. 12, 24 , 222 S. E. 2d 308, 318 (1976) (found “a clear pattern” of jury behavior).  It is apparent that the Supreme Court of Georgia has taken its review responsibilities seriously.  In <citedDecision>Coley</citedDecision> , it held that “[t]he prior cases indicate that the past practice among juries faced with similar factual situations and like aggravating circumstances has been to impose only the sentence of life imprisonment for the offense of rape, rather than death.” <citedDecision>231 Ga., at 835</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>204 S. E. 2d, at 617</citedDecision> .  It thereupon reduced Coley's sentence from death to life imprisonment.  Similarly, although armed robbery is a capital offense under Georgia law, § 26-1902 (1972), the Georgia court concluded that the death sentences imposed in this case for that crime were “unusual in that they are rarely imposed for [armed robbery], Thus, under the test provided by statute, .  .  .  they must be considered to be excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.” 233 *206 Ga., at 127, 210 S. E. 2d, at 667 .  The court therefore vacated Gregg's death sentences for armed robbery and has followed a similar course in every other armed robbery death penalty case to come before it.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 The new Assistant to the Supreme Court is to assist the court in collecting the records of “all capital felony cases” 11 in the State of Georgia in which sentence was imposed after January 1, 1970.  §27-2537 (f) (Supp. 1975).  The court also has the obligation of determining whether the penalty was “imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.” §27-2537 (c)(1) (Supp. 1975).  The Georgia Supreme Court has interpreted the appellate review statute to require it to set aside the death sentence whenever juries across the State impose it only rarely for the type of crime in question; but to require it to affirm death sentences whenever juries across the State generally impose it for the crime in question.  *224 Thus, in this case the Georgia Supreme Court concluded that the death penalty was so rarely imposed for the crime of robbery that it set aside the sentences on the robbery counts, and effectively foreclosed that penalty from being imposed for that crime in the future under the legislative scheme now in existence.  Similarly, the Georgia Supreme Court has determined that juries impose the death sentence too rarely with respect to certain classes of rape.  Compare Coley v. State, <citedDecision>231 Ga. 829</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>204 S. E. 2d 612</citedDecision> (1974), with Coker v. State, 234 Ga. 555 , 216 S. E. 2d 782 (1975).  However, it concluded that juries “generally throughout the state” have imposed the death penalty for those who murder witnesses to armed robberies.  Jarrell v. State, 234 Ga. 410, 425 , 216 S. E. 2d 258, 270 .  (1975).  Consequently, it affirmed the sentences in this case on the murder counts.  If the Georgia Supreme Court is correct with respect to this factual judgment, imposition of the death penalty in this and similar cases is consistent with Furman .  Indeed, if the Georgia Supreme Court properly performs the task assigned to it under the Georgia statutes, death sentences imposed for discriminatory reasons or wantonly or freakishly for any given category of crime will be set aside.

 “In each of the comparison cases cited, the records show that the accused was found guilty of murder of the victim of the robbery or burglary committed in the course of such robbery or burglary.  In each of those cases, the jury imposed the sentence of death.  In Pass v. State, supra, the murder took place in the victim’s home, as occurred in the case under consideration.  “We find that the sentence of death in this case is not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the defendant.  Code Ann. § 27-2537 (c) (3).  Notwithstanding the fact that there have been cases in which robbery victims were murdered and the juries imposed life sentences (see Appendix), the cited cases show that juries faced with similar factual situations have imposed death sentences.  Compare Coley v. State, <citedDecision>231 Ga. 829, 835</citedDecision> , supra. Thus the sentence here was not ‘wantonly and freakishly imposed’ (see above).” Moore v. State, 233 Ga. 861, 865-866 , 213 S. E. 2d 829, 833 (1975).  In another case decided after the instant case the Georgia Supreme Court stated: “The cases reviewed included all murder cases coming to this court since January 1, 1970.  All kidnapping cases were likewise reviewed.  The comparison involved a search for similarities in addition to the similarity of offense charged and sentence imposed.  “All of the murder cases selected for comparison involved mur *220 ders wherein all of the witnesses were killed or an attempt was made to kill all of the witnesses, and kidnapping eases where the victim was killed or seriously injured.  “The cases indicate that, except in some special circumstance such as a juvenile or an accomplice driver of a get-away vehicle, where the murder was committed and trial held at a time when the death penalty statute was effective, juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty.  The death penalty has also been imposed when the kidnap victim has been mistreated or seriously injured.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Brennan, dissenting. * The Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause “must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” 1 The opinions of Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Powell, and Mr. Justice Stevens today hold that “evolving standards of decency” require focus not on the essence of the death penalty itself but primarily upon the procedures employed by the State to single out persons to suffer the penalty of death. Those opinions hold further that, so viewed, the Clause invalidates the mandatory infliction of the death penalty but not its infliction under sentencing procedures that Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Powell, and Mr. Justice Stevens conclude adequately safeguard against the risk that the death penalty was imposed in an arbitrary and capricious manner. In Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, 257 (1972) (concurring opinion), I read “evolving standards of decency” as requiring focus upon the essence of the death penalty itself and not primarily or solely upon the procedures *228 under which the determination to inflict the penalty upon a particular person was made. I there said: “From the beginning of our Nation, the punishment of death has stirred acute public controversy. Although pragmatic arguments for and against the punishment have been frequently advanced, this longstanding and heated controversy cannot be explained solely as the result of differences over the practical wisdom of a particular government policy. At bottom, the battle has been waged on moral grounds. The country has debated whether a society for which the dignity of the individual is the supreme value can, without a fundamental inconsistency, follow the practice of deliberately putting some of its members to death. In the United States, as in other nations of the western world, 'the struggle about this punishment has been one between ancient and deeply rooted beliefs in retribution, atonement or vengeance on the one hand, and, on the other, beliefs in the personal value and dignity of the common man that were born of the democratic movement of the eighteenth century, as well as beliefs in the scientific approach to an understanding of the motive forces of human conduct, which are the result of the growth of the sciences of behavior during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.’ It is this essentially moral conflict that forms the backdrop for the past changes in and the present operation of our system of imposing death as a punishment for crime.” Id., at 296 . 2 That continues to be my view. For the Clause forbidding cruel and unusual punishments under our con *229 stitutional system of government embodies in unique degree moral principles restraining the punishments that our civilized society may impose on those persons who transgress its laws. Thus, I too say: “For myself, I do not hesitate to assert the proposition that the only way the law has progressed from the days of the rack, the screw and the wheel is the development of moral concepts, or, as stated by the Supreme Court . . . the application of 'evolving standards of decency’ . 3 This Court inescapably has the duty, as the ultimate arbiter of the meaning of our Constitution, to say whether, when individuals condemned to death stand before our Bar, “moral concepts” require us to hold that the law has progressed to the point where we should declare that the punishment of death, like punishments on the rack, the screw, and the wheel, is no longer morally tolerable in our civilized society. 4 My opinion in Furman v. Georgia concluded that our civilization and the law had progressed to this point and that therefore the punishment of death, for whatever crime and under all circumstances, is “cruel and unusual” in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. I shall not again canvass the reasons that led to that conclusion. I emphasize only that foremost among the “moral concepts” recognized in our cases and inherent in the Clause is the primary moral principle that the State, even as it punishes, must treat its citizens in a manner consistent with their intrinsic worth as human beings — a punishment must not be so severe as to be degrading to human dignity. A judicial determina *230 tion whether the punishment of death comports with human dignity is therefore not only permitted but compelled by the Clause. 408 U. S., at 270 . I do not understand that the Court disagrees that “[i]n comparison to all other punishments today . . . the deliberate extinguishment of human life by the State is uniquely degrading to human dignity.” Id., at 291 . For three of my Brethren hold today that mandatory infliction of the death penalty constitutes the penalty cruel and unusual punishment. I perceive no principled basis for this limitation. Death for whatever crime and under all circumstances “is truly an awesome punishment. The calculated killing of a human being by the State involves, by its very nature, a denial of the executed person’s humanity. . . . An executed person has indeed 'lost the right to have rights.’ ” Id., at 290 . Death is not only an unusually severe punishment, unusual in its pain, in its finality, and in its enormity, but it serves no penal purpose more effectively than a less severe punishment; therefore the principle inherent in the Clause that prohibits pointless infliction of excessive punishment when less severe punishment can adequately achieve the same purposes invalidates the punishment. Id., at 279 . The fatal constitutional infirmity in the punishment of death is that it treats “members of the human race as nonhumans, as objects to be toyed with and discarded. [It is] thus inconsistent with the fundamental premise of the Clause that even the vilest criminal remains a human being possessed of common human dignity.” Id., at 273 . As such it is a penalty that “subjects the individual to a fate forbidden by the principle of civilized treatment guaranteed by the [Clause].” 5 I therefore would hold, *231 on that ground alone, that death is today a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Clause. “Justice of this kind is obviously no less shocking than the crime itself, and the new 'official’ murder, far from offering redress for the offense committed against society, adds instead a second defilement to the first.” 6 I dissent from the judgments in No. 7-U6257, Gregg v. Georgia , No. 75-5706, Proffitt v. Florida, and No. 75-5394, Jurek v. Texas, insofar as each upholds the death sentences challenged in those cases. I would set aside the death sentences imposed in those cases as vio-lative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. [This opinion applies also to No. 75-5706, Proffitt v.

Surely life imprisonment and, if necessary, solitary confinement would fully accomplish this purpose.
