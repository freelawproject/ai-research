<p id="b252-8">The respondent is the publisher of the only daily morning newspaper in St. Louis. The petitioner was one of some 170 independent distributors who bought copies of the paper from the respondent and sold them to householders. Each distributor had an exclusive territory subject only to the condition that his resale price not exceed a stated maximum. When the petitioner’s price did exceed that maximum, the respondent allowed and indeed actively assisted another distributor to enter the petitioner’s territory and compete with him. The Court today holds that this latter practice by the respondent subjected it to antitrust liability to the petitioner. I cannot understand why.</p>
<p id="b252-9">The case was litigated throughout by both parties upon the premise that the respondent’s granting of an exclusive territory to each distributor was a perfectly permissible practice. Upon that premise the judgment of the Court of Appeals was obviously correct. For the respondent’s conduct here was in furtherance of, not contrary to, the purposes of the antitrust laws. The petitioner was a monopolist within his own territory; he was the only person who could sell for home delivery the city’s only daily morning newspaper. But for the fact that respondent provided competition above a certain price level, the householders would have been totally without protection from the petitioner’s monopoly posi<page-number citation-index="1" label="169">*169</page-number>tion. The cases cited by the petitioner, such as <em>Kiefer-Stewart Co. </em>v. <em>Seagram &amp; Sons, </em>340 U. S. 211, and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Parke, Davis </em>&amp; <em>Co., </em>362 U. S. 29, did not involve monopoly products distributed through exclusive territories and are thus totally inapplicable here. The thrust of those decisions is that the reseller should be free to make his own independent pricing determination. But that cannot be a proper objective where the reseller is a monopolist.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To the extent that the respondent prevented the petitioner from raising his price above that which would have prevailed in a competitive market, the respondent’s actions were fully compatible with the antitrust laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b253-5">But, says the Court, the original grant of an exclusive territory to the petitioner may have itself violated the antitrust laws. Putting aside the fact that this question was not briefed or argued either here or in the court below, I fail to understand how the illegality of the petitioner’s exclusive territory could conceivably help his case. The petitioner enjoyed the benefits of his exclusive territory subject to the condition that he keep his price at or below a stated maximum. When he did charge more, the respondent took steps to force the petitioner’s price down by introducing competition into his territory. If it was illegal in the first place for the petitioner to enjoy a <em>conditional </em>monopoly, I am at a loss to under<page-number citation-index="1" label="170">*170</page-number>stand how the respondent can be liable to the petitioner for not permitting him a <em>complete </em>monopoly.</p>
<p id="b254-4">The Court in this case does more, I think, than simply depart from the rule of reason.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>221 U. S. 1. The Court today stands the Sherman Act on its head.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>

<p id="b253-7"> Because the major portion of the respondent’s income derives from advertising rather than from sales to distributors, the respondent’s self-interest is in keeping the retail price of the paper low in order to increase circulation and thereby increase advertising revenues. However, neither the petitioner nor the Court suggests that the maximum set by the respondent was less than the price that would have prevailed if there had been competition among the distributors.</p>

<p id="b254-5"> See generally Elman, “Petrified Opinions” and Competitive Realities, 66 Col. L. Rev. 625 (1966). “It should be plain why there is a real danger of the abuse of the per se principle by those predisposed to offer mechanical or dogmatic solutions to legal problems. In every antitrust case there are two routes to a finding of illegality: critically analyzing the competitive effects and possible justifications of the challenged practice; or subsuming it under one of the per se rules. The latter route is naturally the more tempting; it is easier to classify a practice in a forbidden category than to demonstrate from the ground up, as it were, why it is against public policy and should be forbidden.” <em>Id., </em>at 627.</p>
