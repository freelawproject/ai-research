 The Framers’ conception of what could properly be tried in a court-martial must have informed their understanding of what cases arise in the Armed Forces, thus permitting what would otherwise be unconstitutional infringements of Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.  The relatively recent expansion of the authority of military tribunals appears to disregard the Framers’ understanding.  Instead of acknowledging the Fifth Amendment limits on the crimes triable in a court-martial, the Court simply ignores them.  But “[t]he concept that the Bill of Rights and other constitutional protections against arbitrary government are inoperative when they become inconvenient or when expediency dictates otherwise is a very dangerous doctrine and if allowed to flourish would destroy the benefit of a written Constitution and undermine the basis of our Government.” Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 14 (1957) (plurality opin *462 ion).  The limitations may not, in the view of the majority, be desirable, but that does not mean they do not exist.  The requirement of service connection recognized in O’Callahan has a legitimate basis in constitutional language and a solid historical foundation.  It should be applied in this case. II Application of the service connection requirement of O’Callahan , as further elaborated in Relford, v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, <citedDecision>401 U. S. 355</citedDecision> (1971), demonstrates that petitioner’s Alaska crimes do not have an adequate service connection to support the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction.  Petitioner’s offenses did not detract from the performance of his military duties.  He committed these crimes while properly absent from his unit, and there was no connection between his assigned duties and his crimes.  Nor did petitioner’s crimes threaten people or areas under military control.  The crimes were committed in petitioner’s private home in the civilian community in Juneau, where there is not even a base for Coast Guard personnel.  Petitioner’s acts were not likely to go unpunished; the court-martial judge determined that the offenses were of a type traditionally prosecuted by civilian courts, that such courts were available, and that, while the Alaska courts had deferred prosecution in light of the court-martial proceeding, the State had not declined to prosecute the offenses.  Nor did the crimes implicate any authority stemming from the war power; they were committed within the territorial United States while the Nation was at peace.  Moreover, the crimes caused no measurable interference with military relationships.  Though the victims were dependents of Coast Guard members, the court-martial judge found that there was only de minimis military interaction between petitioner and the fathers of the victims, and that the relationships between petitioner and the families of the vie *463 tims “were founded primarily upon the ages and activities of the children and additionally upon common sporting interests, common spousal interest and employment and neighborly relationships,” App. to Pet. for Cert. 58a, rather than the connection of petitioner and the families through the Coast Guard.  8 Because the crimes did not take place in an area within military control or have any effect on petitioner’s military duties, their commission posed no challenge to the maintenance of order in the local command.  The military judge found that the Government had not demonstrated any impact of the offenses on “morale, discipline, [or] the reputation or the integrity of the Coast Guard in Juneau.” The only connection between the military and the offenses at issue was the fact that the victims were military dependents.  But the military judge found explicitly that the military association of petitioner and the victims’ fathers did not facilitate petitioner’s crimes, 9 and that “[t]he impact apparent in this case, that is, on the parents and the victims themselves is no different than that which would be produced by [a] civilian perpetrator.” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 57a.  The military judge, after properly reviewing the Retford, factors, concluded correctly that they did not render petition *464 er’s offenses service connected and dismissed the charges.  Engaging in what can only be describéd as impermissible appellate factfinding, 10 the Coast Guard Court of Military *465 Review reversed the dismissal.  21 M. J. 512 (1985).  It concluded that the military judge’s finding that the offenses had had no impact on morale or discipline was erroneous because the judge should have considered the effect the offenses would have had on the community in Juneau had they come to light while the victims and their families were still in Alaska, and the impact of the offenses on morale and discipline at Governors Island.  Without remanding for further factfinding, the court held that the Alaska offenses had a direct impact upon the good order, discipline, morale, and welfare of Coast Guard personnel at Governors Island.  Id., at 519 .

 Id., at 519-520 .  On the basis of these newly found facts, the Court of Military Review held petitioner’s crime sufficiently service connected to justify the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction.  Id., at 522 .  The Court of Military Appeals affirmed.  21 M. J. 251 (1986).  While conceding that its “precedents involving off-base sex offenses against civilian dependents of military personnel would point to a different conclusion,” id., at 254 , it concluded that a “recent development in our society” — specifically, an increase in concern for the victims of crimes — meant that sex offenses committed against young children of members of the military, which would have “a continuing effect on the victims and their families,” id., at 256 , sufficed to establish service connection.  The military judge’s straightforward application of O’Callahan and <citedDecision>Relford</citedDecision> was plainly correct given the facts as he found them, facts that the reviewing courts have not demonstrated to have been clearly erroneous.  The Court of Mili *466 tary Appeals’ apparent conclusion that serious or disturbing crimes committed upon military dependents sufficed to create court-martial jurisdiction ignored this Court’s prior decisions.  The majority asserts that “the service connection approach, even as elucidated in <citedDecision>Relford</citedDecision> , has proved confusing and difficult for military courts to apply.” Ante, at 448.  It is true that the test requires a careful, case-specific factual inquiry.  But this is not beyond the capacity of the military courts.  Indeed, the military judge in this case engaged in a thorough and thoughtful application of the <citedDecision>Relford</citedDecision> factors.  It should not be surprising that such determinations may at times be difficult or time consuming or require the drawing of narrow distinctions.  The trial of any person before a court-martial encompasses a deliberate decision to withhold procedural protections guaranteed by the Constitution.  Denial of these protections is a very serious matter.  The Framers declined to draw an easy line, like that established by the Court today, which would sweep an entire class of Americans beyond the reach of the Bill of Rights.  Instead, they required that the protections of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments be applied in any case not “arising in” the Armed Forces.  This requirement must not be discarded simply because it may be less expeditious than the majority deems appropriate.

 The sole question is whether the Federal Government, when it proceeded against petitioner, was obliged to provide those safeguards guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  See Grafton v. United States, 206 U. S. 333, 352-354 (1907).  The language of this exception could be understood to mean that “cases arising in the land or naval forces,” as well as in the militia, are only excepted from the requirement of grand jury indictment or presentment “in actual service in time of War or public danger.” This Court, however, has interpreted the “time of war” provision as referring only to cases arising in the militia, not the land or naval forces.  Johnson v. Sayre, 158 U. S. 109, 114 (1895).  I am not convinced this reading of the Fifth Amendment is correct, but need not rely on a different interpretation here.  “This Court has constantly reiterated that the language of the Constitution where clear and unambiguous must be given its plain evident meaning.” Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 8, n. 7 (1957) (plurality opinion).  See also Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, <citedDecision>401 U. S. 355, 362-363</citedDecision> (1971); Gosa v. Mayden, 413 U. S. 665, 672-673 (1973).  The majority contends that, before O’Callahan , this Court had held consistently that status as a member of the Armed Forces was an adequate basis for the assertion of court-martial jurisdiction.  Ante, at 439.  But a number of the precedents cited dealt with the assertion of court-martial jurisdiction over individuals who were not members of the Armed Forces and therefore, this Court ruled, did not come within the reach of Art. I, § 8, el.  14.  See Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton, 361 U. S. 234, 246-248 (1960) (military dependent in noncapital case); Reid v. Covert, supra, at 19-23 (plurality opinion) (military dependent in capital case); United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 14-15 (1955) (discharged veteran); see also Grisham v. Hagan, 361 U. S. 278 (1960) (civilian military employee in capital case); McElroy v. United States ex rel. Guagliardo, 361 U. S. 281, 286 (1960) (civilian military employee in noncapital case).  Having disposed of these cases on the threshold issue of the reach of the congressional power created by Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, the Court did not consider the limits imposed on the Article I power by the Fifth Amendment.
