Specifically, in Passage 2, the Court states, 'we reject the prior dicta regarding jury trial in criminal cases,' which implies a significant departure from the principles established in those earlier cases. Furthermore, the Court's discussion in Passage 1 about the fundamental nature of the right to a jury trial under the Fourteenth Amendment suggests that it is overruling or at least qualifying the previous interpretations of the cited case, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964), in the context of jury trials. The language used indicates that the Court is moving away from the precedent set by Malloy regarding the applicability of the right to jury trials in state courts, thus leading to the conclusion that Malloy has been overruled in this context.""

  ""rationale"": ""The excerpts indicate that the Supreme Court has effectively overruled the per se rule established in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co., 388 U.S. 365 (1967), regarding vertical restrictions on location. The majority opinion articulates a shift back to a rule-of-reason standard for evaluating such restrictions, stating that the per se rule is no longer applicable in this context. The Court acknowledges the need to examine the specifics of the challenged practices and their impact on the marketplace, which is a significant departure from the previous per se approach. Additionally, the majority opinion explicitly states that the decision is to return to the rule of reason that governed vertical restrictions prior to Schwinn. This indicates a clear overruling of the principles established in Schwinn, particularly as they relate to location restrictions, thus meeting the criteria for overruling a case. The dissenting opinions express concern about this shift, but the majority's decision reflects a definitive change in the legal standard applied to such cases.""

Specifically, in Passage 5, Justice Scalia explicitly states that today's decision requires the Court to overrule Seagram. Furthermore, the Court's analysis in Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, which is referenced multiple times, indicates that the legal underpinnings of Seagram's Commerce Clause analysis have been removed. The Court clarifies that while Seagram was not explicitly overruled in Brown-Forman, its scope was strictly limited, and the current case's ruling effectively overrules Seagram by establishing that state laws cannot regulate liquor prices in a way that has extraterritorial effects. This indicates a clear shift in legal interpretation regarding the Commerce Clause and state regulation of liquor prices, confirming that Seagram is no longer good law in this context.""
