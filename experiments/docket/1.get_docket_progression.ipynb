The jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central\\n\\nDistrict of Illinois was founded upon 18 U.S.C. § 3231. Ms. Piper pleaded guilty\\n\\nwithout a written plea agreement to count 1 of the indictment charging her with\\n\\nsexual exploitation of a child. (R.8, App. 1-6) A second count of transportation of\\n\\nchild pornography was dismissed. She was sentenced to 300 months\\n\\nimprisonment and lifetime supervised release. (App. 1-6)\\n\\n 2. The jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the\\n\\nSeventh Circuit is founded upon 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18 U.S.C. § 3742, and is\\n\\nbased upon the following particulars:\\n\\n i. Date of entry sought to be reviewed: Sentence imposed on\\n\\nNovember 15, 2012 and Judgment in a Criminal Case filed on\\n\\nNovember 19, 2012;\\n\\n ii.Filing date of motion for a new trial: N/A\\n\\n iii.

Whether any non-frivolous issues can be raised as to Ms. Piper’s sentence\\n\\nwhere her sentence was not imposed in violation of the law, was not the result of\\n\\nan incorrect application of the Guidelines, and was not otherwise unreasonable?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 3\\n\\x0c Case: 12-3705 Document: 10Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\\n\\n This is a direct appeal in a criminal case.\\n\\n Ms. Piper pleaded guilty to the indictment charging her with sexual\\n\\nexploitation of a child in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2251. She was later sentenced to\\n\\n300 months imprisonment and lifetime supervised release. (App. 1-6)\\n\\nNotice of appeal was timely filed on November 28, 2012. (R. 22)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 10 Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\\n\\n Ms. Piper was charged by way of indictment with sexual exploitation of a\\n\\nchild and transportation of child pornography. (R. 8) The latter count was\\n\\ndismissed when she entered an open plea to the charge of sexual exploitation of a\\n\\nchild. (T. 2)\\n\\n Ms. Piper produced multiple images and a live web cam stream of herself\\n\\nengaging in sexually explicit acts with her then 11 year old daughter in their\\n\\nhome in Peoria, Illinois. The web camera stream was sent over the internet to a\\n\\nman in New York. Those acts included Ms. Piper performing oral sex on her\\n\\ndaughter and the daughter performing oral sex on her mother. Also, Ms. Piper\\n\\nrecorded her daughter engaging in sexually explicit poses. The recorded images,\\n\\nas opposed to the web cam stream, were emailed to this man in New York. Ms.\\n\\nPiper hoped to travel to New York to meet the man in person, but the meeting\\n\\nnever occurred. (T. 8-10)\\n\\n Later, some of the images were found in the possession of an unrelated\\n\\nperson in the state of Oregon. Investigators were able to establish probable cause\\n\\nto believe the images originated in Ms. Piper’s home. A search warrant was\\n\\nobtained and Ms. Piper eventually confessed that she was the person who\\n\\nproduced the images. (T. 8)\\n\\n Ms. Piper entered an open plea of guilty to the charge of sexual\\n\\nexploitation of a child. The advisory guideline range was calculated to be the\\n\\n 5\\n\\x0c Case: 12-3705Document: 10 Filed: 04/25/2013Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nstatutory maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment, although the range\\n\\nwould have been life imprisonment but for the statutory cap. This was based\\n\\nupon the following calculations: 32 (base offense level) + 4 (images of a minor\\n\\nwho had not attained the age of 12) + 2 (the offense involved the commission of a\\n\\nsex act or sexual contact) + 2 (distribution of the images to another) + 2 (Ms. Piper\\n\\nwas the parent of the minor) + 5 (the offense of conviction was a covered sex\\n\\ncrime and she engaged in a pattern of activity involving two or more acts of\\n\\nprohibited sexual conduct.)47. Ms. Piper received a 3 level reduction for\\n\\ntimely acceptance of responsibility for her actions, resulting in a total offense\\n\\nlevel of 44. At a criminal history category I, the above advisory range was set.\\n\\n(PSR. 8-9, 14) Ms. Piper did not raise an objection to the guideline calculations. (S.\\n\\n2)\\n\\nAt sentencing the Government stressed the fact that Ms. Piper committed\\n\\nan incestuous, hands-on sexual assault of her own daughter, for her own sexual\\n\\ngratification and the gratification of a man she had met on the internet. (S. 8-10)\\n\\nThe Government recommended the statutory maximum sentence of 360 months.\\n\\n(S. 15)\\n\\nMs. Piper recommended the statutory minimum sentence of 180 months,\\n\\nstressing the short duration of the offense, the fact that some sort of\\n\\nunderstanding had been reached between Ms. Piper and her daughter as\\n\\nevidenced by the daughter’s victim impact statement, and the lack of any\\n\\n 6\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 10 Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\ncriminal history on Ms. Piper’s part. (S. 16-7) Ms. Piper also cited her life-long\\n\\ndepression as a factor to be considered. (S. 18-20) Ms. Piper also noted the history\\n\\nof the child pornography sentencing guidelines, and the steady escalation in\\n\\npenalties over the years. (S. 20-25) Particularly, Ms. Piper pointed out that\\n\\nCongress amended the guidelines directly in 2003 to change the five level\\n\\nenhancement imposed for engaging in a pattern of activity involving sexual\\n\\nactivity with minors. Prior to 2003 the definition of pattern of activity required\\n\\ntwo or more victims, but this was changed to require only two or more instances.\\n\\n(S. 23) Ms. Piper argued that her advisory guideline range would have been 262-\\n\\n327 months without the five level pattern of activity enhancement. (S. 23)\\n\\nThe district court did not specifically comment on this last argument,\\n\\npointing instead to the short duration of the offense and the fact that Ms. Piper\\n\\nsought therapy and refrained from committing any more offenses with her\\n\\ndaughter for a five year period:\\n\\n\\nTHE COURT: Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Piper. All right. The Court\\nhaving considered the Presentence Report as prepared by probation\\nwhich includes the sentencing guideline calculations, the arguments\\nof counsel, the statement of Miss Piper, the victim statement by Miss\\nPiper\\'s daughter, factors as set forth in 3553 which have been recited\\nhere by both sides, the nature and circumstances of the offense,\\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the\\nsentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for\\nthe law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence to\\ncriminal conduct, protect the public from further crimes of the\\ndefendant and provide the defendant with educational or vocational\\ntraining, medical care or other correctional treatment in a most\\n\\n7\\n\\x0c Case: 12-3705 Document: 10 Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\neffective manner; I believe the following sentence is sufficient but\\nnot greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of the Act:\\nThere is a lot to be said, and, but, frankly, I don\\'t think much more\\nneeds to be said. It would be easy to be angry over these facts. It\\nwould be easy to lecture but truly these facts are too sad for that.\\nMiss Piper, your 16-year-old daughter has shown more respect for\\nyou than you showed for her. She even asks for a minimum sentence\\nfor you. Frankly, if I thought a minimum sentence would be helpful\\nto your daughter then I would consider it for she has been through a\\nnightmare that may never end. You, in effect by your actions, have\\nsentenced your daughter to a life sentence of her own. A life\\nsentence on the internet exposed to all of the perverts, perpetrators,\\nand pedophiles that are lurking there to satisfy themselves at the\\nexpense of minor children. I can\\'t help but wonder what sentence\\nyou would impose on someone if someone else had done this to\\nyour daughter. Now having said that though, I understand the\\ncomments of Mr. Alvarado, the offense was during a very short a\\nshort period of time. The last five years somehow the two of you\\nlived together without any hands-on exploitation. Apparently, the\\nletter from your husband detailing your mental health issues and the\\nletter from your daughter expressing concern for you, and the fact\\nthat you went into therapy before your arrest, I guess is another\\nfactor that can be considered. So, when I consider all of those and try\\nto balance out of this, it will be a sentence under the maximum 360\\nmonths. It will be a sentence to 300 months in the Bureau of Prisons.\\nAnd that will be followed by a life term of supervised release. (S. 29-\\n31)\\n\\n\\nThe district court also imposed a term of lifetime supervised release with\\n\\ncertain special conditions. (S. 31-2) This appeal followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705Document: 10Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\\n\\n No non-frivolous issues can be raised regarding Ms. Piper’s adjudication of\\n\\nguilt. Her unconditional plea of guilty waived all non-jurisdictional defects to\\n\\nthe determination of her guilt. Moreover, because she failed to move to\\n\\nwithdraw her plea in the district court and does not seek to challenge the plea in\\n\\nthis appeal , no other issues are presented by the adjudication of Ms. Piper’s\\n\\nguilt.\\n\\n Furthermore, no non-frivolous issues can be raised regarding Ms. Piper’s\\n\\nsentence. Because the district court correctly calculated the advisory guideline\\n\\nand thoroughly considered the factors raised in mitigation, a sentence of 300\\n\\nmonths imprisonment, which was 60 months below the statutory maximum\\n\\nsentence and below the otherwise applicable advisory guideline range of life\\n\\nimprisonment, cannot be said to be unreasonable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 10Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nARGUMENT\\n\\nI.Any argument challenging Ms. Piper’s conviction would be frivolous\\nwhere she entered into an unconditional, knowing, and voluntary plea\\nof guilty, did not seek to withdraw the plea in the district court, and does\\nnot seek to challenge the plea on appeal.\\n\\nA. Introduction.\\n\\nIn United States v. Knox, this Court noted that where a defendant does not\\n\\nmove to withdraw a guilty plea in the district court, counsel need not address the\\n\\nvoluntariness of the plea in an Anders brief if, after consultation with the\\n\\ndefendant and advisement of any risks associated with the withdrawal of the\\n\\nplea, the defendant indicates that he does not wish to challenge his plea on\\n\\nappeal. United States v. Knox, 287 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir. 2002). Following this\\n\\ncourt’s direction, counsel communicated with Ms. Piper to determine whether\\n\\nshe wished to seek a withdrawal of her guilty plea. She did not.\\n\\nB. Standard of review.\\n\\nThe standard of review applicable to whether a guilty plea is knowing and\\n\\nvoluntary is “whether, looking at the totality of the circumstances surrounding\\n\\nthe plea, the defendant was informed of his or her rights.” United States v.\\n\\nMitchell, 58 F.3d 1221, 1224 (7th Cir. 1995). In the present case, however, because\\n\\nMs. Piper failed to move to withdraw her guilty plea in the district court below,\\n\\nthis Court’s review is limited to determining whether “plain error” occurred.\\n\\nUnited States v. Driver, 242 F.3d 767, 769 (7th Cir. 2001).\\n\\n\\n 10\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705Document: 10 Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nII.Any argument challenging Ms. Piper’s sentence would be frivolous\\n where her sentence was not imposed in violation of the law, was not the\\n result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines, and was not\\n otherwise unreasonable.\\n\\n A.Standard of review.\\n\\n This Court reviews preserved challenges to the application of the\\n\\nGuidelines for clear error, and interpretations of the Guidelines de novo. United\\n\\nStates v. Cobblah, 118 F.3d 549, 550 (7th Cir. 1997). For challenges not made in the\\n\\ndistrict court, the applicable standard of review depends upon whether the\\n\\nfailure to raise the issue constituted a waiver or a forfeiture. United States v.\\n\\nStaples, 202 F.3d 992, 995 (7th Cir. 2000). Where waiver is accomplished by intent,\\n\\nforfeiture comes about through neglect. Staples, 202 F.3d at 995. Waiver\\n\\nextinguishes the error and precludes appellate review, but forfeiture, instead of\\n\\nprecluding all appellate review, permits plain error review. Staples, 202 F.3d at\\n\\n995. For a forfeited issue, therefore, there must be an “error” that is “plain” and\\n\\nthat “affect[s] substantial rights.” United States v. Perry, 223 F.3d 431, 433 (7th Cir.\\n\\n2000).\\n\\n With regard to downward deviations, the Supreme Court’s decision in\\n\\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 260-63 (2005), requires an appellate court to\\n\\nreview a district court’s sentence for reasonableness. On appeal, this court may,\\n\\nbut is not required, to apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence\\n\\nimposed within the advisory Guideline range. Gall v. United States, 128 S.Ct. 586,\\n\\n\\n 11\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 10 Filed: 04/25/2013Pages: 36\\n\\n\\n597 (2007).\\n\\n B. Argument.\\n\\n Ms. Piper’s sentencing profile, as set forth in the presentence report,\\n\\nestablished a statutory imprisonment range of 15 to 30 years. The advisory\\n\\nguideline range was calculated to be life imprisonment but because the statutory\\n\\nmaximum sentence was 30 years, the applicable advisory guideline range became\\n\\n360 months. The advisory guideline application included every enhancement\\n\\nthat could be applied under U.S.S.G. § 2G.2.1, including a five level enhancement\\n\\nfor engaging in a pattern of activity involving two or more acts of prohibited\\n\\nsexual conduct. All of the enhancements constituted a simple application of the\\n\\nguidelines to the facts admitted and were established by the evidence. There are\\n\\nno arguably non-frivolous issues regarding the application of the guideline\\n\\nprovisions and the sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum under the\\n\\nlaw.\\n\\n This leaves only the question of whether Ms. Piper’s sentence of 300\\n\\nmonths imprisonment was otherwise unreasonable. Her sentence was 60 months\\n\\nbelow the statutory maximum sentence of 360 months and of course below the\\n\\nother wise applicable range of life imprisonment. The district court balanced the\\n\\nseriousness of the offense against the relatively short duration of the crime and\\n\\nthe fact that Ms. Piper voluntarily sought therapy and refrained from any further\\n\\nexploitation of her daughter for a five year period.\\n\\n12\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 10Filed: 04/25/2013Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nA below guideline sentence, or one within the guidelines, is presumed\\n\\nreasonable on appeal. Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 347 (2007); United States v.\\n\\nVallone, 698 F.3d 416, 488 (7th Cir. 2012). And Ms. Piper bears a heavy burden to\\n\\nshow that such a sentence would be unreasonable. United States v. Lemke, 693\\n\\nF.3d 731, 733-4 (7th Cir. 2012); United States v. Tahzib, 513 F.3d 692, 695 (7th Cir.\\n\\n2008)(Noting that a below guideline sentence will almost never be unreasonable.)\\n\\nSee also, United States v. Klug, 670 F.3d 797, 800 (7th Cir. 2012)(Noting that a\\n\\nguideline range of life effectively makes any sentence to a term of imprisonment\\n\\npresumptively reasonable).\\n\\nThe district court did not, however, specifically address Ms. Piper’s\\n\\nargument that the court should vary from the advisory guideline range on the\\n\\nground that the five level enhancement for engaging in a pattern of sexual\\n\\nconduct involving a minor – enacted by Congress directly in 2003 –violated the\\n\\nnotion that the Sentencing Commission be entrusted with implementing\\n\\nguideline changes after careful, empirical study justifying the need for such\\n\\nchanges. Ms. Piper urged the court to consider that without such an\\n\\nenhancement, the applicable guideline range would have been 262-327 months.\\n\\nWithout stating its consideration of that point though, the district court did\\n\\nimpose a sentence within the range suggested without the enhancement. And\\n\\nwhether the district court consciously imposed a sentence within that lower\\n\\nadvisory range or not, the district court was not required to reject every\\n\\n13\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 10 Filed: 04/25/2013Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nargument raised at sentencing or give each aggravating and mitigating factor\\n\\nequal weight. United States v. Busara, 551 F.3d 669, 674 (7th Cir. 2008) (noting\\n\\ndistrict court’s discretion to assign different weights to § 3553(a) factors and\\n\\naffirming sentence based on conclusion that seriousness of offense outweighed\\n\\nmitigating factors).

The jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Central\\n\\nDistrict of Illinois was founded upon 18 U.S.C. § 3231. Ms. Piper pleaded guilty\\n\\nwithout a written plea agreement to count 1 of the indictment charging her with\\n\\nsexual exploitation of a child. (R.8, App. 1-6) A second count of transportation of\\n\\nchild pornography was dismissed. She was sentenced to 300 months\\n\\nimprisonment and lifetime supervised release. (App. 1-6)\\n\\n 2. The jurisdiction of the United States Court of Appeals for the\\n\\nSeventh Circuit is founded upon 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and 18 U.S.C. § 3742, and is\\n\\nbased upon the following particulars:\\n\\n i. Date of entry sought to be reviewed: Sentence imposed on\\n\\nNovember 15, 2012 and Judgment in a Criminal Case filed on\\n\\nNovember 19, 2012;\\n\\n ii.Filing date of motion for a new trial: N/A\\n\\n iii.

Whether any non-frivolous issues can be raised as to Ms. Piper’s sentence\\n\\nwhere her sentence was not imposed in violation of the law, was not the result of\\n\\nan incorrect application of the Guidelines, and was not otherwise unreasonable?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n 3\\n\\x0c Case: 12-3705 Document: 11Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\\n\\n This is a direct appeal in a criminal case.\\n\\n Ms. Piper pleaded guilty to the indictment charging her with sexual\\n\\nexploitation of a child in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2251. She was later sentenced to\\n\\n300 months imprisonment and lifetime supervised release. (App. 1-6)\\n\\nNotice of appeal was timely filed on November 28, 2012. (R. 22)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 11 Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nSTATEMENT OF FACTS\\n\\n Ms. Piper was charged by way of indictment with sexual exploitation of a\\n\\nchild and transportation of child pornography. (R. 8) The latter count was\\n\\ndismissed when she entered an open plea to the charge of sexual exploitation of a\\n\\nchild. (T. 2)\\n\\n Ms. Piper produced multiple images and a live web cam stream of herself\\n\\nengaging in sexually explicit acts with her then 11 year old daughter in their\\n\\nhome in Peoria, Illinois. The web camera stream was sent over the internet to a\\n\\nman in New York. Those acts included Ms. Piper performing oral sex on her\\n\\ndaughter and the daughter performing oral sex on her mother. Also, Ms. Piper\\n\\nrecorded her daughter engaging in sexually explicit poses. The recorded images,\\n\\nas opposed to the web cam stream, were emailed to this man in New York. Ms.\\n\\nPiper hoped to travel to New York to meet the man in person, but the meeting\\n\\nnever occurred. (T. 8-10)\\n\\n Later, some of the images were found in the possession of an unrelated\\n\\nperson in the state of Oregon. Investigators were able to establish probable cause\\n\\nto believe the images originated in Ms. Piper’s home. A search warrant was\\n\\nobtained and Ms. Piper eventually confessed that she was the person who\\n\\nproduced the images. (T. 8)\\n\\n Ms. Piper entered an open plea of guilty to the charge of sexual\\n\\nexploitation of a child. The advisory guideline range was calculated to be the\\n\\n 5\\n\\x0c Case: 12-3705Document: 11 Filed: 04/25/2013Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nstatutory maximum sentence of 30 years imprisonment, although the range\\n\\nwould have been life imprisonment but for the statutory cap. This was based\\n\\nupon the following calculations: 32 (base offense level) + 4 (images of a minor\\n\\nwho had not attained the age of 12) + 2 (the offense involved the commission of a\\n\\nsex act or sexual contact) + 2 (distribution of the images to another) + 2 (Ms. Piper\\n\\nwas the parent of the minor) + 5 (the offense of conviction was a covered sex\\n\\ncrime and she engaged in a pattern of activity involving two or more acts of\\n\\nprohibited sexual conduct.)47. Ms. Piper received a 3 level reduction for\\n\\ntimely acceptance of responsibility for her actions, resulting in a total offense\\n\\nlevel of 44. At a criminal history category I, the above advisory range was set.\\n\\n(PSR. 8-9, 14) Ms. Piper did not raise an objection to the guideline calculations. (S.\\n\\n2)\\n\\nAt sentencing the Government stressed the fact that Ms. Piper committed\\n\\nan incestuous, hands-on sexual assault of her own daughter, for her own sexual\\n\\ngratification and the gratification of a man she had met on the internet. (S. 8-10)\\n\\nThe Government recommended the statutory maximum sentence of 360 months.\\n\\n(S. 15)\\n\\nMs. Piper recommended the statutory minimum sentence of 180 months,\\n\\nstressing the short duration of the offense, the fact that some sort of\\n\\nunderstanding had been reached between Ms. Piper and her daughter as\\n\\nevidenced by the daughter’s victim impact statement, and the lack of any\\n\\n 6\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 11 Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\ncriminal history on Ms. Piper’s part. (S. 16-7) Ms. Piper also cited her life-long\\n\\ndepression as a factor to be considered. (S. 18-20) Ms. Piper also noted the history\\n\\nof the child pornography sentencing guidelines, and the steady escalation in\\n\\npenalties over the years. (S. 20-25) Particularly, Ms. Piper pointed out that\\n\\nCongress amended the guidelines directly in 2003 to change the five level\\n\\nenhancement imposed for engaging in a pattern of activity involving sexual\\n\\nactivity with minors. Prior to 2003 the definition of pattern of activity required\\n\\ntwo or more victims, but this was changed to require only two or more instances.\\n\\n(S. 23) Ms. Piper argued that her advisory guideline range would have been 262-\\n\\n327 months without the five level pattern of activity enhancement. (S. 23)\\n\\nThe district court did not specifically comment on this last argument,\\n\\npointing instead to the short duration of the offense and the fact that Ms. Piper\\n\\nsought therapy and refrained from committing any more offenses with her\\n\\ndaughter for a five year period:\\n\\n\\nTHE COURT: Okay. Thank you, Mrs. Piper. All right. The Court\\nhaving considered the Presentence Report as prepared by probation\\nwhich includes the sentencing guideline calculations, the arguments\\nof counsel, the statement of Miss Piper, the victim statement by Miss\\nPiper\\'s daughter, factors as set forth in 3553 which have been recited\\nhere by both sides, the nature and circumstances of the offense,\\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant, the need for the\\nsentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for\\nthe law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence to\\ncriminal conduct, protect the public from further crimes of the\\ndefendant and provide the defendant with educational or vocational\\ntraining, medical care or other correctional treatment in a most\\n\\n7\\n\\x0c Case: 12-3705 Document: 11 Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\neffective manner; I believe the following sentence is sufficient but\\nnot greater than necessary to comply with the purposes of the Act:\\nThere is a lot to be said, and, but, frankly, I don\\'t think much more\\nneeds to be said. It would be easy to be angry over these facts. It\\nwould be easy to lecture but truly these facts are too sad for that.\\nMiss Piper, your 16-year-old daughter has shown more respect for\\nyou than you showed for her. She even asks for a minimum sentence\\nfor you. Frankly, if I thought a minimum sentence would be helpful\\nto your daughter then I would consider it for she has been through a\\nnightmare that may never end. You, in effect by your actions, have\\nsentenced your daughter to a life sentence of her own. A life\\nsentence on the internet exposed to all of the perverts, perpetrators,\\nand pedophiles that are lurking there to satisfy themselves at the\\nexpense of minor children. I can\\'t help but wonder what sentence\\nyou would impose on someone if someone else had done this to\\nyour daughter. Now having said that though, I understand the\\ncomments of Mr. Alvarado, the offense was during a very short a\\nshort period of time. The last five years somehow the two of you\\nlived together without any hands-on exploitation. Apparently, the\\nletter from your husband detailing your mental health issues and the\\nletter from your daughter expressing concern for you, and the fact\\nthat you went into therapy before your arrest, I guess is another\\nfactor that can be considered. So, when I consider all of those and try\\nto balance out of this, it will be a sentence under the maximum 360\\nmonths. It will be a sentence to 300 months in the Bureau of Prisons.\\nAnd that will be followed by a life term of supervised release. (S. 29-\\n31)\\n\\n\\nThe district court also imposed a term of lifetime supervised release with\\n\\ncertain special conditions. (S. 31-2) This appeal followed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705Document: 11Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\\n\\n No non-frivolous issues can be raised regarding Ms. Piper’s adjudication of\\n\\nguilt. Her unconditional plea of guilty waived all non-jurisdictional defects to\\n\\nthe determination of her guilt. Moreover, because she failed to move to\\n\\nwithdraw her plea in the district court and does not seek to challenge the plea in\\n\\nthis appeal , no other issues are presented by the adjudication of Ms. Piper’s\\n\\nguilt.\\n\\n Furthermore, no non-frivolous issues can be raised regarding Ms. Piper’s\\n\\nsentence. Because the district court correctly calculated the advisory guideline\\n\\nand thoroughly considered the factors raised in mitigation, a sentence of 300\\n\\nmonths imprisonment, which was 60 months below the statutory maximum\\n\\nsentence and below the otherwise applicable advisory guideline range of life\\n\\nimprisonment, cannot be said to be unreasonable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 11Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nARGUMENT\\n\\nI.Any argument challenging Ms. Piper’s conviction would be frivolous\\nwhere she entered into an unconditional, knowing, and voluntary plea\\nof guilty, did not seek to withdraw the plea in the district court, and does\\nnot seek to challenge the plea on appeal.\\n\\nA. Introduction.\\n\\nIn United States v. Knox, this Court noted that where a defendant does not\\n\\nmove to withdraw a guilty plea in the district court, counsel need not address the\\n\\nvoluntariness of the plea in an Anders brief if, after consultation with the\\n\\ndefendant and advisement of any risks associated with the withdrawal of the\\n\\nplea, the defendant indicates that he does not wish to challenge his plea on\\n\\nappeal. United States v. Knox, 287 F.3d 667, 671 (7th Cir. 2002). Following this\\n\\ncourt’s direction, counsel communicated with Ms. Piper to determine whether\\n\\nshe wished to seek a withdrawal of her guilty plea. She did not.\\n\\nB. Standard of review.\\n\\nThe standard of review applicable to whether a guilty plea is knowing and\\n\\nvoluntary is “whether, looking at the totality of the circumstances surrounding\\n\\nthe plea, the defendant was informed of his or her rights.” United States v.\\n\\nMitchell, 58 F.3d 1221, 1224 (7th Cir. 1995). In the present case, however, because\\n\\nMs. Piper failed to move to withdraw her guilty plea in the district court below,\\n\\nthis Court’s review is limited to determining whether “plain error” occurred.\\n\\nUnited States v. Driver, 242 F.3d 767, 769 (7th Cir. 2001).\\n\\n\\n 10\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705Document: 11 Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nII.Any argument challenging Ms. Piper’s sentence would be frivolous\\n where her sentence was not imposed in violation of the law, was not the\\n result of an incorrect application of the Guidelines, and was not\\n otherwise unreasonable.\\n\\n A.Standard of review.\\n\\n This Court reviews preserved challenges to the application of the\\n\\nGuidelines for clear error, and interpretations of the Guidelines de novo. United\\n\\nStates v. Cobblah, 118 F.3d 549, 550 (7th Cir. 1997). For challenges not made in the\\n\\ndistrict court, the applicable standard of review depends upon whether the\\n\\nfailure to raise the issue constituted a waiver or a forfeiture. United States v.\\n\\nStaples, 202 F.3d 992, 995 (7th Cir. 2000). Where waiver is accomplished by intent,\\n\\nforfeiture comes about through neglect. Staples, 202 F.3d at 995. Waiver\\n\\nextinguishes the error and precludes appellate review, but forfeiture, instead of\\n\\nprecluding all appellate review, permits plain error review. Staples, 202 F.3d at\\n\\n995. For a forfeited issue, therefore, there must be an “error” that is “plain” and\\n\\nthat “affect[s] substantial rights.” United States v. Perry, 223 F.3d 431, 433 (7th Cir.\\n\\n2000).\\n\\n With regard to downward deviations, the Supreme Court’s decision in\\n\\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 260-63 (2005), requires an appellate court to\\n\\nreview a district court’s sentence for reasonableness. On appeal, this court may,\\n\\nbut is not required, to apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence\\n\\nimposed within the advisory Guideline range. Gall v. United States, 128 S.Ct. 586,\\n\\n\\n 11\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 11 Filed: 04/25/2013Pages: 36\\n\\n\\n597 (2007).\\n\\n B. Argument.\\n\\n Ms. Piper’s sentencing profile, as set forth in the presentence report,\\n\\nestablished a statutory imprisonment range of 15 to 30 years. The advisory\\n\\nguideline range was calculated to be life imprisonment but because the statutory\\n\\nmaximum sentence was 30 years, the applicable advisory guideline range became\\n\\n360 months. The advisory guideline application included every enhancement\\n\\nthat could be applied under U.S.S.G. § 2G.2.1, including a five level enhancement\\n\\nfor engaging in a pattern of activity involving two or more acts of prohibited\\n\\nsexual conduct. All of the enhancements constituted a simple application of the\\n\\nguidelines to the facts admitted and were established by the evidence. There are\\n\\nno arguably non-frivolous issues regarding the application of the guideline\\n\\nprovisions and the sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum under the\\n\\nlaw.\\n\\n This leaves only the question of whether Ms. Piper’s sentence of 300\\n\\nmonths imprisonment was otherwise unreasonable. Her sentence was 60 months\\n\\nbelow the statutory maximum sentence of 360 months and of course below the\\n\\nother wise applicable range of life imprisonment. The district court balanced the\\n\\nseriousness of the offense against the relatively short duration of the crime and\\n\\nthe fact that Ms. Piper voluntarily sought therapy and refrained from any further\\n\\nexploitation of her daughter for a five year period.\\n\\n12\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 11Filed: 04/25/2013Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nA below guideline sentence, or one within the guidelines, is presumed\\n\\nreasonable on appeal. Rita v. United States, 551 U.S. 338, 347 (2007); United States v.\\n\\nVallone, 698 F.3d 416, 488 (7th Cir. 2012). And Ms. Piper bears a heavy burden to\\n\\nshow that such a sentence would be unreasonable. United States v. Lemke, 693\\n\\nF.3d 731, 733-4 (7th Cir. 2012); United States v. Tahzib, 513 F.3d 692, 695 (7th Cir.\\n\\n2008)(Noting that a below guideline sentence will almost never be unreasonable.)\\n\\nSee also, United States v. Klug, 670 F.3d 797, 800 (7th Cir. 2012)(Noting that a\\n\\nguideline range of life effectively makes any sentence to a term of imprisonment\\n\\npresumptively reasonable).\\n\\nThe district court did not, however, specifically address Ms. Piper’s\\n\\nargument that the court should vary from the advisory guideline range on the\\n\\nground that the five level enhancement for engaging in a pattern of sexual\\n\\nconduct involving a minor – enacted by Congress directly in 2003 –violated the\\n\\nnotion that the Sentencing Commission be entrusted with implementing\\n\\nguideline changes after careful, empirical study justifying the need for such\\n\\nchanges. Ms. Piper urged the court to consider that without such an\\n\\nenhancement, the applicable guideline range would have been 262-327 months.\\n\\nWithout stating its consideration of that point though, the district court did\\n\\nimpose a sentence within the range suggested without the enhancement. And\\n\\nwhether the district court consciously imposed a sentence within that lower\\n\\nadvisory range or not, the district court was not required to reject every\\n\\n13\\n\\x0cCase: 12-3705 Document: 11 Filed: 04/25/2013Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nargument raised at sentencing or give each aggravating and mitigating factor\\n\\nequal weight. United States v. Busara, 551 F.3d 669, 674 (7th Cir. 2008) (noting\\n\\ndistrict court’s discretion to assign different weights to § 3553(a) factors and\\n\\naffirming sentence based on conclusion that seriousness of offense outweighed\\n\\nmitigating factors). Obviously, the district court was aware of its discretion to\\n\\nimpose a sentence below the advisory guidelines since it did so in this case.\\n\\nBecause there are no other arguable grounds that her sentence was\\n\\nimposed in violation of the law or that the sentence was otherwise unreasonable,\\n\\nthere are no non-frivolous issues concerning Ms. Piper’s sentence that can be\\n\\nraised in this appeal.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\x0c Case: 12-3705Document: 11Filed: 04/25/2013 Pages: 36\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFor the reasons stated herein, undersigned counsel respectfully prays that\\n\\nthis Honorable Court allow the Defendant-Appellant’s counsel to withdraw.\\n\\n\\n Respectfully submitted,\\n\\n JONATHAN E.
