**Dissenting Opinion**
 In 1889, Mr. Justice Miller, ■ a member of the Court since 1862, said: 9 “The Constitution of the United States has placed several limitations upon the general power [of taxation], and .  .  .  some of them are implied.  One of its provisions is that' neither the President of the United States (Art. II, sec. 1, par 6), nor a judge of the Supreme or inferior courts (Art III, sec. 1), shall have his salary diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, or during his continuance in office.  It is very clear that *290 when Congress, during the late [Civil] war, levied an income tax, and placed it as well- upon the salaries of the President and the judges of the courts as those of other people, that it was a diminution of them to just that extent.” Although the Income Tax Act of 1894 said nothing about the compensation of the judges, Mr. Justice Field construed § 33 10 to tax that compensation and assigned that ground among others for joining in the decision that the Act was unconstitutional.  Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., <citedDecision>157 U. S. 429, 604-606</citedDecision> .  Mr. Justice Field, who was confirmed the day this Court ordered Chief Justice Taney’s letter entered on its records, had taken his place upon this bench at the beginning of the following term. His opinion recited the facts of that incident and quoted extensively from the letter, which was printed as an appendix to the volume of the reports containing the opinions in the <citedDecision>Pollock</citedDecision> case. 157 U. S. 701 .  The Justice ended his discussion of the matter by stating his belief, based on information, that the opinion of Attorney General Hoar had been followed ever since without question by the Treasury.  And, upon reargument of the cause, Attorney General Olney said in his brief: “There has never been a doubt since the opinion of Attorney General Hoar that the salaries of the President and judges were exempt.” The Revenue Acts of 1913 11 and 1916, 12 being the first two after adoption of ■ the Sixteenth Amendment, ex *291 pressly.  excluded from gross income the compensation of judges then in office.  But after this country engaged in the World War, the Revenue Act of 1918, approved February 24, 1919, defined gross income to include “in the case of the President .  .  .

 [Citing.] Is it not therefore morally certain that the discern *294 ing statesmen who framed the Constitution and were so sedulously bent on* securing the independence of the judiciary intended to protect the compensation of the judges from assault and diminution in the name or form of a tax?  Could not the purpose of the prohibition be wholly thwarted if this avenue of attack were left open?  Certainly there is nothing in the words of the prohibition indicating that it is directed against one legislative power and not another; and in our opinion due regard for its spirit and principle requires that it be taken as directed against them all.” .  Mr. Justice Holmes wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brandéis joined.  With that expression his opposition to the decision ended.  Two years later, in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501 , writing for the Court, invalidating a state tax upon- net income of a lessee from sales of his share of oil and gas received under leases of restricted Indian land, he said (p. 505): “In cases where the principal is' absolutely immune from interference an inquiry is allowed into the sources from which net income is derived and if a part of it comes from-,such a source the tax is pro tanto void; Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., <citedDecision>157 U. S. 429</citedDecision> ; 158 U. S. 601 ; a.rule lately illustrated by Evans v. Gore .  .  .” And in that case he relied on the truth, as put by Chief Justice Marshall in M’Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431 , that “the power to tax involves the power to destroy.” He quoted (p,-505) with approval from Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522 , the statement of the opinion (p. 530) that “A tax upon the leases is a tax upon’the power to make them, and could be used to destroy - the power, to make them.” 15 *295 Miles v. Graham (1925), 268 U. S. 501 , held invalid § 213 (a), Revenue Act of 1918, (condemned in Evans v. Gore) when applied to compensation of Judge Graham, *296 appointed after its enactment.  Mr. Justice Holmes joined in the decision.  Mr. Justice Brandéis merely noted dissent.  In the course of the opinion, we said: “Does the circumstance that defendant in error’s appointment came after the taxing Act require a different view concerning his right to exemption ?  The answer depends upon the import of the word ‘compensation’ in the constitutional provision.
