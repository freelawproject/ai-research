Shortly afterwards the Oklahoma Supreme Court refused to sustain the tax on an Osage estate under the impression that this result was required by the Beaver decision; but, significantly, the Oklahoma Court held that the scope of the state law should not be limited 'further than the rule therein established.' Childers v. Pope, 119 Okl. 300 , 303, 249 P. 726 , 729. About 1938, the Oklahoma taxing authorities apparently initiated new efforts to collect an estate tax from Indians. This state action followed our decision in Superintendent v. Commissioner, 295 U.S. 418 , 55 S.Ct. 820 , 79 L.Ed. 1517 , in which we held that the restricted income of Indians was subject to the federal income tax, and our decision in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., <targetCase>303 U.S. 376</targetCase> , <targetCase>58 S.Ct. 623</targetCase> , 82 L.Ed. 907 , which overruled previous decisions limiting the power of the state to impose certain types of taxes on incomes derived from tax exempt and restricted Indian property. The state tax authorities have with reasonable consistency interpreted their acts as covering estates such as these, and have attempted to enforce the statutes except when they considered enforcement precluded by decisions of this Court. The district court held that the state law does apply to these estates. This interpretation is consistent with that given by the state administrative authorities, with the language of the acts themselves and with the State Supreme Court's holding in Childers v. Pope, supra. 4 The respondent's second and major contention is that the state may not impose an estate tax upon the transfer of the restricted cash and securities because Congress by placing restrictions upon this property manifested a purpose to exempt it from Oklahoma estate taxes. Restricted property of an Indian is that which may not be freely alienated or used by the Indian without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.

532 . In time, this constitutional concept was expanded to grant tax exemption to the income derived from Indian lands, whether tribally or individually owned, even when the privilege of exploitation had been granted to non-Indian lessees. 4 The instrumentality concept ultimately resulted in a decision exempting Indian estates from taxation. Childers v. Beaver, supra. None of these cases held, nor has this Court ever decided, that congressional restriction of an Indian's income carried an implication of estate tax exemption. 6 The underlying principles on which these decisions are based do not fit the situation of the Oklahoma Indians. Although there are remnants of the form of tribal sovereignty, these Indians have no effective tribal autonomy as in Worcester v. Georgia, supra; and, unlike the Indians involved in The Kansas Indians case, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> they are actually citizens of the State with little to distinguish them from all other citizens except for their limited property restrictions and their tax exemptions. 5 Their lands are held in fee, not in trust, as in the Rickert case, and the doctrine of constitutional immunity from taxation for the income of their holdings on the federal instrumentality theory has been renounced. Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corporation, supra. Chil ers v. Beavers, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> was in effect overruled by the Mountain Producers decision. The immunity formerly said to rest on constitutional implication cannot now be resurrected in the form of statutory implication. 7 The cash and securities of which these estates are almost entirely composed were restricted by the Act of January 27, 1933. 6 Unless the tax immunity is granted by the restriction clause itself, there is not a word in the Act which even remotely suggests that Congress meant to exempt Indians' cash and securities from Oklahoma's estate taxes. We conclude that this Act does not exempt the restricted property from taxation for two reasons: (1) the legislative history of the Act refutes the contention that an exemption was intended; and (2) application of the normal rule against tax exemption by statutory implication prevents our reading such an implication into the Act. 8 The 1933 Act was intended to serve two purposes relevant to this case. One was to continue the restrictions on Indian property for the purpose of protecting the Indians from loss to individuals who might take advantage of them; and the other was to preserve the status of certain Indian land as non-taxable until 1956.

616 , 620, 20 L.Ed. 227 . In holding the income tax applicable to Indians, the Court said, 'The terms of the 1928 Revenue Act (26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 345 et seq.) are very broad, and nothing there indicates that Indians are to be excepted. * * * If exemption exists it must derive plainly from agreements with the Creeks or some Act of Congress dealing with their affairs.' Superintendent v. Commissioner, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> 295 U.S. 420 , 55 S.Ct. 821 , 79 L.Ed. 1517 . If Congress intends to prevent the State of Oklahoma from levying a general non-discriminatory estate tax applying alike to all its citizens, it should say so in plain words. Such a conclusion can not rest on dubious inferences. 'Nontaxability and restriction upon alienation are distinct things', Superintendent v. Commissioner, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> 295 U.S. 421 , 55 S.Ct. 822 , 79 L.Ed. 1517 , and when Congress wants to require both non-alienability and nontaxability it can, as it has so often done, say so explicitly. 11 14 It is true that our interpretation of the 1933 statute must be in accord with the generous and protective spirit which the United States properly feels toward its Indian wards, but we cannot assume that Congress will choose to aid the Indians by permenently granting them immunit from taxes which they are as able as other citizens to pay. It runs counter to any traditional concept of the guardian and ward relationship to suppose that a ward should be exempted from taxation by the nature of his status, and the fact that the federal government is the guardian of its Indian ward is no reason, by itself, why a state should be precluded from taxing the estate of the Indian. We have held that the Indians, like all other citizens, must pay federal income taxes. Superintendent v. Commissioner, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> 295 U.S. 421 , 55 S.Ct. 822 , 79 L.Ed. 1517 . 'Wardship with limited power over his property' did not there 'without more, render (the Indian) immune from the common burden.' A federal court has held, in a well reasoned decision defended before us by the Solicitor General of the United States, who is not a party to this action, that an Indian's estate is subject to the federal estate tax. Landman v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 123 F.2d 787 . 12 Congress cannot have intended to impose federal income and inheritance taxes on the Indians and at the same time exempt them by implication from similar state taxes.

But there is a complete absence of any evidence of congressional belief that these exemptions are required on equitable grounds, no matter on which sovereign the burden falls. Here is a tax based solely on ability to pay. 15 'Only the same duties are exacted as from our own citizens. The burden must rest somewhere. Revenue is indispensable to meet the public necessities. It is unreasonable that this small portion of it shall rest upon these Indians?' The Cherokee Tobacco, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> 11 Wall. page 621, 20 L.Ed. 227 . 16 Recognizing that equality of privilege and equality of obligation should be inseparable associates, we have recently swept away many of the means of tax favoritism.

In all those cases a non-Indian lessee of restricted Indian lands was held immune from state taxation of various kinds because, and only because, the lands themselves and the leasing of them were held to be immune from taxation, and this in turn because they were the lands of Indians held in Government tutelage, who were permitted to lease the lands only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior. This immunity for lessees was withdrawn by Helvering v. Producers Corp., <targetCase>303 U.S. 376</targetCase> , <targetCase>58 S.Ct. 623</targetCase> , 82 L.Ed. 907 , which overruled Gillespie v.

In neither the Coronado case nor in the Producers case was there any contention that the land in the hands of the lessors was subject to taxation.

Seber, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> Congress in 1887 turned from a policy of protecting Indian tribes in the possession of their domains to a program, now discontinued, of assimilating the Indians through dissolution of their tribal governments and the compulsory individualization of their lands. This allotment program evolved out of the historical background sketched above, and took its cue from the previous protection and freedom from state control accorded Indians and their lands. The Indian surrendered tribal land, protected against state taxation as well as against all other forms of voluntary and involuntary encumbrance and alienation. Cf. The Kansas Indians, supra; The New York Indians, supra. Under the various allotment acts he received in return land which was intended to have the same measure of protection for a temporary period, generally subject to extension. Thus the General Allotment Act of 1887, 24 Stat.

United States v. Rickert, 188 U.S. 432 , 23 S.Ct. 478 , 47 L.Ed. 532 . 35 The lands here involved were not allotted under 'trust patents'; they were grants in fee subject to restrictions against alienation and encumbrance. 9 But there are no differences of substance between the two forms of tenure which suggest that while the one is exempt from state taxation, the other is not, or that Congress intended to favor Indians holding under 'trust patents' over those holding restricted fees. Cf. The Kansas Indians, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> 5 Wall. at page 755, 18 L.Ed. 667 . The power of Congress over 'trust' and 'restricted' lands is the same, Board of Commissioners v. Seber, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> and in practice the terms have been used interchangeably. See United States v. Bowling, 256 U.S. 484 , 41 S. t. 561, 65 L.Ed. 1054 ; cf. State of Minnesota v. United States, 305 U.S. 382 , 59 S.Ct. 292 , 83 L.Ed. 235 . Both devices had a common purpose, to protect a dependent people against loss of their property through their own improvidence or the greed of others during the period of transition in which they began to assume the responsibilities of citizenship.

The restrictions are not limited to voluntary sale consistently with their purpose they extend to all forms of transfer or encumbrance, involuntary as well as voluntary. Cf. Goudy v. Meath, 203 U.S. 146 , 27 S.Ct. 48 , 51 L.Ed. 130 . The interference of state taxation with Congress' program of protection is made clear by the fact that the instant Oklahoma inheritance tax acts impose liens upon the property until the taxes are paid. 10 The possible consequences of a tax lien upon Indian property are pointed out in The New York Indians, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> where it was held that the mere existence of a lien in a state taxing act invalidates it, despite a provision to the effect that no foreclosure of a lien should affect the Indian's right of occupancy. And, even when permitting specified forms of state taxation of restricted Indian property, Congress has significantly provided in numerous statutes that no tax lien should attach. 11 I conclude that when Congress imposed restrictions upon Indian property, it meant, and was saying in effect, that the property was exempt from state taxation while the restrictions continue or until Congress waives the immunity. Indeed, Congress has clearly stated that this was its intention by declaring in the Act of April 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 68 , which permitted a gross production tax to be imposed by Oklahoma on lead and zinc produced from restricted Quapaw lands: 'In accordance with the uniform policy of the United States Government to hold the lands of the Quapaw Indians while restricted and the income therefrom free from State taxation of whatsoever nature, except as said immunity is expressly waived, and, in pursuance of said fixed policyIt is herein expressly provided that the waiver of tax immunity herein provided shall be in lieu of all other State taxes of whatever nature on said restricted lands or the income therefrom, * * *.' 12 37 When Congress has intended that restricted property should be taxed, it has explicitly said so. 13 In the absence of such assent restricted property remains beyond the reach of a state's taxing power.

The taxes imposed upon them must always be properly related to their capacity to pay. For them an income tax would be infinitely better than a general property tax because of its direct relationship to their capacity to pay. The returns from such a tax would obviously be extremely small at the outset, but they would increase with the increasing productivity of the Indians.'

Two were Seminoles and one was a Creek. Congress has not terminated the guardianship relation with respect to these tribes. They still exist (§ 28 of Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137 ), and have recently been authorized to resume some of their former powers (Act of June 26, 1936, 49 Stat. 1967 , 25 U.S.C.A.
