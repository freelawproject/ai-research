We granted certiorari, 379 U.S. 944 . Rule 42 (a) is entitled "Summary Disposition" and reads as follows: "A criminal contempt may be punished summarily if the judge certified that he saw or heard the conduct constituting the contempt and that it was committed in the actual presence of the court. The order of contempt shall recite the facts and shall be signed by the judge and entered of record." Rule 42 (a) was reserved "for exceptional circumstances," Brown v. United States, 359 U.S. 41 , 54 (dissenting opinion), such as acts threatening the judge or disrupting a hearing or obstructing court proceedings. Ibid. We reach that conclusion in light of "the concern long demonstrated by both Congress and this Court over the possible abuse of the contempt power," ibid., and in light of the wording of the Rule. Summary contempt is for "misbehavior" ( Ex parte Terry, 128 U.S. 289 , 314) in the "actual presence of the court." Then speedy punishment may be necessary in order to achieve "summary vindication of the court's dignity and authority." Cooke v. United States, 267 U.S. 517 , 534. But swiftness was not a prerequisite of justice here. Delay necessary for a hearing would not imperil the grand jury proceedings. Cases of the kind involved here are foreign to Rule 42 (a). The real contempt, if such there was, was contempt before the grand juryÂ—the refusal to answer to it when directed by the court.

"I have not been told what tariff has been violated; no law has been cited or rule or regulation to your Honor or to me, and that requires research. "I also would request that the contempt hearing be held in public. "The Court: Your request is denied. This is a contempt committed in open court, and I adjudge the defendant guilty of a criminal contempt rule under Rule 42 (a)." [2] And see Nye v. United States, 313 U.S. 33 , 52-53; In re Michael, 326 U.S. 224 , 227; Cammer v. United States, 350 U.S. 399 , 404. [3] Rule 42 (a) was described by the Advisory Committee as "substantially a restatement of existing law. Ex parte Terry, 128 U.S. 289 ; Cooke v. United States . . . ." We have confirmed this on more than one occasion, e. g., Offutt v. United States. 348 U.S. 11 , 13-14; Brown v. United States, supra , at 51. [4] Chief Justice Taft said in Cooke v. United States, supra , at 537: "Due process of law, therefore, in the prosecution of contempt, except of that committed in open court, requires that the accused should be advised of the charges and have a reasonable opportunity to meet them by way of defense or explanation.
