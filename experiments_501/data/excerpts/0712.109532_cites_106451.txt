 In Weems the Court addressed the constitutionality of the Philippine punishment of cadena temporal for the crime of falsifying an official document.  That punishment included imprisonment for at least 12 years and one day, in chains, at hard and painful labor; the loss of many basic civil rights; and subjection to lifetime surveillance.  Although the Court acknowledged the possibility that “the cruelty of pain” may be present in the challenged punishment, 217 U. S., at 366 , it did not rely on that factor, for it rejected the proposition that the Eighth Amendment reaches only punishments that are “inhuman and barbarous, torture and the like.” Id., at 368 .  Rather, the Court focused on the lack of proportion between the crime and the offense: “Such penalties for such offenses amaze those who have formed their conception of the relation of a state to even its offending citizens from the practice *172 of the American commonwealths, and believe that it is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to offense.” Id., at 366-367 .  18 Later, in Trop v. Dulles, supra, the Court reviewed the constitutionality of the punishment of denationalization imposed upon a soldier who escaped from an Army stockade and became a deserter for one day. Although the concept of proportionality was not the basis of the holding, the plurality observed in dicta that “[fjines, imprisonment and even execution may be imposed depending upon the enormity of the crime.” 356 U. S., at 100 .  .  The substantive limits imposed by the Eighth Amendment on what can be made criminal and punished were discussed in Robinson v. California, <citedDecision>370 U. S. 660</citedDecision> (1962).  The Court found unconstitutional a state statute that made the status of being addicted to a narcotic drug a criminal offense.  It held, in effect, that it is “cruel and unusual” to impose any punishment at all for the mere status of addiction.  The cruelty in the abstract of the actual sentence imposed was irrelevant: “Even one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the 'crime' of having a common cold.” <citedDecision>Id., at 667</citedDecision> .  Most recently, in Furman v. Georgia, supra, three Justices in separate concurring opinions found the Eighth Amendment applicable to procedures employed to select convicted defendants for the sentence of death.  It is clear from the foregoing precedents that the *173 Eighth Amendment has not been regarded as a static concept.  As Mr. Chief Justice Warren said, in an oft-quoted phrase, “[t]he Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” Trop v. Dulles, supra, at 101 .  See also Jackson v. Bishop, 404 P. 2d 571 , 579 (CA8 1968).  Cf. <citedDecision>Robinson</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>California, supra, at 666</citedDecision> .  Thus, an assessment of contemporary values concerning the infliction of a challenged sanction is relevant to the application of the Eighth Amendment.  As we develop below more fully, see infra, at 175-176, this assessment does not call for a subjective judgment.  It requires, rather, that we look to objective indicia that reflect the public attitude toward a given sanction.  But our cases also make clear that public perceptions of standards of decency with respect to criminal sanctions are not conclusive.  A penalty also must accord with “the dignity of man,” which is the “basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment.” Trop v. Dulles, supra, at 100 (plurality opinion).  This means, at least, that the punishment not be “excessive.” When a form of punishment in the abstract (in this case, whether capital punishment may ever be imposed as a sanction for murder) rather than in the particular (the propriety of death as a penalty to be applied to a specific defendant for a specific crime) is under consideration, the inquiry into “excessiveness” has two aspects.

 20 Therefore, in assessing a punishment selected by a democratically elected legislature against the constitutional measure, we presume its validity.  We may not require the legislature to select the least severe penalty possible so long as the penalty selected is not cruelly inhumane or disproportionate to the crime involved.  And a heavy burden rests on those who would attack the judgment of the representatives of the people.  This is true in part because the constitutional test is intertwined with an assessment of contemporary standards and the legislative judgment weighs heavily in ascertaining such standards.  “[I]n a democratic society legislatures, not courts, are constituted to respond to the will and consequently the moral values of the people.” *176 Furman v. Georgia, supra, at 383 (Burger, C. J., dissenting) .  The deference we owe to the decisions of the state legislatures under our federal system, 408 U. S., at 465-470 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), is enhanced where the specification of punishments is concerned, for “these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.” Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 393 (1958).  Cf. <citedDecision>Robinson</citedDecision> v. California, <citedDecision>370 U. S., at 664-665</citedDecision> ; Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S., at 103 (plurality opinion); In re Kemmler, 136 U. S., at 447 .  Caution is necessary lest this Court become, “under the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the ultimate arbiter of the standards of criminal responsibility .  .  .  throughout the country.” Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 533 (1968) (plurality opinion).  A decision that a given punishment is impermissible under the Eighth Amendment cannot be reversed short of a constitutional amendment.  The ability of the people to express their preference through the normal democratic processes, as well as through ballot referenda, is shut off.

 — That they would not admit of tortures, or cruel and barbarous punishment.  But Congress may introduce the practice of the civil law, in preference to that of the common law. They may introduce the practice of France, Spain, and Germany — of torturing, to extort a confession of the crime.” 3 J. Elliot, Debates 447-448 (1863).  A similar objection was made in the Massachusetts convention: “They are nowhere restrained from inventing the most cruel and unheard-of punishments and annexing them to crimes; and there is no constitutional check on them, but that racks and gibbets may be amongst the most mild instruments of their discipline.” 2 Elliot, supra, at 111.  The Court remarked on the fact that the law under review “has come to us from a government of a different form and genius from ours,” but it also noted that the punishments it inflicted “would have those bad attributes even if they were found in a Federal enactment and not taken from an alien source.” 217 U. S., at 377 .  Although legislative measures adopted by the people’s chosen representatives provide one important means of ascertaining contemporary values, it is evident that legislative judgments alone cannot be determinative of Eighth Amendment standards since that Amendment was intended to safeguard individuals from the abuse of legislative power.  See Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 371-373 (1910); Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 258-269 (Brennak, J., concurring).  Robinson v. California, <citedDecision>370 U. S. 660</citedDecision> (1962), illustrates the proposition that penal laws enacted by state legislatures may violate the Eighth Amendment because “in the light of contemporary human knowledge” they “would doubtless be universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.” <citedDecision>Id., at 666</citedDecision> .  At the time of <citedDecision>Robinson</citedDecision> nine States in addition to California had criminal laws that punished addiction similar to the law declared unconstitutional in <citedDecision>Robinson</citedDecision> .  See Brief for Appellant in <citedDecision>Robinson</citedDecision> v. California, O. T. 1961, No. 554, p. 15.  See also Furman v. Georgia, supra, at 411 (Blacicmun, J., dissenting): “We should not allow our personal preferences as to the wisdom of legislative and congressional action, or our distaste for such action, to guide our judicial decision in cases such as these.  The temptations to cross that policy line are very great.” See concurring opinions of Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall, 408 U. S., at 257 and 314.
