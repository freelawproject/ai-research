 In both cases, more patently in Williams than in Baldwin, the history of jury trial practice in both the state and federal systems has been indiscriminately jumbled together as opposed to the point of departure having been taken from the language in which the federal guarantee is expressed and the historical precedent that brings it to life. The consequence of this inverted approach to interpreting the Sixth Amendment results, fortuitously, 4 in Baldwin in a Sixth Amendment rule that would be reached under the correct approach, given the “incorporationist” philosophy of Duncan , but, unhappily, imposes it on the one jurisdiction in the country that has seen fit to do otherwise; and in Williams results in a Sixth Amendment rule that could only be reached by standing the constitutional dialectic on its head.  A To the extent that the prevailing opinion premises its conclusions in the Baldwin case on federal precedent and the common-law practice, I agree that the federal right to *120 jury trial attaches where an offense is punishable by as much as six months’ imprisonment.  I think this follows both from the breadth of the language of the Sixth Amendment, which provides for a jury in “all criminal prosecutions,” and the evidence of historical practice.  In this regard I believe that contemporary usage in the States is of little, if any, significance.  5 For if exceptions are to be created out of the all-embracing language of the Sixth Amendment they should only be those that are anchored in history.  It is to the distinction between “petty” and “serious” offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.  See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937); Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65 (1904); Callan v. Wilson, <citedDecision>127 U. S. 540, 552</citedDecision> (1888).  Since the conventional, if not immutable practice at common law appears to have been to provide juries for offenses punishable by fines of more than £100 or sentences to hard labor of more than six months in prison, see Frankfurter & Corcoran, Petty Federal Offenses and the Constitutional Guaranty of Trial by Jury, 39 Harv. L. Rev. 917 (1926), 6 I think it *121 appropriate to draw the line at six months in federal cases, 7 although, for reasons to follow, I would not encumber the States by this requirement.  8 *122 B In Williams the Court strangely does an about-face.  Rather than bind the States by the hitherto undeviating and unquestioned federal practice of 12-member juries, the Court holds, based on a poll of state practice, that a six-man jury satisfies the guarantee of a trial by jury in a federal criminal system and consequently carries over to the States.  This is a constitutional renvoi.  With all respect, I consider that before today it would have been unthinkable to suggest that the Sixth Amendment’s right to a trial by jury is satisfied by a jury of six, or less, as is left open by the Court’s opinion in Williams, or by less than a unanimous verdict, a question also reserved in today’s decision.  1.

 16 Ill Today’s decisions demonstrate a constitutional schizophrenia born of the need to cope with national diversity under the constraints of the incorporation doctrine.  In Baldwin the prevailing opinion overrides the consideration of local needs, but in Williams the Court seeks out a minimum standard to avoid causing disruption in numerous instances even though, a prion, incorporation would surely require a jury of 12.  The six-man, six-month rule of today’s decisions simply reflects the lowest common denominator in the scope and function of the right to trial by jury in this country, but the circumstance that every jurisdiction except New York City has a trial by a jury for offenses punishable by six months in prison obscures the variety of opinion that actually exists as to the proper place for the jury in the administration of justice.  More discriminating analysis indicates that four States besides Florida authorize a jury of less than 12 to try felony *137 offenses 17 and three States authorize a nonunanimous verdict 18 in felony cases, and at least two other States provide a trial without jury in the first instance for certain offenses punishable by more than one year with a right to de novo trial on appeal.  19 Eight States provide for juries ranging from five to 12 to try crimes punishable by one year in prison, and one State has provided for a verdict by nine in a jury of 12.  20 Five States first provide a bench trial for misdemeanors from which the defendant can seek a trial de novo by jury, 21 a procedure that this Court, in a federal trial, has deemed incompatible with the Sixth Amendment for putting the accused to the burden of two trials if he wishes a jury verdict.  See Callan v. Wilson, <citedDecision>127 U. S. 540</citedDecision> (1888).  22 These varying provisions, reflecting as they do differing estimates of the importance of the jury in securing a fair trial and the feasibility of administering such a procedure given the local circumstances, and the extensive study and debate about the merits and demerits of the jury system, demonstrate that the relevance and proper role of trial by jury in the administration of criminal justice is yet far from sure.  *138 “Incorporation” in Duncan closed the door on debate, 23 irrespective of local circumstances, such as the backlogs in urban courts like those of New York City, and has, without justification, clouded with uncertainty the constitutionality of these differing state modes of proceeding, see Appendix, pending approval by this Court; it now promises to dilute in other ways the settled meaning of the federal right to a trial by jury.  Flexibility for experimentation in the administration of justice should be returned to the States here and in other areas that now have been swept into the rigid mold of “incorporation.” I agree with The Chief Justice: “That the ‘near-uniform judgment of the Nation’ is otherwise than the judgment in some of its parts affords no basis ... to read into the Constitution something not found there.” Opinion of The Chief Justice in Baldwin, ante, at 77.  It is time, I submit, for this Court to face up to the reality implicit in today’s holdings and reconsider the “incorporation” doctrine before its leveling tendencies further retard development in the field of criminal procedure by stifling flexibility in the States and by discarding the possibility of federal leadership by example.

 See No. 188, ante, at 71-72.  “The range and severity of punishment in summary trials has been defined by limiting jurisdiction to the imposition of fines up to a hundred pounds and sentences with hard labor up to six months.” Id., at 934.  The practice in the Colonies was not uniform but it is apparent that the line was drawn at six months in most instances.  See District of Columbia v. Clawans, supra, at 626 nn. 2, 3.  While this Court has said that the most significant index to the seriousness of an offense is the degree of penalty that attaches, see Frank v. United States, 395 U. S. 147, 148 (1969); District of Columbia v. Clawans, supra, it should be recalled that this is not alone determinative and that the “apportioned punishment was both a consequence of the minor quality of the misconduct and an index of the community’s moral judgment upon it.” Frankfurter & Corcoran, supra, at 980.  In Clawans the Court held the severity of punishment was not determinative when the offense by its own nature is not considered grave.  300 U. S., at 625 ; see also <citedDecision>Callan</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wilson, supra, at 556</citedDecision> ; Schick v. United States, supra, where this Court noted that the “nature” of the offense and the severity of punishment are two distinct considerations.  Cf. the House debate in 1930 over a bill to provide for a trial before federal magistrates for crimes of a petty nature, 72 Cong. Rec. 9991-9994; see also H. R. Rep. No. 1699, 71st Cong., 2d Sess. (1930) (minority views); Comments, American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Trial by Jury 21 (Approved Draft 1968); Comment, The Petty Offense Category and Trial by Jury, 40 Yale L. J. 1303 (1931).  I would reserve the question as to whether a jury would be required in a federal ease for a particular offense not punishable by more than six months in prison.  Nor do I think it offends the Equal Protection Clause for New York not to provide juries to hear offenses punishable by six months in New York City but to have such a provision for trials elsewhere in the State.  In Salsburg v. Maryland, 346 U. S. 545 (1954), and Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U. S. 22 (1880), this Court upheld the right of a State to adapt procedures to the differing requirements of territorial subdivisions.  In Salsburg the Court quoted and reaffirmed the principles set forth in Missouri: “ '[T]here is nothing in the Constitution to prevent any State from adopting any system of laws or judicature it sees fit for all or any part of its territory.  If the State of New York, for example, should see fit to adopt the civil law and its method of procedure for New York City and the surrounding counties, and the common law and its method of procedure for the rest of the State, there is nothing in the *122 Constitution of the United States to prevent its doing so.’ ” 346 U. S., at 551.

To accord to the accused a right to be tried by a jury, in an appellate court, after he has been once fully tried otherwise than by a jury, in the court of original jurisdiction .  .  .  does not satisfy the requirements of the Constitution.” <citedDecision>127 U. S., at 557</citedDecision> .  See, e. g., H. Kalven & H. Zeisel, The American Jury 5 (1966); Comment, Should Jury Verdicts Be Unanimous in Criminal Cases?, 47 Ore. L. Rev. 417 (1968).  Like Mr. Justice Harlan, I join Part I of the Court’s opinion in No. 927, relating to the “alibi” issue.  I have had occasion to state elsewhere my own understanding, for whatever it is worth, of the motivational origins of Fourteenth Amendment “incorporation”: “Shortly before Justice Jackson came to the Court, some of its then more junior members had embraced the comforting theory that the Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive impact upon the states could be exactly measured by the specific restrictions that the first eight Amendments imposed upon the National Government.  I call this a 'comforting’ theory, because, for critics of the old Court’s subjective approach to due process, it was a theory that appeared to give the Fourteenth Amendment objective content and definable scope.” (Footnotes omitted.)
