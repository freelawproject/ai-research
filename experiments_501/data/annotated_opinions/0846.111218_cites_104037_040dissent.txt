 In United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218 (1947), the Court explicitly stated that a corporate subsidiary could conspire with its parent: “The fact that these restraints occur in a setting described by the appellees as a vertically integrated enterprise does not necessarily remove the ban of the Sherman Act.  The test of illegality under the Act is the presence or absence of an unreasonable restraint on interstate commerce.  Such a restraint may result as readily from a conspiracy among those who are affiliated or integrated under common ownership as from a conspiracy among those who are otherwise independent.” Id., at 227 .  The majority attempts to explain Yellow Cab by suggesting that it dealt only with unlawful acquisition of subsidiaries.  Ante, at 761-762.  But the Court mentioned acquisitions only as an additional consideration separate from the passage *780 quoted above, 1 and more important, the Court explicitly held that restraints imposed by the corporate parent on the affiliates that it already owned in themselves violated § l. 2 At least three cases involving the motion picture industry also recognize that affiliated corporations may combine or conspire within the meaning of §1.  In United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., <citedDecision>323 U. S. 173</citedDecision> (1944), as the Court recognizes, ante, at 762, n. 6, the only conspirators were affiliated corporations.  The majority’s claim that the case involved only unlawful acquisitions because of the Court’s comments concerning divestiture of the affiliates cannot be squared with the passage immediately following that cited by the majority, which states that there had been unlawful conduct going beyond the acquisition of subsidiaries: “That principle is adequate here to justify divestiture of all interest in some of the affiliates since their acquisition was part of the fruits of the conspiracy.  But the relief need not, and under these facts should not, be so restricted [to divestiture].  The fact that the companies were affiliated induced joint action and agreement.  Common control was one of the instruments in bringing about unity of purpose and unity of action and in making the conspiracy effective.  If that affiliation continues, *781 there will be tempting opportunity for these exhibitors to continue to act in combination against the independents.” <citedDecision>323 U. S., at 189-190</citedDecision> (emphasis supplied).  Similarly, in Schine Chain Theatres, Inc. v. United States, 334 U. S. 110 (1948), the Court held that concerted action by parents and subsidiaries constituted an unlawful conspiracy.  3 That was also the holding in United States v. Griffith, 334 U. S. 100, 109 (1948).  The majority’s observation that in these cases there were alternative grounds that could have been used to reach the same result, ante, at 763, n. 8, disguises neither the fact that the holding that actually appears in these opinions rests on conspiracy between affiliated entities, nor that today’s holding is inconsistent with what was actually held in these cases. In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211 (1951), the Court’s holding was plain and unequivocal: *782 This holding is so clear that even the Court, which is not wanting for inventiveness in its reading of the prior cases, cannot explain it away.  The Court suggests only that today Kiefer-Stewart might be decided on alternative grounds, ante, at 764, ignoring the fact that today’s holding is inconsistent with the ground on which the case actually was decided.  4 *781 “Respondents next suggest that their status as ‘mere in-strumentalities of a single manufacturing-merchandizing unit’ makes it impossible for them to have conspired in a manner forbidden by the Sherman Act.  But this suggestion runs counter to our past decisions that common ownership and control does not liberate corporations from the impact of the antitrust laws.

 Restraints that act only on the parent or its subsidiary as a consequence of an otherwise lawful integration do not violate § 1 of the Sherman Act.  26 But if the behavior at issue is unrelated to any functional integration between the affiliated corporations and *793 imposes a restraint on third parties of sufficient magnitude to restrain marketwide competition, as a matter of economic substance, as well as form, it is appropriate to characterize the conduct as a “combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade.” 27 For example, in Yellow Cab the Court read the complaint as alleging that integration had assisted the parent in excluding competing manufacturers from the marketplace, 332 U. S., at 226-227 , leading the Court to conclude that “restraint of interstate trade was not only effected by the combination of the appellees but was the primary object of the combination.” Id., at 227 .  Similarly, in Crescent Amusement the Court noted that corporate affiliation between exhibitors enhanced their buying power and “was one of the instruments in .  .  .  making the conspiracy effective” in excluding independents from the market.  <citedDecision>323 U. S., at 189-190</citedDecision> .  Thus, in both cases the Court found that the affiliation enhanced the ability of the parent corporation to exclude the competition of third parties, and hence raised entry *794 barriers faced by actual and potential competitors.  When conduct restrains trade not merely by integrating affiliated corporations but rather by restraining the ability of others to compete, that conduct has competitive significance drastically different from procompetitive integration.  28 In these cases, the affiliation assisted exclusionary conduct; it was not the competitive equivalent of unilateral integration but instead generated power to restrain marketwide competition.  There are other ways in which corporate affiliation can operate to restrain competition.  A wholly owned subsidiary might market a “fighting brand” or engage in other predatory behavior that would be more effective if its ownership were concealed than if it was known that only one firm was involved.  A predator might be willing to accept the risk of bankrupting a subsidiary when it could not afford to let a division incur similar risks.

 The language I have quoted, most of which is overlooked by the majority, makes it clear that the Court’s adoption of the concept of conspiracy between affiliated corporations was unqualified.  As the first word of the sentence indicates, the Court’s following statement: “Similarly, any affiliation or integration flowing from an illegal conspiracy cannot insulate the conspirators from the sanctions which Congress has imposed,” 332 U. S., at 227 , expresses a separate if related point.  “[B]y preventing the cab operating companies under their control from purchasing cabs from manufacturers other than CCM, the appellees deny those companies the opportunity to purchase cabs in a free, competitive market.  The Sherman Act has never been thought to sanction such a conspiracy to restrain the free purchase of goods in interstate commerce.” Id., at 226-227 (footnote omitted).  “[T]he combining of the open and closed towns for the negotiation of films for the circuit was a restraint of trade and the use of monopoly power in violation of § 1 and § 2 of the Act.  The concerted action of the parent company, its subsidiaries, and the named officers and directors in that endeavor was a conspiracy which was not immunized by reason of the fact that the members were closely affiliated rather than independent.  See United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218, 227 ; United States v. Crescent Amusement Co., <citedDecision>323 U. S. 173</citedDecision> .  334 U. S., at 116.  In Kiefer-Stewart, Seagram unsuccessfully argued that Yellow Cab was confined to cases concerning unlawful acquisitions, see Brief for Respondents, O. T. 1950, No. 297, p. 21.  Thus the Kiefer-Stewart Court considered and rejected exactly the same argument embraced by today’s majority.  “The fact that there is common ownership or control of the contracting corporations does not liberate them from the impact of the antitrust laws.  E. g., Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Seagram & Sons, [340 U. S.,] at 215.  Nor do we find any support in reason or authority for the proposition that agreements between legally separate persons and companies to suppress competition among themselves and others can be justified by labeling the project a ‘joint venture.’ Perhaps every agreement and combination to restrain trade could be so labeled.” 341 U. S., at 598.
