Case of interest: Superintendent of Five Civilized Tribes v. Commissioner (1935)
-----------------------
fers made in contemplation of death or intended to take effect after death as well as transfers 'by will or the intestate laws of this state.'2 The language of the statutes does not except either Indians or any other persons from their scope. Efforts of Oklahoma to apply this tax to the estate of a deceased Quapaw Indian were frustrated by this Court's opinion in Childers v. Beaver, 270 U.S. 555, 46 S.Ct. 387, 70 L.Ed. 730, decided in 1926. Shortly afterwards the Oklahoma Supreme Court refused to sustain the tax on an Osage estate under the impression that this result was required by the Beaver decision; but, significantly, the Oklahoma Court held that the scope of the state law should not be limited 'further than the rule therein established.' Childers v. Pope, 119 Okl. 300, 303, 249 P. 726, 729. About 1938, the Oklahoma taxing authorities apparently initiated new efforts to collect an estate tax from Indians. This state action followed our decision in Superintendent v. Commissioner, <caseOfInterest>295 U.S. 418</caseOfInterest>, <caseOfInterest>55 S.Ct. 820</caseOfInterest>, 79 L.Ed. 1517, in which we held that the restricted income of Indians was subject to the federal income tax, and our decision in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376, 58 S.Ct. 623, 82 L.Ed. 907, which overruled previous decisions limiting the power of the state to impose certain types of taxes on incomes derived from tax exempt and restricted Indian property. The state tax authorities have with reasonable consistency interpreted their acts as covering estates such as these, and have attempted to enforce the statutes except when they considered enforcement precluded by decisions of this Court. The district court held that the state law does apply to these estates. This interpretation is consistent with that given by the state administrative authorities, with the language of the acts themselves and with the State Supreme Court's holding in Childers v. Pope, supra.

The respondent's second and major contention is that the state may not impose an estate tax upon the tra

rals themselves should be subject to taxation, but that the proceeds of their sale, even further removed from the land itself, should be immune.

This Court has repeatedly said that tax exemptions are not granted by implication. United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U.S. 57, 60, 59 S.Ct. 692, 693, 83 L.Ed. 1104. It has applied that rule to taxing acts affecting Indians as to all others. As was said of an excise tax on tobacco produced by the Cherokee Indians in 1870, 'If the exemption had been intended it would doubtless have been expressed.' The Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616, 620, 20 L.Ed. 227. In holding the income tax applicable to Indians, the Court said, 'The terms of the 1928 Revenue Act (26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Acts, page 345 et seq.) are very broad, and nothing there indicates that Indians are to be excepted. * * * If exemption exists it must derive plainly from agreements with the Creeks or some Act of Congress dealing with their affairs.' Superintendent v. Commissioner, <caseOfInterest>supra,</caseOfInterest> 295 U.S. 420, 55 S.Ct. 821, 79 L.Ed. 1517. If Congress intends to prevent the State of Oklahoma from levying a general non-discriminatory estate tax applying alike to all its citizens, it should say so in plain words. Such a conclusion can not rest on dubious inferences. 'Nontaxability and restriction upon alienation are distinct things', Superintendent v. Commissioner, <caseOfInterest>supra,</caseOfInterest> 295 U.S. 421, 55 S.Ct. 822, 79 L.Ed. 1517, and when Congress wants to require both non-alienability and nontaxability it can, as it has so often done, say so explicitly.11

It is true that our interpretation of the 1933 statute must be in accord with the generous and protective spirit which the United States properly feels toward its Indian wards, but we cannot assume that Congress will choose to aid the Indians by permenently granting them immunit  from taxes which they are as able as other citizens to pay. It runs counter to any traditional concept of the guardian and ward relationship to suppose that a ward should be exempted from taxation by the nature of his status, and the fact that the federal government is the guardian of its Indian ward is no reason, by itself, why a state should be precluded from taxing the estate of the Indian. We have held that the Indians, like all other citizens, must pay federal income taxes. Superintendent v. Commissioner, <caseOfInterest>supra,</caseOfInterest> 295 U.S. 421, 55 S.Ct. 822, 79 L.Ed. 1517. 'Wardship with limited power over his property' did not there 'without more, render (the Indian) immune from the common burden.' A federal court has held, in a well reasoned decision defended before us by the Solicitor General of the United States, who is not a party to this action, that an Indian's estate is subject to the federal estate tax. Landman v. Commissioner, 10 Cir., 123 F.2d 787.12 Congress cannot have intended to impose federal income and inheritance taxes on the Indians and at the same time exempt them by implication from similar state taxes.

Congress has passed laws under which Indians have become full fledged citizens of the State of Oklahoma.13 Oklahoma supplies for them and their children schools, roads, courts, police protection and all the other benefits of an ordered society. Citizens of Oklahoma must pay for these benefits. If some pay less, others must pay more. Since Oklahoma has become a state, it has been authori

 See, for examples, Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567, tract made 'inalienable and nontaxable;' Act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861, tract made 'nontaxable and inalienable;' Act of June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 500, tract to remain 'nontaxable, inalienable, and free from any incumbrance;' Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137, 'all lands upon which restrictions are removed shall be subject to taxation, and the other lands shall be exempt from taxation.' Cf. for special treatment of the Quapaw Indians the Act of April 17, 1937, 50 Stat. 68.

 Certiorari denied, 315 u.S. 810, 62 S.Ct. 799, 86 L.Ed. 1209. The Department of the Interior in the Landman case made substantially the same argument it makes here against taxation of Indians' estates. It emphasizes that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals would lead to similar taxation by states. The Solicitor General, opposing the Department of the Interior in the Landman case, insisted that under Superintendent v. Commissioner, <caseOfInterest>295 U.S. 418</caseOfInterest>, <caseOfInterest>55 S.Ct. 820</caseOfInterest>, 79 L.Ed. 1517, and Choteau v. Burnet, 283 U.S. 691, 51 S.Ct. 598, 75 L.Ed. 1353, the Indians' estates should be subjected to taxation; and that even if the Indians' lands were exempt from direct taxation, the estate tax should be upheld as an excise tax, indirect in its nature, citing United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U.S. 57, 59 S.Ct. 692, 83 L.Ed. 1104; Plummer v. Coler, 178 U.S. 115, 20 S.Ct. 829, 44 L.Ed. 998; Greiner v. Lewellyn, 258 U.S. 384, 42 S.Ct. 324, 66 L.Ed. 676. In other words, the Solicitor General in seeking to uphold the validity of a federal estate tax as applied to Indian estates opposed the argument which the Department of the Interior made then and which it makes now, the only difference being that in the instant case the Department of the Interior is seeking to invalidate a state instead of a federal tax.

 It must not be assumed that the Oklahoma Indians are all unable to pay estate taxes. The estates of the three Indians here involved, as has been

The Act of May 27, 1908, 35 Stat. 312, by specifically providing in § 4 that lands from which 'restrictions have been or shall be removed shall be subject to taxation', strongly indicates a Congressional understanding that restriction amounted to tax ex mption.

 It is for this historical reason that cases such as Superintendent v. Commissioner, <caseOfInterest>295 U.S. 418</caseOfInterest>, <caseOfInterest>55 S.Ct. 820</caseOfInterest>, 79 L.Ed. 1517, and Landman v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 10 Cir., 123 F.2d 787, have no bearing upon a consideration of the effect of restrictions upon the power of a state to tax.

 Since 1908 the regulations prescribed by the Secretary under § 2 of the Act of 1908, 35 Stat. 312 and related statutes governing oil, gas and other mining leases of restricted lands, have recognized that proceeds from such leases are restricted and have required that all such money be paid to a representative of the Secretary.
