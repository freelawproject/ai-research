**Combined Opinion**
 The two controlling statutes broadly provide for a tax upon all transfers made in contemplation of death or intended to take effect after death as well as transfers 'by will or the intestate laws of this state.' 2 The language of the statutes does not except either Indians or any other persons from their scope.  Efforts of Oklahoma to apply this tax to the estate of a deceased Quapaw Indian were frustrated by this Court's opinion in Childers v. Beaver, 270 U.S. 555 , 46 S.Ct. 387 , 70 L.Ed. 730 , decided in 1926.  Shortly afterwards the Oklahoma Supreme Court refused to sustain the tax on an Osage estate under the impression that this result was required by the Beaver decision; but, significantly, the Oklahoma Court held that the scope of the state law should not be limited 'further than the rule therein established.' Childers v. Pope, 119 Okl. 300 , 303, 249 P. 726, 729 .  About 1938, the Oklahoma taxing authorities apparently initiated new efforts to collect an estate tax from Indians.  This state action followed our decision in Superintendent v. Commissioner, 295 U.S. 418 , 55 S.Ct. 820 , 79 L.Ed. 1517 , in which we held that the restricted income of Indians was subject to the federal income tax, and our decision in Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., <citedDecision>303 U.S. 376</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>58 S.Ct. 623</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>82 L.Ed. 907</citedDecision> , which overruled previous decisions limiting the power of the state to impose certain types of taxes on incomes derived from tax exempt and restricted Indian property.  The state tax authorities have with reasonable consistency interpreted their acts as covering estates such as these, and have attempted to enforce the statutes except when they considered enforcement precluded by decisions of this Court. The district court held that the state law does apply to these estates.  This interpretation is consistent with that given by the state administrative authorities, with the language of the acts themselves and with the State Supreme Court's holding in Childers v. Pope, supra. 4 The respondent's second and major contention is that the state may not impose an estate tax upon the transfer of the restricted cash and securities because Congress by placing restrictions upon this property manifested a purpose to exempt it from Oklahoma estate taxes.  Restricted property of an Indian is that which may not be freely alienated or used by the Indian without the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.  We find, upon an examination of both the cases dealing generally with the taxation of Indian property and the statute which imposes the restriction, that the restriction, without more, is not the equivalent of a congressional grant of estate tax immunity for the cash and securities.  3 5 The many cases dealing generally with the problem of Indian tax exemptions provide no basis for the government's argument that Congress, in view of the existing legal framework, must have assumed that it would immunize the securities and cash from estate taxes by restricting their alienation.  Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515 , 8 L.Ed. 483 , held that a state might not regulate the conduct of persons in Indian territory on the theory that the Indian tribes were separate political entities with all the rights of independent status—a condition which has not existed for many years in the State of Oklahoma.

 The burden must rest somewhere.  Revenue is indispensable to meet the public necessities.  It is unreasonable that this small portion of it shall rest upon these Indians?' The Cherokee Tobacco, supra, 11 Wall. page 621, 20 L.Ed. 227 .  16 Recognizing that equality of privilege and equality of obligation should be inseparable associates, we have recently swept away many of the means of tax favoritism.  Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U.S. 466 , 59 S.Ct. 595 , 83 L.Ed. 927 , 120 A.L.R. 1466 , permitted States to impose income taxes upon government employees and Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U.S. 405 , 58 S.Ct. 969 , 82 L.Ed. 1427 , permitted the federal government to impose taxes on state employees.  O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277 , 59 S.Ct. 838 , 83 L.Ed. 1289 , 122 A.L.R. 1379 , overruled a previous decision which held that judges should not pay taxes just as other citizens, and Helvering v. Mountain Producers Oil <citedDecision>Corp., supra,</citedDecision> repudiated former decisions seriously limiting state and federal power to tax. See, also, Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U.S. 514 , 46 S.Ct. 172 , 70 L.Ed. 384 , and James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U.S. 134 , 58 S.Ct. 208 , 82 L.Ed. 155 , 114 A.L.R. 318 .  The trend of these cases should not now be reversed.  17 What has been said requires the conclusion that the cash and securities are not exempted by any existing legislation from state estate taxation, and this is likewise true of the personal property in two of these estates.  18 The validity of the taxes on the transfer of the land presents a somewhat different problem.  Some of these lands are exempt from direct taxation by virtue of explicit congressional command.  The Act of May 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 495 , for example, provides that Indians of a class which includes the three deceased should select up to 160 acres of his allotted, inherited or devised restricted lands, which 'shall remain exempt from taxation while the title remains in the Indian designated * * * or in any full-blood Indian heir of devisee', while all other restricted lands are made subject to taxation by Oklahoma.  The state argues that congressional exemption of the land from direct state taxation does not exempt the land from an estate tax, because of the principles announced in United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, supra. A majority of the Court concludes that this principle does not apply to Indian lands specifically exempted from direct taxation.

 On the contrary, those Indians were subject to federal control.  1 Most of their allotted lands were expressly exempt from taxation, and, as the opinion of the Court recognizes, this removed them from the operation of Oklahoma's estate tax. 2 But apart from these express exemptions, the bulk of the properties in the three estates were restricted against alienation and encumbrance by various acts of Congress.  3 History, as well as statements of Congress itself, 4 leave no doubt that property so restricted is beyond the taxing power of the states, unless and until Congress gives its consent.  In other words restriction is tantamount to immunity from state taxation.  That was the basis of decision in Choctaw O. & Gulf R. Co. v. Harrison, 235 U.S. 292 , 35 S.Ct. 27 , 59 L.Ed. 234 ; Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U.S. 522 , 36 S.Ct. 453 , 60 L.Ed. 779 ; Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, 271 U.S. 609 , 46 S.Ct. 592 , 70 L.Ed. 1112 ; Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., 247 U.S. 503 , 38 S.Ct. 426 , 62 L.Ed. 1239 ; Large Oil Co. v. Howard, 248 U.S. 549 , 39 S.Ct. 183 , 63 L.Ed. 416 ; Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U.S. 501 , 42 S.Ct. 171 , 66 L.Ed. 338 .  In all those cases a non-Indian lessee of restricted Indian lands was held immune from state taxation of various kinds because, and only because, the lands themselves and the leasing of them were held to be immune from taxation, and this in turn because they were the lands of Indians held in Government tutelage, who were permitted to lease the lands only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.  This immunity for lessees was withdrawn by Helvering v. Producers Corp., <citedDecision>303 U.S. 376</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>58 S.Ct. 623</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>82 L.Ed. 907</citedDecision> , which overruled Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra. Cf. the dissenting opinions in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S. 393 , 52 S.Ct. 443 , 76 L.Ed. 815 .  In neither the Coronado case nor in the Producers case was there any contention that the land in the hands of the lessors was subject to taxation.  That was recognized and accepted as correct.  The point was that even though the land was tax immune in the hands of the lessor, the lessor's immunity did not extend to the lessee who had no personal immunity and who acquired the land for his own purposes and made a profit from it.  In other words, the withdrawal of immunity from a non-Indian lessee of restricted Indian land rests upon the remoteness of the effect of that taxation upon such I dian property, cf. Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U.S. 466 , 59 S.Ct. 595 , 83 L.Ed. 927 , 120 A.L.R. 1466 , not upon a notion that Congress did not intend by imposing restrictions to prohibit state taxation of the interest of Indians in their restricted property, nor upon the supposition that Congress lacks power to do so. Congress plainly has power to implement its Indian policy by forbidding state taxation to burden the interest of an Indian in his property.  Cf. Shaw v. Oil Corp., 276 U.S. 575 , 48 S.Ct. 333 , 72 L.Ed. 709 ; Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U.S. 705 , 63 S.Ct. 920 , 87 L.Ed. —-.  It exercises that power simply by imposing the restrictions.
