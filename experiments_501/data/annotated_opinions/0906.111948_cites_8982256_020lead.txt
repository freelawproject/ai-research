 We hold that it does not, and overrule our earlier decision in O’Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258 (1969).  While petitioner Richard Solorio was on active duty in the Seventeenth Coast Guard District in Juneau, Alaska, he sexually abused two young daughters of fellow coastguardsmen.  *437 Petitioner engaged in this abuse over a 2-year period until he was transferred by the Coast Guard to Governors Island, New York. Coast Guard authorities learned of the Alaska crimes only after petitioner’s transfer, and investigation revealed that he had later committed similar sexual abuse offenses while stationed in New York. The Governors Island commander convened a general court-martial to try petitioner for crimes alleged to have occurred in Alaska and New York. There is no “base” or “post” where Coast Guard personnel live and work in Juneau.  Consequently, nearly all Coast Guard military personnel reside in the civilian community.  Petitioner’s Alaska offenses were committed in his privately owned home, and the fathers of the 10- to 12-year-old victims in Alaska were active duty members of the Coast Guard assigned to the same command as petitioner.  Petitioner’s New York offenses also involved daughters of fellow coast-guardsmen, but were committed in Government quarters on the Governors Island base.  After the general court-martial was convened in New York, petitioner moved to dismiss the charges for crimes committed in Alaska on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction under this Court’s decisions in O’Callahan v. Parker, supra, and Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, <citedDecision>401 U. S. 355</citedDecision> (1971).  1 Ruling that the Alaska offenses were not sufficiently “service connected” to be tried in the military criminal justice system, the court-martial judge granted the motion to dismiss.  The Government appealed the dismissal of the charges to the United *438 States Coast Guard Court of Military Review, which reversed the trial judge’s order and reinstated the charges.  21 M. J. 512 (1985).  The United States Court of Military Appeals affirmed the Court of Military Review, concluding that the Alaska offenses were service connected within the meaning of O’Callahan and Relford.  21 M. J. 251 (1986).  Stating that “not every off-base offense against a servicemember’s dependent is service-connected,” the court reasoned that “sex offenses against young children .

 *448 Since O’Callahan , we have adhered to this principle of deference in a variety of contexts where, as here, the constitutional rights of servicemen were implicated.  See, e. g., Goldman v. Weinberger, supra, at 509-510 (free exercise of religion); Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U. S. 296, 300-305 (1983) (racial discrimination); Rostker v. Goldberg, supra, at 64-66, 70-71 (sex discrimination); Brown v. Glines, 444 U. S. 348, 357, 360 (1980) (free expression); Middendorf v. Henry, 425 U. S. 25, 43 (1976) (right to counsel in summary court-martial proceedings); Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U. S. 738, 753 (1975) (availability of injunctive relief from an impending court-martial); Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 756 (1974) (due process rights and freedom of expression).  The notion that civil courts are “ill equipped” to establish policies regarding matters of military concern is substantiated by experience under the service connection approach.  Chappell v. Wallace, supra, at 305 .  In his O’Callahan dissent, Justice Harlan forecasted that “the infinite permutations of possibly relevant factors are bound to create confusion and proliferate litigation over the [court-martial] jurisdiction issue.” 395 U. S., at 284 .  In fact, within two years after O’Callahan , this Court found it necessary to expound on the meaning of the decision, enumerating a myriad of factors for courts to weigh in determining whether an offense is service connected.  Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, <citedDecision>401 U. S. 355</citedDecision> (1971).  Yet the service connection approach, even as elucidated in <citedDecision>Relford</citedDecision> , has proved confusing and difficult for military courts to apply.  13 *449 Since O’Callahan and <citedDecision>Relford</citedDecision> , military courts have identified numerous categories of offenses requiring specialized analysis of the service connection requirement.  For example, the courts have highlighted subtle distinctions among offenses committed on a military base, offenses committed off-base, offenses arising from events occurring both on and off a base, and offenses committed on or near the boundaries of a base.  14 Much time and energy has also been expended in litigation over other jurisdictional factors, such as the status of the victim of the crime, and the results are difficult to reconcile.  15 The confusion created by the complexity of the service connection requirement, however, is perhaps best illustrated in the area of off-base drug offenses.  16 Soon after O’Callahan , the Court of Military Appeals held that drug offenses were of such “special military significance” that their trial by court-martial was unaffected by the decision.  United States v. Beeker, 18 U. S. C. M. A. 563, 565, 40 C. M. R. 275, 277 (1969).  Nevertheless, the court has changed its position on *450 the issue no less than two times since Beeker, each time basing its decision on O’Callahan and <citedDecision>Relford</citedDecision> .  17 When considered together with the doubtful foundations of O’Callahan , the confusion wrought by the decision leads us to conclude that we should read Clause 14 in accord with the plain meaning of its language as we did in the many years before O’Callahan was decided.  That case’s novel approach to court-martial jurisdiction must bow “to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning.” Burnet v. Corona do Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 , 406-408 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).  We therefore hold that the requirements of the Constitution are not violated where, as here, a court- *451 martial is convened to try a serviceman who was a member of the Armed Services at the time of the offense charged.  18 The judgment of the Court of Military Appeals is Affirmed.  Petitioner was charged with 14 specifications alleging indecent liberties, lascivious acts, and indecent assault in violation of U. C. M. J., Art. 134, 10 U. S. C. § 934 , 6 specifications alleging assault in violation of Art. 128, 10 U. S. C. § 928 , and 1 specification alleging attempted rape in violation of Art. 80, 10 U. S. C. § 880 .  The specifications alleged to have occurred in Alaska included all of the Article 128 and Article 80 specifications and 7 of the Article 134 specifications.

 App. 1984); United States v. Scott, 15 M. J. 589 (A. C. M. R. 1983) (serviceman’s off-post murder of another serviceman held service connected where crime had its basis in on-post conduct of participants).  Compare United States v. Wilson, 2 M. J. 24 (Ct. Mil.  App. 1976) (off-post robbery and assault of a fellow serviceman held not service connected), and United States v. Tucker, 1 M. J. 463 (Ct. Mil.  App. 1976) (off-post concealment of property stolen from fellow serviceman on-post held not service connected), with United States v. Lockwood, 15 M. J. 1 (Ct. Mil.  App. 1983) (on-post larceny of fellow serviceman’s wallet and use of identification cards in it to obtain loan from an off-post business establishment held service connected), and United States v. Shorte, 18 M. J. 518 (A. F. C. M. R. 1984) (off-post felonious assault committed against fellow serviceman held not service connected).  See Cooper 172-182; Tomes 13-31.  Seven years after United States v. Beeker, the Court of Military Appeals expressly renounced that decision, holding that O’Callahan and <citedDecision>Relford</citedDecision> mandated the conclusion that off-base drug offenses by a serviceman could not be tried by court-martial.  See United States v. McCarthy, supra; United States v. Williams, 2 M. J. 81, 82 (Ct. Mil.  App. 1976); see also United States v. Conn, 6 M. J. 351, 353 (Ct. Mil.  App. 1979); United States v. Alef supra, at 415-418 .  Reversing its position again in 1980, the Court of Military Appeals decided that such a restrictive approach was not required under this Court’s decisions.  United States v. Trottier, 9 M. J. 337, 340-351 (1980).  The court therefore held that “the gravity and immediacy of the threat to military personnel and installations posed by the drug traffic and .
