United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432. In time, this constitutional concept was expanded to grant tax exemption to the income derived from Indian lands, whether tribally or individually owned, even when the privilege of exploitation had been granted to non-Indian lessees. 4 The instrumentality concept ultimately resulted in a decision exempting Indian estates from taxation. Childers v. Beaver, supra. None of these cases held, nor has this Court ever decided, that congressional restriction of an Indian’s income carried an implication of estate tax exemption. The underlying principles on which these decisions are based do not fit the situation of the Oklahoma Indians. Although there are remnants of the form of tribal sovereignty, these Indians have no effective tribal autonomy as in Worcester v. Georgia, supra; and, unlike the Indians involved in The Kansas Indians case, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> they are actually citizens of the State with little to distinguish them from all other citizens except for their limited property restrictions and their tax exemptions. 5 Their lands are held in fee, not in trust, as in the Rickert case, and the doctrine of constitutional immunity from taxation for the income of their holdings on the federal instrumentality theory has been renounced, Helvering v. Mountain Pro *604 ducers Corp., 303 U. S. 376. Childers v. Beaver, <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> was in effect overruled by the Mountain Producers decision. The immunity formerly said to rest on constitutional implication cannot now be resurrected in the form of statutory implication. The cash and securities of which these estates are almost entirely composed were restricted by the Act of January 27,1933. 6 Unless the tax immunity is granted by the restriction clause itself, there is not a word in the Act which even remotely suggests that Congress meant to exempt Indians’ cash and securities from Oklahoma’s estate taxes. We conclude that this Act does not exempt the restricted property from taxation for two reasons: (1) the legislative history of the Act refutes the contention that an exemption was intended; and (2) application of the normal rule against tax exemption by statutory implication prevents our reading such an implication into the Act. The 1933 Act was intended to serve two purposes relevant to this case. One was to continue the restrictions on Indian property for the purpose of protecting the Indians from loss to individuals who might take advantage of them; and the other was to preserve the status of certain *605 Indian land as non-taxable until 1956.

United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U. S. 57, 60. It has applied that rule to taxing acts affecting Indians as to all others. As was said of an excise tax on tobacco produced by the Cherokee Indians in 1870, “If the exemption had been intended, it would doubtless have been expressed.” Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616, 620. In holding the income tax applicable to Indians, the Court said, “The terms of the 1928 Revenue Act are very broad, and nothing there *607 indicates that Indians are to be excepted. ... If exemption exists it must derive plainly from agreements with the Creeks or some Act of Congress dealing with their affairs.” Superintendent v. Commissioner, <targetCase>supra, 420</targetCase>. If Congress intends to prevent the State of Oklahoma from levying a general non-discriminatory estate tax applying alike to all its citizens, it should say so in plain words. Such a conclusion cannot rest on dubious inferences. “Nontaxability and restriction upon alienation are distinct things,” Superintendent v. Commissioner, <targetCase>supra, 421</targetCase>, and when Congress wants to require both nonalienability and nontaxability it can, as it has so often done, say so explicitly. 11 It is true that our interpretation of the 1933 statute must be in accord with the generous and protective spirit which the United States properly feels toward its Indian wards, but we cannot assume that Congress will choose to aid the Indians by permanently granting them immunity from taxes which they are as able as other citizens to pay. It runs counter to any traditional concept of the guardian and ward relationship to suppose that a ward should be exempted from taxation by the nature of his status, and the fact that the federal government is the guardian of its Indian ward is no reason, by itself, why a state should be precluded from taxing the estate of the Indian. We have held that the Indians, like all other citizens, must pay federal income taxes. Superintendent v. Commissioner, <targetCase>supra, 421</targetCase>. “Wardship with limited power over his prop *608 erty” did not there “without more render [the Indian] immune from the common burden.” A federal court has held, in a well-reasoned decision defended before us by the Solicitor General of the United States, who is not a party to this action, that an Indian’s estate is subject to the federal estate tax. Landman v. Commissioner, 123 E. 2d 787. 12 Congress cannot have intended to impose federal income and inheritance taxes on the Indians and at the same time exempt them by implication from similar state taxes. Congress has passed laws under which Indians have become full-fledged citizens of the State of Oklahoma. 13 Ok *609 lahoma supplies for them and their children schools, roads, courts, police protection and all the other benefits of an ordered society. Citizens of Oklahoma must pay for these benefits.

14 If Congress intended to relieve these Indians from the burden of a state inheritance tax as a consequence of our national policy toward Indians, there is still no reason why we should imply that it intended the burden to be borne so heavily by one state. But there is a complete absence of any evidence of congressional belief that these exemptions are required on equitable grounds, no matter on which sovereign the burden falls. Here is a tax based solely on ability to pay. 15 “Only the same duties are exacted as from our own citizens. The burden must rest *610 somewhere. Revenue is indispensable to meet the public necessities. Is it unreasonable that this small portion of it shall rest upon these Indians?” Cherokee Tobacco, <targetCase>supra, p. 621</targetCase>. Recognizing that equality of privilege and equality of obligation should be inseparable associates, we have recently swept away many of the means of tax favoritism. Graves v. New York ex rel. O’Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, permitted states to impose income taxes upon government employees, and Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, permitted the federal government to impose taxes on state employees. O’Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277, overruled a previous decision which held that judges should not pay taxes just as other citizens, and Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., <targetCase>supra,</targetCase> repudiated former decisions seriously limiting state and federal power to tax. See also Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514, and James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134. The trend of these cases should not now be reversed. What has been said requires the conclusion that the cash and securities are not exempted by any existing legislation from state estate taxation, and this is likewise true of the personal property in two of these estates. The validity of the taxes on the transfer of the land presents a somewhat different problem. Some of these lands are exempt from direct taxation by virtue of explicit congressional command. The Act of May 10, 1928, 45 Stat.

The 1933 Act discussed above was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Congressman Hastings of Oklahoma, who was himself of Indian descent. Hearings before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, note 13, <targetCase>supra, p. 4</targetCase>. “The view of the survey staff is that the Indians must be educated to pay taxes just as they must be educated to do other things. The taxes imposed upon them must always be properly related to their capacity to pay. For them an income tax would be infinitely better than a general property tax because of its direct relationship to their capacity to pay. The returns from such a tax would obviously be extremely small at the outset, but they would increase with the increasing productivity of the Indians.” The Problem of Indian Administration, note 13, <targetCase>supra, 478</targetCase>; and see also 43, 98.
