 But as we emphasized in Kennedy itself, no one factor should be considered controlling as they “may often point in differing directions.” 372 U. S., at 169 .  The second significant departure in Halper .  was the Court’s decision to “asses[s] the character of the actual sanctions imposed,” 490 U. S., at 447 , rather than, as Kennedy demanded, evaluating the “statute on its face” to determine whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction, 372 U. S., at 169 .  We believe that Halper’s deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered.  5 AlS subsequent *102 eases have demonstrated, Hamper’s test for determining whether a particular sanction is “punitive,” and thus subject to the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause, has proved unworkable.  We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect.  See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, <citedDecision>511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14</citedDecision> (1994); United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 284-285, n. 2 (1996).  6 If a sanction must be “solely” remedial (i.  e., entirely nonde-terrent) to avoid implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause, then no civil penalties are beyond the scope of the Clause.  Under Halper’s method of analysis, a court must also look at the “sanction actually imposed” to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated.  Thus, it will not be possible to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is violated until a defendant has proceeded through a trial to judgment.  But in those eases where the civil proceeding follows the criminal proceeding, this approach flies in the face of the notion that the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the government from even “attempting a second time to punish criminally.” Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399 (emphasis added).  Finally, it should be noted that some of the ills at which Halper was directed are addressed by other constitutional *103 provisions.

 E. g., Zukas v. Hinson, 1997 WL 623648 (CA11, Oet.  21, 1997) (challenge to FAA revocation of a commercial pilot’s license as violative of double jeopardy); E. B. v. Verniero, 119 F. 3d 1077 (CA3 1997) (challenge to “Megan’s Law” as violative of double jeopardy); Jones v. Securities & Exchange Comm’n, 115 F. 3d 1173 (CA4 1997) (challenge to SEC debarment proceeding as violative of double jeopardy); United States v. Rice, 109 F. 3d 151 (CA3 1997) (challenge to criminal drug prosecution following general military discharge for same conduct as violative of double jeopardy); United States v. Hatfield, 108 F. 3d 67 (CA4 1997) (challenge to criminal fraud prosecution as foreclosed by previous debarment from Government contracting); Taylor v. Cisneros, 102 F. 3d 1334 (CA3 1996) (challenge to eviction from federally subsidized housing based on guilty plea to possession of drug paraphernalia as violative of double jeopardy); United States v. Galan, 82 F. 3d 639 (CA5) (challenge to prosecution for prison escape following prison disciplinary proceeding as violative of double jeopardy), cert. denied, 519 U. S. 867 (1996).  In his concurrence, Justice Stevens criticizes us for reexamining our Halper opinion rather than deciding the case on what he believes is the narrower Blockburger grounds.  But the question upon which we granted certiorari in this ease is “whether imposition upon petitioners of monetary-fines as in personam civil penalties by the Department of the Treasury, together with other sanctions, is ‘punishment’ for purposes of the Double *102 Jeopardy Clause.” Pet. for Cert. i.  It is this question, and not the Blockburger issue, upon which there is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in this case did not even pass upon the Bloekbwrger question, finding it unnecessary to do so. 92 F. 3d, at 1028, n. 3 .  In <citedDecision>Kurth Ranch</citedDecision> , we held that the presence a purpose effect is not dispositive of the double jeopardy question.  <citedDecision>511 U. S., at 781</citedDecision> .  Rather, we applied a Kennedy-like test, see <citedDecision>511 U. S., at 780-783</citedDecision> , before concluding that Montana’s dangerous drug tax was “the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution,” <citedDecision>id., at 784</citedDecision> .  Similarly, in Ursery , we rejected the notion that civil in rem forfeitures violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  518 U. S., at 270-271 .  We upheld such forfeitures, relying on the historical support for the notion that such forfeitures are civil and thus do not implicate double jeopardy.  Id., at 292 .  “We... hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution.” United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 448-449 (1989).
**Concurrence Opinion**
 I agree with the majority and with Justice Souter that United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), does not provide proper guidance for distinguishing between criminal and noncriminal sanctions and proceedings.  I also agree that United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980), and Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), set forth the proper approach.  I do not join the Court’s opinion, however, because I disagree with its reasoning in two respects.  First, unlike the Court I would not say that “‘only the clearest proof will “transform” into a criminal punishment what a legislature calls a “civil remedy.” Ante, at 100.  I understand that the Court has taken this language from earlier cases. See Ward, supra, at 249 .  But the limitation that the language suggests is not consistent with what the Court has actually done.  Rather, in fact if not in theory, the Court has simply applied factors of the Kennedy variety to the matter at hand. In Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, <citedDecision>511 U. S. 767</citedDecision> (1994), for example, the Court held that the collection of a state tax imposed on the possession and storage of drugs was “the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution” because, among other things, the tax was “remarkably high”; it had “an obvious deterrent purpose”; it was “conditioned on the commission of a crime”; it was “exacted only after the taxpayer ha[d] been arrested for the precise conduct that gives rise to the tax obligation”; its alternative function of raising revenue could be equally well served by increasing the fine imposed on the activity; and it departed radically from “normal revenue laws” by taxing contraband goods perhaps destroyed before the tax was imposed.  <citedDecision>Id., at 781-784</citedDecision> .  This reasoning tracks the nonexclusive list of factors set forth in Kennedy , and it is, I believe, the proper approach.  The “clearest proof” language *116 is consequently misleading, and I would consign it to the same legal limbo where Halper now rests.  Second, I would not decide now that a ate a statute only “ ‘on its face,’ ” ante, at 100 (quoting Kennedy, supra, at 169 ), rather than “assessing the character of the actual sanctions imposed,” Halper, supra, at 447 ; ante, at 101.  Halper involvéd an ordinary civil-fine statute that as normally applied would not have created any “double jeopardy” problem.  It was not the statute itself, but rather the disproportionate relation between fine and conduct as the statute was applied in the individual case that led this Court, unanimously, to find that the “civil penalty” was, in those circumstances, a second “punishment” that constituted double jeopardy.  See 490 U. S., at 439, 452 (finding that $130,000 penalty was “sufficiently disproportionate” to $585 loss plus approximately $16,000 in Government expenses caused by Halper’s fraud to constitute a second punishment in violation of double jeopardy).
