**Combined Opinion**
 An act compelling profession of allegiance to a religion, no matter how subtly or tenuously promoted, is bad.  But an act promoting good citizenship and national allegiance is within the domain of governmental authority and is therefore to be judged by the same considerations of power and of constitutionality as those involved in the many *655 claims of immunity from civil obedience because of religious scruples.  That claims are pressed on behalf of sincere religious convictions does not of itself establish their constitutional validity.  Nor does waving the banner of religious freedom relieve us from examining into the power we are asked to deny the states.  Otherwise the doctrine of separation of church and state, so cardinal in the history of this nation and for the liberty of our people, would mean not the disestablishment of a state church but the establishment of all churches and of all religious groups.  The subjection of dissidents to the general requirement of saluting the flag, as a measure conducive to the training of children in good citizenship, is very far from being the first instance of exacting obedience to general laws that have offended deep religious scruples.  Compulsory vaccination, see Jacobson v. Massachusetts, <citedDecision>197 U.S. 11</citedDecision> , food inspection regulations, see Shapiro v. Lyle, 30 F.2d 971 , the obligation to bear arms, see Hamilton v. Regents, 293 U.S. 245, 267 , testimonial duties, see Stansbury v. Marks, 2 Dall. 213 , compulsory medical treatment, see People v. Vogelgesang, 221 N.Y. 290 , 116 N.E. 977 Â— these are but illustrations of conduct that has often been compelled in the enforcement of legislation of general applicability even though the religious consciences of particular individuals rebelled at the exaction.  Law is concerned with external behavior and not with the inner life of man.  It rests in large measure upon compulsion.  Socrates lives in history partly because he gave his life for the conviction that duty of obedience to secular law does not presuppose consent to its enactment or belief in its virtue.  The consent upon which free government rests is the consent that comes from sharing in the process of making and unmaking laws.  The state is not shut out from a domain because the individual conscience may deny the state's claim.  The individual conscience *656 may profess what faith it chooses.
