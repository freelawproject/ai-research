**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 Since we specifically limited the question on which certiorari was granted in order not to consider the potential retroactive effects of overruling Bellas Hess, I believe we should leave that issue for another day. If indeed fears about retroactivity are driving the Court’s decision in this case, we would be better served, in my view, to address *333 those concerns directly rather than permit them to infect our formulation of the applicable substantive rule.  Although Congress can and should address itself to this area of law, we should not adhere to a decision, however right it was at the time, that by reason of later cases and economic reality can no longer be rationally justified.  The Commerce Clause aspect of Bellas Hess, along with its due process holding, should be overruled.  See, e. g., P. Hartman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxation § 10.8 (1981); Hartman, Collection of Use Tax on Out-of-State Mail-Order Sales, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 993 , 1006-1015 (1986); Hellerstein, Significant Sales and Use Tax Developments During the Past Half Century, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 961 , 984-985 (1986); McCray, Overturning Bellas Hess: Due Process Considerations, 1985 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 265, 288-290; Rothfeld, Mail Order Sales and State Jurisdiction to Tax, 53 Tax Notes 1405 , 1414-1418 (1991).  Similarly, I am unconvinced by the majority’s reliance on subsequent decisions that have cited Bellas Hess.  See ante, at 311.  In D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, <citedDecision>486 U. S. 24, 33</citedDecision> (1988), for example, we distinguished Bellas Hess on the basis of the company’s “significant economic presence in Louisiana, its many connections with the State, and the direct benefits it receives from Louisiana in conducting its business.” We then went on to note that the situation presented was much more analogous to that in National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551 (1977).  See <citedDecision>486 U. S., at 33-34</citedDecision> .  In Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981), the Court cited Bellas Hess not to revalidate the physical-presence requirement, but rather to establish that a “nexus” must exist to justify imposition of a state tax. And finally, in *325 Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 437 (1980), the Court cited Bellas Hess for the due process requirements necessary to sustain a tax. In my view, these citations hardly signal the continuing support of Bellas Hess that the majority seems to find persuasive.  Instead of remanding for consideration of whether Quill’s ownership of software constitutes sufficient physical presence under its new Commerce Clause nexus requirement, the majority concludes as a matter of law that it does not.  See ante, at 315, n. 8.  In so doing, the majority rebuffs North Dakota’s challenge without setting out any clear standard for what meets the Commerce Clause physical-presence nexus standard and without affording the State an opportunity on remand to attempt to develop facts or otherwise to argue that Quill’s presence is constitutionally sufficient.  For the federal rule, see Flora v. United States, 357 U. S. 63 (1958); see generally J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation § 58A.05 (1992).  North Dakota appears to follow the same principle.
