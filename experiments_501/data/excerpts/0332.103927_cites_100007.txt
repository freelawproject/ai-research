**Combined Opinion**
 Ordinarily we do not, in admiralty, more than in other *99 cases, review the concurrent findings of fact of two courts below.  The Carib Prince, 170 U. S. 655, 658 ; The Wildcroft, 201 U. S. 378, 387 ; Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Co., supra; Piedmont Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., 254 U. S. 1, 13 ; Just v. Chambers, 312 U. S. 383, 385 .  Here, however, both courts below, holding themselves bound by The Pinar Del Rio, supra, have, on the facts found, held as a matter of law that the staging was seaworthy despite its defect.  That conclusion of law is reviewable here.  Until the enactment of the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007 , 46 U. S. C. § 688 , the maritime law afforded no remedy by way of indemnity beyond maintenance and cure, for the injury to a seaman caused by the mere negligence of a ship’s officer or member of the crew.  But the admiralty rule that the vessel and owner are liable to indemnify a seaman for injury caused by unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment, has been the settled law since this Court’s ruling to that effect in The Osceola, supra, 175 .  Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., 247 U. S. 372, 380-381 ; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, <citedDecision>259 U. S. 255, 258-260</citedDecision> ; Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 134 ; Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, 287 U. S. 367, 370-371 ; Warner v. Goltra, 293 U. S. 155, 158 ; The Arizona v. Anelich, 298 U. S. 110 , 120 et seq.; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, supra, 428-429 ; O’Donnell v. Great Lakes Co., 318 U. S. 36, 40 .  The latter rule seems to have been derived from the seaman’s privilege to abandon a ship improperly fitted out, and was generally applied, before its statement in The Osceola, supra, by numerous decisions of the lower federal courts during the last century.  See The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 121 , footnote 2.  This was a recognized departure from the rule of the English law, which allowed no recovery other than maintenance and cure for injuries caused by unseaworthiness, Couch v. Steel, 3 El.  & Bl. 402, until the enactment of the *100 Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, 39 & 40 Vict., Chap. 80, § 5, reenacted by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, 57 & 58 Vict., Chap. 60, § 458.  By that statute there is annexed to every contract of service between the owner of a ship or the master and any seaman thereof, an obligation that all reasonable means be used to insure the seaworthiness of the ship before and during the voyage.  See Hedley v. Pinkney & Sons S. S. Co., [1894] A. C. 222.  In a number of cases in the federal courts, decided before The Osceola, supra, the right of the seaman to recover for injuries caused by unseaworthiness seems to have been rested on the negligent failure, usually by the seaman’s officers or fellow seamen, to supply seaworthy appliances.  The Noddleburn, 28 F. 855 , aff’d, 30 F. 142 ; The Neptuno, 30 F. 925 ; The Frank and Willie, 45 F. 494 ; The Julia Fowler, 49 F. 277 ; William Johnson & Co. v. Johansen, 86 F. 886 ; and see The Columbia, 124 F. 745 ; The Lyndhurst, 149 F. 900 .  But later cases in this and other federal courts have followed the ruling of The Osceola, supra, that the exercise of due diligence does not relieve the owner of his obligation to the seaman to furnish adequate appliances.  2 Carlisle Packing Co. v. <citedDecision>
   Sandanger, supra,
  
  259-260</citedDecision> ; The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 120 et seq.; Beadle v. Spencer, 298 U. S. 124, 128-129 ; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, supra, 428-429, 432 ; The H. A. Scandrett, 87 F. 2d 708 , 710-711; cf. The Edwin I.  Morrison, 153 U. S. 199, 210 .  If the owner is liable for furnishing an unseaworthy appliance, even when he is not negligent, a fortiori his obligation is unaffected by the fact that the negligence of the officers of the vessel contributed to its unseaworthiness.  *101 It is true that before the Jones Act the owner was, in other respects, not responsible for injuries to a seaman caused by the negligence of officers or members of the crew.  But this is not sufficient to insulate the owner from liability for their negligent failure to furnish seaworthy appliances, see Judge Addison Brown, in The Frank and Willie, supra, 495-497; Carlisle Packing Co. v. <citedDecision>
   Sandanger, supra,
  
  259-260</citedDecision> , more than their negligence relieves him from his liability for maintenance and cure.  The Osceola, supra, 175 ; Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, supra, 134 ; Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, 303 U. S. 525, 527 .  It required the Harter Act to relax the exacting obligation to cargo of the owner’s warranty of seaworthiness of ship and tackle.  3 That relaxation has not been extended, either by statute or by decision, to the like obligation of the owner to the seaman.  The defense of the fellow servant rule to suits in admiralty for negligence, a defense precluded by the Jones Act, has never avowedly been deemed applicable to the owner’s stricter obligation to the seaman of the warranty of seaworthiness.  The Osceola, supra, in answer to certified questions, laid down as separately numbered and independent propositions the rule of the owner’s unqualified obligation to furnish seaworthy appliances, and the rule that the owner is not liable to a seaman for the negligence of his fellow servants.  It nowhere intimated that the owner is relieved from liability for providing an unseaworthy appliance, merely because the unseaworthiness was attributable to the negligence of fellow servants of the injured seaman rather than to the negligence of the owner.  Indeed, to support the rule of absolute liability, the Court, see The Osceola, supra, 173-175 , relied on cases in which the vessel or its owner had been held liable for injuries resulting from unseaworthiness, although application of the fellow *102 servant rule would have barred recovery.  Of one, The Frank and Willie, supra, the Court, after pointing out that the seaman was injured by reason of the negligent failure of the mate to provide a safe place in which to work, said, “the question was really one of unseaworthiness and not of negligence.” The Court cited, discussed and relied upon The Noddleburn, supra, Olson v. Flavel, 34 F. 477 , The Frank and Willie, supra, and The Julia Fowler, supra. In each the seaman was injured as a result of his use of unseaworthy appliances rendered so by the negligence of a fellow servant.  In The Julia Fowler, supra, the injury was caused by a fall from a boatswain’s chair which the Court found, as in this case, was rigged with defective rope by reason of the fault of the mate.  The inapplicability of the fellow servant rule to this type of case was recognized explicitly in The Noddleburn, supra, 858, and in The Frank and Willie, supra, 495-497.  And such was our holding in Carlisle Packing Co. v. <citedDecision>Sandanger, supra,</citedDecision> where it was said, at p. 259, “without regard to negligence the vessel was unseaworthy.” See also the discussion in The H. A. Scandrett, supra, 710-711.  In thus refusing to limit, by application of the fellow servant rule, the liability of the vessel and owner for unseaworthiness, this Court was but applying the familiar and then well established rule of non-maritime torts, that the employer’s duty to furnish the employee with safe appliances and a safe place to work, is nondelegable and not qualified by the fellow servant rule.  Hough v. Railway Co., 100 U. S. 213, 216-220 ; Northern Pacific R. Co. v. Herbert, 116 U. S. 642, 647-648 ; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U. S. 368 , 386-388; Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Daniels, 152 U. S. 684, 688-689 .  It would be an anomaly if the fellow servant rule, discredited by the Jones Act as a defense in suits for negligence, were to be resuscitated and extended to suits founded on the warranty of *103 seaworthiness, so as to lower the standard of the owner’s duty to furnish safe appliances below that of the land employer.  The staging from which petitioner fell was an appliance appurtenant to the ship.  It was unseaworthy in the sense that it was inadequate for the purpose for which it was ordinarily used, because of the defective rope with which it was rigged.  Its inadequacy rendered it unseaworthy, whether the mate’s failure to observe the defect was negligent or unavoidable.
**Combined Opinion**
 These conditions, which have generated the exacting re *104 quirement that the vessel or the owner must provide the seaman with seaworthy appliances with which to do his work, likewise require that safe appliances be furnished when and where the work is to be done.  For, as was said in The Osceola, supra, 175 , the owner’s obligation is “to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship.” (Italics supplied.) It is not enough that the “Wichita Falls” had on board sound rope which could have been used to make the staging seaworthy, if in fact the staging was unsafe because sound rope was not used.  The Julia Fowler, supra; The Navarino, 7 F. 2d 743, 746 ; cf. The Portland, 213 F. 699 .  Respondent’s argument that the defective rope was a consumable supply of the vessel, not falling within the requirement that the owner must furnish seaworthy equipment appurtenant to the vessel, is inappropriate here because, as we have said, it was the stage which was unseaworthy, by reason of the use of the defective rope in its construction.  The stage was used in the repair of the ship, and was as intimately associated with it and with the seaman’s employment as are the gangways or other appliances or the passageways used by the seaman in doing his work.  Moreover it would not be enough to say that this case concerns a consumable supply, for in Carlisle Packing Co. v. <citedDecision>Sandanger, supra,</citedDecision> the owner was held liable to a seaman for unseaworthiness, where a consumable supply of the ship was stored in such fashion as to render it dangerous to the seaman who used it.  There gasoline had been negligently placed in a can marked “coal oil” and the seaman was burned by an explosion which resulted when he attempted to build a fire with the gasoline, which he had taken out of the can thinking it to be coal oil.  The statement from The Pinar Del Rio, supra, relied upon by the two courts below, could be taken to support *105 their decision, only on the assumption either that the presence of sound rope on the “Wichita Falls” afforded an excuse for the failure to provide a safe staging, or that antecedent negligence of the mate in directing the use of the defective rope relieved the owner from liability for furnishing the appliance thereby rendered unseaworthy.  But as we have seen, neither assumption is tenable in the light of our decisions before and since The Pinar Del Rio, supra. So far as this statement supports these assumptions, it is disapproved.  We cannot follow it, and also follow The Osceola, supra, the cases which it approved and Carlisle Packing Co. v. <citedDecision>Sandanger, supra.</citedDecision> We prefer to follow the latter as the more consonant with principle and authority.  Reversed.  Mr. Justice Roberts: I think the judgment is wrong.  The case does not present a situation calling for liberalizing the maritime law in favor of seamen by abolishing the defense of a fellow seaman’s negligence.  Congress did that in 1920 ( 41 Stat. 1007 ).  But it required actions in such situations to be brought within two years, which it subsequently extended to three years.  The sole question is whether recovery should be permitted beyond the time when Congress said action must be instituted.
**Combined Opinion**
 His injury was due entirely to the negligent selection by the mate of a piece of bad rope when ample good rope was at hand. The District Court found that the mate was negligent, the Circuit Court of Appeals accepted the finding, and the disposition of the case in this court is on the assumption of the correctness of this finding.  The question, therefore, is whether the ship is liable for the mate’s negligent choice of a defective piece of rope when there was plenty of good rope aboard.  Under the principles announced in The Osceola , recovery in admiralty for a maritime tort is barred by the mate’s negligence.  It was to avoid the interposition of such a defense of a fellow servant’s act that the Jones Act made the Federal Employers’ Liability Act applicable to the claims of injured seamen.  .  The court professes to have to choose between the doctrine it reads into the decision in The Osceola case and the ruling in Pinar Del Rio.  But further it asserts that Pinar Del Rio is in conflict with Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, <citedDecision>259 U. S. 255</citedDecision> , an opinion written by the same justice who wrote the opinion in the Pinar Del Rio case. The cited authority, as I read it, clearly ruled that in order for a seaman to recover for an injury where the ship is unseaworthy the unseaworthiness must be the direct cause of his injury.  That was an action brought in a state court by an injured seaman against the owner of a motor boat.  When the boat left on her voyage a can intended for the use of the crew, supposed to contain coal oil, and so labeled, had been filled with gasoline and the seaman, without notice of this fact, attempted to use the contents and was *111 burned.  The supply of life preservers was insufficient and his injuries were aggravated by his having to search for one before he could jump overboard and extinguish the flames consuming his clothing.  A verdict and judgment for the seaman was sustained.  This court found that erroneous instructions had been given the jury but held the error harmless since the record showed that, without regard to the owner’s negligence, the vessel was unseaworthy when she left the dock, and the court held (p. 259): “.  .
