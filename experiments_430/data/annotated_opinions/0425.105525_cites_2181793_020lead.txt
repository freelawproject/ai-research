Brief for respondent, p. 31, United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U. S. 11 : “Indeed, we think the constitutional case is, if anything, clearer for the court-martial of Toth, who was a soldier at the time of his offense, than it is for a civilian accompanying the armed forces.” Perlstein v.

We have examined all the cases of military trial of civilians by the *34 British or American Armies prior to and contemporaneous with the Constitution that the Government has advanced or that we were able to find by independent research.  Without exception these cases appear to have involved trials during wartime in the area of battle— “in the field” — or in occupied enemy territory.  Even in these areas there are only isolated instances of military trial of “dependents” accompanying the armed forces.  Apparently the normal method of disciplining camp followers was to expel them from the camp or to take away their ration privileges.  Experts on military law, the Judge Advocate General and the Attorney General have repeatedly taken the position that “in the field” means in an area of actual fighting.
