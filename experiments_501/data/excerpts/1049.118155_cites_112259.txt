CHIEF Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the Court. The Government administratively imposed monetary penalties and occupational debarment on petitioners for violation of federal banking statutes, and later criminally indicted them for essentially the same conduct.  We hold that the *96 Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not a bar to the later criminal prosecution because the administrative proceedings were civil, not criminal.  Our reasons for so holding in large part disavow the method of analysis used in United States v. Halper, <citedDecision>490 U. S. 435, 448</citedDecision> (1989), and reaffirm the previously established rule exemplified in United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980).  During the early and mid-1980’s, petitioner John Hudson was the chairman and controlling shareholder of the First National Bank of Tipton (Tipton) and the First National Bank of Hammon (Hammon).  1 During the same period, petitioner Jack Rackley was president of Tipton and a member of the board of directors of Hammon, and petitioner Larry Baresel was a member of the board of directors of both Tipton and Hammon.  An examination of Tipton and Hammon led the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to conclude that petitioners had used their bank positions to arrange a series of loans to third parties in violation of various federal banking statutes and regulations.  According to the OCC, those loans, while nominally made to third parties, were in reality made to Hudson in order to enable him to redeem bank stock that he had pledged as collateral on defaulted loans.  On February 13,1989, OCC issued a “Notice of Assessment of Civil Money Penalty.” The notice alleged that petitioners had violated 12 U. S. C. §§ 84 (a)(1) and 375b (1982 ed.) and 12 CFR §§ 31.2 (b) and 215.4(b) (1986) by causing the banks with which they were associated to make loans to nominee borrowers in a maimer that unlawfully allowed Hudson to receive the benefit of the loans.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 89a.

 The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court’s holding on the nonparticipation sanction issue, but vacated and remanded to the District Court on the money sanction issue.  14 F. 3d 536 (CA10 1994).  The District Court on remand granted petitioners’ motion to dismiss the indictments.  This time the Government appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed.  92 F. 3d 1026 (1996).  That court held, following HaVper, that the actual fines imposed by the Government were not so grossly disproportional to the proved damages to the Government as to render the sanctions “punishment” for double jeopardy purposes.  We granted certiorari, 520 U. S. 1165 (1997), because of concerns about the wide variety of novel double jeopardy claims spawned in the wake of <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> .  4 We now affirm, but for different reasons.  The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no “person [shall] be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” We have long recognized that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not prohibit the imposition of *99 all additional sanctions that could, “‘in common parlance,’” be described as punishment.  United States ex rel. Marcus v. Hess, 317 U. S. 537, 549 (1943) (quoting Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, 19 (1852)).  The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense, Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938); see also Hess, supra, at 548-549 (“Only” “criminal punishment” “subjeet[s] the defendant to ‘jeopardy 3 within the constitutional meaning”); Breed v. Jones, 421 U. S. 519, 528 (1975) (“In the constitutional sense, jeopardy describes the risk that is traditionally associated with a criminal prosecution”), and then only when such occurs in successive proceedings, see Missouri v. Hunter, 459 Ú.  S. 359, 366 (1983).  Whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is, at least initially, a matter of statutory construction.  Helvering, supra, at 399 .  A court must first ask whether the legislature, “in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.” Ward, 448 U. S., at 248 .  Even in those eases where the legislature “has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect,” id., at 248-249 , as to “transfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty,” Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956).  In making this latter determination, the factors listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), provide useful guideposts, including: (1) “[wjhether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint”; (2) “whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment”; (3) “whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter (4) “whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment — retribution and deterrence”; (5) “whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime”; (6) “whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it”; and (7) “whether it appears *100 excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.” It is important to note, however, that “these factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face,” id., at 169 , and “only the clearest proof” will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty, Ward, supra, at 249 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Our opinion in United States v. <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> marked the first time we applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to a sanction without first determining that it was criminal in nature.  In that case, Irwin Halper was convicted of, inter alia, violating the criminal false claims statute, 18 U. S. C. § 287 , based on his submission of 65 inflated Medicare claims each of which overcharged the Government by $9.  He was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and fined $5,000.  The Government then brought an action against Halper under the civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3731 (1982 ed., Supp. II).  The remedial provisions of the False Claims Act provided that a violation of the Act rendered one “liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $2,000, an amount equal to 2 times the amount of damages the Government sustains because of the act of that person, and costs of the civil action.” Id., § 3729.  Given Halper’s 65 separate violations of the Act, he appeared to be liable for a penalty of $130,000, despite the fact he actually defrauded the Government of less than $600.  However, the District Court, concluded that a penalty of this magnitude would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause in light of Halper’s previous criminal conviction.  While explicitly recognizing that the statutory damages provision of the Act “was not itself a criminal punishment,” the District Court nonetheless concluded that application of the full penalty to Halper would constitute a second “punishment” in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  <citedDecision>490 U. S., at 438-439</citedDecision> .  On direct appeal, this Court affirmed.  As the <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> Court saw it, the imposition of “punishment” of any kind was *101 subject to double jeopardy constraints, and whether a sanction constituted “punishment” depended primarily on whether it served the traditional “goals of punishment,” namely, “retribution and deterrence.” <citedDecision>Id., at 448</citedDecision> .  Any sanction that was so “overwhelmingly disproportionate” to the injury caused that it could not “fairly be said solely to serve [the] remedial purpose” of compensating the Government for its loss, was thought to be explainable only as “serving either retributive or deterrent purposes.” See <citedDecision>id., at 448-449</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  The analysis applied by the <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> Court deviated from our traditional double jeopardy doctrine in two key respects.  First, the <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> Court bypassed the threshold question: whether the successive punishment at issue is a “criminal” punishment.  Instead, it focused on whether the sanction, regardless of whether it was civil or criminal, was so grossly disproportionate to the harm caused as to constitute “punishment.” In so doing, the Court elevated a single Kennedy factor — whether the sanction appeared excessive in relation to its nonpunitive purposes — to dispositive status.  But as we emphasized in Kennedy itself, no one factor should be considered controlling as they “may often point in differing directions.” 372 U. S., at 169 .  The second significant departure in <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> .  was the Court’s decision to “asses[s] the character of the actual sanctions imposed,” <citedDecision>490 U. S., at 447</citedDecision> , rather than, as Kennedy demanded, evaluating the “statute on its face” to determine whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction, 372 U. S., at 169 .  We believe that Halper’s deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered.  5 AlS subsequent *102 eases have demonstrated, Hamper’s test for determining whether a particular sanction is “punitive,” and thus subject to the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause, has proved unworkable.  We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect.  See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14 (1994); United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 284-285, n. 2 (1996).  6 If a sanction must be “solely” remedial (i.  e., entirely nonde-terrent) to avoid implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause, then no civil penalties are beyond the scope of the Clause.  Under Halper’s method of analysis, a court must also look at the “sanction actually imposed” to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is implicated.  Thus, it will not be possible to determine whether the Double Jeopardy Clause is violated until a defendant has proceeded through a trial to judgment.  But in those eases where the civil proceeding follows the criminal proceeding, this approach flies in the face of the notion that the Double Jeopardy Clause forbids the government from even “attempting a second time to punish criminally.” Helvering, 303 U. S., at 399 (emphasis added).  Finally, it should be noted that some of the ills at which <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> was directed are addressed by other constitutional *103 provisions.  The Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses already protect individuals from sanctions which are downright irrational.  Williamson v. Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., 348 U. S. 483 (1955).  The Eighth Amendment protects against excessive civil fines, including forfeitures.  Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544 (1993); Austin v. United States, 509 U. S. 602 (1993).  The additional protection afforded by extending double jeopardy protections to proceedings heretofore thought to be civil is more than offset by the confusion created by attempting to distinguish between “punitive” and “nonpunitive” penalties.  Applying traditional double jeopardy principles to the facts of this ease, it is clear that the criminal prosecution of these petitioners would not.

 The consent orders also contained language providing that they did not constitute "a waiver of any right, power, or authority of any other representatives of the United States, or agencies thereof, to bring other actions deemed appropriate.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 133a, 143a, 138a.  The Court of Appeals ultimately held that this provision was not a waiver of petitioners’ double jeopardy claim.  14 F. 3d 536, 539 (CA10 1994).  Only petitioner Raekley was indicted for making false bank entries in violation of 18 U. S. C. § 1005 .  E. g., Zukas v. Hinson, 1997 WL 623648 (CA11, Oet.  21, 1997) (challenge to FAA revocation of a commercial pilot’s license as violative of double jeopardy); E. B. v. Verniero, 119 F. 3d 1077 (CA3 1997) (challenge to “Megan’s Law” as violative of double jeopardy); Jones v. Securities & Exchange Comm’n, 115 F. 3d 1173 (CA4 1997) (challenge to SEC debarment proceeding as violative of double jeopardy); United States v. Rice, 109 F. 3d 151 (CA3 1997) (challenge to criminal drug prosecution following general military discharge for same conduct as violative of double jeopardy); United States v. Hatfield, 108 F. 3d 67 (CA4 1997) (challenge to criminal fraud prosecution as foreclosed by previous debarment from Government contracting); Taylor v. Cisneros, 102 F. 3d 1334 (CA3 1996) (challenge to eviction from federally subsidized housing based on guilty plea to possession of drug paraphernalia as violative of double jeopardy); United States v. Galan, 82 F. 3d 639 (CA5) (challenge to prosecution for prison escape following prison disciplinary proceeding as violative of double jeopardy), cert. denied, 519 U. S. 867 (1996).  In his concurrence, Justice Stevens criticizes us for reexamining our <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> opinion rather than deciding the case on what he believes is the narrower Blockburger grounds.  But the question upon which we granted certiorari in this ease is “whether imposition upon petitioners of monetary-fines as in personam civil penalties by the Department of the Treasury, together with other sanctions, is ‘punishment’ for purposes of the Double *102 Jeopardy Clause.” Pet. for Cert. i.  It is this question, and not the Blockburger issue, upon which there is a conflict among the Courts of Appeals.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in this case did not even pass upon the Bloekbwrger question, finding it unnecessary to do so. 92 F. 3d, at 1028, n. 3 .  In Kurth Ranch , we held that the presence a purpose effect is not dispositive of the double jeopardy question.  511 U. S., at 781 .  Rather, we applied a Kennedy-like test, see 511 U. S., at 780-783 , before concluding that Montana’s dangerous drug tax was “the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution,” id., at 784 .  Similarly, in Ursery , we rejected the notion that civil in rem forfeitures violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  518 U. S., at 270-271 .  We upheld such forfeitures, relying on the historical support for the notion that such forfeitures are civil and thus do not implicate double jeopardy.  Id., at 292 .  “We... hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution.” United States v. Halper, <citedDecision>490 U. S. 435, 448-449</citedDecision> (1989).

*115 Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring in the judgment.  I agree with the majority and with Justice Souter that United States v. Halper, <citedDecision>490 U. S. 435</citedDecision> (1989), does not provide proper guidance for distinguishing between criminal and noncriminal sanctions and proceedings.  I also agree that United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980), and Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), set forth the proper approach.  I do not join the Court’s opinion, however, because I disagree with its reasoning in two respects.  First, unlike the Court I would not say that “‘only the clearest proof will “transform” into a criminal punishment what a legislature calls a “civil remedy.” Ante, at 100.  I understand that the Court has taken this language from earlier cases. See Ward, supra, at 249 .  But the limitation that the language suggests is not consistent with what the Court has actually done.  Rather, in fact if not in theory, the Court has simply applied factors of the Kennedy variety to the matter at hand. In Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767 (1994), for example, the Court held that the collection of a state tax imposed on the possession and storage of drugs was “the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution” because, among other things, the tax was “remarkably high”; it had “an obvious deterrent purpose”; it was “conditioned on the commission of a crime”; it was “exacted only after the taxpayer ha[d] been arrested for the precise conduct that gives rise to the tax obligation”; its alternative function of raising revenue could be equally well served by increasing the fine imposed on the activity; and it departed radically from “normal revenue laws” by taxing contraband goods perhaps destroyed before the tax was imposed.  Id., at 781-784 .  This reasoning tracks the nonexclusive list of factors set forth in Kennedy , and it is, I believe, the proper approach.  The “clearest proof” language *116 is consequently misleading, and I would consign it to the same legal limbo where <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> now rests.  Second, I would not decide now that a ate a statute only “ ‘on its face,’ ” ante, at 100 (quoting Kennedy, supra, at 169 ), rather than “assessing the character of the actual sanctions imposed,” <citedDecision>Halper, supra, at 447</citedDecision> ; ante, at 101.  <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> involvéd an ordinary civil-fine statute that as normally applied would not have created any “double jeopardy” problem.  It was not the statute itself, but rather the disproportionate relation between fine and conduct as the statute was applied in the individual case that led this Court, unanimously, to find that the “civil penalty” was, in those circumstances, a second “punishment” that constituted double jeopardy.  See <citedDecision>490 U. S., at 439, 452</citedDecision> (finding that $130,000 penalty was “sufficiently disproportionate” to $585 loss plus approximately $16,000 in Government expenses caused by Halper’s fraud to constitute a second punishment in violation of double jeopardy).  Of course, the Court in <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> might have reached the same result through application of the constitutional prohibition of “excessive fines.” See ante, at 103; Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544, 558-559 (1993); <citedDecision>Halper, supra, at 449</citedDecision> (emphasizing that <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> was “the rare case” in which there was an “overwhelmingly disproportionate” fine).  But that is not what the Court there said.  And nothing in the majority’s opinion today explains why we should abandon this aspect of Hamper's holding.  Indeed, in context, the language of Kennedy that suggests that the Court should consider the statute on its face does not suggest that there may not be further analysis of a penalty as it is applied in a particular case. See 372 U. S., at 169 .  Most of the lower court confusion and criticism of <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> appears to have focused on the problem of characterizing — by examining the face of the statute — the purposes of a civil penalty as punishment, not on the application of double jeopardy analysis to the penalties that are imposed in particular cases. It seems to me quite possible that *117 a statute that provides for a punishment that normally is civil in nature could nonetheless amount to a criminal punishment as applied in special circumstances.  And I would not now hold to the contrary.  That said, an analysis of the Kennedy factors still leads me to the conclusion that the statutory penalty in this case is not on its face a criminal penalty.  Nor, in my view, does the application of the statute to the petitioners in this ease amount to criminal punishment.  I therefore concur in the judgment.

S. 767 (1994), for example, the Court held that the collection of a state tax imposed on the possession and storage of drugs was “the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution” because, among other things, the tax was “remarkably high”; it had “an obvious deterrent purpose”; it was “conditioned on the commission of a crime”; it was “exacted only after the taxpayer ha[d] been arrested for the precise conduct that gives rise to the tax obligation”; its alternative function of raising revenue could be equally well served by increasing the fine imposed on the activity; and it departed radically from “normal revenue laws” by taxing contraband goods perhaps destroyed before the tax was imposed.  Id., at 781-784 .  This reasoning tracks the nonexclusive list of factors set forth in Kennedy , and it is, I believe, the proper approach.  The “clearest proof” language *116 is consequently misleading, and I would consign it to the same legal limbo where <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> now rests.  Second, I would not decide now that a ate a statute only “ ‘on its face,’ ” ante, at 100 (quoting Kennedy, supra, at 169 ), rather than “assessing the character of the actual sanctions imposed,” <citedDecision>Halper, supra, at 447</citedDecision> ; ante, at 101.  <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> involvéd an ordinary civil-fine statute that as normally applied would not have created any “double jeopardy” problem.  It was not the statute itself, but rather the disproportionate relation between fine and conduct as the statute was applied in the individual case that led this Court, unanimously, to find that the “civil penalty” was, in those circumstances, a second “punishment” that constituted double jeopardy.  See <citedDecision>490 U. S., at 439, 452</citedDecision> (finding that $130,000 penalty was “sufficiently disproportionate” to $585 loss plus approximately $16,000 in Government expenses caused by Halper’s fraud to constitute a second punishment in violation of double jeopardy).  Of course, the Court in <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> might have reached the same result through application of the constitutional prohibition of “excessive fines.” See ante, at 103; Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544, 558-559 (1993); <citedDecision>Halper, supra, at 449</citedDecision> (emphasizing that <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> was “the rare case” in which there was an “overwhelmingly disproportionate” fine).  But that is not what the Court there said.  And nothing in the majority’s opinion today explains why we should abandon this aspect of Hamper's holding.  Indeed, in context, the language of Kennedy that suggests that the Court should consider the statute on its face does not suggest that there may not be further analysis of a penalty as it is applied in a particular case. See 372 U. S., at 169 .  Most of the lower court confusion and criticism of <citedDecision>Halper</citedDecision> appears to have focused on the problem of characterizing — by examining the face of the statute — the purposes of a civil penalty as punishment, not on the application of double jeopardy analysis to the penalties that are imposed in particular cases. It seems to me quite possible that *117 a statute that provides for a punishment that normally is civil in nature could nonetheless amount to a criminal punishment as applied in special circumstances.  And I would not now hold to the contrary.  That said, an analysis of the Kennedy factors still leads me to the conclusion that the statutory penalty in this case is not on its face a criminal penalty.  Nor, in my view, does the application of the statute to the petitioners in this ease amount to criminal punishment.  I therefore concur in the judgment.
