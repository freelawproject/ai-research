 .”); In re Kemmler, 136 U. S. 436, 447 (1890) (“Punishments are cruel when they involve torture or a lingering death .  .  .”).  See also Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459, 464 (1947) (second attempt at electrocution found not to violate *171 Eighth Amendment, since failure of initial execution attempt was “an unforeseeable accident” and “[t]here [was] no purpose to inflict unnecessary pain nor any unnecessary pain involved in the proposed execution”).  But the Court has not confined the prohibition embodied in the Eighth Amendment to “barbarous” methods that were generally outlawed in the 18th century.  Instead, the Amendment has been interpreted in a flexible and dynamic manner.  The Court early recognized that “a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth.” Weems v. United States, <citedDecision>217 U. S. 349, 373</citedDecision> (1910).  Thus the Clause forbidding “cruel and unusual” punishments “is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.” <citedDecision>Id., at 378</citedDecision> .  See also Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 429-430 (Powell, J., dissenting); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100-101 (1958) (plurality opinion).  In <citedDecision>Weems</citedDecision> the Court addressed the constitutionality of the Philippine punishment of cadena temporal for the crime of falsifying an official document.  That punishment included imprisonment for at least 12 years and one day, in chains, at hard and painful labor; the loss of many basic civil rights; and subjection to lifetime surveillance.  Although the Court acknowledged the possibility that “the cruelty of pain” may be present in the challenged punishment, <citedDecision>217 U. S., at 366</citedDecision> , it did not rely on that factor, for it rejected the proposition that the Eighth Amendment reaches only punishments that are “inhuman and barbarous, torture and the like.” <citedDecision>Id., at 368</citedDecision> .  Rather, the Court focused on the lack of proportion between the crime and the offense: “Such penalties for such offenses amaze those who have formed their conception of the relation of a state to even its offending citizens from the practice *172 of the American commonwealths, and believe that it is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to offense.” <citedDecision>Id., at 366-367</citedDecision> .  18 Later, in Trop v. Dulles, supra, the Court reviewed the constitutionality of the punishment of denationalization imposed upon a soldier who escaped from an Army stockade and became a deserter for one day. Although the concept of proportionality was not the basis of the holding, the plurality observed in dicta that “[fjines, imprisonment and even execution may be imposed depending upon the enormity of the crime.” 356 U. S., at 100 .  .  The substantive limits imposed by the Eighth Amendment on what can be made criminal and punished were discussed in Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962).  The Court found unconstitutional a state statute that made the status of being addicted to a narcotic drug a criminal offense.  It held, in effect, that it is “cruel and unusual” to impose any punishment at all for the mere status of addiction.  The cruelty in the abstract of the actual sentence imposed was irrelevant: “Even one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the 'crime' of having a common cold.” Id., at 667 .

 It requires, rather, that we look to objective indicia that reflect the public attitude toward a given sanction.  But our cases also make clear that public perceptions of standards of decency with respect to criminal sanctions are not conclusive.  A penalty also must accord with “the dignity of man,” which is the “basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment.” Trop v. Dulles, supra, at 100 (plurality opinion).  This means, at least, that the punishment not be “excessive.” When a form of punishment in the abstract (in this case, whether capital punishment may ever be imposed as a sanction for murder) rather than in the particular (the propriety of death as a penalty to be applied to a specific defendant for a specific crime) is under consideration, the inquiry into “excessiveness” has two aspects.  First, the punishment must not involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.  Furman v. Georgia, supra, at 392-393 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).  See Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S., at 136 ; <citedDecision>Weems</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>United States, supra, at 381</citedDecision> .  Second, the punishment must not be grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.  Trop v. Dulles, supra, at 100 (plurality opinion) (dictum); <citedDecision>Weems</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>United States, supra, at 367</citedDecision> .  *174 B Of course, the requirements of the Eighth Amendment must be applied with an awareness of the limited role to be played by the courts.  This does not mean that judges have no role to play, for the Eighth Amendment is a restraint upon the exercise of legislative power.  “Judicial review, by definition, often involves a conflict between judicial and legislative judgment as to what the Constitution means or requires.  In this respect, Eighth Amendment cases come to us in no different posture.  It seems conceded by all that the Amendment imposes some obligations on the judiciary to judge the constitutionality of punishment and that there are punishments that the Amendment would bar whether legislatively approved or not.” Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 313-314 (White, J., concurring).  See also id., at 433 (Powell, J., dissenting).

 408 U. S., at 316-328 (Marshall, J., concurring).  This conclusion derives primarily from statements made during the debates in the various state conventions called to ratify the Federal Constitution.  For example, Virginia delegate Patrick Henry objected vehemently to the lack of a provision banning “cruel and unusual punishments”: “What has distinguished our ancestors?  — That they would not admit of tortures, or cruel and barbarous punishment.  But Congress may introduce the practice of the civil law, in preference to that of the common law. They may introduce the practice of France, Spain, and Germany — of torturing, to extort a confession of the crime.” 3 J. Elliot, Debates 447-448 (1863).  A similar objection was made in the Massachusetts convention: “They are nowhere restrained from inventing the most cruel and unheard-of punishments and annexing them to crimes; and there is no constitutional check on them, but that racks and gibbets may be amongst the most mild instruments of their discipline.” 2 Elliot, supra, at 111.  The Court remarked on the fact that the law under review “has come to us from a government of a different form and genius from ours,” but it also noted that the punishments it inflicted “would have those bad attributes even if they were found in a Federal enactment and not taken from an alien source.” <citedDecision>217 U. S., at 377</citedDecision> .  Although legislative measures adopted by the people’s chosen representatives provide one important means of ascertaining contemporary values, it is evident that legislative judgments alone cannot be determinative of Eighth Amendment standards since that Amendment was intended to safeguard individuals from the abuse of legislative power.  See Weems v. United States, <citedDecision>217 U. S. 349, 371-373</citedDecision> (1910); Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S., at 258-269 (Brennak, J., concurring).  Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962), illustrates the proposition that penal laws enacted by state legislatures may violate the Eighth Amendment because “in the light of contemporary human knowledge” they “would doubtless be universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.” Id., at 666 .  At the time of Robinson nine States in addition to California had criminal laws that punished addiction similar to the law declared unconstitutional in Robinson .  See Brief for Appellant in Robinson v. California, O. T. 1961, No. 554, p. 15.  See also Furman v. Georgia, supra, at 411 (Blacicmun, J., dissenting): “We should not allow our personal preferences as to the wisdom of legislative and congressional action, or our distaste for such action, to guide our judicial decision in cases such as these.  The temptations to cross that policy line are very great.” See concurring opinions of Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall, 408 U. S., at 257 and 314.  See concurring opinions of Mr. Justice Douglas, Mr. Justice Stewart, and Mr. Justice White, id., at 240, 306 , and 310.
