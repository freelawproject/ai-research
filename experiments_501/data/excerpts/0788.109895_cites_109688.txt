 On the other hand, to require a criminal defendant to stand trial again after he has successfully invoked a statutory right of appeal to upset his first conviction is not an act of governmental oppression of the sort against which the Double Jeopardy Clause was intended to protect.  The common sense of the matter is most pithily, if not most elegantly, expressed in the words of Mr. Justice McLean on circuit in United States v. Keen, 26 F. Cas. 686 (No. 15,510) *92 (CC Ind. 1839).  He vigorously rejected the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited any new trial after the setting aside of a judgment of conviction against the defendant or that it “guarantees to him the right of being hung, to protect him from the danger of a second trial.” Id., at 690 .  Ill Although the primary purpose of the Double Jeopardy Clause was to protect the integrity of a final judgment, see Crist v. Bretz, ante, at 33, this Court has also developed a body of law guarding the separate but related interest of a defendant in avoiding multiple prosecutions even where no final determination of guilt or innocence has been made.  Such interests may be involved in two different situations: the first, in which the trial judge declares a mistrial; the second, in which the trial judge terminates the proceedings favorably to the defendant on a basis not related to factual guilt or innocence.  A When a trial court declares a mistrial, it all but invariably contemplates that the prosecutor will be permitted to proceed anew notwithstanding the defendant’s plea of double jeopardy.  See Lee v. United States, <citedDecision>432 U. S. 23, 30</citedDecision> (1977).  Such a motion may be granted upon the initiative of either party or upon the court’s own initiative.  The fact that the trial judge contemplates that there will be a new trial is not conclusive on the issue of double jeopardy; in passing on the propriety of a declaration of mistrial granted at the behest of the prosecutor or on the court’s own motion, this Court has balanced “the valued right of a defendant to have his trial completed by the particular tribunal summoned to sit in judgment on him,” Downum v. United States, 372 U. S. 734, 736 (1963), against the public interest in insuring that justice is meted out to offenders.  Our very first encounter with this situation came in United *93 States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579 (1824), in which the trial judge' had on his own motion declared a mistrial because of the jury’s inability to reach a verdict.  The Court-said- that trial judges might declare mistrials “whenever, in their opinion, taking all the circumstances into consideration, there is a manifest necessity for the act, or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.” Id., at 580 .  In our recent decision in Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 (1978), we reviewed this Court’s attempts to give content to the term “manifest necessity.” That case, like Doumum, supra, 8 ,.arose from a motion of the prosecution for a mistrial, and we noted that the trial court’s discretion must be exercised with a, careful regard for the interests first described in United States v. Perez.  Arizona v. Washington, supra, at 514-516 .

 Such a motion ,by the defendant is deemed to be a deliberate election on his part to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined before the first trier of fact.  “The important considera *94 tion, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of such error.” United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600, 609 (1976).  But “[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause does protect a defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby to subject defendants to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions.” Id., at 611 .  B We turn now to the relationship between the Double Jeopardy Clause and reprosecution of a defendant who has successfully obtained not a mistrial but a termination of the trial in his favor before any determination of factual guilt or innocence.  Unlike the typical mistrial, the granting of a motion such as this obviously contemplates that the proceedings will terminate then and there in favor of the defendant.  The prosecution, if it wishes to reinstate the proceedings in the face of such a ruling, ordinarily must seek reversal of the decision of the trial court. The Criminal Appeals Act, 18 U. S. C. § 3731 (1976 ed.), as previously noted, makes appealability of a ruling favorable to the defendant depend upon whether further proceedings upon reversal would be barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  Jenkins, 420 U. S., at 370 , held that, regardless of the character of the midtrial termination, appeal was barred if “further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged, would have been required upon reversal and remand.” However, only last Term, in <citedDecision>Lee, supra,</citedDecision> the Government was permitted to institute a second prosecution after a midtrial dismissal of an indictment.  The Court found the circumstances presented by that case “functionally indistinguishable from a declaration of mistrial.” <citedDecision>432 U. S., at 31</citedDecision> .  Thus, <citedDecision>Lee</citedDecision> demonstrated that, at least in some cases, the dismissal of an indictment may be treated on the same basis as the declaration of a mistrial.  *95 In the present case, the District Court’s dismissal of the first count of the indictment was based upon a claim of prein-dictment delay and not on the court’s conclusion that the Government had not produced sufficient evidence to establish the guilt of the defendant.  Respondent Scott points out quite correctly that he had moved to dismiss the indictment on this ground prior to trial, and that had the District Court chosen to grant it at that time the Government could have appealed the ruling under our holding in Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377 (1975).  He also quite correctly points out that jeopardy had undeniably “attached” at the time the District Court terminated the trial in his favor; since a successful Government appeal would require further proceedings in the District Court leading to a factual resolution of the issue of guilt or innocence, Jenkins bars the Government’s appeal.  However, our growing experience with Government appeals convinces us that we must re-examine the rationale of Jenkins in light of Lee, Martin Linen, and other recent expositions of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  IV Our decision in Jenkins was based upon our perceptions of the underlying purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, see supra, at 87: “ ‘The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity ....’” Jenkins, supra, at 370 , quoting Green, 355 U. S., at 187 .  Upon fuller consideration, we are now of the view that this language from Green , while entirely appropriate in the circumstances of that opinion, is not a principle which can be *96 expanded to include situations in which the defendant is responsible for the second prosecution.

 It is instead a picture of a defendant who chooses to avoid conviction and imprisonment, not because of his assertion that the Government has failed to make out a case against him, but because of a legal claim that the Government’s case against him must fail even though it might satisfy the trier of fact that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  We have previously noted that “the trial judge’s characterization of his own action cannot control the classification of the action.” Jorn, 400 U. S., at 478 n. 7 (opinion of Harlan, J.), citing United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267, 290 (1970).  See also Martin Linen, 430 U. S., at 571 ; Wilson, 420 U. S., at 336 .  Despite respondent’s contentions, an appeal is not barred simply because a ruling in favor of a defendant “is based upon facts outside the face of the indictment,” id., at 348 , or be *97 cause it “is granted on the ground .  .  .  that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged,” Lee, <citedDecision>432 U. S., at 30</citedDecision> .  Rather, a defendant is acquitted only when “the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution [in the defendant's favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.” Martin Linen, supra, at 571 .  Where the court, before the' jury returns a verdict, enters a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29, appeal will, be barred, only when “it is plain that the District Court .  .  .  evaluated the Government’s evidence and determined that it was legally] insufficient to sustain a conviction.”., 430 U. S., at 572 .  9 Our opinion in Burks necessarily holds that there has been a “failure of proof,” ante, at 16, requiring an acquittal when the Government does not submit sufficient evidence to rebut a defendant’s essentially factual defense of insanity, though it may otherwise be entitled to have its case submitted to the jury.

 Here, “the lessons of experience” indicate that Government appeals from midtrial dismissals requested by the defendant would significantly advance the public interest in assuring that each defendant shall be subject to a just judgment on the merits of his case, without “enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.” Green, 355 U. S., at 188 .  Accordingly, the contrary holding of United States v. Jenkins is overruled.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.  It is so ordered.  A thorough account of the enactment and development of the Act is set out in Mr. Justice Harlan’s opinion for the Court in United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267, 291-296 (1970).  The rule established in Wilson and Jenkins was later described in the following terms: “[Dismissals (as opposed to mistrials) if they occurred at a stage of the proceeding after which jeopardy had attached, but prior to the factfinder’s conclusion as to guilt or innocence, were final so far as the accused defendant was concerned and could not be appealed by the Government because retrial was barred by double jeopardy.  This made the issue of double jeopardy turn very largely on temporal considerations — if the Court granted an order of dismissal during the factfinding stage of the proceedings, the defendant could not be reprosecuted, but if the dismissal came later, he could.” Lee v. United, States, <citedDecision>432 U. S. 23, 36</citedDecision> (1977) (RehN-qtjist, J., concurring).  The Government contends here that the District Court in Jenkins entered a judgment of acquittal in favor of Jenkins, but our opinion in that case recognized that it could not be said with certainty whether this was the case. See Jenkins, 420 U. S., at 367 .  Two years later, review was provided for all "infamous” crimes.  Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 517, § 5, 26 Stat. 827 .  The Court thereby rejected the English rule set out in Vaux’s Case, 4 Co. Rep. 44a, 76 Eng. Rep. 992 (K. B. 1590), which refused to recognize a plea of autrefois acquit where the initial indictment had been insufficient to support a conviction.  Again, this ruling provided a greater measure of protection for criminal defendants than had been known at the time of the *89 adoption of the Constitution.  A contrary ruling would have altered this Court’s task in such cases as Lee v. United States, <citedDecision>432 U. S. 23</citedDecision> (1977), and Illinois v. Somerville, 410 U. S. 458 (1973).  In so doing, the Court rejected the contention of Mr, Justice Holmes in dissent that “there is no rule that a man may not be tried twice in the same case.” 195 U. S., at 134 .  He went on to say: “If a statute should give the right to take exceptions to the Government, I believe it would be impossible to maintain that the prisoner would be protected by the Constitution from being tried again.  He no more would be put in jeopardy a second time when retried because of a mistake of law in his favor, than he would be when retried for a mistake that did him harm.” Id., at 135 .  Mr. Justice Holmes’ concept of continuing jeopardy would have greatly simplified the matter of Government appeals, but it has never been accepted by a majority of this Court. See Jenkins, 420 U. S., at 358 .  In Jenkins we had assumed that a judgment of acquittal could be appealed where no retrial would be needed on remand: “When this principle is applied to the situation where the jury returns a verdict of guilt but the trial court thereafter enters a judgment of acquittal, an appeal is permitted.  In that situation a conclusion by an appellate court that the judgment of acquittal was improper does not require a criminal defendant to submit to a second trial; the error can be corrected on remand by the entry of a judgment on the verdict.” Id,., at 365.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Under the principles of double jeopardy law that controlled until today, further prosecution of respondent under count one would unquestionably be prohibited, and appeal by the United States from the judgment of dismissal thus would not lie.  See 18 U. S. C. § 3731 (1976 ed.).  The dismissal would, under prior law, have been treated as an “acquittal” — i.  e., “a legal determination on the basis of facts adduced at the trial relating to the general issue of the case.” United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564, 575 (1977) (citations omitted).  Indeed, further proceedings would have been barred even if the dismissal could not have been so characterized.  United States v. Jenkins, 420 U. S. 358 (1975), established that, even if a mid-trial termination does not amount to an “acquittal,” an appeal by the United States from the dismissal would not lie if a reversal would, as is of course true in the present case, require “further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged.” Id., at 370 .  This principle was reaffirmed only last Term in Lee v. United States, <citedDecision>432 U. S. 23, 30</citedDecision> (1977): “Where a midtrial dismissal is granted on the ground, correct or not, that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged, .  .  .  further prosecution is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.” 1 But the Court today overrules the principle recognized in Jenkins and <citedDecision>Lee</citedDecision> .  While reaffirming that the Government may not appeal from judgments of “acquittal” when reversals would require new trials, the Court holds that appeals by the United States will lie from all other final judgments favor *103 able to the accused.  The Court implements this new rule by fashioning a more restrictive definition of “acquittal” than heretofore followed — i.  e., “a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense” — and holds, without explanation, that, under that restrictive definition, respondent was not “acquitted” when the District Judge concluded that the facts adduced at trial established that unjustifiable and prejudicial preindictment delay gave respondent a complete defense to the charges contained in count one.  I dissent.  I would not overrule the rule announced in Jenkins and reaffirmed in <citedDecision>Lee</citedDecision> .  This principle is vital to the implementation of the values protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause; indeed, it follows necessarily from the very rule the Court today reaffirms.  The Court's attempt to draw a distinction between “true acquittals” and other final judgments favorable to the accused, quite simply, is unsupportable in either logic or policy.  Equally fundamental, the decision today indefensibly adopts an overly restrictive definition of “acquittal.” Its definition, moreover, in sharp contrast to the rule of Jenkins , is incapable of principled application.  That is vividly evident in the Court’s own distinction between a dismissal based on a finding of preaccusation delay violative of due process, and a dismissal based upon evidence adduced at trial in support of a defense of insanity or of entrapment.  Ante, at 97-98.  Why should the dismissal in the latter cases raise a double jeopardy bar, but the dismissal based on pre-accusation delay not also raise that bar to a retrial?
**Dissenting Opinion**
 See Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54; United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., *107 supra; Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141 (1962).  For however egregious the error of the acquittal, the termination favorable to the accused has been regarded as no different from a factfinder’s acquittal that resulted from errors of the trial judge. See also Burks v. United States, ante, p. 1.  These cases teach that the Government’s means of protecting its vital interest in convicting the guilty is its participation as an adversary at the criminal trial where it has every opportunity to dissuade the trial court from committing erroneous rulings favorable to the accused.  Jenkins was simply a necessary and logical extension of the rule that an acquittal bars any further trial proceedings.  Jenkins recognized that an acquittal can never represent a determination that the criminal defendant is innocent in any absolute sense; the bar to- a retrial following acquittal does not — and indeed could not — rest on any assumption that the finder of fact has applied the correct legal principles to all the admissible evidence and determined that the defendant was factually innocent of the offense charged.  The reason further prosecution is barred following an acquittal, rather, is that the Government has been afforded one complete opportunity to prove a case of the criminal defendant’s culpability and, when it has failed for any reason to persuade the court not to enter a final judgment favorable to the accused, the constitutional policies underlying the ban against multiple trials become compelling.  Thus, Jenkins and <citedDecision>Lee</citedDecision> recognized that it mattered not whether the final judgment constituted a formal “acquittal.” What is critical is whether the accused obtained, after jeopardy attached, a favorable termination of the charges against him.  If he did, no matter how erroneous the ruling, the policies embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause require the conclusion that “further proceedings .  .  .  devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged” are barred.  Jenkins, 420 U. S., at 370 ; see Lee, <citedDecision>432 U. S., at 30</citedDecision> .  *108 B The whole premise for today’s retreat from Jenkins and <citedDecision>Lee</citedDecision> , of course, is the Court’s new theory that a criminal defendant who seeks to avoid conviction on a “ground unrelated to factual innocence” somehow stands on a different constitutional footing from a defendant whose participation in his criminal trial creates a situation in which a judgment of acquittal has to be entered.  This premise is simply untenable.  The rule prohibiting retrials following acquittals does not and could not rest on a conclusion that the accused was factually innocent in any meaningful sense.  If that were the basis for the rule, the decisions that have held that even egregiously erroneous acquittals preclude retrials, see, e. g., Fong Foo v. United States, supra (acquittal entered after three of many prosecution witnesses had testified); Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54, were erroneous.  It is manifest that the reasons that bar a retrial following an acquittal are equally applicable to a final judgment entered on a ground “unrelated to factual innocence.” The heavy personal strain of the second trial is the same in either case. So too is the risk that, though innocent, the defendant may be found guilty at a second trial. If the appeal is allowed in either situation, the Government will, following any reversal, not only obtain the benefit of the favorable appellate ruling but also be permitted to shore up any other weak points of its case and obtain all the other advantages at the second trial that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to forbid.  Moreover, the Government’s interest in retrying a defendant simply cannot vary depending on the ground of the final termination in the accused’s favor.  I reject as plainly erroneous the Court’s suggestion that final judgments not based on innocence deprive the public of “its valued right to 'one complete opportunity to convict those who have violated its laws,’ ” ante, at 100, quoting Arizona v. Washington, 434 *109 U. S., at 509 , 6 and therefore differ from “true acquittals.” The Government has the same “complete opportunity” in either situation by virtue of its participation as an adversary at the criminal trial. 7 Equally significant, the distinction between the two is at best purely formal.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Sanabria held that the midtrial termination of the prosecution erected an absolute bar to any further proceedings against the defendant, and we reached that result even though the rulings which led to the acquittal were purely legal determinations, unrelated to any question of defendant’s factual guilt, and had been precipitated entirely by the defendant’s “voluntary choice” to seek a narrow construction of his indictment.  Here the legal ruling that the Court characterizes as unrelated to the defendant’s factual guilt itself terminated the prosecution with prejudice.  In Sanabria, after the District Court rendered the two erroneous rulings that excluded most of the relevant evidence of defendant’s guilt, it remained for the trial court to take the pro forma step of granting the defendant’s motion for a judgment of acquittal.  Surely, this difference between the cases should not possess constitutional significance.  By holding that it does, the Court suggests that the present case would have been decided differently if the trial court had remedied the due process violation by excluding all the Government’s evidence on count one and then entering an acquittal pursuant to Rule 29.  Sanabria simply confirms that the distinction the Court today draws is wholly arbitrary, bearing no conceivable relationship to the policies protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  II The Court’s definition of “acquittal” compounds the damage that repudiation of Jenkins and <citedDecision>Lee</citedDecision> has done to the fabric of double jeopardy law. Not only is this definition unduly *111 restrictive, it is literally incapable of principled application.  The Court’s application of its definition to the facts of this case proves the point.  The doctrine of preindictment delay, like a host of other principles and policies of the law — e. g., entrapment, insanity, right to speedy trial, statute of limitations — operates to preclude the imposition of criminal liability on defendants, notwithstanding a showing that they committed criminal acts.  Like these other doctrines, the question whether preindictment delay violates due process of law cannot ordinarily be considered apart from the factual development at trial since normally only the “ ‘[e] vents of the trial [can demonstrate] actual prejudice.’ ” United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783, 789 (1977), quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 326 (1971); see United States v. MacDonald, 435 U. S. 850, 858, 858-859 (1978).  Here, therefore, the District Court, quite properly, deferred consideration of the respondent’s pretrial motion to dismiss for preaccusation delay until trial. At the close of the evidence, respondent renewed his motion.  The District Court recognized that there was sufficient evidence of guilt to permit submission of count one to the jury, but granted the motion as to this count because, evaluating the facts adduced at trial, the court found that the delay between the offense alleged and respondent’s indictment had been unjustifiable and had so prejudiced respondent’s ability to present his defense as to constitute a denial of due process of law. A critical feature of today’s holding appears to be the Court’s definition of acquittal as “ 'a resolution [in the defendant’s favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,’ ” ante, at 97, quoting United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S., at 571 .  But this definition, which is narrower than the traditional one, enjoys no significant support in our prior decisions.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The Court offers no satisfactory explanation for the difference in treatment.  The suggestion that determinations concerning insanity and entrapment are “factual” whereas dismissals of indictments for preindictment delay represent “legal judgments,” see ante, *114 at 98, is simply untenable.  Consideration of all three defenses requires the application of legal standards to the evidence adduced at trial, and the most likely ground for reversal and reprosecution following the entry of a final judgment favorable to the accused on such grounds would be an appellate court’s conclusion that the trial court applied an erroneous legal test.  The question the Court fails to address, therefore, is why an egregiously erroneous dismissal on entrapment grounds — e. g., a ruling in a federal trial that a defendant has been entrapped as a matter of law because it had been shown that the Government had supplied the contraband the defendant had been charged with selling, cf. Hampton v. United States, 425 U. S. 484 (1976) — should erect a double jeopardy bar but not a possibly erroneous dismissal on the ground of preaccusation delay.  The Court’s observation that factual defenses of insanity and entrapment provide “legal justifications for otherwise criminal acts” — and is unlike the doctrine of preindictment delay, which is intended to protect the integrity of the trial process — reflects common legal parlance but in no wise explains why the two classes of dismissals should have different double jeopardy consequences.  Whether or not the Court’s ipse dixit concerning the consequences of a ruling of unlawful preaccusation delay is defensible, the enormous practical problems that today’s decision portends are very clear.  A particularly appealing virtue of the Jenkins and <citedDecision>Lee</citedDecision> principle — in addition, of course, to its protection of constitutional values — was its simplicity.  Any midtrial order contemplating an end to all prosecution of the accused would automatically erect a double jeopardy bar to a retrial.  Under today’s decision, the thousands of state and federal courts will be required to decide, with only minimal guidance from this Court, the question of the double jeopardy consequences of all favorable terminations of criminal proceedings on the basis of affirmative defenses.  The only guidance the Court offers is its suggestion that defenses which *115 provide legal justifications for otherwise criminal acts will erect double jeopardy bars whereas those defenses that arise from unlawful or unconstitutional Government acts will not.  Consideration of the defense of entrapment illustrates how difficult the Court’s decision will be to apply.  To the extent the defense applies when there has been a showing the defendant was not “predisposed” to commit a criminal act, it perhaps does provide a “legal justification.” But the defense of entrapment, in many jurisdictions, see Park, The Entrapment Controversy, 60 Minn. L. Rev. 163 , 171-176 (1976), is a device to deter police officials from engaging in reprehensible law enforcement techniques.  Is the entrapment defense to erect a double jeopardy bar in such jurisdictions?
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Section 3731 provides that the United States may obtain appellate review of a "dismissal” “except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.” The Court cites with approval Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54; United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., supra; Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141 (1962); Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100 (1904); and United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896).  There are a number of reasons a retrial enhances the risk that “even though innocent, [the criminal defendant] may be found guilty.” Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957).  A retrial affords the Government the opportunity to re-examine the weaknesses of its first presentation in order to strengthen the second.  And, as would any litigant, the Government has been known to take advantage of this opportunity.  It is not uncommon to find that prosecution witnesses change their testimony, not always subtly, at second trials.  See Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 , 504 n. 14 (1978), quoting Carsey v. United States, 129 U. S. App. D. C. 205, 208-209, 392 F. 2d 810, 813-814 (1967).  By “final judgment favorable to the accused,” I am, of course, referring to an order terminating all prosecution of the defendant on the ground he “simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged.” See Lee v. United States, <citedDecision>432 U. S. 23, 30</citedDecision> (1977).  Similarly unpersuasive is the Court’s suggestion that its holding is supported by the well-recognized rules that a criminal defendant may twice be tried for the same offense if he either successfully moved for a mistrial at the first trial, see <citedDecision>Lee, supra;</citedDecision> United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600 (1976), or succeeded in having a conviction set aside on a ground other than the insufficiency of the evidence.  See United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896).  What distinguishes these situations, of course, is that neither involved a final judgment entered for the accused, and that in both the Government could not be said to have had a complete opportunity to convict the accused.  The Court’s suggestion that intervening decisions have somehow undermined Jenkins simply will not wash. Although it is quite true that the author of the Court opinion has stated that he understood Jenkins to embrace a rule that any midtrial termination that is labeled a “dismissal” erects a double jeopardy bar, see ante, at 86 n. 2, quoting Lee, <citedDecision>432 U. S., at 36</citedDecision> (Rehnqtjist, J., concurring), no Court opinion has adopted the position that the label attached to a trial court’s ruling could be determinative.  Indeed, since Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S 377, 392 (1975), which was decided the week after Jenkins , explicitly provides that labels are not to have such talismanic significance, the unanimous Court in Jenkins could scarcely have contemplated that it had announced such a mechanical formula.  Thus, the Court’s suggestion, see ante, at 94, that <citedDecision>Lee</citedDecision> , which held that a termination that was labeled a “dismissal” did not erect a double jeopardy bar, could have undermined Jenkins is unpersuasive on its face.  In <citedDecision>Lee</citedDecision> , we treated the dismissal as the equivalent of a mistrial because both the trial judge and the parties had so regarded it.  See 432 U. S., at 29.  In Serfass , we reserved decision on the question whether a defendant who was afforded an opportunity to obtain a determination of a legal defense prior to trial but who nevertheless knowingly allowed himself to be placed in jeopardy before raising the defense could claim the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  420 U. S., at 394.  A contrary position would not only be inconsistent with Burks v. United States, ante, p. 1, but would also have untoward consequences for criminal defendants.  The premise of such a ruling would necessarily be that a criminal defendant has no legitimate interest in protecting the finality of a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.  It would then follow that there could be appellate review not only of all directed verdicts of not guilty by reason of insanity, but also of all jury verdicts that had been preceded by a prior finding of guilt of the statutory offense.
