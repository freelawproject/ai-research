<p id="b708-6">This case raises an important issue concerning the construction of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution— whether <span class="citation no-link">Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1163</span> (B) (1956), which is part of Arizona's Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, is invalid under that clause as being in conflict with the mandate of § 17 of the Bankruptcy Act, <span class="citation no-link">11 U.

The courts below, concluding that this case was controlled by <em>Kesler </em>v. <em>Department of Public Safety, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106365"><a href="/opinion/106365/kesler-v-department-of-public-safety-of-utah/" aria-description="Citation for case: Kesler v.

<p id="b708-7">On July 8, 1965, petitioner Adolfo Perez, driving a car registered in his name, was involved in an automobile accident in Tucson, Arizona. The Perez automobile was not covered by liability insurance at the time of the collision. The driver of the second ca,r was the minor daughter of Leonard Pinkerton, and in September 1966 the Pinkertons sued Mr. and Mrs. Perez in state court for personal injuries and property damage sustained in the accident. On October 31, 1967, the petitioners confessed judgment in this suit, and a judgment order was entered against them on November 8, 1967, for $2,425.98 plus court costs.</p>
<p id="b708-8">Mr. and Mrs. Perez each filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in Federal District Court on November 6, 1967. Each of them duly scheduled the judgment debt <page-number citation-index="1" label="639">*639</page-number>to the Pinkertons. The District Court entered orders on July 8, 1968, discharging both Mr. and Mrs. Perez from all debts and claims provable against their estates, including the Pinkerton judgment. <span class="citation no-link">11 U. S. C. §35</span>; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em><span class="citation" data-id="100616"><a href="/opinion/100616/lewis-v-roberts/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lewis v. Roberts">267 U. S. 467</a></span> (1925).</p>
<p id="b709-5">During the pendency of the bankruptcy proceedings, the provisions of the Arizona Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act came into play. Although only one provision of the Arizona Act is relevant to the issue presented by this case, it is appropriate to describe the statutory scheme in some detail. The Arizona statute is based on the Uniform Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act promulgated by the National Conference on Street and Highway Safety.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Articles 1 and 2 of the Act deal, respectively, with definitional matters and administration.</p>
<p id="b709-6">The substantive provisions begin in Art. 3, which requires the posting of financial security by those involved in accidents. Section 28-1141 of that article requires suspension of licenses for unlawful failure to report accidents, and § 28-1142 (Supp. 1970-1971) provides that within 60 days of the receipt of an accident report the Superintendent of the Motor Vehicle Division of the Highway Department shall suspend the driver's license of the operator and the registration of the owner of a car involved in an accident “unless such operator or owner or both shall deposit security in a sum which is sufficient in the judgment of the superintendent to satisfy any judgment or judgments for damages resulting from the accident as may be recovered against the operator or owner.” Under the same section, notice of such suspension and the amount of security required must be sent to the owner and operator not less than 10 days prior to the effective date of the suspension. This section does not apply if the owner or the operator carried liabil<page-number citation-index="1" label="640">*640</page-number>ity insurance or some other covering bond at the time of the accident, or if such individual had previously qualified as a self-insurer under § 28-1222. Other exceptions to the requirement that security be posted are stated in § 28-1143.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If none of these exceptions applies, the suspension continues until: (1) the person whose privileges were suspended deposits the security required under § 28-1142 (Supp. 1970-1971); (2) one year elapses from the date of the accident and the person whose privileges were suspended files proof with the Superintendent that no one has initiated an action for damages arising from the accident; (3) evidence is filed with the superintendent that a release from liability, an adjudication of nonliability, a confession of judgment, or some other written settlement agreement has been entered.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As far as the record in the instant case shows, <page-number citation-index="1" label="641">*641</page-number>the provisions of Art. 3 were not invoked against petitioners, and the constitutional validity of these provisions is, of course, not before us for decision.</p>
<p id="b711-5">Article 4 of the Arizona Act, which includes the only provision at issue here, deals with suspension of licenses and registrations for nonpayment of judgments. Interestingly, it is only when the judgment debtor in an automobile accident lawsuit — usually an owner-operator like Mr. Perez — fails to respond to a judgment entered against him that he must overcome two hurdles in order to regain his driving privileges. Section 28-1161, the first section of Art. 4, requires the state court clerk or judge, when a judgment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> has remained unsatisfied for 60 days after entry, to forward a certified copy of the judgment to the superintendent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This was done in the present case, and on March 13, 1968, Mr. and Mrs. Perez were served with notice that their drivers’ licenses and registration were suspended pursuant to § 28-1162 (A).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Under other provisions of Art. 4, such suspension is to <page-number citation-index="1" label="642">*642</page-number>continue until the judgment is paid,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and § 28-1163 (B) specifically provides that “[a] discharge in bankruptcy following the rendering of any such judgment shall not relieve the judgment debtor from any of the requirements of this article.” In addition to requiring satisfaction of the judgment debt, § 28-1163 (A) provides that the license and registration “shall remain suspended and shall not be renewed, nor shall any license or registration be thereafter issued in the name of the person . . . until the person gives proof of financial responsibility” for a future period.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Again, the validity of this limited requirement that some drivers post evidence of financial responsibility for the future in order to regain driving privileges is not questioned here. Nor is the broader issue of whether a <page-number citation-index="1" label="643">*643</page-number>State may require proof of financial responsibility as a precondition for granting driving privileges to anyone before us for decision. What is at issue here is the power of a State to include as part of this comprehensive enactment designed to secure compensation for automobile accident victims a section providing that a discharge in bankruptcy of the automobile accident tort judgment shall have no effect on the judgment debtor’s obligation to repay the judgment creditor, at least insofar as such repayment may be enforced by the withholding of driving privileges by the State. It was that question, among others, which petitioners raised after suspension of their licenses and registration by filing a complaint in Federal District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and requesting a three-judge court. They asserted several constitutional violations, and also alleged that § 28-1163 (B) was in direct conflict with the Bankruptcy Act and was thus violative of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In support of their complaint, Mr. and Mrs. Perez filed affidavits stating that the suspension of their licenses and registration worked both physical and financial hardship upon them and their children. The District Judge granted the petitioners leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>but thereafter granted the respondents’ motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, citing <em><span class="citation" data-id="106365"><a href="/opinion/106365/kesler-v-department-of-public-safety-of-utah/" aria-description="Citation for case: Kesler v.

<p id="b714-6">Deciding whether a state statute is in conflict with a federal statute and hence invalid under the Supremacy-Clause is essentially a two-step process of first ascertaining the construction of the two statutes and then determining the constitutional question whether they are in conflict. In the present case, both statutes have been authoritatively construed. In <em>Schecter </em>v. <em>Killingsworth, </em><span class="citation" data-id="1198518"><a href="/opinion/1198518/schecter-v-killingsworth/" aria-description="Citation for case: Schecter v.

See, <em>e. g., General Trading Co. </em>v. <em>State Tax Comm’n, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103992"><a href="/opinion/103992/general-trading-co-v-state-tax-commission-of-iowa/#337" aria-description="Citation for case: General Trading Co. v.

Although the dissent seems unwilling to accept the Arizona Supreme Court's construction of the statute as expressive of the Act’s primary purpose<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="645">*645</page-number>and indeed characterizes that construction as unfortunate, <em>post, </em>at 667, a reading of the provisions outlined above leaves the impression that the Arizona Court’s <page-number citation-index="1" label="646">*646</page-number>description of the statutory purpose is not only logical but persuasive. The sole emphasis in the Act is one of providing leverage for the collection of damages from <page-number citation-index="1" label="647">*647</page-number>drivers who either admit that they are at fault or are adjudged negligent. The victim of another driver’s carelessness, if he so desires, can exclude the superintendent entirely from the process of “deterring” a repetition of that driver’s negligence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, if an <page-number citation-index="1" label="648">*648</page-number>accident is litigated and a special verdict that the defendant was negligent and the plaintiff contributorily negligent is entered, the result in Arizona, as in many other States, is that there is no liability for damages arising from the accident. <em>Heimke </em>v. <em>Munoz, </em><span class="citation" data-id="2607960"><a href="/opinion/2607960/heimke-v-munoz/" aria-description="Citation for case: Heimke v.

Davis">448 P. 2d 869</a></span> (1968). Under the Safety Responsibility Act, the apparent result of such a judgment is that no consequences are visited upon either driver although both have been found to have driven carelessly. See <span class="citation no-link">Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §§ 28-1143</span> (A) (4), 28-1144 (3). Moreover, there are no provisions requiring drivers proved to' be careless to stay off the roads for a period of time. Nor are there provisions requiring drivers who have caused accidents to attend some kind of driver improvement course, a technique that is not unfamiliar in sentencing for traffic offenses.</p>
<p id="b718-5">Turning to the federal statute, the construction of the Bankruptcy Act is similarly clear. This Court on numerous occasions has stated that “[o]ne of the primary purposes of the bankruptcy act” is to give debtors “a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.” <em>Local Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102265"><a href="/opinion/102265/local-loan-co-v-hunt/#244" aria-description="Citation for case: Local Loan Co. v.

<p id="b719-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="649">*649</page-number>II</p>
<p id="b719-5">With the construction of both statutes clearly established, we proceed immediately to the constitutional question whether a state statute that protects judgment creditors from “financially irresponsible persons” is in conflict with a federal statute that gives discharged debtors a new start “unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.” As early as <em>Gibbons </em>v. <em>Ogden, </em><span class="citation" data-id="85412"><a href="/opinion/85412/gibbons-v-ogden/" aria-description="Citation for case: Gibbons v. Ogden">9 Wheat. 1</a></span> (1824), Chief Justice Marshall stated the governing principle — that “acts of the State Legislatures . . . [which] <em>interfere with, </em>or are contrary to the laws of Congress, made in pursuance of the constitution,” are invalid under the Supremacy Clause. <em>Id., </em>at 211 (emphasis added). Three decades ago Mr. Justice Black, after reviewing the precedents, wrote in a similar vein that, while “[t]his Court, in considering the validity of state laws in the light of treaties or federal laws touching the same subject, ha[d] made use of the following expressions: conflicting; contrary to; occupying the field; repugnance; difference; irreconcilability; inconsistency; violation; curtailment; and interference[,] . . . [i]nthe final analysis,” our function is to determine whether a challenged state statute “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” <em>Hines </em>v. <em>Davidowitz, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103438"><a href="/opinion/103438/hines-v-davidowitz/#67" aria-description="Citation for case: Hines v.

<blockquote id="b721-6">“The penalty which § 94-b imposes for injury due to careless driving is not for the protection of the creditor merely, but to enforce a public policy that irresponsible drivers shall not, with impunity, be allowed to injure their fellows. The scheme of the legislation would be frustrated if the reckless driver were permitted to escape its provisions by the simple expedient of voluntary bankruptcy, and, accordingly, the legislature declared that a discharge in bankruptcy should not interfere with the operation of the statute. Such legislation is not in derogation of the Bankruptcy Act. Rather it is an enforcement of permissible state policy touching highway safety.” <span class="citation" data-id="103548"><a href="/opinion/103548/reitz-v-mealey/#37" aria-description="Citation for case: Reitz v.

<p id="b721-7">The dissenting opinion written by Mr. Justice Douglas for himself and three others noted that the New York legislation put “the bankrupt ... at the creditor’s mercy,” with the results that “[i]n practical effect the bankrupt may be in as bad, or even worse, a position than if the state had made it possible for a creditor to attach his future wages” and that “[bankruptcy . . .

<p id="b724-5">IV</p>
<p id="b724-6">One final argument merits discussion. The dissent points out that the District of Columbia Code contains an anti-discharge provision similar to that included in the Arizona Act. Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act of the District of Columbia, D. C. Code Ann. § 40-464 (1967), <span class="citation no-link">68 Stat. 132</span>. In light of our decision today, the sum of the argument is to draw into question the constitutional validity of the District's anti-discharge section, for as noted in the dissent the Constitution confers upon Congress the power “[t]o establish . . . <em>uniform </em>Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.” U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 4 (emphasis <page-number citation-index="1" label="655">*655</page-number>added). It is asserted that “Congress must have regarded the two statutes as consistent and compatible/’ <em>post, </em>at 665, but such an argument assumes a modicum of legislative attention to the question of consistency. The D. C. Code section does, of course, refer specifically to discharges, but its passage may at most be viewed as evidencing an opinion of Congress on the meaning of the general discharge provision enacted by an earlier Congress and interpreted by this Court as early as 1925. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="100616"><a href="/opinion/100616/lewis-v-roberts/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lewis v. Roberts">Lewis</a></span> </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="100616"><a href="/opinion/100616/lewis-v-roberts/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lewis v. Roberts">Roberts, supra.</a></span> </em>In fact, in passing the initial and amended version of the District of Columbia financial responsibility law, Congress gave no attention to the interaction of the anti-discharge section with the Bankruptcy Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the legislative history is <page-number citation-index="1" label="656">*656</page-number>quite clear that when Congress dealt with the subject of financial responsibility laws for the District, it based its work upon the efforts of the uniform commissioners which had won enactment in other States.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b726-5">Had Congress focused on the interaction between this minor subsection of the rather lengthy financial responsibility act and the discharge provision of the Bankruptcy Act, it would have been immediately apparent to the legislators that the only constitutional method for so defining the scope and effect of a discharge in bankruptcy was by amendment of the Bankruptcy Act, which by its terms is a uniform statute applicable in the States, Territories, and the District of Columbia. <span class="citation no-link">11 U. S. C. § 1</span> (29). To follow any other course would obviously be to legislate in such a way that a discharge in bankruptcy means one thing in the District of Columbia and something else in the States — depending on state law — a result explicitly prohibited by the uniformity requirement in the constitutional authorization to Congress to enact bankruptcy legislation.</p>

<p id="b726-7">From the foregoing, we think it clear that § 28-1163 (B) of the Arizona Safety Responsibility Act is constitutionally invalid. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="b717-7">Under Art. 3 of the Arizona Act, dealing with the posting of security for damages arising from a particular accident, the victim may cut the superintendent out by executing a release from liability or agreeing to some other written settlement or confession of judgment providing for payment of some damages, in installments or otherwise. <span class="citation no-link">Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1143</span> (A) (4) discussed in n. 2, <em>supra. </em>Assuming that such an agreement or confession of judgment providing for installment payments is filed with the superintendent, it prevents him from suspending driving privileges for failure to post the amount of financial security the superintendent determines to be necessary; however, if the careless driver later defaults on one installment, the victim may give notice to the superintendent, who must then use his power of suspension to either coerce full payment or the posting of security. <span class="citation no-link">Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1144</span> (3), discussed in n. 3, <em>supra.</em></p>
<p id="b717-8">Under Art. 4, dealing with suspension for nonpayment of a judgment, the victim who has chosen to reduce his claim to judgment maintains substantial control over the suspension of driving privileges if the judgment remains unsatisfied 60 days after entry. He may consent that the judgment debtor’s driving privileges not be suspended, but the debtor still must furnish proof of financial responsibility for the future. <span class="citation no-link">Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §28-1162</span> (B). For an argument that a similar provision delegating to judgment creditors the right to choose which careless drivers who do not pay judgments shall escape suspension conflicts with the Bankruptcy Act see <em>Kesler, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106365"><a href="/opinion/106365/kesler-v-department-of-public-safety-of-utah/#179" aria-description="Citation for case: Kesler v.

If the judgment debtor is able to secure a discretionary court order permitting him to pay a judgment in installments under §28-1165 (A), the creditor may cause suspension of driving privileges until the judgment is fully satisfied by notifying the superintendent of any default in payment of the installments. <span class="citation no-link">Ariz.

Because the automobile was community property under Arizona law and because judgment was confessed as to her in the Pinkerton negligence action, the Court of Appeals reasoned that loss of Mrs. Perez’ license “is the price an Arizona wife must pay for negligent driving by her husband of the community vehicle” when the resulting judgment is not paid. 421 F. 2d, at 624.
