*801 Justice Thomas announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice, Justice Scalia, and Justice Kennedy join.  As part of a longstanding school-aid program known as Chapter 2, the Federal Government distributes funds to state and local governmental agencies, which in turn lend educational materials and equipment to public and private schools, with the enrollment of each participating school determining the amount of aid that it receives.  The question is whether Chapter 2, as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, is a law respecting an establishment of religion, because many of the private schools receiving Chapter 2 aid in that parish are religiously affiliated.  We hold that Chapter 2 is not such a law. I A Chapter 2 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97-35, 95 Stat. 469, as amended, 20 TJ. S. C. §§ 7301-7373, 1 has its origins in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), Pub. L. 89-10, 79 Stat. 55, and is a close cousin of the provision of the ESEA *802 that we recently considered in Agostini v. Felton, <citedDecision>521 U. S. 203</citedDecision> (1997).  Like the provision at issue in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , Chapter 2 channels federal funds to local educational agencies (LEA’s), which are usually public school districts, via state educational agencies (SEA’s), to implement programs to assist children in elementary and secondary schools.  Among other things, Chapter 2 provides aid “for the acquisition and use of instructional and educational materials, including library services and materials (including media materials), assessments, reference materials, computer software and hardware for instructional use, and other curricular materials.” 20 U. S. C. § 7351 (b)(2).  LEA’s and SEA’s must offer assistance to both public and private schools (although any private school must be nonprofit).  §§ 7312(a), 7372(a)(1).  Participating private schools receive Chapter 2 aid based on the number of children enrolled in each school, see § 7372(a)(1), and allocations of Chapter 2 funds for those schools must generally be “equal (consistent with the number of children to be served) to expenditures for programs .  .  .

 These cases, in the Ninth Circuit’s view, revived the principle of Allen and of Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing; 3 that “state benefits provided to all citizens without regard to religion are constitutional.” 46 F. 3d, at 1465.  The Ninth Circuit also relied, id., at 1467, on our observation in Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687 (1994), that “we have frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of any benefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges,” id., at 704 .  The Ninth Circuit purported to distinguish Meek and Wolman based on the percentage of schools receiving aid that were parochial (a large percentage in those cases and a moderate percentage in Walker), 46 F. 3d, at 1468, but that court undermined this distinction when it observed that Meek also upheld “the massive provision of text *806 books to parochial schools.” 46 F. 3d, at 1468, n. 16.  Thus, although the Ninth Circuit did not explicitly hold that Meek and Wolman were no longer good law, its reasoning seemed to require that conclusion.  Finally, in addition to relying on our decision in Zobrest and the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Walker, Judge Livaudais invoked Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 615 U. S. 819 (1995), in which, a few months after Walker, we held that the Establishment Clause does not require a public university to exclude a student-run religious publication from assistance available to numerous other student-run publications.  Following Judge Livaudais’ ruling, respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  While that appeal was pending, we decided <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , in which we approved a program that, under Title I of the ESEA, provided public employees to teach remedial classes at private schools, including religious schools.  In so holding, we overruled Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), and partially overruled School Dish of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985), both of which had involved such a program.  The Fifth Circuit thus faced a dilemma between, on the one hand, the Ninth Circuit’s holding and analysis in Walker and our subsequent decisions in Rosenberger and <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , and, on the other hand, our holdings in Meek and Wolman .  To resolve the dilemma, the Fifth Circuit abandoned any effort to find coherence in our ease law or to divine the future course of our decisions and instead focused on our particular holdings.  Helms v. Picard, 151 F. 3d 347, 371 (1998).  It thought such an approach required not only by the lack of coherence but also by Agostini’s admonition to lower courts to abide by any applicable holding of this Court even though that holding might seem inconsistent with our subsequent decisions, see Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 237</citedDecision> .  The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , by recognizing our rejection of the rule that “all government aid that directly assists the *807 educational function of religious schools is invalid,” <citedDecision>id., at 225</citedDecision> , had rejected a premise of Meek , hut that court nevertheless concluded that <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> had neither directly overruled Meek and Wolman nor rejected their distinction between textbooks and other in-kind aid.  The Fifth Circuit therefore concluded that Meek and Wolman controlled, and thus it held Chapter 2 unconstitutional.  We granted certiorari.  527 U. S. 1002 (1999).  II The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment dictates that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” In the over 50 years since Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), we have consistently struggled to apply these simple words in the context of governmental aid to religious schools.  4 As we admitted in Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672 (1971), “candor compels the acknowledgment that we can only dimly perceive the boundaries of permissible government activity in this sensitive area.” Id., at 678 (plurality opinion); see Lemon, 403 U. S., at 671 (White, J., concurring in judgment).  In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , however, we brought some clarity to our ease law, by overruling two anomalous precedents (one in whole, the other in part) and by consolidating some of our previously disparate considerations under a revised test.  Whereas in Lemon we had considered whether a statute (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or (3) creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion, see 403 U. S., at 612-613, in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> we modified Lemon for purposes of evaluating aid to schools and examined only the first and second factors, see <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 222-223</citedDecision> .  We acknowledged *808 that our cases discussing excessive entanglement had applied many of the same considerations as had our cases discussing primary effect, and we therefore recast Lemon’s entanglement inquiry as simply one criterion relevant to determining a statute’s effect.  <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 232-233</citedDecision> .  We also acknowledged that our eases had pared somewhat the factors that could justify a finding of excessive entanglement.  <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 238-284</citedDecision> .  We then set out revised criteria for determining the effect of a statute: “To summarize, New York City’s Title I program does not run afoul of any of three primary criteria we currently use to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: It does not result in governmental indoctrination; define its recipients by reference to religion; or create an excessive entanglement.” <citedDecision>Id., at 234</citedDecision> .  In this case, our inquiry under Agostini’s purpose and effect test is a narrow one.  Because respondents do not challenge the District Court’s holding that Chapter 2 has a secular purpose, and because the Fifth Circuit also did not question that holding, ef.  151 F. 3d, at 369, n. 17 , we will consider only Chapter 2’s effect.  Further, in determining that effect, we will consider only the first two <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> criteria, since neither respondents nor the Fifth Circuit has questioned the District Court’s holding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a, that Chapter 2 does not create an excessive entanglement.  Considering Chapter 2 in light of our more recent ease law, we conclude that it neither results in religious indoctrination by the government nor defines its recipients by reference to religion.  We therefore hold that Chapter 2 is not a “law respecting an establishment of religion.” In so holding, we acknowledge what both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits saw was inescapable — Meek and Wolman are anomalies in our case law. We therefore conclude that they are no longer good law. *809 A As we indicated in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , and have indicated elsewhere, the question whether governmental aid to religious schools results in governmental indoctrination is ultimately a question whether any religious indoctrination that occurs in those schools could reasonably be attributed to governmental action.  See <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 226</citedDecision> (presence of sign-language interpreter in Catholic school “ ‘cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking’ ” (quoting Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 ) (emphasis added in Agostini))', <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 230</citedDecision> (question is whether “any use of [governmental] aid to indoctrinate religion could be attributed to the State”); see also Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 841-842; Witters v. Washington Dept., of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 488-489 (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397 (1983); cf. Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 337 (1987) (“For a law to have forbidden 'effects’ under Lemon, it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through its own activities and influence”).  We have also indicated that the answer to the question of indoctrination will resolve the question whether a program of educational aid “subsidizes” religion, as our religion eases use that term. See <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , 521U.  S., at 230-231; see also <citedDecision>id., at 230</citedDecision> .  In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, we have consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion.  If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government.  For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question.  If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any par *810 ticular indoctrination.  To put the point differently, if the government, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without regard to religion, to all who adequately further that purpose, see Allen, 392 U. S., at 245-247 (discussing dual secular and religious purposes of religious schools), then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose.  The government, in crafting such an aid program, has had to conclude that a given level of aid is necessary to further that purpose among secular recipients and has provided no more than that same level to religious recipients.  As a way of assuring neutrality, we have repeatedly considered whether any governmental aid that goes to a religious institution does so “only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of individuals.” <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 226</citedDecision> (internal quotation marks omitted).  We have viewed as significant whether the “private choices of individual parents,” as opposed to the “unmediated” will of government, Ball, 473 U. S., at 395, n. 13 (internal quotation marks omitted), determine what schools ultimately benefit from the governmental aid, and how much.  For if numerous private choices, rather than the single choice of a government, determine the distribution of aid pursuant to neutral eligibility criteria, then a government cannot, or at least cannot easily, grant special favors that might lead to a religious establishment.  Private choice also helps guarantee neutrality by mitigating the preference for pre-existing recipients that is arguably inherent in any governmental aid program, see, e. g., Gilder, The Revitalization of Everything: The Law of the Macrocosm, Harv. Bus. Rev. 49 (Mar./Apr.  1988), and that could lead to a program inadvertently favoring one religion or favoring religious private schools in general over nonreligious ones.  The principles of neutrality and private choice, and their relationship to each other, were prominent not only in Agos- *811 Uni, supra, at 225-226, 228, 280-282, but also in Zobrest, Witters, and Mueller .  5 The heart of our reasoning in Zobrest , upholding governmental provision of a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at his Catholic high school, was as follows: “The service at issue in this ease is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as ‘disabled’ under the [statute], without regard to the ‘sectarian-nonseetarian, or publie-nonpublic nature’ of the school the child attends.
**Lead Opinion**
 6 Further, five Members of this Court, in separate opinions, emphasized both the importance of neutrality and of private choices, and the relationship between the two.  See id., at *813 490-491 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring); id., at 493 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also id., at 490 (White, J., concurring).  The tax deduction for educational expenses that we upheld in Mueller was, in these respects, the same as the tuition grant in Witters .  We upheld it chiefly because it “neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens,” 463 U. S., at 398-399 , and because “numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children,” id., at 399 , determined which schools would benefit from the deductions.  We explained that “[w]here, as here, aid to parochial schools is available only as a result of decisions of individual parents no ‘imprimatur of state approval’ can be deemed to have been conferred on any particular religion, or on religion generally.” Ibid, (citation omitted); see id., at 397 (neutrality indicates lack of state imprimatur).  Agostini's second primary criterion for determining the effect of governmental aid is closely related to the first.  The second criterion requires a court to consider whether an aid program “define[s] its recipients by reference to religion.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 234</citedDecision> .  As we briefly explained in <citedDecision>Agostini, id., at 230-231</citedDecision> , this second criterion looks to the same set of facts as does our focus, -under the first criterion, on neutrality, see <citedDecision>id., at 225-226</citedDecision> , but the second criterion uses those facts to answer a somewhat different question — whether the criteria for allocating the aid “ereat[e] a financial incentive to undertake religious indoctrination,” <citedDecision>id., at 231</citedDecision> .  In Agos-tini we set out the following rule for answering this question: “This incentive is not present, however, where the aid is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Under such circumstances, the aid is less likely to have the effect of advancing religion.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> *814 The cases on which <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> relied for this rule, and Agos-tini itself, make clear the close relationship between this rule, incentives, and private choice.  For to say that a program does not create an incentive to choose religious schools is to say that the private choice is truly “independent,” Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 .  See <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 232</citedDecision> (holding that Title I did not create any impermissible incentive, because its services were “available to all children who meet the Act’s eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school”); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (discussing, in successive sentences, neutrality, private choice, and financial incentives, respectively); Witters, supra, at 488 (similar).  When such an incentive does exist, there is a greater risk that one could attribute to the government any indoctrination by the religious schools.  See Zobrest, supra, at 10 .  We hasten to add, what should be obvious from the rule itself, that simply because an aid program offers private schools, and thus religious schools, a benefit that they did not previously receive does not mean that the program, by reducing the cost of securing a religious education, creates, under Agostini’s second criterion, an “incentive” for parents to choose such an education for their children.  For any aid will have some such effect.  See Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 ; Everson, 330 U. S., at 17 ; see also Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 .  B Respondents inexplicably make no effort to address Chapter 2 under the <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> test.  Instead, dismissing <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> as factually distinguishable, they offer two rules that they contend should govern our determination of whether Chapter 2 has the effect of advancing religion.  They argue first, and chiefly, that “direct, nonineidental” aid to the primary educational mission of religious schools is always impermissible.  Second, they argue that provision to religious schools of aid that is divertible to religious use is similarly impermis *815 sible.  7 Respondents’ arguments are inconsistent with our more recent ease law, in particular <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> and Zobrest , and we therefore reject them.  1 Although some of our earlier eases, particularly Ball, 473 U. S., at 393-394 , did emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect aid, the purpose of this distinction was *816 merely to prevent “subsidization” of religion, see id., at 394 .  As even the dissent all but admits, see post, at 889 (opinion of Souter, J.), our more recent cases address this purpose not through the direet/indireet distinction but rather through the principle of private choice, as incorporated in the first <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> criterion (i.  e., whether any indoctrination could be attributed to the government).  If aid to schools, even “direct aid,” is neutrally available and, before reaching or benefiting any religious school, first passes through the hands (literally or figuratively) of numerous private citizens who are free to direct the aid elsewhere, the government has not provided any “support of religion,” Witters, supra, at 489 .  See supra, at 810.  Although the presence of private choice is easier to see when aid literally passes through the hands of individuals — which is why we have mentioned directness in the same breath with private choice, see, e. g., Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 226</citedDecision> ; Witters, supra, at 487 ; Mueller, supra, at 399 — there is no reason why the Establishment Clause requires such a form.  Indeed, <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> expressly rejected the absolute line that respondents would have us draw.  We there explained that “we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 225</citedDecision> .  <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> relied primarily on Witters for this conclusion and made clear that private choice and neutrality would resolve the concerns formerly addressed by the rule in Ball .  It was undeniable in Witters that the aid (tuition) would ultimately go to the Inland Empire School of the Bible and would support religious education.  We viewed this arrangement, however, as no different from a government issuing a paycheck to one of its employees knowing that the employee would direct the funds to a religious institution.  Both arrangements would be valid, for the same reason: “[A]ny money that ultimately went to religious institutions did so ‘only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of’ individuals.” *817 <citedDecision>Agostini, supra,</citedDecision> at 226 (quoting Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 ).  In addition, the program in Witters was neutral.  <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 225</citedDecision> (quoting Witters, supra, at 487 ).  As <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> explained, the same reasoning was at work in Zobrest , where we allowed the government-funded interpreter to provide assistance at a Catholic school, “even though she would he a mouthpiece for religious instruction,” because the interpreter was provided according to neutral eligibility criteria and private choice.  <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 226</citedDecision> .  Therefore, the religious messages interpreted by the interpreter could not be attributed to the government, see <citedDecision>ibid.</citedDecision> (We saw no difference in Zobrest between the government hiring the interpreter direetly and the government providing funds to the parents who then would hire the interpreter.  509 U. S., at 13, n. 11 .) We rejected the dissent’s objection that we had never before allowed “a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination.” See id., at 18 (opinion of Blaekmun, J.).  Finally, in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> itself, we used the reasoning of Witters and Zobrest to conclude that remedial classes provided under Title I of the ESEA by public employees did not impermissibly finance religious indoctrination.  <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 228</citedDecision> ; see <citedDecision>id., at 230-232</citedDecision> .  We found it insignificant that students did not have to direetly apply for Title I services, that Title I instruction was provided to students in groups rather than individually, and that instruction was provided in the facilities of the private schools.  <citedDecision>Id., at 226-229</citedDecision> .  To the extent that respondents intend their direct/indireet distinction to require that any aid be literally placed in the hands of schoolchildren rather than given directly to the school for teaching those same children, the very cases on which respondents most rely, Meek and Wolman , demonstrate the irrelevance of such formalism.  In Meek , we justified our rejection of a program that loaned instructional materials and equipment by, among other things, pointing out that the aid was loaned to the schools, and thus was “direct *818 aid.” 421 U. S., at 362-363 .  The materials-and-equipment program in Wolman was essentially identical, except that the State, in an effort to comply with Meek , see Wolman, 433 U. S., at 233, 250 , loaned the aid to the students.  (The revised program operated much like the one we upheld in Allen.  Compare Wolman, supra, at 248 , with Allen, 392 U. S., at 243-245 .) Yet we dismissed as “technical” the difference between the two programs: “[I]t would exalt form over substance if this distinction were found to justify a result different from that in Meek.” 433 U. S., at 250 .
**Lead Opinion**
 But those cases offer little, if any, support for respondents.  Meek mentioned divertibility only briefly in a concluding footnote, see 421 U. S., at 366, n. 16 , and that mention was, at most, peripheral to the Court’s reasoning in striking down the lending of instructional materials and equipment.  The aid program in Wolman explicitly barred divertible aid, 433 U. S., at 248-249 , so a concern for divertibility could not have been part of our reason for finding that program invalid.  The issue is not divertibility of aid but rather whether the aid itself has an impermissible content.  Where the aid would be suitable for use in a public school, it is also suitable for use in any private school.  Similarly, the prohibition against the government providing impermissible content resolves the Establishment Clause concerns that exist if aid is actually diverted to religious uses.  9 In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , we explained Zobrest by making just this distinction between the content of aid and the use of that aid: “Because the only government aid in Zobrest was the interpreter, who was herself not inculcating any religious messages, no government indoctrination took place.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 224</citedDecision> (second emphasis added).  <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> also acknowledged that what the dissenters in Zobrest had charged was essentially true: Zobrest did effect a “shift ... in our Establishment Clause law.” <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 225</citedDecision> .  The interpreter herself, assuming that she *823 fulfilled her assigned duties, see <citedDecision>id., at 224-225</citedDecision> , had “no inherent religious significance,” Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 (discussing bus rides in Everson), and so it did not matter (given the neutrality and private choice involved in the program) that she “would be a mouthpiece for religious instruction,” <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 226</citedDecision> (discussing Zobrest).  And just as a government interpreter does not herself inculcate a religious message — even when she is conveying one — so also a government computer or overhead projector does not itself inculcate a religious message, even when it is conveying one.  In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> itself, we approved the provision of public employees to teach secular remedial classes in private schools partly because we concluded that there was no reason t© suspect that indoctrinating content would be part of such governmental aid.  See <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 223-225, 226-227, 234-235</citedDecision> .  Relying on Zobrest , we refused to presume that the public teachers would “‘inject religious content’” into their classes, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 225</citedDecision> , especially given certain safeguards that existed; we also saw no evidence that they had done so, id, at 226-227.  In Allen we similarly focused on content, emphasizing that the textbooks were preapproved by public school authorities and were not “unsuitable for use in the public schools because of religious content.” 392 U. S., at 245 .  See Lemon, 403 U. S., at 617 (“We note that the dissenters in Allen seemed chiefly concerned with the pragmatic difficulties involved in ensuring the truly secular content of the textbooks” (emphasis added)).  Although it might appear that a book, because it has a pre-existing content, is not divertible, and thus that lack of divertibility motivated our holding in Allen, it is hard to imagine any book that could not, in even moderately skilled hands, serve to illustrate a religious message.  10 Post, at 855 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) *824 (agreeing with this point).  Indeed, the plaintiffs in Walker essentially conceded as much.  46 F. 3d, at 1469, n. 17.
**Lead Opinion**
 But it escapes us how a court might coherently draw any such line. It not only is far more workable, but also is actually related to real concerns about preventing advancement of religion by government, simply to require, as did Zobrest, Agostini, and Allen, that a program of aid to schools not provide improper content and that it determine eligibility and allocate the aid on a permissible basis.  11 C The dissent serves up a smorgasbord of 11 factors that, depending on the facts of each case “in all its particularity,” post, at 877, could be relevant to the constitutionality of a school-aid program.  And those 11 are a bare minimum.  We are reassured that there are likely more.  12 See post, at 885, 888.  Presumably they will be revealed in future eases, as needed, but at least one additional factor is evident from the dissent itself: The dissent resurrects the concern for political divisiveness that once occupied the Court but that post-Aguilar cases have rightly disregarded.  Compare post, at 868, 872, 901, 902, 909, n. 27, with Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 233-234</citedDecision> ; Bowen, 487 U. S., at 617, n. 14 ; Amos, 483 U. S., at 339-340, n. 17 .  As Justice O’Connor explained in dissent in Aguilar : “It is curious indeed to base our interpretation of the Constitution on speculation as to the likelihood of a phenomenon which the parties may create merely by *826 prosecuting a lawsuit.” 473 U. S., at 429.  While the dissent delights in the perverse chaos that all these factors produce, post, at 899; see also post, at 869, 885, the Constitution becomes unnecessarily clouded, and legislators, litigants, and lower courts groan, as the history of this case amply demonstrates.  See Part I-B, supra. One of the dissent’s factors deserves special mention: whether a school that receives aid (or whose students receive aid) is pervasively sectarian.  The dissent is correct that there was a period when this factor mattered, particularly if the pervasively sectarian school was a primary or secondary school.  Post, at 885-887, 894, 898, 902-906.  But that period is one that the Court should regret, and it is thankfully long past.  There are numerous reasons to formally dispense with this factor.  First, its relevance in our precedents is in sharp decline.  Although our case law has consistently mentioned it even in recent years, we have not struck down an aid program in reliance on this factor since 1985, in Aguilar and Ball.  Agostini of course overruled Aguilar in Ml and Ball in part, and today Justice O’Connor distances herself from the part of Ball with which she previously agreed, by rejecting the distinction between public and private employees that was so prominent in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> .  Compare post, at 858-860, 863-864 (opinion concurring in judgment), with Agos-tini, supra, at 223-225, 234-235.  In Witters , a year after Aguilar and Ball , we did not ask whether the Inland Empire School of the Bible was pervasively sectarian.  In Bowen , a 1988 decision, we refused to find facially invalid an aid program (although one not involving schools) whose recipients had, the District Court found, included pervasively sectarian institutions.  See 487 U. S., at 636, 647, 648 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Although we left it open on remand for the District Court to reaffirm its prior finding, we took pains to emphasize the narrowness of the “pervasively sectarian” category, see id., at 620-621 (opinion of the Court), and two *827 Members of the majority questioned whether this category was “well-founded,” id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring).  Then, in Zobrest and <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , we upheld aid programs to children who attended schools that were not only pervasively sectarian but also were primary and secondary.  Zobrest , in turning away a challenge based on the pervasively sectarian nature of Salpointe Catholic High School, emphasized the presence of private choice and the absence of government-provided sectarian content.  509 U. S., at 13 .  <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , in explaining why the aid program was constitutional, did not bother to mention that pervasively sectarian schools were at issue, 13 see <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 226-235</citedDecision> , a fact that was not lost on the dissent, see <citedDecision>id., at 249</citedDecision> (opinion of Souter, J.).  In disregarding the nature of the school, Zobrest and <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> were merely returning to the approach of Everson and Allen, in which the Court upheld aid programs to students at pervasively sectarian schools.  See post, at 875, 885-886 (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting this fact regarding Everson); Allen, 392 U. S., at 251-252 (Black, J., dissenting); id., at 262-264, 269-270 , n. (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Second, the religious nature of a recipient should not matter to the constitutional analysis, so long as the recipient adequately furthers the government’s secular purpose.  See supra, at 810.  If a program offers permissible aid to the religious (including the pervasively sectarian), the areligious, and the irreligious, it is a mystery which view of religion the government has established, and thus a mystery what the constitutional violation would be.  The pervasively sectarian recipient has not received any special favor, and it is most bizarre that the Court would, as the dissent seemingly does, reserve special hostility for those who take their religion seriously, who think that their religion should affect the whole *828 of their lives, or who make the mistake of being effective in transmitting their views to children.  Third, the inquiry into the recipient’s religious views required by a focus on whether a school is pervasively sectarian is not only unnecessary but also offensive.

 Opposition to aid to “sectarian” schools acquired prominence in the 1870’s with Congress’ consideration (and near passage) of the Blaine Amendment, which would have amended the Constitution to bar any aid to sectarian institutions.  Consideration of the amendment arose at a time of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and to Catholics in general, and it was an open secret that “sectarian” was code for “Catholic.” See generally Green, The Blaine Amendment Reconsidered, 36 Am. J. Legal Hist. 38 (1992).  *829 Notwithstanding its history, of course, “sectarian” could, on its face, describe the school of any religious sect, but the Court eliminated this possibility of confusion when, in Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S., at 743 , it coined the term “pervasively sectarian” — a term which, at that time, could be applied almost exclusively to Catholic parochial schools and which even today’s dissent exemplifies chiefly by reference to such schools.  See post, at 886, 904-906 (opinion of Soutek, J.).  In short, nothing in the Establishment Clause requires the exclusion of pervasively sectarian schools from otherwise permissible aid programs, and other doctrines of this Court bar it.  This doctrine, born of bigotry, should be buried now.  J-H W-< Applying the two relevant <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> criteria, we see no basis for concluding that Jefferson Parish’s Chapter 2 program “has the effect of advancing religion.” <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 234</citedDecision> .  Chapter 2 does not result in governmental indoctrination, because it determines eligibility for aid neutrally, allocates that aid based on the private choices of the parents of schoolchildren, and does not provide aid that has an impermissible content.  Nor does Chapter 2 define its recipients by reference to religion.  Taking the second criterion first, it is clear that Chapter 2 aid “is allocated on the basis of neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, and is made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis.” Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 231</citedDecision> .  Aid is allocated based on enrollment: “Private schools receive Chapter 2 materials and equipment based on the per capita number of students at each school,” Walker, 46 F. 3d, at 1464, and allocations to private schools must “be equal (consistent with the number of children to be served) to expenditures for programs under this subchapter for children enrolled in the public schools of the [LEA],” 20 U. S. C. § 7372 (b).  LEA’s must provide Chapter 2 materials and equipment for the benefit *830 of children in private schools “[t]o the extent consistent with the number of children in the school district of [an LEA]... who are enrolled in private nonprofit elementary and secondary schools.” § 7372(a)(1).  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 87a (District Court, recounting testimony of head of Louisiana’s Chapter 2 program that LEA’s are told that “‘for every dollar you spend for the public school student, you spend the same dollar for the non-public school student’ ”); §§ 7372(a)(1) and (b) (children in private schools must receive “equitable participation”).  The allocation criteria therefore create no improper incentive.  Chapter 2 does, by statute, deviate from a pure per capita basis for allocating aid to LEA’s, increasing the per-pupil allocation based on the number of children within an LEA who are from poor families, reside in poor areas, or reside in rural areas.  §§ 7312(a)-(b).  But respondents have not contended, nor do we have any reason to think, that this deviation in the allocation to the LEA’s leads to deviation in the allocation among schools within each LEA, see §§ 7372(a)-(b), and, even if it did, we would not presume that such a deviation created any incentive one way or the other with regard to religion.  Chapter 2 also satisfies the first <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> criterion.  The program makes a broad array of schools eligible for aid without regard to their religious affiliations or lack thereof.  § 7372; see § 7353(a)(3).  We therefore have no difficulty concluding that Ghapter 2 is neutral with regard to religion.  See <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 225-226</citedDecision> .  Chapter 2 aid also, like the aid in Agostini, Zobrest, and Witters , reaches participating schools only “as a consequence of private decisionmaking.” <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 222</citedDecision> .  Private decisionmaking controls because of the per capita allocation scheme, and those decisions are independent because of the program’s neutrality.  See <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 226</citedDecision> .  It is the students and their parents— not the government — who, through their choice of school, determine who receives Chapter 2 funds.  The aid follows the child. *831 Because Chapter 2 aid is provided pursuant to private choices, it is not problematic that one could fairly describe Chapter 2 as providing “direct” aid.  The materials and equipment provided under Chapter 2 are presumably used from time to time by entire classes rather than by individual students (although individual students are likely the chief consumers of library books and, perhaps, of computers and computer software), and students themselves do not need to apply for Chapter 2 aid in order for their schools to receive it, but, as we explained in <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , these traits are not constitutionally significant or meaningful.  See <citedDecision>id., at 228-229</citedDecision> .  Nor, for reasons we have already explained, is it of constitutional significance that the schools themselves, rather than the students, are the bailees of the Chapter 2 aid.  The ultimate beneficiaries of Chapter 2 aid are the students who attend the schools that receive that aid, and this is so regardless of whether individual students lug computers to school each day or, as Jefferson Parish has more sensibly provided, the schools receive the computers.  Like the Ninth Circuit, and unlike the dissent, post, at 888, we “see little difference in loaning science kits to students who then bring the kits to school as opposed to loaning science kits to the school directly.” Walker, supra, at 1468, n. 16; see Allen, 392 U. S., at 244, n. 6 .  Finally, Chapter 2 satisfies the first <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> criterion because it does not provide to religious schools aid that has an impermissible content.  The statute explicitly bars anything of the sort, providing that all Chapter 2 aid for the benefit of children in private schools shall be “secular, neutral, and nonideological,” § 7372(a)(1), and the record indicates that the Louisiana SEA and the Jefferson Parish LEA have faithfully enforced this requirement insofar as relevant to this case. The chief aid at issue is computers, computer software, and library books.  The computers presumably have no preexisting content, or at least none that would be impermissible for use in public schools.  Respondents do not contend *832 otherwise.  Respondents also offer no evidence that religious schools have received software from the government that has an impermissible content.  There is evidence that equipment has been, or at least easily could be, diverted for use in religious classes.  See, e. g., App. 108a, 118a, 205a-207a.

 Further, the violation by the LEA and the private schools was minor and, in the view of the SEA’s coordinator, inadvertent.  See App. 122a.  There were approximately 191 improper book requests over three years (the 1982-1988 through 1984-1985 school years); these requests came from fewer than half of the 40 private schools then participating; and the cost of the 191 books *835 amounted to “less than one percent of the total allocation over all those years.” Id., at 132a-133a.  The District Court found that prescreening by the LEA coordinator of requested library books was sufficient to prevent statutory violations, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a, and the Fifth Circuit did not disagree.  Further, as noted, the monitoring system appears adequate to catch those errors that do occur.  We are unwilling to elevate scattered de minimis statutory violations, discovered and remedied by the relevant authorities themselves prior to any litigation, to such a level as to convert an otherwise unobjectionable parishwide program into a law that has the effect of advancing religion.  IV In short, Chapter 2 satisfies both the first and second primary criteria of <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> .  It therefore does not have the effect of advancing religion.  For the same reason, Chapter 2 also “cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion,” Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 235</citedDecision> .  Accordingly, we hold that Chapter 2 is not a law respecting an establishment of religion.  Jefferson Parish need not exclude religious schools from its Chapter 2 program.  19 To the extent that Meek and Wolman conflict with this holding, we overrule them.  Our conclusion regarding Meek and Wolman should come as no surprise.  The Court as early as Wolman itself left no doubt that Meek and Allen were irreconcilable, see 433 U. S., at 251, n. 18 , and we have repeatedly reaffirmed Allen since then, see, <citedDecision>e.  g., Agostini, supra, at 231</citedDecision> .  (In fact, Meek , in *836 discussing the materials-and-equipment program, did not even cite Allen.  See Meek, 421 U. S., at 368-366 .) Less than three years after Wolman , we explained that Meek did not, despite appearances, hold that “all loans of secular instructional material and equipment inescapably have the effect of direct advancement of religion.” Regan, 444 U. S., at 661-662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Then, in Mueller , we conceded that the aid at issue in Meek and Wolman did “resembl[e], in many respects,” the aid that we had upheld in Everson and Allen.  463 U. S., at 393 , and n. 3; see id., at 402, n. 10 ; see also id., at 415 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (viewing Allen as incompatible with Meek and Wolman , and the distinction between textbooks and other instructional materials as “simply untenable”).  Most recently, <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , in rejecting Ball's assumption that “all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid,” <citedDecision>Agostini, supra, at 225</citedDecision> , necessarily rejected a large portion (perhaps all, see Ball, 473 U. S., at 395 ) of the reasoning of Meek and Wolman in invalidating the lending of materials and equipment, for Ball borrowed that assumption from those cases. See <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 220-221</citedDecision> (Shared Time program at issue in Ball was “surely invalid ... [g]iven the holdings in Meek and Wolman” regarding instructional materials and equipment).  Today we simply acknowledge what has long been evident and was evident to the Ninth and Fifth Circuits and to the District Court. The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed.  It is so ordered.  Chapter 2 is now technically Subchapter VI of Chapter 70 of 20 U. S. C., where it was codified by the Improving America’s Schools Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-382, 108 Stat. 3707.  For convenience, we will use the term "Chapter 2,” as the lower courts did.  Prior to 1994, Chapter 2 was codified at 20 U. S. C. §§2911-2976 (1988 ed.).  Congress in 1988 amended the section governing the sorts of materials and equipment available under Chapter 2.

 Justice O’Connor acknowledges that “neutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs,” one that our recent eases have “emphasized .  .  .  repeatedly.” Post, at 838 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The majority opinion also noted that only a small portion of the overall aid under the State’s program would go to religious education, see Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , but it appears that five Members of the Court thought this point irrelevant.  See id., at 491, n. 8 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring) (citing Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 401 (1983), to assert that validity of program “does not depend on the fact that petitioner appeal’s to be the only handicapped student who has sought to use his assistance to pursue religious training”); 474 U. S., at 490 (White, J., concurring) (agreeing with “most of Justice Powell’s concurring opinion with respect to the relevance of Mueller,” but not specifying further); id., at 493 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (agreeing with Justice Powell’s reliance on Mueller and explaining that the program did not have an impermissible effect, because it was neutral and involved private choice, and thus “[n]o reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts before us an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief”).  More recently, in Agostini v. Felton, <citedDecision>521 U. S. 203</citedDecision> (1997), we held that the proportion of aid benefiting students at religious schools pursuant to a neutral program involving private choices was irrelevant to the constitutional inquiry.  <citedDecision>Id., at 229</citedDecision> (refusing “to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid”); see also post, at 848 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting this passage).  Respondents also contend that Chapter 2 aid supplants, rather than supplements, the core educational function of parochial schools and therefore has the effect of furthering religion.  Our case law does provide some indication that this distinction may be relevant to determining whether aid results in governmental indoctrination, see Agostini, <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 228-229</citedDecision> ; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 12 (1993); but see School Dist. of G'rand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 396 (1985), but we have never delineated the distinction’s contours or held that it is constitutionally required.  Nor, to the extent that the supplement/supplant line is separable from respondents’ direct/indireet and “no divertibility” arguments, do we need to resolve the distinction’s constitutional status today, for, as we have already noted, Chapter 2 itself requires that aid may only be supplemental.  20 U. S. C. § 7371 (b).  See also post, at 867 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (declining to decide whether supplement/supplant distinction is a constitutional requirement); but see post, at 852 (explaining that computers are “necessary” to "the educational process”).  We presume that whether a parish has complied with that statutory requirement would be, at the very least, relevant to whether a violation of any constitutional supplement/supplant requirement has occurred, yet we have no reason to believe that there has been any material statutory violation.  A statewide review by the Louisiana SEA indicated that § 7371(b) receives nearly universal compliance.  App. 112a.

 The contact person also is usually not involved with the computers.  Id., at 163a.  Thus, the contact person is uninvolved in the actual use of the divertible equipment and, therefore, in no position to know whether diversion has occurred.  See id., at 154a.  Unsurprisingly, then, no contact person has ever reported diversion.  Id., at 147a.  (In <citedDecision>Agostini</citedDecision> , by contrast, monitors visited each classroom — unannounced—once a month, and the teachers received specific training in what activities were permitted.  <citedDecision>521 U. S., at 211-212, 234</citedDecision> .) The head of the Jefferson Parish LEA admitted that she had, and could have, no idea whether Chapter 2 equipment was being diverted: “Q: Would there be any way to ascertain, from this on-site visit, whether the material or equipment purchased are used not only in accordance with Chapter 2 plan submitted, but for other purposes, also?  “A: No. “Q: Now, would it be your view that a church-affiliated school that would teach the creation concept of the origin of man, that if they used [a Chapter 2] overhead projector, that would be a violation... ?  “A: Yes.  “Q: Now, is there any way, do you ever ask that question of a church-affiliated school, as to whether they use it for that purpose?  “A: No.” App. 144a, 150a-151a.  See <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 139a, 145a, 146a-147a (similar).  In fact, a label, by associating the government with any religious use of the equipment, exacerbates any Establishment Clause problem that might exist when diversion occurs.  Justice O’Connor dismisses as de minimis the evidence of actual diversion.  Post, at 864-865 (opinion concurring in judgment).  That may be, but it is good to realize just what she considers de minimis.  There is *834 persuasive evidence that Chapter 2 audiovisual equipment was used in a Catholic school’s theology department.  “[M]uch” of the equipment at issue “was purchased with Federal funds,” App. 205a, and those federal funds were, from the 1982-1983 school year on, almost certainly Chapter 2 funds, see <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 210a; ef.  <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 187a, 189a.  The diversion occurred over seven consecutive school years, <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 206a-207a, and the use of the equipment in the theology department was massive in each of those years, outstripping in every year use in other departments such as science, math, and foreign language, <citedDecision>ibid.</citedDecision> In addition, the dissent has documented likely diversion of computers.  Post, at 910.  The coordinator of the Jefferson Parish LEA ordered the books recalled sometime in the summer or early fall of 1985, and it appears that the schools had complied with the recall order by the second week of December 1985.  App. 162a, 80a-81a.  Respondents filed suit in early December.  This self-correction is a key distinction between this instance of providing improper content and the evidence of actual diversion.  See n. 17, supra. Indeed, as petitioners observe, to require exclusion of religious schools from such a program would raise serious questions under the Free Exercise Clause.
