92291,88699,Osborne v. Mobile (1873),Overruled,"The state court relies upon the case of Osborne v. Mobile, 16 Wall. 479, ... This court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional. This was in December term, 1872. In view of the course of decisions which have been made since that time, it is very certain that such an ordinance would now be regarded as repugnant to the power Conferred upon Congress to regulate commerce among the several States.","The Acting Decision expressly states that the holding of Osborne v. Mobile would now be regarded as unconstitutional, thereby overruling its precedential value."
92291,89664,Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co. (1878),Mentioned,"In the case of The Pensacola Telegraph Company v. The Western Union Telegraph Company, 96 U. S. 1, we held that it was not only the right, but the duty of Congress to take care that intercourse among the States and the transmission of intelligence between them be not obstructed or unnecessarily incumbered by state legislation...","The Acting Decision references Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co. to support its reasoning, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
92291,90600,Telegraph Co. v. Texas (1882),Mentioned,"In Western Union Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U. S. 460, we decided that a State cannot lay a tax on the interstate business of a telegraph company, as it is interstate commerce, and that if the company accepts the provisions of the act of 1866, it becomes an agent of the United States, so far as the business of the government is concerned...","The Acting Decision cites Telegraph Co. v. Texas as precedent supporting its holding, without criticizing or limiting its authority."
92291,91869,Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District (1887),Mentioned,"It comes plainly within the principle of the decisions lately made by this court in Robbins v. The Taxing District of Shelby County, 120 U. S. 489...","The Acting Decision references Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District as supporting precedent, without questioning or altering its authority."
92291,91985,Philadelphia & Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania (1887),Mentioned,"It comes plainly within the principle of the decisions lately made by this court in ... Philadelphia and Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S. 326.","The Acting Decision cites Philadelphia & Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania as supporting precedent, without criticizing, limiting, or otherwise altering its authority."
93904,93354,Roberts v. Lewis (1892),Mentioned,"This certificate distinctly presents for decision the question (argued, but not decided, when this case was before this court at a former term, reported in 144 U. S. 653 ) of the construction of the will of Jacob Dawson...","The Acting Decision references the earlier appearance of the case (Roberts v. Lewis, 144 U.S. 653) to note that the question was previously argued but not decided; there is no substantive discussion or critique, so the treatment is 'Mentioned'."
93904,87423,Suydam v. Williamson (1861),Mentioned,"The opinion of the Supreme Court of the State appears to have been formed upon full consideration of the difficulties of. the case; and is entitled to great weight, especially upon the construction of the statute of the State. Suydam v. Williamson, 24 How. 427.","Suydam v. Williamson is cited as authority for giving weight to state court interpretations of state statutes, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes nor distinguishes it, so it is merely 'Mentioned'."
93904,84798,Lambert's Lessee v. Payne (1805),Mentioned,"He begins by giving her 'all my estate, real and personal,' which of itself would carry a fee, unless restricted by other words. Lambert v. Paine, 3 Cranch, 97.","The Acting Decision references Lambert v. Paine as a general principle supporting its reasoning, without criticizing or limiting it, so the treatment is 'Mentioned'."
93904,89382,Brant v. Virginia Coal & Iron Co. (1876),Distinguished,"In Brant v. Virginia Coal Co., the bequest which was held to give a life estate, and no power to convey a fee, was only of the testator’s estate, real and personal, to his wife, 'to have and to hold during her life, and to do with as she sees proper, before her death.' 93 U. S. 327.",The Acting Decision explains that Brant v. Virginia Coal Co. involved different will language and thus is not controlling; it is distinguished on its facts and wording.
93904,90983,Howard v. Carusi (1884),Mentioned,"If the clause containing them is repugnant and void, the view of the Supreme Court of Nebraska that the widow took an estate in fee is fortified. See Howard v. Carusi, 109 U. S. 725; Potter v. Couch, 141 U. S. 296, 315, 316.","Howard v. Carusi is cited as additional support for a possible interpretation, but there is no discussion or critique, so it is 'Mentioned'."
93904,93152,Potter v. Couch (1891),Mentioned,"If the clause containing them is repugnant and void, the view of the Supreme Court of Nebraska that the widow took an estate in fee is fortified. See Howard v. Carusi, 109 U. S. 725; Potter v. Couch, 141 U. S. 296, 315, 316.","Potter v. Couch is cited alongside Howard v. Carusi as supporting authority, but not discussed or criticized, so it is 'Mentioned'."
93904,90455,Giles v. Little (1881),Overruled,"This court, on reconsideration of the whole matter... is of opinion that the sound construction of this will, as to the extent of the power conferred on the widow, is in accordance with the conclusion of the state court, and not with the former decision of this court, which must, therefore, be considered as overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly states that the former decision in Giles v. Little is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value."
98124,96356,Rogers v. Peck (1905),Mentioned,"Due process of law, this court has held, does not require the State to adopt any particular form of procedure, so long as it appears that the accused has had sufficient notice of the accusation and an adequate opportunity to defend himself in the prosecution. Rogers v. Peck, 199 U. S. 425, 435 , and previous cases in this court there cited.","The Acting Decision references Rogers v. Peck as support for a general principle regarding due process, without criticizing, limiting, or otherwise altering its authority. The citation is used to reinforce the court's reasoning, constituting a 'Mentioned' treatment."
98124,94455,Crain v. United States (1896),Overruled,"Holding this view> notwithstanding our reluctance to overrule former decisions of this court, we now are constrained to hold that the technical enforcement of formal *647 rights in criminal procedure sustained in the Crain Case is no longer required in the prosecution of offenses under present systems of law, and so far as that case is not in accord with the views herein expressed it is necessarily overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Crain v. United States is 'necessarily overruled' to the extent it conflicts with the current opinion, which is a clear and express overruling."
91306,88061,Texas v. White,Overruled,"The position there taken that the legislature of Texas, while the State was owner of the bonds, could limit their negotiability by an act of legislation, of which all subsequent purchasers were charged with notice, although the bonds on their face were payable to bearer, must be regarded as overruled. And the further position that negotiable government securities, redeemable at the pleasure of the government after a specified day, but in which no date is fixed for final payment, cease to be negotiable as overdue after the day named when they first become redeemable, must be regarded as limited to cases where the title of the purchaser is acquired with notice of the defect of title, or under circumstances which discredit the instrument, such as would affect the title to negotiable paper payable on demand, when purchased after an unreasonable length of time from the date of issue.","The Acting Decision expressly states that a key holding of Texas v. White 'must be regarded as overruled,' directly nullifying its precedential value on that point."
91306,88994,Vermilye & Co. v. Adams Express Co.,Questioned,"Mr. Justice Miller then added: 'We have not quoted the language from the opinion in that case with any view of affirming it. It may admit of grave doubt whether such bonds, redeemable but not payable at a certain day, except at the option of the government, do become overdue in the sense of being dishonored if not paid or redeemed on that day.'","The Acting Decision expresses 'grave doubt' about the reasoning in Vermilye, questioning its continuing validity on the relevant legal issue."
91306,87633,Murray v. Lardner,Mentioned,"The rules established in Murray v. Lardner, 2 Wall. 110, 118 — 'that the purchaser of coupon bonds, before due, without notice and in good faith, is unaffected by want of title in the seller, and that the burden of proof in respect-to notice and want of good faith is on the claimant of the bonds as against the purchaser' — were repeated and reaffirmed, but it was added: 'These rules have never been applied to matured obligations.'","The Acting Decision references and restates the rule from Murray v. Lardner without criticizing, limiting, or otherwise altering its authority."
91306,88240,Texas v. Hardenberg,Mentioned,"The case came before the court again in another aspect, and is reported as Texas v.

Hardenberg without criticizing or distinguishing it.
91306,88693,Huntington v. Texas,Mentioned,"The same questions, as to part of the same issue of bonds, came again before the court in Huntington v. Texas, 16 Wall. 402, in which the two prior decisions were relied on, on behalf of the State of Texas, as conclusive.","The Acting Decision references Huntington v. Texas as part of the historical development of the law, without criticizing or limiting its authority."
91306,88924,National Bank of Washington v. Texas,Distinguished,"The question 'whether the bonds were overdue in the sense which puts a purchaser of dishonored negotiable paper on the inquiry as to defences which may be set up against it,' was expressly waived, in the opinion of the court, because, it being 'quite clear that they were transferable by delivery after due, the same as before,' it followed that, 'to invalidate the title so acquired by a purchaser, it is necessary to make out some defect in that title,' which the court decided had not been done.",The Acting Decision notes that the key legal question was expressly waived in National Bank of Washington v. Texas and distinguishes the facts and reasoning from the present case.
91306,89668,Cromwell v. County of Sac,Mentioned,"""To hold otherwise,"" said this court in Cromwell v. County of Sac, 96 U. S. 51, 58, ""would throw discredit upon a large class of securities issued by municipal and private corporations, having years to run, with interest payable annually or semi-annually.""","The Acting Decision quotes Cromwell v. County of Sac to support a general principle, without criticizing or limiting its authority."
91306,90400,Railroad Co. v. Sprague,Mentioned,"And the doctrine was reaffirmed in Railway Co. v. Sprague, 103 U. S. 756.","The Acting Decision references Sprague as reaffirming a doctrine, without criticizing, limiting, or otherwise altering its authority."
99004,95042,Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway Co. v. Smith (1899),Overruled,"True it is that it may not be possible to reconcile these views with all that is said in the opinion delivered for the majority of the court in the case of Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co. v. Smith, supra. The views therein expressed which are inconsistent with the right of the States to fix reasonable commutation fares when the carrier has itself established fares for such service, must be regarded as overruled by the decision in this case.","The Acting Decision expressly states that the inconsistent views in the Smith case 'must be regarded as overruled,' making this an explicit overruling of at least part of the Cited Decision."
99004,3485674,Penna. R.R. Co. v. Public Ser. Com. (1915),Affirmed,"The injunction was refused, and on appeal the Court of Appeals of Maryland affirmed the decree...

99004,93379,Interstate Com. Commiss. v. B. & O. RAILROAD (1892),Mentioned,"In Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 145 U. S. 263 , this court held that a 'party rate ticket' for the transportation of ten or more persons at a less rate than that charged a single individual did not make a discrimination against an individual charged more for the same service, or amount to an unjust or unreasonable discrimination within the meaning of the Act to Regulate Commerce. In the course of the opinion the right to issue tickets at reduced rates good for limited periods upon the principle of commutation was fully recognized.","The Acting Decision references this case to support a general principle and does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
99004,98392,"Norfolk and Western Railway Company v. Conley, Attorney General of the State of West Virginia (1913)",Mentioned,"In Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. West Virginia, 236 U. S. 605, 608 , after making reference to Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, 236 U.

S. 352 ) the legality of an order of the Commission of that State was recognized which fixed a maximum freight rate and passenger rate, the latter at two cents a mile as the maximum fare for passengers twelve years of age or over, and one cent a mile for those under twelve years of age.","The Acting Decision references this case as an example of the legality of certain rate regulations, without criticism or limitation."
99004,96710,Interstate Consolidated Street Railway Co. v. Massachusetts (1907),Mentioned,In Interstate R. Co. v. Massachusetts ( 207 U. S. 79 ) the Massachusetts law prescribing special rates less than the maximum for school children was held valid.,"The Acting Decision cites this case as an example supporting the validity of special rates, without criticizing or limiting its holding."
93311,92988,Merrill v. Monticello (1891),Mentioned,"In Merrill v. Monticello, 138 U. S. 673, 687, 691 , it was held that the implied power of a municipal corporation to borrow money to enable it to execute the powers expressly conferred upon it by law, if existing at all, did not authorize it to create and issue negotiable securities to be sold in the market and to be taken by the purchaser freed from the equities that might be set up by the maker; and that to borrow money, and to give a bond or obligation therefor which might circulate in the market as a negotiable security, freed from any equities that might be set up by the maker of it, were essentially different transactions in their nature and legal effect.","The Acting Decision discusses and applies the reasoning of Merrill v. Monticello, citing it with approval and using its principles, but does not criticize, limit, or overrule it. The case is analyzed and relied upon, so the treatment is 'Mentioned'."
93311,87743,Rogers v. Burlington (1866),Overruled,"We, therefore, must regard the cases of Rogers v. Burlington and Mitchell v. Burlington, as overruled in the particular-referred to, by later cases in this court.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Rogers v.

93311,91125,Claiborne County v. Brooks (1884),Mentioned,"In Claiborne County v. Brooks, 111 U. S. 400 , it was held that the power to issue commercial paper was foreign to the objects of the creation of the political divisions of counties and townships, and was not to be conceded to such organizations unless by virtue of express legislation or by very strong implication from such legislation; and that the power conferred by statutes of Tennessee upon a county, to erect a court-house, jail and other necessary county buildings, did not authorize the issue of commercial paper as evidence of or security for a debt contracted for the construction of such a building.- The opinion in the case was delivered by Mr. Justice Bradley; and the case of Police Jury v. Britton, 15 Wall. 566 , was cited and approved, although the unsuccessful *185 party cited as authority the case of Rogers v. Burlington, 3 Wall. 654 .","The Acting Decision describes and applies the holding of Claiborne County v. Brooks, citing it with approval and using its reasoning, but does not criticize, limit, or overrule it. The treatment is 'Mentioned'."

Britton (1873),Mentioned,"In the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Bradley, it is stated, that the police jury of the parish of Tensas, Louisiana, which issued the negotiable bonds in question in that case, had no express authority to issue them; that the power could not be implied from the ordinary powers of local administration and police which were conferred upon the boards and trustees of political districts; ... and that, although the authority for such-bodies to issue negotiable paper might be implied in some cases from other and express powers granted, those implications should not be extended beyond the fair inferences to be gathered from the circumstances of each case.","The Acting Decision discusses and applies the reasoning of Police Jury v.

Merchants' National Bank (1887),Mentioned,"The state courts, including those of Georgia where the cause of action arose, have very generally reached the opposite conclusion, holding that the liability of the principal for the false statement or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope of his authority is unaffected by his secret purpose or motives.

Merchants’ Nat’l Bank, 78 Ga. 574 ...","The Acting Decision references this case as an example of the prevailing rule in state courts, but does not analyze or alter its holding."

92059,91368,Poindexter v. Greenhow (1885),Distinguished,"This proposition, indeed, is said to be justified by the authority of certain language in the opinion of this court in the case of Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270 . In that case the effect of a tender in payment of taxes upon the subsequent act of the collector in seizing the personal property of the tax-payer was considered and decided, but there is nothing in the opinion which countenances the idea that such a tender was a payment of the taxes, so as to extinguish all subsequent claim of the State therefor. Its effect was precisely defined in the following statement (page 299): His tender, as we have already seen, was equivalent to payment, so far as concerns the legality of all subsequent steps by the collector to enforce payment by distraint of his property. There is nothing in the opinion to indicate that the party making the tender was relieved from the operation of the rule of law, making it necessary to keep the tender good, or that a subsequent action at law for the recovery of the taxes would be unlawful, reserving, of course, in such a case, the admitted right of the defendant to plead the fact of his tender and bring it into court, in pursuance of the usual practice in such cases, as a defence.","The Acting Decision explains that Poindexter v. Greenhow addressed a different factual scenario—seizure of property after a tender—whereas the present case concerns the right to bring suit after a tender. The court clarifies the scope of Poindexter and limits its application, thus distinguishing it."
92059,91371,Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (1885),Distinguished,"In pursuance of the principles adjudged in the case of Osborn v. Bank of the United States, supra, it has been repeatedly and uniformly held by this court that an injunction will lie to restrain the collection of taxes sought to be collected by seizures of property imposed in the name of the State, but contrary to the Constitution of the United States, the defendants being officers of the State threatening the distraint complained of. The grounds of this jurisdiction were stated in Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 114 U.S. 311. The vital principle in all such cases is that the defendants, though professing to act as officers of the State, are threatening a violation of the personal or property rights of the complainant, for which they are personally and individually liable... The present case stands upon a footing altogether different.","The Acting Decision discusses Allen as an example of a case where officers were personally liable for violating property rights, but then states that the present case is 'altogether different,' thereby distinguishing Allen from the facts and legal issues at hand."
92059,88673,Davis v. Gray (1873),Distinguished,"And the point as involved in that case was stated by Mr. Justice Swayne, delivering the opinion of the court in Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 220, as follows: In deciding who are parties to the suit the *488 court will not look beyond the record. Making a state officer a party does not make the State a party, although her law may have prompted his action and the State may stand behind him as the real party in interest... But what was said by Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, supra, must be taken in connection with its immediate context...","The Acting Decision references Davis v. Gray as part of a line of cases about party status, but then clarifies that the present case is different in substance and outcome, thus distinguishing Davis v. Gray."
92059,87371,"Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON, GOVERNOR, &C. (1861)",Mentioned,"This view was reiterated by this court in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 98, where it was said to be settled, that where the State is a party, plaintiff or defendant, the Governor represents the State, and the suit may be, in form, a suit by him as Governor in behalf of the State, where the State is plaintiff, and he must be summoned or notified as the officer representing the State, where the State is defendant.","The Acting Decision references Dennison only to restate a general principle about party representation, without engaging in analysis or criticism, thus it is merely mentioned."
92059,91583,Hagood v. Southern (1886),Mentioned,"The converse of that case is to be found in Hagood v. Southern, 117 U.S. 52. There, the State of South Carolina, which was the party in interest, was not nominally a defendant... The decrees of the Circuit Court granting the relief were reversed, and the cause remanded, with *491 instructions to dismiss the bills, on the ground that the suits, though nominally against the officers of the State, were really against the State itself.","The Acting Decision cites Hagood v. Southern as an example supporting its jurisdictional analysis, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority; it is simply mentioned as precedent."
92059,90667,United States v. Lee (1882),Distinguished,"This principle is illustrated and enforced by the case of United States v. Lee, 106 U. S. 196. In that case the plaintiffs had been wrongfully dispossessed of their real estate by defendants, claiming to act under the authority of the United States... This feature will be found, on an examination, to characterize every case where persons have been made defendants for acts done or threatened by them as officers of the government... The present case stands upon a footing altogether different.","The Acting Decision discusses United States v. Lee as an illustration of a different principle—personal liability for wrongful acts—then expressly states that the present case is 'altogether different,' thereby distinguishing it."
92059,85451,Osborn v. Bank of United States (1824),Criticized,"It must be regarded as a settled doctrine of this court, established by its recent decisions, that the question whether a suit is within the prohibition of the 11th Amendment is not always determined by reference to the nominal parties on the record. Poindexter v. Greenhow, 114 U.S. 270, 287. This, it is true, is not in harmony with what was said by Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 857.","The Acting Decision expressly notes that its current doctrine is 'not in harmony' with the rule stated in Osborn, thereby criticizing the reasoning or approach of Osborn."
98917,97893,Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell (1913),Mentioned,"But this court, when the question came before it in Bauer v. O’Donnell, 229 U. S. 1, rejecting plausible argument and. adhering to the language of the statute from which all patent right is derived, refused to give such a construction to the act of Congress, and decided that the owner of a patent is not authorized by either the letter or the purpose of the law to fix, by notice, the price at which a patented article must be sold after the first sale of it, declaring that the right-to- vend is exhausted by a single, unconditional sale, the article sold being thereby carried outside the monopoly of. the patent law and rendered free of every restriction which the vendor may attempt to put upon it.","The Acting Decision references Bauer v. O'Donnell as precedent supporting its reasoning but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority; it is cited as an example of the exhaustion doctrine."
98917,97584,Henry v. A. B. Dick Co. (1912),Overruled,"It is obvious that the conclusions arrived at in this opinion are such that the decision in Henry v. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, must be regarded as overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Henry v. Dick Co. is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value."

Eastern Paper Bag Co., 210 U. S. 405, 422. So much being undisputed, I cannot understand why he may not keep it out of use unless the licensee, or, for the matter of that, the buyer, will use some unpatented thing in connection with it.","The Cited Decision is referenced in the dissent to support a general proposition about patent rights, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its authority."
98917,93828,Dunlap v. Schofield (1894),Mentioned,"Revised Statutes, § 4900, requiring that patented articles shall be marked with the word Patented” affects only the damages recoverable for infringement, Dunlap v. Schofield, 152 U. S. 244 , and Rev. Stats., § 4901, protects by its penalties the inventor, but neither one contemplates the use of such a License Notice” as we have here and whatevér validity it has must be derived from the general and not from the patent law.","Dunlap v. Schofield is cited for a narrow, factual point about statutory damages and marking requirements, without further discussion or criticism."
98917,94177,Keeler v. Standard Folding Bed Co. (1895),Mentioned,"The extent to which the use of the patented machine may validly be restricted to specific supplies or otherwise by special contract between the owner of a patent and the purchaser or licensee is a question outside the patent law and with it we are not here concerned.

98917,94711,United States v. American Bell Telephone Co. (1897),Mentioned,"It has long been settled that the patentee receives nothing from the law which he did not have before, and that the only effect of his patént is to restrain others from manufacturing, using or selling that which he has invented. The patent law simply protects him in the monopoly of that which he has invented and has described in the claims of his patent. United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., 167 U.

S. 587, came here on certiorari to the New York court, which had held the New York minimum wage act for women to be invalid... That view led to the affirmance by this Court of the judgment in the Morehead case, as the Court considered that the only question before it was whether the Adkins case was distinguishable and that reconsideration of that decision had not been sought.","The Acting Decision discusses Morehead as following Adkins and suggests that its result was dictated by adherence to Adkins, which is now overruled, thereby criticizing the reasoning and outcome of Morehead without expressly overruling it."

This court, following the findings of the highest court of New York ( 225 N. Y. 397, 403-404 ; 122 N. E. 260 ), held that the entire movement of the gas was interstate commerce and that, in the absence of contrary regulation by the Congress, the state commission had jurisdiction to prescribe such rates.","The Acting Decision references the New York court's findings and the Supreme Court's reliance on them, but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter the precedential value of the New York decision itself.

Tyson is, as Mr. Justice Holmes said, 'an unconstitutional assumption of powers by courts of the United States which no lapse of time or respectable array of opinion should make us hesitate to correct.'

Stevenson, 20 Nev. 269 ; 21 Pac. 317 , in a well reasoned opinion, held that the common law doctrine of riparian rights was unsuited to conditions prevailing in -the arid land states and territories of the west, and therefore was without force in Nevada; and that, in respect of the use of water, the applicable rule was based upon the doctrine of prior appropriation for a beneficial use.","The Acting Decision references Stevenson as an example of the adaptability of common law, but does not analyze, criticize, or otherwise alter its precedential value."

103172,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt,Mentioned,"It was there pointed out that the implied immunity of one government and its agencies from taxation by the other should, as a principle of constitutional construction, be narrowly restricted. ... In applying these controlling principles in the Gerhardt case the Court held that the salaries of employees of the New York Port Authority, a state instrumentality created by New York and New Jersey, were not immune from federal infeome tax, even though the Authority be regarded as not subject to federal taxation.","The Acting Decision discusses and applies the reasoning from Helvering v.

Mitchell,Mentioned,"The fact that the expenses ef the one government might be lessened if all those who deal with it were exempt from taxation by the other was thought not to be an adequate basis for tax immunity in Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514 ; Group No. 1 Oil Corp. v. Bass, 283 U. S. 279 ; Burnet v. Jergins Trust, 288 U. S. 508 ; James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134 ; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376 .","The Acting Decision references Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell as part of the development of the doctrine, but does not criticize, limit, or overrule it."
103172,102734,New York Ex Rel. Rogers v. Graves,Overruled,"Collector v. Day, supra, and New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, are overruled so far as they recognize an implied constitutional immunity from income taxation of the salaries of officers or employees of the national or a state government or their instrumentalities.",The Acting Decision expressly overrules New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves regarding its holding on implied constitutional immunity from income taxation of government salaries.
103172,86223,Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County,Overruled,"Neither Dobbins v. Commissioners, 16 Pet. 435 , and its offspring, nor Collector v. Day, supra, and its, can stand appeal to the Constitution and its historic purposes. Since both are the starting points of an interdependent doctrine, both should be, as I assume them to be, overruled this day.",Both the lead and concurring opinions state that Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County is overruled as a starting point of the now-rejected doctrine of implied immunity.
103172,102783,Brush v. Commissioner,Overruled,"From the decision just announced, it is clear that the Court has overruled Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County (1842) 16 Pet. 435 ; Collector v. Day (1871) 11 Wall. 113 ; New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, supra, and Brush v. Commissioner (1937) 300 U. S. 352 .","The dissenting opinion, summarizing the majority's holding, states that Brush v. Commissioner is overruled by the Acting Decision."

S. 429, 586 , 604 et seq.","Pollock is referenced for the separate opinion of Justice Field and as historical context, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise materially engage with its holding."
103214,3487033,Gordy v. Dennis (1939),Mentioned,"The cases, pro and con, are collected in the recent dissenting opinion by Chief Judge Bond of the Court of Appeals of Maryland in Gordy v. Dennis, 5 A. 2d 69, 82.","Gordy v. Dennis is cited as a collection of cases and for comparative purposes, but the Acting Decision neither adopts nor rejects its reasoning, nor does it distinguish or criticize it."
103214,100693,Miles v. Graham (1925),Overruled,"But to the extent *283 that what the Court now says is inconsistent with what was said in Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501, the latter cannot survive.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Miles v. Graham 'cannot survive' to the extent it is inconsistent with the current holding, which is the language of overruling."
103214,85272,M'culloch v. State of Maryland (1819),Mentioned,"He quoted (p,-505) with approval from Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522, the statement of the opinion (p. 530) that 'A tax upon the leases is a tax upon’the power to make them, and could be used to destroy - the power, to make them.' 15 *295 Miles v. Graham (1925), 268 U. S. 501, held invalid § 213 (a), Revenue Act of 1918, (condemned in Evans v. Gore) when applied to compensation of Judge Graham, *296 appointed after its enactment. Mr. Justice Holmes joined in the decision. Mr. Justice Brandéis merely noted dissent. In the course of the opinion, we said: ... The power to tax carries with it the power to embarrass and destroy’; may be applied to every object within its range fin such measure as Congress may determine’; enables that body to select one calling and omit another, to tax one class of property and to forebear to tax another’; and may be applied in different ways to different objects so long as there is ‘geographical uniformity’ in the duties, imposts and excises imposed. [Citing.] Is it not therefore morally certain that the discern *294 ing statesmen who framed the Constitution and were so sedulously bent on* securing the independence of the judiciary intended to protect the compensation of the judges from assault and diminution in the name or form of a tax? Could not the purpose of the prohibition be wholly thwarted if this avenue of attack were left open? Certainly there is nothing in the words of the prohibition indicating that it is directed against one legislative power and not another; and in our opinion due regard for its spirit and principle requires that it be taken as directed against them all.” . Mr. Justice Holmes wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brandéis joined. With that expression his opposition to the decision ended. Two years later, in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501, writing for the Court, invalidating a state tax upon- net income of a lessee from sales of his share of oil and gas received under leases of restricted Indian land, he said (p. 505): “In cases where the principal is absolutely immune from interference an inquiry is allowed into the sources from which net income is derived and if a part of it comes from-,such a source the tax is pro tanto void; Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429; 158 U. S. 601; a.rule lately illustrated by Evans v. Gore . . .” And in that case he relied on the truth, as put by Chief Justice Marshall in M’Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431, that “the power to tax involves the power to destroy.”","M'culloch v. Maryland is cited for the famous dictum about the power to tax, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or distinguish it; it is used as background authority."
103214,99610,Evans v. Gore (1920),Overruled,"By means of § 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932, Congress sought to avoid, at least in part, the consequences of Evans v. Gore, 253 U. S. 245. That case, decided on June 1, 1920, ruled for the first time that a provision requiring the compensation received by the judges of the United States to be included in the “gross income” from which the net income is to be computed, although merely part of a taxing measure of general, non-discriminatory application to all earners of incomes, is contrary to Article III, § 1, of the Constitution ... However, the meaning which Evans v. Gore imputed to the history which explains Article III, § 1, was contrary to the way in which it was read by other English-speaking courts. ... The decision met wide and steadily growing disfavor from legal scholarship and professional opinion. ... Evans v. Gore itself was rejected by most of the courts before whom the matter came after that decision. ... Evidently the, Court intends to destroy the decision in Evans v. Gore. Without suggesting that there is any distinction between that case and Miles v. Graham, it declares that the latter 'cannot survive.' But the decision of today fails to deal with, much less to detract from the reasoning of those cases. ... Admittedly the Court now repudiates its earlier decisions upon the point here in issue.","The Acting Decision makes clear that Evans v. Gore is no longer good law, describing the Court's intent to 'destroy the decision' and 'repudiates its earlier decisions,' which is the language of overruling."
103292,102488,Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co.,Overruled,We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine — untenable because they drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept and to which we adhere.,"The lead opinion expressly rejects and overturns the distinctions and reasoning of the St. Louis Trust cases, making clear that they are no longer good law."
103292,101723,Klein v. United States,Mentioned,"The teaching of the Klein case is exactly the opposite. ... Freed from the distinctions, introduced by the St. Louis Trust cases, the Klein case furnishes such a harmonizing principle.","The Acting Decision repeatedly references Klein v. United States as the controlling and correct principle, but does not alter, criticize, or limit it; it is cited as authoritative."
103292,101780,Cyrus H. McCormick v. David Burnet,Questioned,"The Commissioner made the same contention in this court, but it was overruled upon the authority of May v. Heiner. Then came the two St. Louis Union Trust Company cases, decided upon the authority of May v. Heiner and McCormick v. Burnet.","While the dissent treats McCormick as controlling, the lead opinion groups it with the St. Louis Trust cases and implies its reasoning is inconsistent with the Klein doctrine, thus questioning its continuing validity."
103292,101552,May v. Heiner,Questioned,"By the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, c. 454, 46 Stat. 1516, Congress displaced the construction which this Court put upon § 302 (c) in those cases wherein it was held that the reservation by a decedent of a life estate in property conveyed inter vivos, did not constitute a sufficient postponement of the remainder to bring it into the grantor’s gross estate. May v. Heiner, 281 U. S. 238 ...","The lead opinion notes that May v. Heiner was legislatively overruled in relevant part and treats its reasoning as superseded, thus questioning its precedential value."
103292,1477043,Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Schwarz,Mentioned,"Some indication of the influence of Klein v. United States upon the lower courts may be found in Sargent v. White, 50 F. 2d 410 and Union Trust Co. v. United States, 54 F. 2d 152, cert. denied, 286 U. S. 547. Cf. Commissioner v. Schwarz, 74 F. 2d 712.",Schwarz is only cited as an example of lower court application and is not discussed or analyzed further.
103292,1474615,Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Hallock,Mentioned,"In each case the Commissioner of Internal Revenue included the trust property in the decedent’s gross estate. In Nos. 110, 111 and 112 his determination was reversed by the Board of Tax Appeals, 34 B. T. A. 575, and the Board was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, 102 F. 2d 1.","This is a lower court decision in the same litigation, mentioned only as procedural history and not analyzed or criticized."
103292,102489,Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co.,Overruled,We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine — untenable because they drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept and to which we adhere.,"Becker is treated as part of the St. Louis Trust cases, whose distinctions and reasoning are expressly rejected and overruled by the Acting Decision."
103290,102529,Colgate v. Harvey (1935),Overruled,"Appellant relies upon Colgate v. Harvey 24 as a precedent to support his argument that the present statute is not within the limits of permissible classification and violates the privileges and immunities clause. In view of our conclusions, we look upon the decision in that case as repugnant to the line of reasoning adopted here. As a consequence, Colgate v. Harvey must be and is overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Colgate v. Harvey is 'repugnant to the line of reasoning adopted here' and concludes that it 'must be and is overruled,' which is a clear and direct overruling."
103290,88661,Butchers' Benevolent Ass'n v. Crescent City Live-Stock Landing & Slaughter-House Co. (1873),Mentioned,This Court declared in the Slaughter-House Cases 15 that the Fourteenth Amendment as well as the Thirteenth and Fifteenth were adopted to protect the negroes in their freedom. This almost contemporaneous interpretation extended the benefits of the privileges and immunities clause to other rights which are inherent in national citizenship but denied it to those which spring from *92 state citizenship.,"The Acting Decision references the Slaughter-House Cases to explain the historical interpretation of the privileges and immunities clause, but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
103290,96885,Twining v. New Jersey (1908),Mentioned,"Cf. Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 94 . Twining v. New Jersey, supra, 92 .","Twining v. New Jersey is cited as part of a string of authorities to illustrate the type of rights protected by the privileges and immunities clause, without any criticism or limitation."
103290,103226,Haguer v. Committee for Industrial Organization (1939),Mentioned,There is a very recent discussion in Hague v. C. I. O. 13 The appellant purports to accept as sound the position stated as the view of all the justices concurring in the Hague decision.,"The Acting Decision references Hague v. CIO as a recent discussion of the privileges and immunities clause, but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its authority."
103198,97661,Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States (1912),Limited,"In translating these- important objectives for effectuating the Congressional scheme to enlarge the independent powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission into a seemingly technical distinction between “negative” and “affirmative” orders, the opinion in Procter & Gambie v. United States gave authority to a doctrine which harmonizes neither with the considerations which induced it nor with the course of decisions which have purported to follow it. ... We conclude, therefore, that any distinction, as such, between “negative” and “affirmative” orders, as a touchstone of jurisdiction to review the Commission’s orders, serves no useful purpose, and insofar as earlier decisions have been controlled by this distinction, they can no longer be guiding.","The Acting Decision expressly limits the precedential value of Procter & Gamble by rejecting the distinction between 'negative' and 'affirmative' orders as a basis for jurisdiction, stating that earlier decisions controlled by this distinction 'can no longer be guiding.'"
103198,101973,Alton Railroad v. United States (1932),Mentioned,"In Alton R. Co. v. United States, 287 U. S. 229, the Court held reviewable the action of the Commission refusing to interfere with divisions set by a railroad in violation of a previous agreement, the Court stating that the action of the Commission validated divisions which were previously invalid.

United States as an example in its discussion of reviewability, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."

S. 226, 229, the doctrine of “negative orders” implies a jurisdictional defect which courts must consider sua sponte.","The Acting Decision cites United States v. Corrick as an example of the application of the 'negative orders' doctrine, but does not criticize or limit its holding."
103198,101012,United States v. Los Angeles & Salt Lake Railroad (1927),Mentioned,"The governing considerations which keep such orders without the area of judicial review were thus summarized .for the Court by Mr. Justice Brandéis indenying review-ability of a “final valuation” under the Valuations Act: “The so-called order here complained of is one which does not command the carrier to do, or to refrain from *131 doing, anything; which does not grant or withhold any authority, privilege or license; which does not extend or abridge any power or facility; which does not subject the carrier, to any liability, civil or criminal; which does not change the carrier’s existing or future status or. condition; which does not determine any right or obligation.” United States v. Los Angeles & S. L. R. Co., 273 U. S.. 299, 309-310.","The Acting Decision quotes United States v.

103198,98242,Intermountain Rate Cases (1914),Mentioned,"The initial decisión in this group of cases, the Intermountain Bate Cases, 234 U. S. 476, held reviewable the action of the Commissiqn in refusing to grant requested consent to depart from the long-short haul clause.","The Acting Decision cites Intermountain Rate Cases as an example of reviewable Commission action, but does not criticize or limit its authority."
103198,102969,United States v. Griffin (1938),Mentioned,"Under United States v. Corrick, 298 U. S. 435, 440, and United States v. Griffin, 303 U.

United States (1929),Distinguished,"It has been held that an act of misbehavior though covered by the latter provisions may also be a contempt if committed in the “presence” of the Court. Savin, Petitioner, supra. And see Sinclair v. United States, 279 U. S. 749 . Yet in view of the history of those provisions, meticulous regard for those separate categories of offenses must be had, so that ■the instances where there is no right to jury trial will be narrowly restricted.","The Acting Decision references Sinclair as an example of a case where contempt was found, but distinguishes the present case by emphasizing the need for a narrow construction and physical proximity, thus treating Sinclair as factually or legally different."
103505,99206,Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States (1918),Overruled,But for the reasons stated that decision must be overruled. The fact that in purpose and effect there was an obstruction in the administration of justice did not bring the condemned conduct within the vicinity of the court in any normal meaning of the term.,"The Acting Decision expressly states that Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States is overruled, rejecting its broader interpretation of the contempt statute."

But assuming that the term is applicable to him and to persons similarly situated, we do not consider ourselves bound by the language referred to. City of New York v. Miln was decided in 1837. Whatever may have been the notion then prevailing, we do not think that it will now be seriously contended that because a person is without employment and without funds he constitutes a 'moral pestilence.'

The leases were deemed to be instrumentalities of the United States in carrying out its duties to the Indians, and the Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, concluded that the tax imposed by Oklahoma was 'a direct hamper upon the effort of the United States to make the best terms that it can for its wards.' ... These decisions are not controlling here. The nature and purpose of copyrights place them in a distinct category and we are unable to find any basis for the supposition that a nondiscriminatory tax on royalties hampers in the slightest degree the execution of the policy of the copyright statute.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Gillespie is not controlling because the facts and legal context are different, thus distinguishing it."

The dominant power of the federal Government, as has *597 been repeatedly held, extends to the entire bed of a stream, which includes the lands below ordinary high-water mark. The exercise of the power within these limits is not an invasion of any private property right in such lands for which the United States must make compensation.","The Acting Decision cites Scranton v. Wheeler as authority for the general proposition regarding the federal government's power over navigable waters, but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
103493,97899,United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co. (1913),Mentioned,"7 United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., 229 U. S. 53, 62 ... 12 See the cases cited in Note 9, and United States v.

Lynah (1903),Limited,"But we think this Court has never followed it as a binding decision that compensation is due for injury or destruction of a riparian owner’s property located in the bed of a navigable stream. And we think that, so far as it sanctions such a principle, it is in irreconcilable conflict with our later decisions* 11 and cannot be considered as expressing the law.","The Acting Decision expressly declines to follow Lynah as binding precedent on the issue at hand, stating that it is in conflict with later decisions and cannot be considered as expressing the law, thereby limiting its scope and precedential value."
103493,98902,United States v. Cress (1917),Distinguished,"What was said in the Cress case must be confined to the facts there disclosed. In that case, the Government’s improvement in a navigable stream resulted in the flooding of the plaintiff’s land in and adjacent to a non-navigable stream. The owners of the land along and under the bed of the stream were held entitled to compensation for the damage to their lands. The question here presented was not discussed in the opinion.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Cress by limiting its application to its specific facts and noting that the question at issue in the present case was not discussed in Cress.

Briggs is cited as additional authority for the general proposition, without further discussion or modification."
103555,90350,Dietzsch v. Huidekoper,Distinguished,"The true rationale of these decisions is that the Removal Acts qualify pro tanto the Act of 1793. Subsequent decisions have clarified the loose ground advanced in French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250, 253. See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U. S. 226; Taylor and Willis, The Power of Federal Courts to Enjoin Proceedings in State Courts, 42 Yale L. J. 1169, 1174-75; compare Bryant v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 92 F. 2d 569, 571.","The Acting Decision discusses Dietzsch v. Huidekoper as a removal case, noting that its rationale is based on the Removal Acts, which are a statutory exception to the general rule. Thus, the case is distinguished from the present context, which does not involve removal."
103555,100061,Kline v. Burke Construction Co.,Mentioned,"See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U. S. 226, 235: 'The rank and authority of the [federal and state] courts are equal but both courts cannot possess or control the same thing at the same time, and any attempt to do so would result in unseemly conflict. The rule, therefore, that the court first acquiring jurisdiction shall proceed without interference from a court of the other jurisdiction is a rule of right and of law based upon necessity, and where the necessity, actual or potential, does not exist, the rule does not apply. Since that necessity does exist in actions in rem and does not exist in actions in -personam, involving a question of personal liability only, the rule applies in the former but does not apply in the latter.'","Kline v. Burke Construction Co. is quoted for its general principle about jurisdiction and is used to clarify the distinction between in rem and in personam actions. The Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its authority, but simply references and explains it."
103555,96399,Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad,Distinguished,"It has been suggested that the provision reflected the then strong feeling against the unwarranted intrusion of federal courts upon state sovereignty. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, was decided on February 18, 1793, less than two weeks before the provision was enacted into law. The significance of this proximity is doubtful. Compare Warren, Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345, 347-48, with Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, 200 U. S. 273, 291-92. ... Another group of cases is said to constitute an exception to § 265, namely, where federal courts have enjoined litigants from enforcing judgments fraudulently obtained in the state courts. ... The foundation of these cases is thus very doubtful. However, we need not undertake to reexamine them here since, in any event, they do not govern the cases at bar.","The Acting Decision discusses Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line Railroad as part of a group of cases whose foundation is described as 'very doubtful' and explicitly states that they do not govern the present case, thus distinguishing them."
103555,89070,French v. Hay,Distinguished,"Subsequent decisions have clarified the loose ground advanced in French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250, 253. See Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U.

Co., 92 F. 2d 569, 571.","The Acting Decision refers to 'the loose ground advanced in French v. Hay' and notes that later decisions have clarified its rationale, indicating that it is not controlling and is distinguished from the present context."
103555,89712,Dial v. Reynolds,Mentioned,"We come, then, to the so-called 'relitigation' cases, the first of which is Dial v. Reynolds, 96 U. S. 340. ... The lower court sustained Reynolds’ demurrer, and this Court affirmed. It held that the 'gravamen' of the bills was an injunction to prevent Reynolds from proceeding in the state court. 'Such an injunction, except under the Bankrupt Act, no court of the United States can grant. With this exception, it is expressly forbidden by law.' 96 U. S. at 341.","The Acting Decision summarizes the holding of Dial v. Reynolds as part of its historical review, but does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its authority. It is simply mentioned and explained."
103555,99752,Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble,Criticized,"Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble, 255 U. S. 356, held that a federal district court, having rendered a decree in a class suit brought in behalf of all the members of a certain class of beneficiaries in a fraternal association, may enjoin members of the class, found to be bound by the decree, from prosecuting suits in the state courts which would relitigate questions settled by such decree. The opinion of Mr. Justice Day contains no reference to either the Act of March 2, 1793, or to Dial v. Reynolds. ... Having determined this question in the affirmative, the Court disposed of the remaining — § 265 — question in one sentence, citing only one case in support of its conclusion, Looney v. Eastern Texas R. Co., supra, which, as we have seen, was not a relitigation case.","The Acting Decision points out that Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble did not adequately address the statutory prohibition and relied on a case that was not on point, thus criticizing its reasoning and precedential value."
103555,93714,Root v. Woolworth,Distinguished,"Root v. Woolworth, 150 U. S. 401, is erroneously regarded as illustrating a 'relitigation' exception to § 265. The case holds merely that courts of equity have jurisdiction to 'effectuate their own decrees by injunctions or writs of assistance in order to avoid the relitigation of questions once settled between the same parties.' 150 U. S. at 411-12. The Court did not uphold a federal injunction against a state suit to relitigate a claim already settled by a previous federal decree — no such state suit had been brought. Consequently, there was no occasion to consider the applicability of § 265.","The Acting Decision clarifies that Root v. Woolworth did not actually involve an injunction against state court proceedings and thus does not support a 'relitigation' exception, distinguishing it from the present context."
103555,95802,Prout v. Starr,Distinguished,"The 'first come, first served' rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537, was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U. S. 226, 235.

Starr has been discarded by later authority, distinguishing it from the current case."

103442,95716,Reid v. Colorado (1902),Mentioned,"Congress, following its own conception of public policy concerning the restrictions which may appropriately be imposed on interstate commerce, is free to exclude from the commerce articles whose use in the states for which they are destined it may conceive to be injurious to the public health, morals or welfare, even though the state has not sought to regulate their use. Reid v. Colorado, supra; Lottery Case, supra; Hipolite Egg Co. v. United States, supra; Hoke v. United States, supra.","Reid v.

It is plain that if appropriate emphasis be placed on-the orderly administration of justice rather than blind adherence to conflicting precedents, the Wachovia case must be overruled.

Olson (1931),Mentioned,"The power to impose a license tax on the exercise of these freedoms is indeed as potent as the power of censorship which this Court has repeatedly struck down. Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 ; Schneider v. State, supra; Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U. S. 296, 306 ; Largent v. Texas, 318 U. S. 418 ; Jamison v. Texas, supra.","Near v.

103736,96454,Haddock v. Haddock,Overruled,Haddock v. Haddock is overruled. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of North Carolina for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that Haddock v. Haddock is overruled, thereby expressly nullifying its precedential value."

Atherton held that full faith and credit must be given a decree of divorce granted by the state of the matrimonial domicil on constructive service against the other spouse who was a non-resident of that state.","The Acting Decision references Atherton v. Atherton to explain the historical context and prior doctrine, but does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
103736,87830,Christmas v. Russell,Mentioned,"Thus, even though the cause of action could not be entertained in the state of the forum, either because it had been barred by the local statute of limitations or contravened local policy, the judgment thereon obtained in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit. See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290; Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 262 U. S. 411; Titus v. Wallick, 306 U. S. 282, 291.","The Acting Decision cites Christmas v. Russell as supporting authority for the full faith and credit principle, but does not criticize or limit it."
103736,95458,Bell v. Bell,Distinguished,"The intimation in the majority opinion (220 N. C. pp. 460-464) that the Nevada divorces were collusive suggests that the second theory on which the State tried the case may have been an alternative ground for the decision below, adequate to sustain the judgment under the rule of Bell v. Bell, 181 U. S. 175—a case in which this Court held that a decree of divorce was not entitled to full faith and credit when it had been granted on constructive service by the courts of a state in which neither spouse was domiciled. But there are two reasons why we do not reach that issue in this case. In the first place, North Carolina does not seek to sustain the judgment below on that ground. Moreover it admits that there probably is enough evidence in the record to require that petitioners be considered 'to have been actually domiciled in Nevada.' In the second place, the verdict against petitioners was a general one. Hence, even though the doctrine of Bell v. Bell, supra, were to be deemed applicable here, we cannot determine on this rec *292 ord that petitioners were not convicted on the other theory...","The Acting Decision discusses Bell v. Bell as a possible but inapplicable ground, distinguishing the present case because the facts regarding domicile differ."
103736,102404,Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n of Cal.,Mentioned,"This Court, to be sure, has recognized that in case of statutes, 'the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed,' some 'accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states' is necessary. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, 294 U. S. 532, 547.","The Acting Decision references Alaska Packers as an example of the principle that statutes may require accommodation between states, but does not criticize or alter its holding."
103736,98476,Hood v. McGehee,Mentioned,"Thus we have here no question as to extraterritorial effect of a divorce decree insofar as it affects property in another State.

McGehee as an example of cases concerning property, not as controlling or criticized authority for the issue at hand."
103736,102412,Broderick v. Rosner,Mentioned,"But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandéis in Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642, 'the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one.'","The Acting Decision quotes Broderick v. Rosner for a general principle about the narrowness of exceptions to full faith and credit, without criticizing or limiting it."
103736,97084,Fall v. Eastin,Mentioned,"Thus we have here no question as to extraterritorial effect of a divorce decree insofar as it affects property in another State.

Eastin as an example of a property case, not as a controlling or criticized authority for the present issue."
103736,96865,Fauntleroy v. Lum,Mentioned,"Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U. S. 230. This Court only recently stated that Art. IV, § 1 and the Act of May 26, 1790 require that 'not some, but full' faith and credit be given judgments of a state court.","The Acting Decision cites Fauntleroy v. Lum as supporting authority for the full faith and credit principle, without criticism or limitation."
103736,103417,Milliken v. Meyer,Mentioned,"Domicil creates a relationship to the state which is adequate for numerous exercises of state power. See Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, 286 U.

Meyer as authority for the principle that domicile creates a sufficient relationship for state power, but does not criticize or otherwise alter its precedential value."
103761,101495,Johnson v. United States Shipping Bd. Emergency Fleet Corporation (1930),Limited,"Our conclusion, however, is that that position is untenable and that the Lustgarten case so far as it would prevent a private operator from being sued under the circumstances of this case must be considered as no longer controlling. *579 There is ample support for the holding in the Johnson case that § 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act was intended to provide the only available remedy against the United States or its wholly owned corporations for enforcement of maritime causes of action covered by the Act. But there is not the slightest intimation or suggestion in the history of that Act that it was designed to abolish all remedies which might exist against a private company for torts committed during its operation of government vessels under agency agreements.","The Acting Decision limits Johnson by holding that its exclusivity principle applies only to the United States or its wholly owned corporations, not to private operators, thus narrowing its scope."
103761,102049,Vancouver Steamship Co. v. Rice (1933),Mentioned,"We agree with the court below that this was a maritime tort over which the admiralty court has jurisdiction. Vancouver S. S. Co. v.

103761,103284,Yearsley v. W. A. Ross Construction Co. (1940),Distinguished,"It is, of course, true that government contractors obtain certain immunity in connection with work which they do pursuant to their contractual undertaking with the United States. Yearsley v. Ross Construction Co., 309 U. S. 18, was a recent example. ... But here the situation is quite different. The question is not whether the Commission had authority to delegate to respondent responsibilities for managing and operating the vessel as its agent. It is whether respondent can escape liability for a negligent exercise of that delegated power if we assume ... that by contract it will be exonerated or indemnified for any damages it must pay.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Yearsley by explaining that the facts and legal questions are different, and that the immunity principle in Yearsley does not apply to the present case."
103761,95660,Minnesota v. Hitchcock (1902),Mentioned,"Furthermore, if the United States were to become the real party in interest by reason of a contract for exoneration or indemnity, a basic alteration in that concept (Minnesota v. Hitchcock, 185 U. S. 373, 387) would be made, not pursuant to a Congressional policy 4 but by reason of concessions made by contracting officers of the government.","The case is cited as an example of a legal concept that would be altered if the opposing argument were accepted, with no further discussion."

We prefer to follow the latter as the more consonant with principle and authority. Reversed.","The Acting Decision expressly states it cannot follow Pinar Del Rio and disapproves its reasoning, choosing instead to follow contrary precedent.

103869,103816,Board of County Commissioners v. Seber (1943),Distinguished,"It is unnecessary to consider the State’s argument that Congress is without power to exempt these estates from taxation. This issue is not foreclosed by Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U.

This is not to say that the Classic case cuts directly into the rationale of Grovey v. Townsend . This latter case was not mentioned in the opinion. Classic bears upon Grovey v. Townsend not because exclusion of Negroes from primaries is any more or less state action by reason of the unitary character of the electoral process but because the recognition of the place of the primary in the electoral scheme makes clear that state delegation to a party of the power to fix the qualifications of primary elections is delegation of a state function that may make the party’s action the action of the State.","The Acting Decision discusses United States v. Classic at length, explaining its holding and how it relates to the present case, but does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its precedential value. The case is analyzed and its reasoning is incorporated, but it is not questioned or limited. Thus, the treatment is 'Mentioned.'"
103962,102431,Grovey v. Townsend (1935),Overruled,"Here we are applying, contrary to the recent decision in Orovey v. Townsend , the well-established principle of the Fifteenth Amendment, forbidding the abridgement by a State of a citizen’s right to vote. Orovey v. Townsend is overruled. Judgment reversed.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Grovey v. Townsend is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value."
103962,101911,Nixon v. Condon (1932),Mentioned,"The State Executive Committee of the Democratic party adopted a resolution that white Democrats and none other might participate in the primaries of that party. Nixon was refused again the privilege of voting in a primary and again brought suit for damages by virtue of § 31, Title 8, U. S. C. This Court again reversed the dismissal of the suit for the reason that the Committee action was deemed to be state action and invalid as discriminatory under the Fourteenth Amendment. The test was said to be whether the Committee operated as representative of the State in the discharge of the State’s authority. Nixon v. Condon, 286 U. S. 73 . The question of the inherent power *659 of a political party in Texas “without restraint by any law to determine its own membership” was left open. Id., 84-85.","The Acting Decision recounts the holding and reasoning of Nixon v. Condon, using it as historical background and precedent, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority. The treatment is 'Mentioned.'"

Hill is cited for the Texas state court's view of the Democratic party as a voluntary association, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes nor limits its holding, nor does it rely on it for its own constitutional analysis.

Universal Film Co., 243 U.

103916,97018,Leeds & Catlin Company v. Victor Talking Machine Company (No. 2) (1909),Overruled,"Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 2), supra, is authority for the conclusion that he who sells an unpatented part of a combination patent for use in the assembled machine may be guilty of contributory infringement. The protection which the Court in that case extended to the phonograph record, which was an unpat-ented part of the patented phonograph, is in substance inconsistent with the view which we have expressed in this case. The rule of the Leeds & Catlin case (No. 2) accordingly must no longer prevail against the defense 1 that a combination patent is being used to protect an unpatented part from competition.","The Acting Decision expressly states that the rule of Leeds & Catlin (No. 2) 'must no longer prevail,' directly overruling its holding as it applies to the defense at issue."

Suppiger Co., 314 U. S. 488 ; B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, 314 U. S. 495 . In those cases both direct and contributory infringement suits were disallowed on a showing that the owner of the patent was using it 'as the effective means of restraining competition with its sale of an unpatented article.'","Leitch is cited as part of the established doctrine against patent misuse, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority. It is used as supporting precedent."

S. 364, 372 ) and denies to the patentee after issuance the power to use it in such a way as to acquire a monopoly which is not plainly within. *666 the terms of the grant. The necessities or convenience of the patentee do not justify any use of the monopoly of the patent to create another monopoly. The fact that the patentee has the power to refuse a license does not enable him to enlarge the monopoly of the patent by the expedient of attaching conditions to its use. United States v.

Natural Gas Pipeline Co., supra, that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of for-mulae in determining rates. Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of 'pragmatic adjustments.' Id., p. 586. And when the Commission’s order is challenged in the courts, the question is whether that order 'viewed in its entirety' meets the requirements of the Act.

103915,102270,Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission (1934),Mentioned,"The incongruity between the actual operations and the return computed on the basis of reproduction cost suggests that the Commission was wholly justified in rejecting the latter as the measure of the rate base. In view of this disposition of the controversy we need not stop to inquire whether the failure of the Commission to add the $17,000,000 of well-drilling and other costs to the rate base was consistent with the prudent investment theory as developed and applied in particular cases. Only a word need be added respecting depletion and depreciation. ... Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 292 U.

C. 18 , 16 S. E. 2d 411 . Bullington did not seek to review this judgment here. Instead, he sued Angel for the deficiency in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina.

S. 99, 108 ... The essence of diversity jurisdiction is that a federal court enforces State law and State policy. If North Carolina has authoritatively announced that deficiency judgments cannot be secured within its borders, it contradicts the presuppositions of diversity jurisdiction for a federal court in that State to give such a deficiency judgment.","The Acting Decision cites Guaranty Trust Co. v.

104704,104459,Caldarola v. Eckert (1947),Mentioned,"It relied upon the fact that we expressly distinguished the Hust *787 ease in Caldarola v. Eckert, supra. ... The Caldarola case, 332 U. S. 155 , undermined the foundations of Hust . See the dissent therein at pp. 161— 163. Caldarola held that the general agents under the standard form contract were not in possession and control of the vessel so as to make them liable under New York law to an invitee for injuries arising from negligence in its maintenance. Pp. 158-59. Our ruling was based on 'the interpretation of that contract' as 'a matter of federal concern.' We do not think it consistent to hold that the general agent has enough 'possession and control' to be an employer under the Jones Act but not enough to be responsible for maintenance under New York law. ... We think, however, that vicarious liability to anyone must be predicated on the relation which exists under the standard form agreement and the shipping articlés between the general agent on the one hand and the master and crew of the vessel on the other. Caldarola held that this relation was not one which involved that proximity necessary to a finding of liability in the general agent for the torts of the master and crew. We perceive no reason why the rationale of this holding does not apply with equal force to a suit under the Jones Act.","The Acting Decision discusses and applies the reasoning of Caldarola v. Eckert, treating it as sound and using its rationale to support the outcome, but does not overrule, criticize, or distinguish it. The case is mentioned with approval and its reasoning is adopted."

104704,103979,"National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc. (1944)",Mentioned,"We assume, without deciding, that the rule of the Hearst case applies, that is, the word 'employment' should be construed so as to give protection to seamen for torts committed against them by those standing in the proximate relation of employer, and the rules of private agency should not be rigorously ap *791 plied. 11 Yet this Court may not disregard the plain and rational meaning of employment and employer to furnish a seaman a cause of action against one completely outside the broadest lines or definitions of employment or employer.","The Acting Decision references Hearst Publications as a possible interpretive rule but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its precedential value; it is simply mentioned as a possible standard."

104704,103761,Brady v. Roosevelt Steamship Co. (1943),Distinguished,"As to the first conclusion, we think it arises from a misconception of the ruling of the Brady case. The Brady case decided no more, directly or by implication, than that an action could be maintained against agents of the United States at common law for the agents’ own torts. The case did not involve the right to recover against employers under the Jones Act. Brady was a customs inspector suing for injuries sustained when a ship’s ladder broke. The opinion said, 317 U. S. at 577 , 'The sole question here is whether the Suits in Admiralty Act makes private operators such as respondent nonsuable for their torts.' 9 Cf. Caldarola v. Eckert, 332 U. S. at 159-160.","The Acting Decision explains that Brady v. Roosevelt Steamship Co. addressed a different legal issue and does not control the present case, thereby distinguishing it."

Regents of the University of California,Distinguished,"It was held that those who take advantage of its opportunities may not on ground of conscience refuse compliance with such conditions. Hamilton v. Regents, 293 U. S. 245. In the present case attendance is not optional. That case is also to be distinguished from the present one because, independently of college privileges or requirements, the State has power to raise militia and impose the duties of service therein upon its citizens.",The lead opinion explicitly distinguishes Hamilton on the grounds that attendance in the present case is not optional and the state’s power is different.

103870,99296,Schenck v. United States,Mentioned,"He was not enunciating a formal rule that there can be no restriction upon speech and, still less, no compulsion where conscience balks, unless imminent danger would thereby be wrought 'to our institutions or our government.' The flag salute exercise has no kinship whatever to the oath tests so odious in history. For the oath test was one of the instruments for suppressing heretical beliefs. *664 Saluting the flag suppresses no belief nor curbs it. Children and their parents may believe what they please, avow their belief and practice it. It is not even remotely suggested that the requirement for saluting the flag involves the slightest restriction against the fullest opportunity on the part both of the children and of their parents to disavow as publicly as they choose to do so the meaning that others attach to the gesture of salute. All channels of affirmative free expression are open to both children and parents. Had we before us any act of the state putting the slightest curbs upon such free expression, I should not lag behind any member of this Court in striking down such an invasion of the right to freedom of thought and freedom of speech protected by the Constitution. I am fortified in my view of this case by the history of the flag salute controversy in this Court. Five times has the precise question now before us been adjudicated. Four times the Court unanimously found that the requirement of such a school exercise was not beyond the powers of the states. Indeed in the first three cases to come before the Court the constitutional claim now sustained was deemed so clearly unmeritorious that this Court dismissed the appeals for want of a substantial federal question. Leoles v. Landers, 302 U. S. 656 ; Hering v. State Board of Education, 303 U. S. 624 ; Gabrielli v. Knickerbocker, 306 U. S. 621 . In the fourth case the judgment of the district court upholding the state law was summarily affirmed on the authority of the earlier cases. Johnson v. Deerfield, 306 U. S. 621 . The fifth case, Minersville District v. Gobitis, 310 U. S. 586 , was brought here because the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ran counter to our rulings. They were reaffirmed after full consideration, with one Justice dissenting. What may be even more significant than this uniform recognition of state authority is the fact that every Jus *665 tice — thirteen in all — who has hitherto participated in judging this matter has at one or more times found no constitutional infirmity in what is now condemned. Only the two Justices sitting for the first time on this matter have not heretofore found this legislation inoffensive to the “liberty” guaranteed by the Constitution. And among the Justices who sustained this measure were outstanding judicial leaders in the zealous enforcement of constitutional safeguards of civil liberties — men like Chief Justice Hughes, Mr. Justice Brandéis, and Mr. Justice Cardozo, to mention only those no longer on the Court. One’s conception of the Constitution cannot be severed from one’s conception of a judge’s function in applying it. The Court has no reason for existence if it merely reflects the pressures of the day. Our system is built on the faith that men set apart for this special function, freed from the influences of immediacy and from the deflections of worldly ambition, will become able to take a view of longer range than the period of responsibility entrusted to Congress and legislatures. We are dealing with matters as to which legislators and voters have conflicting views. Are we as judges to impose our strong convictions on where wisdom lies? That which three years ago had seemed to -five successive Courts to lie within permissible areas of legislation is now outlawed by the deciding shift of opinion of two Justices. What reason is there to believe that they or their successors may not have another view a few years hence? Is that which was deemed to be of so fundamental a nature as to be written into the Constitution to endure for all times to be the sport of shifting winds of doctrine? Of course, judicial opinions, even as to questions of constitutionality, are not immutable. As has been true in the past, the Court will from time to time reverse its position. But I believe that never before these Jehovah’s Witnesses *666 cases (except for minor deviations subsequently retraced) has this Court overruled decisions so as to restrict the powers of democratic government. Always heretofore, it has withdrawn narrow views of legislative authority so asi to authorize what formerly it had denied. In view of this history it must be plain that what thirteen Justices found to be within the constitutional authority of a state, legislators can not be deemed unreasonable in enacting. Therefore, in denying to the states what heretofore has received such impressive judicial sanction, some other tests of unconstitutionality must surely be guiding the Court than the absence of a rational justification for the legislation. But I know of no other test which this Court is authorized to apply in nullifying legislation. In the past this Court has from time to time set its views of policy against that embodied in legislation by finding laws in conflict with what was called the “spirit of the Constitution.” Such undefined destructive power was not conferred on this Court by the Constitution. Before a duly enacted law can be judicially nullified, it must be forbidden by some explicit restriction upon political authority in the Constitution. Equally inadmissible is the claim to strike down legislation because to us as individuals it seems opposed to the “plan and purpose” of the Constitution. That is too tempting a basis for finding in one’s personal views the purposes of the Founders. The uncontrollable power wielded by this Court brings it very close to the most sensitive areas of public affairs. As appeal from legislation to adjudication becomes more frequent, and its consequences more far-reaching, judicial self-restraint becomes more and not less important, lest we unwarrantably enter social and political domains wholly outside our concern. I think I appreciate fully the objections to the law before us. But to deny that it presents a question upon which men might reasonably *667 differ appears to me to be intolerance. And since men may so reasonably differ, I deem it beyond my constitutional power to assert my view of the wisdom of this law against the view of the State of West Virginia. Jefferson’s opposition to judicial review has not been accepted by history, but it still serves as an admonition against confusion between judicial and political functions. As a rule of judicial self-restraint, it is still as valid as Lincoln’s admonition. For those who pass laws not only are under duty to pass laws. They are also under duty to observe the Constitution. And even though legislation relates to civil liberties, our duty of deference to those who have the responsibility for making the laws is no less relevant or less exacting. And this is so especially when we consider the accidental contingencies by which one man may determine constitutionality and thereby confine the political power of the Congress of the United States and the legislatures of forty-eight states. The attitude of judicial humility which these considerations enjoin is not an abdication of the judicial function. It is a due observance of its limits. Moreover, it is to be borne in mind that in a question like this we are not passing on the proper distribution of political power as between the states and the central government. We are not discharging the basic function of this Court as the mediator of powers within the federal system. To strike down a law like this is to deny a power to all government. The whole Court is conscious that this case reaches ultimate questions of judicial power and its relation to our scheme of government. It is appropriate, therefore, to recall an utterance as wise as any that I know in analyzing what is really involved when the theory of this Court’s function is put to the test of practice. The analysis is that of James Bradley Thayer: . . there has developed a vast and growing increase of judicial interference with legislation. This is a very differ *668 ent state of things from what our fathers contemplated, a century and more ago, in framing the new system. Seldom, indeed, as they imagined, under our system, would this great, novel, tremendous power of the courts be exerted, — would this sacred ark of the covenant be taken from within the veil. Marshall himself expressed truly one aspect of the matter, when he said in one of the later yeare of his life: ‘No questions can be brought before a judicial tribunal of greater delicacy than those which involve the constitutionality of legislative acts. If they become indispensably necessary to the case, the court must meet and decide them; but if the case may be determined on other grounds, a just respect for the legislature requires that the obligation of its laws should not be unnecessarily and wantonly assailed.’ And again, a little earlier than this, he laid down the one true rule of duty for the courts. When he went to Philadelphia at the end of September, in 1831, on that painful errand of which I have spoken, in answering a cordial tribute from the bar of that city he remarked that if he might be permitted to claim for himself and his associates any part of the kind things they had said, it would be this, that they had ‘never sought to enlarge the judicial power beyond its proper bounds, nor feared to carry it to the fullest extent that duty required.’ “That is the safe twofold rule; nor is the first part of it any whit less important than the second; nay, more; today it is the part which most requires to be emphasized. Eor just here comes in a consideration of very great weight. Great and, indeed, inestimable as are the advantages in a popular government of this conservative influence, — the power of the judiciary to disregard unconstitutional legislation, — it should be remembered that the exercise of it, even when unavoidable, is always attended with a serious evil, namely, that the correction of legislative mistakes comes from the outside, and the people thus lose the political experience, and the moral education and stimulus that come from fighting the question out in the ordinary way, and correcting their own errors. If the decision in Munn v. Illinois and the ‘Granger Cases,’ twenty-five years ago, and in the ‘Legal Tender Cases,’ nearly thirty years *669 ago, had been different; and the legislation there in question, thought by many to be unconstitutional and by many more to be ill-advised, had been set aside, we should have been saved some trouble and some harm. But I venture to think that the good which came to the country and its people from the vigorous thinking that had to be done in the political debates that followed, from the infiltration through every part of the population of sound ideas and sentiments, from the rousing into activity of opposite elements, the enlargement of ideas, the strengthening of moral fibre, and the growth of political experience that came out of it all, — that all this far more than outweighed any evil which ever flowed from the refusal of the court to interfere with the work of the legislature. “The tendency of a common and easy resort to this great function, now lamentably too common, is to dwarf the political capacity of the people, and to deaden its sense of moral responsibility. It is no light thing to do that. “What can be done? It is the courts that can do most to cure the evil; and the opportunity is a very great one. Let them resolutely adhere to first principles. Let them consider how narrow is the function which the constitutions have conferred on them — the office merely of deciding litigated cases; how large, therefore, is the duty intrusted to others, and above all to the legislature. It is that body which is charged, primarily, with the duty of judging of the constitutionality of its work. The constitutions generally give them no authority to call upon a court for advice; they must decide for themselves, and the courts may never be able to say a word. Such a body, charged, in every State, with almost all the legislative power of the people, is entitled to the most entire and real respect; is entitled, as among all rationally permissible opinions as to what the constitution allows, to its own choice. Courts, as has often been said, are not to think of the legislators, but of the legislature — the great, continuous body itself, abstracted from all the transitory individuals who may happen to hold its power. It is this majestic representative of the people whose action is in question, a coordinate department of the government, *670 charged with the greatest functions, and invested, in contemplation of law, with whatsoever wisdom, virtue, and knowledge the exercise of such functions requires. “To set aside the acts of such a body, representing in its own field, which is the very highest of all, the ultimate sovereign, should be a solemn, unusual, and painful act. Something is wrong when it can ever be other than that. And if it be true that the holders of legislative power are careless or evil, yet the constitutional duty of the court remains untouched; it cannot rightly attempt to protect the people, by undertaking a function not its own. On the other hand, by adhering rigidly to its own duty, the court will help, as nothing else can, to fix the spot where responsibility lies, and to bring down on that precise locality the thunderbolt of popular condemnation. The judiciary, today, in dealing with the acts of their coordinate legislators, owe to the country no greater or clearer duty than that of keeping their hands off these acts wherever it is possible to do it. For that course — the true course of judicial duty always — will powerfully help to bring the people and their representatives to a sense of their own responsibility. There will still remain to the judiciary an ample field for the determinations of this remarkable jurisdiction, of which our American law has so much reason to be proud; a jurisdiction which has had some of its chief illustrations and its greatest triumphs, as in Marshall’s time, so in ours, while the courts were refusing to exercise it.” J. B. Thayer, John Marshall, (1901) 104-10. Of course patriotism can not be enforced by the flag salute. But neither can the liberal spirit be enforced by judicial invalidation of illiberal legislation. Our constant preoccupation with the constitutionality of legislation rather than with its wisdom tends to preoccupation of the American mind with a false value. The tendency of focussing attention on constitutionality is to make constitutionality synonymous with wisdom, to regard a law as all right if it is constitutional. Such an attitude is a great enemy of liberalism. Particularly in legislation affecting freedom of thought and freedom of speech much which should offend a free-spirited society is constitutional. Re *671 liance for the most precious interests of civilization, therefore, must be found outside of their vindication in courts of law. Only a persistent positive translation of the faith of a free society into the convictions and habits and actions of a community is the ultimate reliance against unabated temptations to fetter the human spirit.","Schenck is referenced in the dissent for its 'clear and present danger' test, but only to clarify its inapplicability to the present context; it is not criticized or limited."

104965,103990,"Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Minnesota (1944)",Distinguished,"Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Minnesota, 322 U. S. 292 , allowed the domiciliary state to tax the entire fleet: of airplanes operating interstate; but in that case, as in the Miller case, it was not shown that “a. defined part of the domiciliary corpus” had acquired a. taxable situs elsewhere. P. 295. Those cases, though exceptional on their facts, illustrate the reach of the taxing power of the state of the domicile as contrasted to that of the other states. But they have no application here since most; if not all, of the barges and boats which Ohio has taxed were almost continuously outside Ohio during the taxable year.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Northwest Airlines by noting factual differences regarding the presence of property in other states, thus declining to apply its rule."
104965,96335,Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky (1905),Mentioned,"The rule which permits taxatioft by two or more states on. an apportionment basis precludes taxation of all of the property by the state of the domicile. See Union Transit *385 Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194 . Otherwise there would be multiple taxation of interstate operations and the tax would have no relation to the opportunities, benefits, or protection which the taxing state gives those operations.","The Acting Decision cites Union Refrigerator Transit Co. as supporting authority for the apportionment rule but does not criticize, limit, or distinguish it, simply referencing it as precedent."

S. 161, considered the federal law which prohibited discrimination against union workers. ... This Court there held, over the dissents of Justices McKenna and Holmes, that the railroad, because of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment, had a constitutional right to discriminate against union members and could therefore do so through use of yellow dog contracts. The chief reliance for this holding was Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45, which had invalidated a New York law prescribing maximum hours for work in bakeries. ... This Court beginning at least as early as 1934, when the Nebbia case was decided, has steadily rejected the due process philosophy enunciated in the Adair-Coppage line of cases. In doing so it has consciously returned closer and closer to the earlier constitutional principle that states have power to legislate against what are found to be injurious practices in their internal commercial and business affairs, so long as their laws do not run afoul of some specific federal constitutional prohibition, or of some valid federal law.","The Acting Decision explicitly rejects the due process philosophy of Adair and its line of cases, indicating disagreement with its reasoning."

104610,98337,Coppage v. Kansas (1915),Criticized,"In 1914 this Court reaffirmed the principles of the Adair case in Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U. S. 1, again over strong dissents, and held that a Kansas statute outlawing yellow dog contracts denied employers and employees a liberty to fix terms of employment. For this reason the law was held invalid under the due process clause. ...

In Adams v. Tanner, this Court with four justices dissenting struck down a state law absolutely prohibiting maintenance of private employment agencies. The majority found that such businesses were highly beneficial to the public and upon this conclusion held that the state was without power to proscribe them. Our holding and opinion in Olsen v. Nebraska, supra, clearly, undermined Adams v. Tanner.",The Acting Decision criticizes Adams v. Tanner and states that it has been undermined by later precedent.
104610,100246,Chas. Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations (1923),Criticized,"Appellants also rely heavily on certain language used in this Court’s opinion in Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations, 262 U. S. 522. In that case the Court invalidated a state law which in part provided a method for a state agency to fix wages and hours. ... In invalidating this part of the state act, this Court construed the due process clause as forbidding legislation to fix hours and wages, or to fix prices of products. The Court also relied on a distinction between businesses according to whether they were or were not 'clothed with a public interest.' This latter distinction was rejected in Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502.",The Acting Decision criticizes the reasoning of Wolff Packing Co. and notes that its distinctions have been rejected.

Colorado (1949),Overruled,"We hold that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court... In overruling the Wolf case the Court, in my opinion, has forgotten the sense of judicial restraint which, with due regard for stare decisis, is one element that should enter into deciding whether a past decision of this Court should be overruled.",The lead opinion and the dissent both explicitly state that Wolf v. Colorado is being overruled by the Court's decision in Mapp v. Ohio.
106285,3599253,People v. Defore (1926),Questioned,"Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the 'weighty testimony' of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13, 150 N. E. 585 (1926). There Justice (then Judge) Cardozo, rejecting adoption of the Weeks exclusionary rule in New York, had said that '[t]he Federal rule as it stands is either too strict or too lax.' 242 N. Y., at 22, 150 N. E., at 588. However, the force of that reasoning has been largely vitiated by later decisions of this Court.","The Court discusses People v. Defore as a precedent that has lost its persuasive force due to subsequent developments, expressing doubt about its continuing validity."
106285,104943,Rochin v. California (1952),Mentioned,"They express 'supplementing phases of the same constitutional purpose — to maintain inviolate large areas of personal privacy.' Feldman v. United States, 322 U. S. 487, 489-490 (1944). The philosophy of each Amendment and of each freedom is complementary to, although not dependent upon, that of the other in its sphere of influence — the very least that together they assure in either sphere is that no man is to be convicted on unconstitutional evidence. Cf. Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 173 (1952).","Rochin v. California is cited as a comparative reference to support the Court's reasoning, but is not discussed or altered in its precedential value."

United States (1960),Mentioned,"These include the recent discarding of the 'silver platter' doctrine which allowed federal judicial use of evidence seized in violation of the Constitution by state agents, Elkins v. United States, supra; ... Only last year this Court expressly considered that contention and found that 'pragmatic evidence of a sort' to the contrary was not wanting. Elkins v. United States, supra, at 218.","Elkins v. United States is referenced multiple times to support the Court's reasoning and to illustrate the development of exclusionary rule doctrine, but its holding is neither changed nor criticized."
106285,98094,Weeks v. United States (1914),Mentioned,"Less than 30 years after Boyd, this Court, in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 (1914), stated that 'the Fourth Amendment ... put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints ... and the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon all entrusted under our Federal system with the enforcement of the laws.'

United States is cited as historical precedent for the principles underlying the exclusionary rule, but its authority is not questioned or altered."
106235,104252,Commissioner v. Wilcox (1946),Overruled,"Since Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, and Mr. Justice Clark agree with us concerning Wilcox, that case is overruled.","The lead opinion explicitly states that Commissioner v.

106235,104992,Rutkin v. United States (1952),Mentioned,"Six years later, this Court held, in Rutkin v. United States, 343 U. S. 130, that extorted money does constitute taxable income to the extortionist in the year that the money is received under § 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In Rutkin, the Court did not overrule Wilcox, but stated: 'We do not reach in this case the factual situation involved in Commissioner v. Wilcox, 327 U. S. 404. We limit that case to its facts.'","Rutkin is discussed for its reasoning and its relationship to Wilcox, but the Acting Decision neither overrules, criticizes, nor distinguishes it; it is used as supporting precedent and context."

United States, supra, at p. 138, is irrelevant. Likewise unimportant is the fact that the sufferer of an extortion is less likely to seek restitution than one whose funds are embezzled. What is important is that the right to recoupment exists in both situations.","Corliss v. Bowers is cited for a general principle about control over property and is not the subject of any criticism, limitation, or distinction."

Burnet (1932),Mentioned,"When a taxpayer acquires earnings, lawfully or unlawfully, without the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay and without restriction as to their disposition, 'he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money, and even though he may still be adjudged liable to restore its equivalent.'

105543,103736,Williams v. North Carolina (1943),Distinguished,"If it is due process for Nevada to adjudicate the marriage status of a domiciliary without personal service over the absent spouse (as it clearly is, see Williams v. North Carolina, I, 317 U. S. 287 ), I see no reason why Nevada cannot, at least for the purposes of her own law, also adjudicate the incidents of that status. ... Where status is concerned, this Court held that the interest in certainty as to whether one is married or single outweighs the interest of home States in the marital status of their domiciliaries, so that North Carolina was forced to swallow Nevada’s views as to what is sufficient cause for divorce even though the North Carolina wife had not appeared in the Nevada proceeding. Williams, I, supra. But I see no reason why we should extend that ... to hold that Nevada’s views as to support as well as divorce must be forced onto other States...","The Acting Decision distinguishes Williams v. North Carolina by noting that while it controls the recognition of marital status, it does not require the same result for support obligations, which are treated as a separate issue."
105543,89656,Pennoyer v. Neff (1878),Mentioned,"It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant. 6 Here, the Nevada divorce court *419 was as powerless to cut off the wife’s support right as it would have been to order the husband to pay alimony if the wife had brought the divorce action and he had not been subject to the divorce court’s jurisdiction. ... Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714, 726-727.","Pennoyer v.

105543,97747,Thompson v. Thompson (1913),Limited,"Petitioner claims that this case is governed by Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U. S. 551. For the reasons given in a concurring opinion in Armstrong v. Armstrong, 350 U. S. 568, 575, at 580-581, the Thompson case, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Thompson v. Thompson is no longer controlling to the extent it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, thereby limiting its precedential value."
105543,104568,Estin v. Estin (1948),Mentioned,"In Estin v. Estin, 334 U. S. 541, this Court decided that a Nevada divorce court, which had no personal jurisdiction over the wife, had no power to terminate a husband’s obligation to provide her support as required in a preexisting New York separation decree. The factor which distinguishes the present case from Estin is that here the wife’s right to support had not been reduced to judgment prior to the husband’s ex parte divorce. In our opinion this difference is not material on the question before us.","Estin v. Estin is discussed and its rule is applied to the present facts, with the Acting Decision stating that the factual distinction is not material. The case is neither overruled, criticized, nor limited, but rather mentioned and followed."
105525,93107,In Re Ross (1891),Limited,"The keystone of supporting authorities mustered by the Court’s opinion last June to justify its holding that Art. Ill, § 2, and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not apply abroad was In re Ross, 140 U. S. 453 . The Ross case is one of those cases that cannot be understood except in its peculiar setting; even then, it seems highly unlikely that a similar result would be reached today... At best, the Ross case should be left as a relic from a different era.","The lead opinion expressly states that Ross should be left as a relic and not expanded, thus limiting its precedential value to its facts and refusing to extend its reasoning to the present context."
105525,105326,United States Ex Rel. Toth v. Quarles (1955),Mentioned,"Construing this Courts decision in United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, 350 U.

105525,105412,Kinsella v. Krueger (1956),Reversed,"In No. 713, Kinsella v. Krueger, the judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded with instructions to order Mrs. Smith released from custody. Reversed and remanded.","The Acting Decision directly reverses the judgment in Kinsella v. Krueger, as explicitly stated in the lead opinion."
105525,95504,Downes v. Bidwell (1901),Distinguished,"The Court’s opinion last Term alsp relied on the “Insular Cases” to support its conclusion that Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were not applicable to the trial of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert. 22 We believe that reliance was misplaced. The “Insular Cases,” which arose at the turn of the century, involved territories which had only recently been conquered or acquired by the United States... The Insular Cases” can be distinguished from the present cases in that they involved the power of Congress to provide rules and regulations to govern temporarily territories with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions whereas here the basis for governmental power is American citizenship. None of these cases had anything to do with military trials and they cannot properly be used as vehicles to support an extension of military jurisdiction to civilians.",Downes v. Bidwell is treated as part of the Insular Cases and is expressly distinguished on the basis of different facts and legal context.

105525,85272,M'culloch v. State of Maryland (1819),Mentioned,"Nothing said here contravenes the rule laid down in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, at 421 , that: “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.”","McCulloch is quoted for a general principle regarding the Necessary and Proper Clause, but its holding is neither altered nor criticized."

105525,105004,Madsen v. Kinsella (1952),Distinguished,"Madsen v. Kinsella, 343 U. S. 341 , is not controlling here. It concerned trials in enemy territory which had been conquered and held by force of arms and which was being governed at the time by our military forces. In such areas the Army commander can establish military or civilian commissions as an arm of the occupation to try everyone in the occupied area, whether they are connected with the Army or not.","The Acting Decision expressly distinguishes Madsen v. Kinsella on the grounds that it involved military government in occupied enemy territory, not the trial of civilian dependents accompanying the armed forces in friendly countries."
105525,1528394,Ex Parte Milligan (1867),Mentioned,"On several occasions this Court has been faced with an attempted expansion of the jurisdiction of military courts. Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 , one of the great landmarks in this Court’s history, held that military authorities were without power to try civilians not in the military or naval service by declaring martial law in an area where the civil *31 administration was not deposed and the courts were not closed.","Ex Parte Milligan is cited as a landmark case supporting the principle that civilians cannot be tried by military courts when civilian courts are open, but its holding is not altered or criticized."
105525,99954,Balzac v. Porto Rico (1922),Distinguished,"To take but one example: Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U. S. 298 , is not good authority for the proposition that jury trials need never be provided for American citizens tried by *75 the United States abroad; but the case is good authority for the proposition that there is no rigid rule that jury trial must always be provided in the trial of an American overseas, if the circumstances are such that trial by jury would be impractical and anomalous.",Balzac is distinguished as not controlling the present case; its holding is limited to its facts and not extended to the situation at hand.
105525,105413,"Reid v. Covert, 351 U.S. 487 (1956)",Overruled,"Subsequently, the Court granted a petition for rehearing, 352 U. S. 901 .

Shillitani is mentioned as an example of a case where a certain procedure was followed, without further discussion or analysis."
106883,106545,Gideon v. Wainwright (1963),Mentioned,"The critical question in this case is whether, under the circumstances, .the refusal by the police to honor petitioner’s request to consult with his lawyer during the course of an interrogation constitutes a denial of “the Assistance of Counsel” in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as “made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,” Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 342 , and thereby renders inadmissible in a state criminal trial any incriminating statement elicited by the police during the interrogation.","Gideon v. Wainwright is cited as authority for the proposition that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel applies to the states, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes, limits, nor overrules it; it is used as foundational precedent."

Reversed and remanded.,The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court in The PEOPLE v. Escobedo.
106883,106822,Massiah v. United States (1964),Mentioned,"In Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201 , this Court observed that “a Constitution which guarantees a defendant the aid of counsel at . . . trial could surely vouchsafe no less to an indicted defendant under interrogation by the police in a completely extrajudicial proceeding. Anything less . . . might deny a defendant effective representation by counsel at the only stage when *485 legal aid and advice would help him.’ ” Id., at 204 , quoting Douglas, J., concurring in Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 326 .","Massiah is cited as supportive precedent for the right to counsel during interrogation, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
106883,105750,Cicenia v. Lagay (1958),Limited,"The Court’s opinion in Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , decided the same day, merely said that the “contention that petitioner had a constitutional right to confer with counsel is disposed of by Crooker v. California . . . That case adds nothing, therefore, to Crooker . In any event, to the extent that Cicenia or Crooker may be inconsistent with the principles announced today, they are not to be regarded as controlling.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Cicenia is not controlling to the extent it is inconsistent with the new rule announced, thereby limiting its precedential value."
106883,106595,White v. Maryland (1963),Mentioned,"It was a stage surely as critical as was the arraignment in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 , and the preliminary hearing in White v.

106883,105917,Spano v. New York (1959),Mentioned,"When petitioner requested, and was denied, an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, the investigation had ceased to be a general investigation of “an unsolved crime.” Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 327 (Stewart, J., concurring).","Spano v.

In any event, to the extent that Cicenia or Crooker may be inconsistent with the principles announced today, they are not to be regarded as controlling.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Crooker is not controlling to the extent it conflicts with the new rule, thereby limiting its precedential value."
106883,106300,Hamilton v. Alabama (1961),Mentioned,"It was a stage surely as critical as was the arraignment in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 , and the preliminary hearing in White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 . What happened at this interrogation could certainly “affect the whole trial,” Hamilton v. Alabama, supra, at 54, since rights “may be as irretrievably lost, if not then and there asserted, as they are when an accused represented by counsel waives a right for strategic purposes.” Ibid.","Hamilton v. Alabama is cited as precedent for the importance of counsel at critical stages, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
106576,100181,Adkins v. Children's Hospital of Columbia (1923),Mentioned,"This intrusion by the judiciary into the realm of legislative value judgments was strongly objected to at the time, particularly by Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brandéis. Dissenting from the Court’s invalidating a state statute which regulated the resale price of theatre and other tickets, Mr. Justice Holmes said, ... The doctrine that prevailed in Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns, and like cases — that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely- — -has long since been discarded. We have returned to the original constitutional proposition that courts do not substitute their social and economic beliefs for the judgment of legislative bodies, who are elected to pass laws. As this Court stated in a unanimous opinion in 1941, “We are not concerned . . . with the wisdom, need, or appropriateness of the legislation.” ... In the face of our abandonment of the use of the “vague contours” 9 of the Due Process Clause to nullify laws which a majority of the Court believed to be economically unwise, reliance on Adams v. Tanner is as mistaken as would be adherence to Adkins v. Children’s Hospital , overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937).","The Acting Decision references Adkins as part of a group of cases whose doctrine has been discarded and notes that Adkins was overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, but does not itself overrule, criticize, or otherwise treat Adkins beyond mentioning its historical context."
106576,96276,Lochner v. New York (1905),Criticized,"There was a time when the Due Process Clause was used by this Court to strike down laws which were thought unreasonable, that is, unwise or incompatible with some particular economic or social philosophy. In this manner the Due Process Clause was used, for example, to nullify laws prescribing maximum hours for work in bakeries, Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), ... The doctrine that prevailed in Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns, and like cases — that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely- — -has long since been discarded.","The Acting Decision expressly rejects the doctrine of Lochner and similar cases, stating that their approach has been discarded, which constitutes criticism of their reasoning and result."

Banton (1927),Mentioned,"This intrusion by the judiciary into the realm of legislative value judgments was strongly objected to at the time, particularly by Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Brandéis. Dissenting from the Court’s invalidating a state statute which regulated the resale price of theatre and other tickets, Mr. Justice Holmes said, ... Mr. Justice Holmes even went so far as to say that “subject to compensation when compensation is due, the legislature may forbid or restrict any business when it has a sufficient force of public opinion behind it.” Tyson & Brother v. Banton, 273 U. S. 418, 445, 446 (1927) (dissenting opinion).","The Acting Decision references Tyson & Brother v.

Binford (1932),Mentioned,"Legislative bodies have broad scope to experiment with economic problems, and this Court does not sit to “subject the State to an intolerable supervision hostile to the basic principles of our Government and wholly beyond the protection which the general clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to secure.” 7 ... 7 Sproles v.

(1949),Mentioned,"It is now settled that States “have power to legislate against what are found to be injurious practices in their internal commercial and business affairs, so long as their laws do *731 not run afoul of some specific federal constitutional prohibition, or of some valid federal law.” 8 Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Co., 335 U.

(1955)",Mentioned,"We refuse to sit as a “superlegislature to weigh the wisdom of legislation,” 11 and we emphatically refuse to go back to the time when courts used the Due Process Clause “to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, im *732 provident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.” 12 ... Mr. Justice Harlan concurs in the judgment on the ground that this state measure bears a rational relation to a constitutionally permissible objective. See Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U.

106576,98999,Adams v. Tanner (1917),Criticized,"In doing so, the Pennsylvania court relied heavily on Adams v. Tanner, 244 U. S. 590 (1917), which held that the Due Process Clause forbids a State to prohibit a business which is “useful” and not “inherently immoral or dangerous to public welfare.” Both the District Court in the present case and the Pennsylvania court in Stone adopted the philosophy of Adams v. Tanner , and cases like it, that it is the province of courts to draw on their own views as to the morality, *729 legitimacy, and usefulness of a particular business in order to decide whether a statute bears too heavily upon that business and by so doing violates due process. ... The doctrine that prevailed in Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns, and like cases — that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely- — -has long since been discarded. ... In the face of our abandonment of the use of the “vague contours” 9 of the Due Process Clause to nullify laws which a majority of the Court believed to be economically unwise, reliance on Adams v. Tanner is as mistaken as would be adherence to Adkins v. Children’s Hospital , overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937). Not only has the philosophy of Adams been abandoned, but also this Court almost 15 years ago expressly pointed to another opinion of this Court as having “clearly undermined” Adams . 10","The Acting Decision expressly rejects the reasoning and philosophy of Adams v. Tanner, stating that its doctrine has been abandoned and undermined, which constitutes criticism."
107081,104790,American Communications Assn. v. Douds (1950),Overruled,"American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382 , which upheld the predecessor statute to § 504 is ob *465 viously overruled.","The dissenting opinion explicitly states that Douds is 'obviously overruled' by the majority's reasoning, and the majority opinion repeatedly distinguishes and rejects the rationale of Douds, making clear that the precedent is no longer good law."
107081,106267,Communist Party of United States v. Subversive Activities Control Bd. (1961),Distinguished,"Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U. S. 1 , lends support to our conclusion. ... A majority of the Court rejected the argument that the Act was a bill of attainder, reasoning that § 3 does not specify the persons or groups upon which the deprivations set forth in the Act are to be imposed, but instead sets forth a general definition. ... In this case no disagreement over whether the statute in question designates a particular organization can arise, for § 504 in terms inflicts its disqualification upon members of the Communist Party.","The majority opinion distinguishes the Subversive Activities Control Board case by noting that the statute there set forth a general definition rather than targeting a specific group, unlike § 504, which directly targets Communist Party members."
107081,104353,Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System v. Agnew (1947),Distinguished,"The Solicitor General points out that in Board of Governors v. Agnew, 329 U. S. 441 , this Court applied § 32 of the Banking Act of 1933... We find this argument without merit. First, we note that § 504, unlike § 32 of the Banking Act, inflicts its deprivation upon the members of a political group thought to present a threat to the national security. ... Thus insofar as § 32 incorporates a condemnation, it condemns all men. ... That Congress was legislating with *455 respect to general characteristics rather than with respect to a specific group of men is well demonstratecfby the fact that § 32 provides that the prescribed disqualification should not obtain whenever the Board of Governors determined that 'it would not unduly influence the investment policies of such member bank or the advice it gives its customers regarding investments.'","The majority opinion distinguishes Agnew by emphasizing that the statute there applied a general rule to all persons with certain business interests, whereas § 504 targets a specific political group, making the two statutes meaningfully different."
107081,87778,Cummings v. Missouri (1867),Mentioned,"The approach which Chief Justice Marshall had suggested was followed in the twin post-Civil War cases of Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277 , and Ex parte Garland, 4 Wall. 333 . ... This Court struck down both provisions as bills of attainder on the ground that they were legislative acts inflicting punishment on a specific group: clergymen and lawyers who had taken part in the rebellion and therefore could not truthfully take the oath.","Cummings v. Missouri is cited as historical precedent supporting the broad reading of the Bill of Attainder Clause, but the Acting Decision does not alter, criticize, or limit its holding; it is used as background authority."
107081,104303,United States v. Lovett (1946),Mentioned,"The next extended discussion of the Bill of Attainder Clause 21 came in 1946, in United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303 , where the Court invalidated § 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, 1943, 57 Stat. 431 , 450, which prohibited payment of further salary to three named federal employees, 22 as a bill of attainder.","Lovett is cited as a supporting precedent for the majority's interpretation of the Bill of Attainder Clause, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes nor limits its holding; it is used to reinforce the majority's reasoning."
107081,94855,Hawker v. New York (1898),Mentioned,"The leading case is Hawker v. New York, 170 U. S. 189 , which upheld a provision prohibiting convicted felons from practicing medicine against a claim that, as applied to one convicted before its enactment, it was an ex post facto law.","Hawker is discussed as an example of a statute that was upheld against a constitutional challenge, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
107081,106534,Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez (1963),Mentioned,"Whether a punitive purpose would be inferred has depended in past cases on a number of circumstances, including the nature of the disability, whether it was traditionally regarded as punishment, whether it is rationally connected to a permissible legislative objective, as well as the specificity of the legisla *463 ture’s designation of the persons to be affected. See generally Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martines, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169.","Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez is cited for its analytical framework regarding punitive purpose, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its holding."

107464,94842,United States v. Wong Kim Ark (1898),Mentioned,"And this was the unequivocal statement of the Court in the case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649. ... The Court then held that Congress could not do anything to abridge or affect his citizenship conferred by the Fourteenth Amendment.","The Acting Decision references Wong Kim Ark as supporting authority for the proposition that Congress cannot abridge citizenship, but does not alter, criticize, or otherwise materially affect its precedential value."
107464,91470,Kurtz v. Moffitt (1885),Mentioned,"his general understanding of the statute was approved by this Court in Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U. S. 487, 501.","Kurtz v.

S. 163 .","Trop v. Dulles is cited as part of a string of cases that have cast doubt on Perez, but the Acting Decision does not overrule, criticize, or otherwise alter Trop's precedential value."
107464,98579,MacKenzie v. Hare (1915),Distinguished,"Moreover, the dictum must be read in light of the subsequent opinion for the Court, written by Mr. Justice McKenna, in Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U. S. 299. Despite counsel’s invocation of Wong Kim Ark, id., at 302 and 303, the Court held in Mackenzie that marriage between an American citizen and an alien, unaccompanied by any intention of the citizen to renounce her citizenship, nonetheless permitted Congress to ■withdraw her nationality. It is immaterial for these purposes that Mrs. Mackenzie’s citizenship might, under the statute there, have been restored upon termination of the marital relationship; she did not consent to the loss, even temporarily, of her citizenship, and, under the proposition apparently urged by the Court today, it can therefore scarcely matter that her expatriation was subject to some condition subsequent.","The Acting Decision discusses MacKenzie v. Hare as a case where citizenship was lost under different circumstances (marriage to an alien), and contrasts it with the present case, thereby distinguishing it on its facts and legal context."
107564,107483,Berger v. New York (1967),Distinguished,"For on that premise my Brother Stewart sets out methods in accord with the Fourth Amendment to guide States in the enactment and enforcement of laws passed to regulate wiretapping by government. In this respect today’s opinion differs sharply from Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41 , decided last Term, which held void on its face a New York statute authorizing wiretapping on warrants issued by magistrates on showings of probable cause. The Berger case also set up what appeared to be insuperable obstacles to the valid passage of such wiretapping laws by States. The Court’s opinion in this case, however, removes the doubts about state power in this field and abates to a large extent the confusion and near-paralyzing effect of the Berger holding.","The Acting Decision explicitly notes that its holding 'differs sharply' from Berger and clarifies or narrows the confusion caused by Berger, indicating that Berger is not overruled but is distinguished on its facts and effect."
107564,107465,"Warden, Maryland Penitentiary v. Hayden (1967)",Mentioned,"But '[t]he premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.' Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 304.","The Acting Decision cites Hayden for a general legal principle about property interests and the Fourth Amendment, without criticizing, limiting, or otherwise altering its authority."
107564,106187,Silverman v. United States (1961),Mentioned,"Indeed, we have expressly held that the Fourth Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements, overheard without any 'technical trespass under . . . local property law.' Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511.","Silverman is cited as supporting precedent for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment applies to certain forms of eavesdropping, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or overrule it."
107564,106622,Lopez v. United States (1963),Mentioned,"It is true that this Court has occasionally described its conclusions in terms of 'constitutionally protected areas,' see, e. g., Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 510, 512 ; Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 438-439 ; Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, 57, 59 , but we have never suggested that this concept can serve as a talismanic solution to every Fourth Amendment problem.","Lopez is referenced as an example of prior case law using certain terminology, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes nor limits its holding."
107564,106641,Ker v. California (1963),Mentioned,"In omitting any requirement of advance notice, the federal court that authorized electronic surveillance in Osborn simply recognized, as has this Court, that officers need not announce their purpose before conducting an otherwise authorized search if such an announcement would provoke the escape of the suspect or the destruction of critical evidence. See Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 37-41.","Ker is cited for a procedural point about notice in searches, with no criticism or limitation of its authority."

107564,103664,Goldman v. United States (1942),Overruled,"It is true that the absence of such penetration was at one time thought to foreclose further Fourth Amendment inquiry, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 457, 464, 466 ; Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129, 134-136 , for that Amendment was thought to limit only searches and seizures of tangible *353 property. 13 ... We conclude that the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the 'trespass' doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling.","The Acting Decision expressly states that the foundational doctrine of Goldman is no longer controlling, which amounts to an overruling of its core holding."

We conclude that the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the 'trespass' doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the doctrine of Olmstead is no longer controlling, thereby overruling its central holding regarding the Fourth Amendment and wiretapping."

Maryland, to the extent that it sanctioned such warrantless inspections, must be overruled, we reverse.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Frank v.

Dow,Limited,Maxwell held that no provision of the Bill of Rights applied to the States— a position long since repudiated — and that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not prevent a State from trying a defendant for a noncapital offense with fewer than 12 men on the jury. It did not deal with a case in which no jury at all had been provided.,"The Acting Decision limits Maxwell v. Dow by noting that its holding is confined to cases with fewer than 12 jurors and that its broader position on the Bill of Rights has been repudiated, thus narrowing its applicability."

S. 503 (1963), whose persistent request during his interrogation was to phone his wife or attorney. 25 In other settings, these individuals might have exercised their constitutional rights. In the incommunicado police-dominated atmosphere, they succumbed.","The Acting Decision references Haynes v. Washington as an example of a prior case where a confession was found inadmissible due to coercive circumstances, but does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its precedential value. It is used to illustrate the Court's reasoning."
107252,94782,Bram v. United States,Mentioned,"This question, in fact, could have been taken as settled in federal courts almost 70 years ago, when, in Bram v. United States, 168 U.

107252,106862,Malloy v. Hogan,Mentioned,"Our decision in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964), necessitates an examination of the scope of the privilege in state cases as well. In Malloy, we squarely held the privilege applicable to the States, and held that the substantive standards underlying the privilege applied with full force to state court proceedings.",Malloy v.

Illinois is referenced as an illustrative case supporting the Acting Decision's reasoning, without criticism or limitation."
107252,100471,Ziang Sung Wan v. United States,Mentioned,"In 1924, Mr. Justice Brandéis wrote for a unanimous Court in reversing a conviction resting on a compelled confession, Wan v.

107252,104108,Malinski v. New York,Mentioned,"For example, in Leyra v. Denno, 347 U. S. 556 (1954), the interrogator-psychiatrist told the accused, 'We do sometimes things that are not right, but in a fit of temper or anger we sometimes do things we aren’t really responsible for,' id., at 562, and again, 'We know that morally you were just in anger. Morally, you are not to be condemned,' id., at 582. ... A variant on the technique of creating hostility is one of engendering fear. This is perhaps best described by the prosecuting attorney in Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401, 407 (1945): 'Why this talk about being undressed? Of course, they had a right to undress him to look for bullet scars, and keep the clothes off him. That was quite proper police procedure. That is some more psychology — let him sit around with a blanket on him, humiliate him there for a while; let him sit in the corner, let him think he is going to get a shellacking.'","Malinski v. New York is referenced as an example of police interrogation techniques, but the Acting Decision does not criticize or limit its authority."
107252,91057,Hopt v. People of Territory of Utah,Mentioned,"The admissibility of a statement in the face of a claim that it was obtained in violation of the defendant’s constitutional rights is an issue the resolution of which has long since been undertaken by this Court.

107746,105055,Schwartz v. Texas,Overruled,"In view of the Nardone and Benanti decisions, 8 the doctrine of Schwartz v. Texas cannot survive the demise of Wolf v. Colorado, supra.","The lead opinion explicitly states that the doctrine of Schwartz v. Texas 'cannot survive,' indicating that the Court is expressly overruling Schwartz as a precedent."
107746,104709,Wolf v. Colorado,Overruled,"That doctrinal underpinning of the Schwartz decision was, of course, completely removed by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , which overruled Wolf and squarely held that evidence obtained by state officers in an unreasonable search is inadmissible in a state criminal trial.","The opinion directly states that Wolf v. Colorado was overruled by Mapp v. Ohio, and this overruling is central to the Court's reasoning in the present case."
107746,102883,Nardone v. United States,Mentioned,"In Nardone v. United States, 302 U. S. 379 , the Court was first called upon to decide whether § 605 had indeed served to render evidence of intercepted communications inadmissible in a federal trial.","The opinion discusses Nardone as foundational precedent for interpreting § 605, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority; it is cited as supporting the current decision."
107746,98094,Weeks v. United States,Mentioned,"Indeed, evidence obtained by a state officer by means which would constitute an unlawful search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution is nonetheless admissible in a state court, Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 , while such evidence, if obtained by a federal officer, would be clearly inadmissible in a federal court. Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383.","Weeks is referenced as background for the exclusionary rule in federal courts, but the Acting Decision does not alter or question its authority."
107746,106107,Elkins v. United States,Mentioned,"But the decision we reach today is not based upon language and doctrinal symmetry alone. It is buttressed as well by the 'imperative of judicial integrity.' Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 222.","Elkins is cited for the principle of judicial integrity and as part of the doctrinal development, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
107343,104974,Adler v. Board of Ed. of City of New York (1952),Overruled,"Moreover, to the extent that Adler sustained the provision of the Feinberg Law constituting membership in an organization advocating forceful overthrow of government a ground for disqualification, pertinent constitutional doctrines have since rejected the premises upon which that conclusion rested. Adler is therefore not dispositive of the constitutional issues we must decide in this case.","The lead opinion explicitly states that Adler is no longer dispositive and that its premises have been rejected by subsequent constitutional doctrine. The Court then proceeds to hold the relevant statutes unconstitutional, thereby overruling Adler to the extent it upheld those statutes."
107343,106837,Baggett v. Bullitt (1964),Mentioned,"We cannot gainsay the potential effect of this obscure wording on 'those with a conscientious and scrupulous regard for such undertakings.' Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U. S. 360, 374.","Baggett is cited as an example of the chilling effect of vague statutes, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its precedential value; it simply applies its reasoning."
107343,107210,Elfbrandt v. Russell (1966),Mentioned,"In Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11, we said, 'Those who join an organization but do not share its unlawful purposes and who do not participate in its unlawful activities surely pose no threat, either as citizens or as public employees.' Id., at 17.",Elfbrandt is quoted as controlling precedent for the proposition that mere membership without specific intent is not a constitutionally adequate basis for exclusion from employment. The Acting Decision applies Elfbrandt without questioning or limiting it.
107343,106514,National Ass'n for the Advancement of Colored People v. Button (1963),Mentioned,"We emphasize once again that '[precision of regulation must be the touchstone in an area so closely touching our most precious freedoms,' N. A. A. C. P. v. Button, 371 U. S. 415, 438; '[f]or standards of permissible statutory vagueness are strict in the area of free expression.... Because First Amendment freedoms need breathing space to survive, government may regulate in the area only with narrow specificity.' Id., at 432-433.",Button is cited as authority for the standard of precision required in statutes affecting First Amendment freedoms. The Acting Decision relies on Button's reasoning without criticizing or limiting it.
107343,105751,Speiser v. Randall (1958),Mentioned,"For '¿tjhe threat of sanctions may deter . . . almost as potently as the actual application of sanctions.' N. A. A. C. P. v. Button, supra, at 433. The danger of that chilling effect upon the exercise of vital First Amendment rights must be guarded against by sensitive tools which clearly inform teachers what is being proscribed. See Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359, 369; Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, 368 U. S. 278; Baggett v. Bullitt, supra. The regulatory maze created by New York is wholly lacking in 'terms susceptible of objective measurement.' Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, supra, at 286.

'[M]en of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application . . . .' Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 367.",Speiser is cited as part of a string of cases illustrating the chilling effect of vague statutes on First Amendment rights. The Acting Decision applies its reasoning without criticism or limitation.
107343,106142,Shelton v. Tucker (1960),Mentioned,"But 'even though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose cannot be pursued by means thatbroadly' stiHe fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.' Shelton v. Tucker, 364 U. S. 479, 488.",Shelton is cited as authority for the principle that laws affecting fundamental liberties must be narrowly tailored. The Acting Decision relies on Shelton's reasoning without criticizing or limiting it.
107343,105537,Yates v. United States (1957),Mentioned,"This is not a case where abstention pending state court interpretation would be appropriate, Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 375-379; Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 489-490. Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183, 195 (Frankfurter, J., concurring). Whether or not loss of public employment constitutes 'punishment,' cf. United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, there can be no doubt that the repressive impact of the threat of discharge will be no less direct or substantial. See Lazarsfeld & Thielens, The Academic Mind 92-112, 192-217; Biddle, The Fear of Freedom 155 et seq.; Jahoda & Cook, *608 Security Measures and Freedom of Thought: An Exploratory Study of the Impact of Loyalty and Security Programs, 61 Yale L.

Prob. 487 (1963). In light of our disposition, we need not consider appellants’ contention that the burden placed on the employee of coming forward with substantial rebutting evidence upon proof of membership in a listed organization is constitutionally impermissible. Compare Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513. Now section 105. Now section 105.",Yates is cited as part of a string of cases supporting the proposition that mere advocacy of abstract doctrine is not sufficient for criminal sanction. The Acting Decision applies Yates' reasoning without criticizing or limiting it.
107343,106311,Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction of Orange Cty. (1961),Mentioned,"The regulatory maze created by New York is wholly lacking in 'terms susceptible of objective measurement.' Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, supra, at 286. It has the quality of 'extraordinary ambiguity' found to be fatal to the oaths considered in Cramp and Baggett v. Bullitt. '[M]en of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application . . . .' Baggett v.

Each of the three principal elements of the doctrine, as it is described in Shapiro, is absent from this situation.","The Acting Decision explains that the facts and legal context of Shapiro are materially different from those in Marchetti, and explicitly states that Shapiro does not apply, thus distinguishing it."
107606,105090,United States v. Kahriger,Overruled,We conclude that nothing in the Court’s opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner’s assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.,The Acting Decision expressly states that Kahriger is overruled to the extent it previously prevented assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege in this context.
107606,101083,United States v. Sullivan,Distinguished,"The Court in Sullivan was evidently concerned, first, that the claim before it was an unwarranted extension of the scope of the privilege, and, second, that to accept a claim of privilege not asserted at the time the return was due would 'make the taxpayer rather than a tribunal the final arbiter of the merits of the claim.' ... The first is, as we have indicated, inapplicable, and we find the second unpersuasive in this situation.","The Acting Decision analyzes Sullivan and finds its reasoning inapplicable to the facts at hand, thus distinguishing it."

We conclude that nothing in the Court’s opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner’s assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Lewis to the extent it previously denied the Fifth Amendment privilege in this context.
107606,107110,Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board,Mentioned,"Every aspect of petitioner’s wagering activities thus subjected him to possible state or federal prosecution. By any standard, in Connecticut and throughout the United States, wagering is 'an area permeated with criminal statutes,' and those engaged in wagering are a group 'inherently suspect of criminal activities.'

S. 70, 79.","Albertson is cited for a general principle about groups 'inherently suspect of criminal activities,' but is not analyzed or applied to the facts, so it is merely mentioned."

Waterfront Commission, 378 U. S. 52. ... Nonetheless, we think that it would be entirely inappropriate in the circumstances here for the Court to impose such restrictions.","The Acting Decision discusses Murphy and explains why its approach is not appropriate in the present case, thus distinguishing it."

S. 145, 149 (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.","Duncan v.

Palko represented an approach to basic constitutional rights which this Court’s recent decisions have rejected.",The Acting Decision expressly states that Palko v. Connecticut is overruled to the extent it is inconsistent with the new holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to the States.
107980,94515,United States v. Ball,Mentioned,"In any case, this argument was answered here over 70 years ago in United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896). ... The Court refused to allow the Government to allege its own error to deprive the defendant of the benefit of an acquittal by a jury. Id., at 667-668.","United States v. Ball is cited as precedent supporting the Acting Decision's reasoning, but its holding is not questioned, criticized, or otherwise altered."
107980,107730,Sibron v. New York,Mentioned,"In Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 (1968), we held that a criminal case did not become moot upon the expiration of the sentence imposed. We noted 'the obvious fact of life that most criminal convictions do in fact entail adverse collateral legal consequences.' Id., at 55.","Sibron v. New York is cited as authority for the proposition that collateral consequences prevent mootness, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its holding."

S. 1, 10-11 (1964), 12 Only last Term we found that the right to trial by jury in criminal cases was 'fundamental to the American scheme of justice,' Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145, 149 (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. 13 For the same reasons, we today find that the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment represents a fundamental ideal in our constitutional heritage, and that it should apply to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.","Malloy v. Hogan is cited as part of the Court's trend toward incorporating Bill of Rights protections against the States, but its reasoning or holding is not criticized, limited, or otherwise altered."
107679,102317,McNally v. Hill (1934),Overruled,"Keeping these purposes of the writ in mind, we turn to consideration of the McNally holding and the reasons which compel us to overrule it. ... We overrule McNally and hold that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is 'in custody' under any one of them for purposes of § 2241 (c)(3).","The Acting Decision explicitly states that it is overruling McNally v. Hill, both in reasoning and in holding, thereby expressly nullifying its precedential value."
107679,106507,Jones v. Cunningham (1963),Mentioned,"What we said of the writ in a similar context in Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963), is equally applicable here. '[The writ] is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose — the protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty.'

Cunningham is cited for its general statement about the evolving scope of habeas corpus, and the Acting Decision applies its reasoning but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
107679,100122,Moore v. Dempsey (1923),Mentioned,"To that extent, it also undermines Moore v. Dempsey, supra, and is inconsistent with subsequent decisions of this Court which have reaffirmed Moore.

Noia, 372 U. S., at 415-420 ; Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241 (1886), and the exigencies of appellate review account for largely unavoidable delays in the processing of criminal cases.","Fay v.

107919,106850,Reynolds v. Sims (1964),Mentioned,"""Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 , held that a State in an apportionment of state representatives and senators among districts and counties could not deprive voters in *818 the more populous counties of their proportionate share of representatives and senators. 'The right to vote freely for the candidate of one’s choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government. And the right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizen’s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.' 377 U. S., at 555.""","Reynolds v. Sims is cited for its general principles regarding equal protection and voting rights, but the Acting Decision does not alter, criticize, or distinguish its holding; it simply applies its reasoning."

Green is overruled. 7 Reversed.""","The Acting Decision expressly states that MacDougall v. Green is 'overruled,' directly nullifying its precedential value."
107919,107449,Dusch v. Davis (1967),Distinguished,"""Dusch v. Davis, 387 U. S. 112 , is not relevant to the problem of this case. There each councilman was required to be a resident of the borough from which he was elected. Like the residence requirement for state senators from a multi-district county (Fortson v. Dorsey, 379 U. S. 433 ), the place of residence did not mark the voting unit; for in Dusch all the electors in the city voted for each councilman.""","The Acting Decision explains why Dusch v. Davis does not apply to the present facts, distinguishing it based on the differences in the electoral systems at issue."
107919,104311,Colegrove v. Green (1946),Questioned,"""While the majority cited Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549 , as their authority for denying relief and while a few who took part in Colegrove put this type of question in the 'political' as distinguished from the 'justiciable' category, 328 U. S., at 552 , that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 202 .""",The Acting Decision questions the continuing validity of Colegrove v. Green by noting that its justiciability holding has been superseded by Baker v. Carr.
107919,106366,Baker v. Carr (1962),Mentioned,"""that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 202 . When a State makes classifications of voters which favor residents of some counties over residents of other counties, a justiciable controversy is presented. 369 U. S., at 198-204 .""","Baker v. Carr is cited as establishing the justiciability of equal protection claims in voting cases, but the Acting Decision does not alter or criticize its holding."
107965,104914,Dennis v. United States,Criticized,"But Whitney has been thoroughly discredited by later decisions. See Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, at 507 (1951). These later decisions have fashioned the principle that the constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a State to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.","The Acting Decision references Dennis as part of a line of cases that have moved away from the reasoning in Whitney, but also criticizes Dennis for distorting the 'clear and present danger' test. The concurrence is even more explicit in its criticism, stating, 'But in Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, we opened wide the door, distorting the “clear and present danger” test beyond recognition.' Thus, Dennis is criticized but not overruled."
107965,102821,Herndon v. Lowry,Mentioned,"As we *448 said in Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 297-298 (1961), 'the mere abstract teaching ... of the moral propriety or even moral necessity for a resort to force and violence, is not the same as preparing a group for violent action and steeling it to such action.'

Lowry is cited as supporting authority for the distinction between abstract advocacy and incitement, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise limit it. It is simply mentioned as precedent consistent with the new rule."
107965,105537,Yates v. United States,Mentioned,"Cf. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298 (1957); De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353 (1937); Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359 (1931).",Yates is cited as part of a string of cases supporting the principle that mere advocacy is protected unless it incites imminent lawless action. There is no criticism or limitation; it is mentioned as consistent authority.
107965,99321,Frohwerk v. United States,Mentioned,"Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U. S. 204 , also authored by Mr. Justice Holmes, involved prosecution and punishment for publication of articles very critical of the war effort in World War I. Schenck was referred to as a conviction for obstructing security 'by words of persuasion.' Id., at 206. And the conviction in Frohwerk was sustained because 'the circulation of the paper was *451 in quarters where a little breath would be enough to kindle a flame.' Id., at 209.","Frohwerk is discussed in the concurrence as part of the historical development of the 'clear and present danger' test, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or limit it. It is mentioned for historical context."
107965,99322,Debs v. United States,Mentioned,"Debs v. United States, 249 U. S. 211 , was the third of the trilogy of the 1918 Term. Debs was convicted of speaking in opposition to the war where his 'opposition was so expressed that its natural and intended effect would be to obstruct recruiting.' Id., at 215.","Debs is mentioned in the concurrence as part of the historical background of First Amendment jurisprudence. There is no indication that the Acting Decision criticizes, overrules, or limits Debs."
107965,101097,Whitney v. California,Overruled,"The contrary teaching of Whitney v. California, supra, cannot be supported, and that decision is therefore overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Whitney v. California is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value."
107979,104769,United States v. Rabinowitz,Overruled,"It is time, for the reasons we have stated, to hold that on their own facts, and insofar as the principles they stand for are inconsistent with those that we have endorsed today, they are no longer to be followed.","The lead opinion expressly states that Rabinowitz is no longer to be followed, overruling it both on its facts and as a precedent inconsistent with the new rule announced in Chimel."
107979,106641,Ker v. California,Mentioned,"Decisions of this Court since Rabinowitz have applied the abstract doctrine of that case to various factual situations with divergent results. Compare Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 42 ...","Ker v. California is referenced as an example of a case applying the Rabinowitz doctrine, but there is no discussion of its reasoning or validity; it is simply mentioned in passing."

United States, 353 U. S. 346 (per curiam).","Abel v. United States is listed among other cases for comparative purposes, without any analysis or criticism of its holding or reasoning."
107979,98094,Weeks v. United States,Mentioned,"Approval of a warrantless search incident to a lawful arrest seems first to have been articulated by the Court in 1914 as dictum in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 , in which the Court stated: ...","Weeks is discussed as historical background for the development of the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine, but its reasoning is neither criticized nor overruled."
107979,104576,Trupiano v. United States,Mentioned,"Only a year after Harris , however, the pendulum swung again. In Trupiano v. United States, 334 U. S. 699 , ... The opinion stated: 'It is a cardinal rule that, in seizing goods and articles, law enforcement agents must secure and use search warrants wherever reasonably practicable.'","Trupiano is described as part of the historical development of the doctrine, but the Acting Decision does not criticize or overrule it; it is used to illustrate the shifting standards."
107979,101164,Marron v. United States,Limited,"That the Marron opinion did not mean all that it seemed to say became evident, however, a few years later in Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, 282 U. S. 344 , and United States v. Lefkowitz, 285 U. S. 452 . ... This limited characterization of Marron was reiterated in Lefkowitz ...","The Acting Decision explicitly notes that Marron's broad language was later limited by subsequent cases, and it adopts this narrower interpretation, thus limiting Marron's scope."
107979,101643,Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States,Mentioned,"This limited characterization of Marron was reiterated in Lefkowitz , a case in which the Court held unlawful a search of desk drawers and a cabinet despite the fact that the search had accompanied a lawful arrest.","Go-Bart is referenced as part of the historical narrative and as a limiting case on Marron, but the Acting Decision does not criticize or overrule it."
107979,107729,Terry v. Ohio,Mentioned,"Only last Term in Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1 , we emphasized that 'the police must, whenever practicable, obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure,' id., at 20 , ...","Terry is cited to support the general principle of warrant preference, but its reasoning is not criticized or distinguished; it is used as supporting authority."
107979,100567,Carroll v. United States,Mentioned,"Eleven years later the case of Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132 , brought the following embellishment of the Weeks statement: ...","Carroll is referenced as part of the historical development of the doctrine, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or overrule it."
107979,104422,Harris v. United States,Overruled,"It is time, for the reasons we have stated, to hold that on their own facts, and insofar as the principles they stand for are inconsistent with those that we have endorsed today, they are no longer to be followed.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Harris, like Rabinowitz, is no longer to be followed, thereby overruling it."
107748,90897,Civil Rights Cases,Distinguished,"As its text reveals, the Thirteenth Amendment 'is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.' Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 20. It has never been doubted, therefore, 'that the power vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate legislation,' ibid., includes the power to enact laws 'direct and primary, operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State legislation or not.' Id., at 23.","The Acting Decision cites the Civil Rights Cases for general principles about the Thirteenth Amendment and congressional power, but distinguishes its holding by emphasizing that the present case involves a different statute and context. The Court uses the Civil Rights Cases to support its reasoning but does not treat it as controlling or limiting precedent."
107748,104546,Hurd v. Hodge,Distinguished,"This Court last had occasion to consider the scope of 42 U. S. C. § 1982 in 1948, in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24 . ... It is true that a dictum in Hurd said that § 1982 was directed only toward 'governmental action,' 334 U. S., at 31 , but neither Hurd nor any other case *420 before or since has presented that precise issue for adjudication in this Court. 25 Today we face that issue for the first time.",The Acting Decision acknowledges Hurd v. Hodge as precedent but distinguishes it by noting that Hurd did not address the precise issue now before the Court—whether § 1982 applies to purely private discrimination. The Court explicitly states that it is deciding this issue for the first time.
107748,1447641,Hodges v. United States,Overruled,"The conclusion of the majority in Hodges rested upon a concept of congressional power under the Thirteenth Amendment irrecon *443 cilable with the position taken by every member of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases and incompatible with the history and purpose of the Amendment itself. Insofar as Hodges is inconsistent with our holding today, it is hereby overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly overrules Hodges v. United States to the extent it is inconsistent with the present holding, thereby nullifying its precedential value on the relevant point."
107748,100887,Corrigan v. Buckley,Distinguished,"It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31 , characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , as having 'held' that '[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute . . . [are] directed is governmental action.' 334 U. S., at 31. But no such statement appears in the Corrigan opinion, and a careful examination of Corrigan reveals that it cannot be read as authority for the proposition attributed to it in Hurd.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Corrigan v. Buckley, clarifying that Corrigan did not decide the issue at hand and cannot be read as authority for limiting § 1982 to governmental action. The Court thus limits Corrigan's relevance to the present case."
107748,90040,Virginia v. Rives,Distinguished,"Two of this Court’s early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action. Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 ... But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra, actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Virginia v. Rives, explaining that its holding was limited to a different statutory provision and did not decide the issue of whether § 1982 applies to private action. The Court clarifies the limited scope of Rives and declines to treat it as controlling."
107973,1178568,"Adkins v. Lear, Inc. (1967)",Reversed,The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.,"The Acting Decision vacates and remands the judgment of the California Supreme Court in Adkins v. Lear, Inc., thereby reversing its holding regarding licensee estoppel and the enforceability of the royalty contract."

S. 342 (1924), framed a rule to govern the recurring problem which arises when the original patent owner, after assigning his patent to another for a substantial sum, claims that the patent is worthless because it contains no new ideas. ... Nevertheless, Formica imposed a limitation upon estoppel which was radically inconsistent with the premises upon which the 'general rule' is based.","The Acting Decision discusses Formica as a limitation on the estoppel doctrine and acknowledges its narrowing effect, but does not overrule or criticize it; rather, it recognizes its limited scope."

S. 249 (1945), this Court adopted a position similar to the Seventh Circuit’s, undermining the basis of patent estoppel even more than Formica had done.","The Acting Decision references Scott Paper as part of the historical development of the law but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its authority."
107973,103320,McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique (1940),Mentioned,"In McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430 (1940), the Court, while recognizing it had jurisdiction to determine whether a New York tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, refused to consider whether the tax was a prohibited impost or duty on imports and exports, saying: '[I]t is only in exceptional cases, and then only in cases coming from the federal courts, that [the Court] considers questions urged by a petitioner or appellant not pressed or passed upon in the courts below. ...'","The Acting Decision cites McGoldrick for a procedural principle regarding Supreme Court review, not for its substantive holding."
107973,104256,Wilson v. Cook (1946),Mentioned,"Wilson v. Cook, 327 U. S. 474 (1946), reached a similar conclusion. There the Court denied a government contractor the benefit of the implied constitutional immunity of the Federal Government from taxation by the State, but at the same time declined to consider whether the state tax at issue placed a forbidden tax directly on the United States.","The Acting Decision references Wilson v. Cook for its approach to issues not raised or decided below, not for its substantive law."
107973,106930,Brulotte v. Thys Co. (1964),Mentioned,"Such a distinction may be valid, and pre-1960 royalties recoverable; but if so, what of post-1960 royalties which are attributable to the headstart Lear obtained over the rest of the industry as a result of pre-issuance disclosure of Adkins’ idea? Today’s bar to collection of post-1960 royalties would seem to be inflexible, and yet those royalties arguably are recoverable to the extent they represent payment for the pre-1960 disclosure of Adkins’ idea; to that extent, they seem indistinguishable from pre-1960 royalties, at least for purposes of federal patent law. Cf. Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U. S. 29, 31 (1964).","Brulotte is cited in a concurring opinion as a comparative reference, but the Acting Decision does not analyze, criticize, or otherwise alter its holding."
108154,106432,Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson (1962),Overruled,"Having concluded that Sinclair was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity, we overrule that decision and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.","The lead opinion explicitly states that Sinclair was 'erroneously decided' and is 'overruled,' making this a clear instance of the Acting Decision expressly nullifying the precedential value of the cited decision."
108154,105511,Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala. (1957),Mentioned,"Lincoln Mills held generally that 'the substantive law to apply in suits under § 301 (a) is federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws,' 353 U. S., at 456, and more specifically that a union can obtain specific performance of an employer’s promise to arbitrate grievances.","The Acting Decision references Lincoln Mills to explain the development of federal labor law and arbitration policy, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its holding; it is used as background and support."
108154,107655,"Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, International Ass'n of MacHinists & Aerospace Workers (1968)",Distinguished,"Furthermore, in light of developments subsequent to Sinclair, in particular our decision in Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge 735, 390 U. S. 557 (1968), it has become clear that the Sinclair decision does not further but rather frustrates realization of an important goal of our national labor policy. Nor can we agree that conclusive weight should be accorded to the failure of Congress to respond to Sinclair on the theory that congressional silence should be interpreted as acceptance of the decision.","The Acting Decision discusses Avco as a development that, when combined with Sinclair, creates an 'anomalous situation,' but does not overrule, criticize, or question Avco; instead, it distinguishes the effects and implications of Avco from those of Sinclair."
108154,103292,Helvering v. Hallock (1940),Mentioned,"We fully recognize that important policy considerations militate in favor of continuity and predictability in the law. Nevertheless, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote for the Court, '[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.' Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).",Helvering v. Hallock is cited for a general principle about stare decisis and not for its holding or reasoning on the merits; it is used illustratively and not substantively discussed.
108164,105594,Green v. United States (1957),Mentioned,"Similar double jeopardy issues did not fully claim the Court’s attention until the Court heard argument in Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957). ... The rationale of the Green holding applies here.","The Acting Decision discusses and applies the reasoning of Green v. United States as controlling precedent, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority. It is cited as the basis for the Court's holding."
108164,1276937,Price v. State (1968),Reversed,"The Georgia Court of Appeals then heard the appeal and affirmed the second conviction, rejecting petitioner’s argument, among others, that his retrial for murder constituted double jeopardy. ... We granted the writ, 395 U. S. 975 (1969), and now reverse.",The Acting Decision directly overturns the outcome of Price v. State (1968) by reversing the conviction affirmed in that decision.
108164,5726506,Brantley v. Georgia (1910),Overruled,"While the Brantley holding may have had some vitality at the time the Georgia courts rendered their decisions in this case, it is no longer a viable authority and must now be deemed to have been overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court.",The Acting Decision expressly states that Brantley is no longer viable and has been overruled by subsequent Supreme Court decisions.
108164,94515,United States v. Ball (1896),Mentioned,"In United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662, 669 (1896), this Court observed: ... The 'twice put in jeopardy' language of the Constitution thus relates to a potential, i. e., the risk that an accused for a second time will be convicted of the 'same offense' for which he was initially tried.","The Acting Decision references Ball for foundational principles regarding double jeopardy, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
108164,1395638,Price v. State (1968),Mentioned,"Petitioner sought direct review of his second conviction in the Supreme Court of Georgia, 1 but that court transferred the case to the Court of Appeals of Georgia, declaring that '[o]nly questions as to the application of plain and unambiguous provisions of the Constitution of the United States being involved, . . the case is one for the consideration of the Court of Appeals . . .

108114,105687,Hoag v. New Jersey (1958),Overruled,"As the District Court and the Court of Appeals correctly noted, the operative facts here are virtually identical to those of Hoag v. New Jersey, supra. ... The doctrine of Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, puts the issues in the present case in a perspective quite different from that in which the issues were perceived in Hoag v. New Jersey, supra. ... We do not hesitate to hold that it [collateral estoppel] is [embodied in the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy].","The Acting Decision expressly rejects the reasoning and holding of Hoag v. New Jersey by applying a new constitutional rule (collateral estoppel as part of double jeopardy) to facts virtually identical to Hoag, thus overruling Hoag's contrary result and rationale."
108114,105860,Abbate v. United States (1959),Mentioned,"Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 196-201 (1959) (separate opinion). My conclusion is not precluded by the Courts decision in Hoag v. New Jersey, 356 U. S. 464 (1958), although the basic fact situation there was identical to that in this case.","Abbate v. United States is cited in a parenthetical as a reference to a separate opinion and for historical context, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes, distinguishes, nor overrules it, nor does it engage in substantive discussion of its holding."
108114,107978,North Carolina v. Pearce (1969),Mentioned,"There can be no doubt of the 'retroactivity' of the Court’s decision in Benton v. Maryland. In North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, decided the same day as Benton, the Court unanimously accorded fully 'retroactive' effect to the Benton doctrine.","North Carolina v. Pearce is cited solely for its holding on the retroactivity of Benton v. Maryland, without any criticism, limitation, or substantive engagement with its reasoning."
108114,107980,Benton v. Maryland (1969),Mentioned,"In Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, the Court held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee against double jeopardy is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.","Benton v. Maryland is cited as controlling precedent and foundational to the Acting Decision’s analysis, but its reasoning is not questioned, criticized, or limited; it is treated as authoritative and applied."
108114,105594,Green v. United States (1957),Mentioned,"For whatever else that constitutional guarantee may embrace, North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717, it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to 'run the gantlet' a second time. Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 190.","Green v. United States is quoted for a phrase and cited as support for the general principle of double jeopardy, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
108350,103548,Reitz v. Mealey (1941),Overruled,"We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of Kesler and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than one of frustration. ... Thus, we conclude that Kesler and Reitz can have no authoritative effect to the extent they are inconsistent with the controlling principle that any state legislation which frustrates the full effectiveness of federal law is rendered invalid by the Supremacy Clause.","The lead opinion expressly states that the Court can no longer adhere to the doctrine of Reitz and removes its authoritative effect, thereby overruling it to the extent of its inconsistency with the Supremacy Clause analysis adopted in Perez."

Killingsworth, 93 Ariz. 273, 380 P. 2d 136 (1963), the Supreme Court of Arizona held that '[t]he Financial Responsibility Act has for its principal purpose the protection of the public using the highways from financial hardship which may result from the use of automobiles by financially irresponsible persons.' 93 Ariz., at 280, 380 P. 2d, at 140.","The Acting Decision references Schecter v.

108350,100616,Lewis v. Roberts (1925),Mentioned,"There can be no doubt, given Lewis v. Roberts, 267 U. S. 467 (1925), that Congress intended this 'new opportunity' to include freedom from most kinds of pre-existing tort judgments.","Lewis v. Roberts is cited as supporting authority for the interpretation of the Bankruptcy Act, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes nor alters its precedential value."
108730,104590,Ahrens v. Clark,Overruled,"In view of these developments since Ahrens v. Clark , we can no longer view that decision as establishing an *500 inflexible jurisdictional rule, dictating the choice of an inconvenient forum even in a class of cases which could not have been foreseen at the time of our decision.","The lead opinion explicitly states that the Court can no longer follow Ahrens as an inflexible jurisdictional rule, and the dissent directly accuses the majority of overruling Ahrens. The majority's reasoning and holding effectively overrule the prior precedent."
108730,107824,Smith v. Hooey,Mentioned,"In Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969), we considered a speedy trial claim similar to the one presented in the ease before us, and we held that a State which had lodged a detainer against a petitioner in another State must, on the prisoner’s demand, “make a diligent, good-faith effort” to bring the prisoner to trial. Id,., at 383. But that ease arose on direct review of the denial of relief by the state court, and we had no occasion to consider whether the same or similar claims could have been raised on federal habeas corpus.","Smith v. Hooey is referenced as precedent for the speedy trial right, but the Acting Decision does not alter, criticize, or limit its holding; it simply uses it as background for the present case."
108730,107679,Peyton v. Rowe,Mentioned,"Yet it logically follows from Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), that the claims can be raised on collateral attack. In this context, as opposed to the situation presented in Peyton , the “future custody” under attack will not be imposed by the same sovereign which holds the petitioner in his current confinement. Nevertheless, the considerations which were held in Peyton to warrant a prompt resolution of the claim also apply with full force in this context.","The Acting Decision relies on Peyton v. Rowe to support its reasoning but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its holding. It extends Peyton's logic to a new context, but this is an application, not a limitation or criticism."
108730,91598,Ex Parte Royall,Distinguished,"It is also true, as our Brother Rehnquist points out in dissent, that federal habeas corpus does not lie, absent “special circumstances,” to adjudicate the merits of an affirmative defense to a state criminal charge prior to a judgment of conviction by a state court. Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 253 (1886). Petitioner does not, however, seek at this time to litigate a federal defense to a criminal charge, but only *490 to demand enforcement of the Commonwealth’s affirmative constitutional obligation to bring him promptly to trial.","The Acting Decision acknowledges the general rule from Ex Parte Royall but distinguishes the present case on its facts and purpose, explaining why Royall does not bar relief here."
108730,108193,Nelson v. George,Mentioned,"Nor does petitioner challenge the “present effect being given the [Kentucky] detainer by the [Alabama] authorities . . . .” Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224, 225 (1970).","Nelson v. George is cited as a factual reference and for a procedural point, but the Acting Decision does not analyze, criticize, or otherwise alter its holding."
108362,90728,United States v. Harris,Limited,"The constitutionality of § 1985 (3) might once have appeared to have been settled adversely by United States v. Harris, 106 U. S. 629 , and Baldwin v. Franks, 120 U. S. 678 , which held unconstitutional its criminal counterpart, then § 5519 of the Revised Statutes. 11 The Court in those cases, however, followed a severability rule that required invalidation of an entire statute if any part of it was unconstitutionally overbroad, unless its different parts could be read as wholly independent provisions. E. g., Baldwin v. Franks, supra, at 685 . This Court has long since firmly rejected that rule in such cases as United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 20-24 . Consequently, we need not find the language of § 1985 (3) now before us Constitutional in all its possible applications in order to uphold its facial constitutionality and its application to the complaint in this case.","The Acting Decision acknowledges Harris but limits its precedential value by explaining that the severability rule it relied on has since been rejected, and thus Harris does not control the outcome regarding the constitutionality of § 1985(3) as applied here."
108362,107201,United States v. Guest,Mentioned,"Our cases have firmly established that the right of interstate travel is constitutionally protected, does not necessarily rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, and is assertable against private as well as governmental interference.

108362,107748,Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.,Mentioned,"It has long been settled that 18 U. S. C. § 241 , a criminal statute of far broader phrasing (see n. 4, supra), reaches wholly private conspiracies and is constitutional. E. g., In re Quarles, 158 U. S. 532 ; Logan v. United States, 144 U. S. 263, 293-295 ; United States v. Waddell, 112 U. S. 76, 77-81 ; Ex parte Yarbrough, 110 U. S. 651 . See generally Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, 97-98 . Our inquiry, therefore, need go only to identifying a source of congressional power to reach the private conspiracy alleged by the complaint, in this case. . A Even as it struck down Rev. Stat. §5519 in United States v. Harris , the Court indicated that parts of its coverage would, if severable, be constitutional under the *105 Thirteenth Amendment. 106 U. S., at 640-641 . And surely there has never been any doubt of the power of Congress to impose liability on private persons under § 2 of that amendment, “for the amendment is not a mere prohibition of State laws .establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.” Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3, 20 . See also id., at 23 ; Clyatt V. United States, 197 U. S. 207, 216, 218 ; Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U. S., at 437-440 . Not only may Congress impose such liability, but the varieties of private conduct that it may make criminally punishable or civilly remediable extend far beyond the actual imposition of slavery or involuntary servitude. By the Thirteenth Amendment, we committed ourselves as a Nation to the proposition that the former slaves and their descendants should be forever free. To keep that promise, “Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.” Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., supra, at 440.","Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. is cited as supporting authority for Congress's power under the Thirteenth Amendment, but the Acting Decision does not alter, criticize, or limit its holding."
108362,96885,Twining v. New Jersey,Mentioned,"Our cases have firmly established that the right of interstate travel is constitutionally protected, does not necessarily rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, and is assertable against private as well as governmental interference. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618, 629-631 ; id., at 642-644 (concurring opinion); United States *106 v. Guest, 383 U. S. 745 , 757-760 and n. 17; Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.

The “right to pass freely from State to State” has been explicitly recognized as “among the rights and privileges of National citizenship.” Twining v. New Jersey, supra, at 97 .","Twining v. New Jersey is cited as supporting authority for the right of interstate travel as a privilege of national citizenship, but the Acting Decision does not otherwise discuss or alter its precedential value."
108362,104918,Collins v. Hardyman,Overruled,"Whether or not Collins v. Hardyman was correctly decided on its own facts is a question with which we need not here be concerned. But it is clear, in the light of *96 the evolution of decisional law in the years that have passed since that case was decided, that many of the constitutional problems there perceived simply do not exist. Little reason remains, therefore, not to accord to the words of the statute their apparent meaning. .That meaning is confirmed by judicial construction of related laws, by the structural setting of § 1985 (3) itself, and by its legislative history. And a fair reading of the allegations of the complaint in this case clearly brings them within this meaning of the statutory language. As so construed, and as applied to this complaint, we have no doubt that the statute was within the constitutional power of Congress to enact.","The Acting Decision expressly rejects the restrictive construction of § 1985(3) adopted in Collins v. Hardyman, holding that the statute does reach private conspiracies and thus overrules Collins to the extent it held otherwise."
108721,102839,Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co.,Mentioned,"Thus, in Carmichael v. Southern Coal Co., 301 U. S. 495 , the Court, in sustaining an unemployment tax on employers, 6 said: “A state legislature, in the enactment of laws, has the widest possible latitude within the limits of the Constitution. In the nature of the case it cannot record a complete catalogue of, the considerations which move its members to enact laws. In the absence of such a record courts cannot assume that its action is capricious, or that, with its informed acquaintance with local conditions to which the legis *365 lation is to be applied, it was not aware of facts which afford reasonable basis for its action. Only by faithful adherence to this guiding principle of judicial review of legislation is it possible to preserve to the legislative branch its rightful independence and its ability to function.” Id., at 510 .","The Acting Decision quotes Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co. as support for the principle of legislative latitude in taxation, but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
108721,2042261,Lake Shore Auto Parts Co. v. Korzen,Reversed,"As so construed, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the tax violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id., at 151 , 273 N. E. 2d, at 599 , one Justice dissenting. ... Reversed.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that it is reversing the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court in Lake Shore Auto Parts Co. v. Korzen.
108721,103290,Madden v. Kentucky Ex Rel. Commissioner,Mentioned,"In Madden v. Kentucky, 309 U. S. 83 , a State laid an ad valorem tax of 50$ per $100 on deposits in banks outside the State and only 10(i per $1,000 on deposits within the State. The classification was sustained against the charge of invidious discrimination, the Court noting that “in taxation, even more than in other fields, legislatures possess the greatest freedom in classification.” Id., at 88 .","The Acting Decision references Madden v. Kentucky as precedent for legislative freedom in tax classification, but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its authority."
108721,97378,Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.,Mentioned,"Each of these dissenters thought Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107 , should govern Quaker City Cab. The Flint case involved a federal tax upon the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity, but it was not laid on businesses carried on by a partnership or private individual. ... But the Court in dictum stated: '[I]t could not be said, even if the principles of the Fourteenth Amendment were applicable to the present case, that there is no substantial difference be *362 tween the carrying on of business by the corporations taxed, and the same business when conducted by a private firm or individual.'","The Acting Decision discusses Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. as background and precedent, quoting its reasoning, but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its authority."
108721,101317,Quaker City Cab Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,Overruled,"Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania is only a relic of a bygone era. We cannot follow it and stay within the narrow confines of judicial review, which is an important part of our constitutional tradition.","The Acting Decision expressly states that it cannot follow Quaker City Cab and characterizes it as a 'relic of a bygone era,' thereby overruling its precedential value."

108889,107235,Mills v. Alabama (1966),Mentioned,"Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214 , involved the constitutionality of a state statute in effect making it a crime for a newspaper editor on election day to urge people to vote a certain way on the issues being submitted. The state court held the act did not violate the Federal Constitution and remanded the case for trial. It was argued that the judgment was not 'final' for purposes of 28 U. S. C. § 1257 . We noted that the point had 'a surface plausibility, since it is true the judgment of the State Supreme Court did not literally end the case.' 384 U. S., at 217 . We held it 'final,' however, because if the Act were constitutional the editor wbuld in reality have no defense.","The Acting Decision references Mills v. Alabama as an example in its discussion of finality for appellate jurisdiction, but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
108889,86449,Forgay v. Conrad (1848),Mentioned,"The exceptions noted 5 have a long lineage dating back *162 to Mr. Chief Justice Taney’s opinion in Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201 , where the Court held 'final' an interlocutory decree requiring a litigant 'to deliver up property which he claims,' even though a final accounting has yet to be made.","Forgay v.

But, as he pointed out, this concept of 'finality' has a 'penumbral area.' Ibid. Speaking for the Court in that case, he held that Nebraska’s ruling on the legality of a radio license issued by the Federal Communications Commission could be reviewed even though the state court had not yet determined the final accounting.","Radio Station Wow, Inc. v.

109514,105546,Morey v. Doud,Overruled,"Actually, the reliance on the statutes potential irrationality in Morey v. Doud , as the dissenters in that case correctly pointed out, see 354 U. S., at 474-475 (Frankfurter, J., joined by Harlan, J., dissenting), was a needlessly intrusive judicial infringement on the States legislative powers, and we have concluded that the equal protection analysis employed in that opinion should no longer be followed. ... Morey is, as appellee and the Court of Appeals properly recognized, essentially indistinguishable from this case, but the decision so far departs from proper equal protection analysis in cases of exclusively economic regulation that it should be, and it is, overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Morey v. Doud 'should be, and it is, overruled,' making the treatment clear."
109514,105285,"Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.",Mentioned,"Legislatures may implement their program step by step, Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384 U. S. 641 (1966), in such economic areas, adopting regulations that only partially ameliorate a perceived evil and deferring complete elimination of the evil to future regulations. See, e. g., Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 488-489 (1955).","The Acting Decision references Williamson v. Lee Optical as an example supporting a general legal principle, without criticizing, limiting, or otherwise altering its precedential value."
109514,106576,Ferguson v. Skrupa,Mentioned,"in the local economic sphere, it is only the in *304 vidious discrimination., the wholly arbitrary act, which cannot stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e. g., Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 732 (1963).","Ferguson v. Skrupa is cited as authority for a general proposition about equal protection and economic regulation, with no indication of criticism or limitation."
109514,107256,Katzenbach v. Morgan,Mentioned,"The governing constitutional principle was stated in Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra, at 657: '[W]e are guided by the familiar principles that a statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did,' ...","Katzenbach v. Morgan is quoted for a general principle and its reasoning is adopted, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
109346,108288,Durham v. United States (1971),Overruled,"To the extent that Durham v. United States, 401 U. S. 481 (1971), may be inconsistent with this ruling, Durham is overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Durham is overruled to the extent it is inconsistent with the current ruling, which is a clear and direct overruling."
108186,107685,Duncan v. Louisiana,Mentioned,"In Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), we held that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right to trial by jury in all criminal cases that — were they to be tried in a federal court — would come within the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee.","The Acting Decision references Duncan v. Louisiana as precedent for the proposition that the right to jury trial applies to the states, but does not criticize, limit, or overrule it. The decision builds upon Duncan, treating it as settled law."
108186,94866,Thompson v. Utah,Overruled,"This Court’s earlier decisions have assumed an affirmative answer to this question. The leading case so construing the Sixth Amendment is Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898)... We conclude, in short, as we began: the fact that the jury at common law was composed of precisely 12 is a historical accident, unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system and wholly without significance 'except to mystics.' ... To read the Sixth Amendment as forever codifying a feature so incidental to the real purpose of the Amendment is to ascribe a blind formalism to the Framers which would require considerably more evidence than we have been able to discover in the history and language of the Constitution or in the reasoning of our past decisions.","The Acting Decision expressly rejects the holding of Thompson v. Utah that the Sixth Amendment requires a 12-person jury, thereby overruling it."
108186,95043,Capital Traction Co. v. Hof,Distinguished,"Similarly, cases interpreting the jury trial provisions of the Seventh Amendment generally leap from the fact that the jury possessed a certain feature at common law to the conclusion that that feature must have been preserved by the Amendment’s simple reference to trial by 'jury.' E. g., Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 13-14 (1899); American Publishing Co. v. Fisher, 166 U. S. 464, 468 (1897). While much of our discussion in this case may be thought to bear equally on the interpretation of the Seventh Amendment’s jury trial provisions, we emphasize that the question is not before us; we do not decide whether, for example, additional references to the 'common law' that occur in the Seventh Amendment might support a different interpretation.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Capital Traction Co. v. Hof by noting that its reasoning about the Seventh Amendment does not control the Sixth Amendment issue before the Court.
108186,106862,Malloy v. Hogan,Mentioned,"Given Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964), I join that part of the Court’s opinion in No. 927 relating to the Florida 'alibi' procedure.","Malloy v. Hogan is mentioned as precedent for incorporation of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, but is not discussed or altered in any substantive way."
108186,96270,Rassmussen v. United States,Questioned,"A ruling that the Sixth Amendment refers to a common-law jury was essential to the holding in Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U. S. 516 (1905), where the Court held invalid a conviction by a six-man jury in Alaska. The ruling was accepted at the Government’s concession without discussion or citation; the major focus of the case was on the question whether the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the territory in question at all. See 197 U. S., at 519.","The Acting Decision questions the precedential value of Rassmussen v. United States, noting that its holding was based on an assumption rather than analysis, and suggesting that its reasoning is not controlling."
108186,92280,Callan v. Wilson,Mentioned,"It is to the distinction between 'petty' and 'serious' offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937); Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65 (1904); Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 552 (1888).","Callan v. Wilson is cited as historical support for the distinction between petty and serious offenses, but the Acting Decision does not discuss, criticize, or alter its holding."
108186,106641,Ker v. California,Mentioned,"In Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963), I noted in an opinion concurring in the result that: 'The rule [of ‘incorporation’] is unwise because the States, with their differing law enforcement problems, should not be put in a constitutional strait jacket ....'","Ker v. California is mentioned in a concurring opinion to illustrate a point about incorporation, but is not substantively discussed or altered."
108186,102801,District of Columbia v. Clawans,Mentioned,"It is to the distinction between 'petty' and 'serious' offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937); Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65 (1904); Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 552 (1888).","District of Columbia v. Clawans is cited as precedent for the petty/serious offense distinction, but is not discussed or altered."
108186,107486,United States v. Wade,Mentioned,"Although I have disagreed with particular holdings like Gilbert v. California, supra, where the Court held that the *133 States must arrange presence of counsel at lineups, see Mr. Justice White’s separate opinion in United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 250 (1967), which I joined, this is because those decisions incorrectly require, in my view, counsel in circumstances where his presence is not necessary under either the Sixth Amendment or the Due Process Clause.","United States v. Wade is mentioned in a discussion of the right to counsel, but the Acting Decision does not discuss, criticize, or alter its holding."
109390,104216,Marsh v. Alabama (1946),Distinguished,"The closest decision in theory, Marsh v. Alabama, supra, involved the assumption by a private enterprise of all of the attributes of a state-created municipality and the exercise by that enterprise of semiofficial municipal functions as a delegate of the State. In effect, thé owner of the company town was performing the full spectrum of municipal powers and stood in the shoes of the State. In the instant case there is no comparable assumption or exercise of municipal functions or power.","The Acting Decision explains that Marsh involved a company town with all the attributes of a municipality, whereas the present case does not, thereby distinguishing Marsh on its facts and limiting its applicability."
109390,107692,"Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc. (1968)",Overruled,"And in the performance of that duty we make clear now, if it was not clear before, that the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive the Court’s decision in the Lloyd case.","The Acting Decision expressly states that the rationale of Logan Valley is no longer valid and makes clear that it is overruled, removing its precedential value."
109390,108592,Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner (1972),Mentioned,"The Court in its Lloyd opinion did not say that it was overruling the Logan Valley decision. Indeed, a substantial portion of the Court’s opinion in Lloyd was devoted to pointing out the differences between the two cases, noting particularly that, in contrast to the hand-billing in Lloyd, the picketing in Logan Valley had been *518 specifically directed to a store in the shopping center and the pickets had had no other reasonable opportunity to reach their intended audience. 407 U. S., at 561-567.","Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner is discussed at length for its reasoning and its effect on Logan Valley, but the Acting Decision neither overrules, criticizes, nor limits Lloyd; it simply analyzes and applies it."
109390,105389,National Labor Relations Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co. (1956),Mentioned,"This result was ostensibly reached under the statutory criteria set forth in NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105, a case which held that union organizers who seek to solicit for union membership may intrude on an employer’s private property if no alternative means exist for communicating with the employees.","The Acting Decision references Babcock & Wilcox as providing the statutory standard for balancing § 7 rights and property rights, but does not alter, criticize, or limit its holding."
109390,108591,Central Hardware Co. v. National Labor Relations Board (1972),Mentioned,"The task of the Board and the reviewing courts under the Act, therefore, stands in conspicuous contrast to the duty of a court in applying the standards of the First Amendment, which requires 'above all else' that expression must not be restricted by government 'because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content.' In the Central Hardware case, and earlier in the case of NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co., 351 U. S. 105, the Court considered the nature of the Boards task in this area under the Act.","Central Hardware is cited as precedent for the statutory balancing required under the NLRA, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
109570,1489061,Walker v. Hall (1975),Mentioned,"A three-judge court convened under 28 U. S. C. § 2281 sustained the constitutionality of the statutory differential and dismissed the action. 399 F. Supp. 1304 (1975). We noted probable jurisdiction of appellants’ appeal, 423 U. S. 1047 (1976). We reverse.","Walker v. Hall is referenced as the district court decision being appealed and reversed, but the Supreme Court does not analyze or critique its reasoning in detail; it is simply the procedural predecessor."
109570,109235,Stanton v. Stanton (1975),Mentioned,"And only two Terms ago, Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7 (1975), expressly stating that Reed v. Reed was 'controlling,' 421 U. S., at 13, held that Reed required invalidation of a Utah differential age-of-majority statute, notwithstanding the statute’s coincidence with and furtherance of the State’s purpose of fostering 'old notions' of role typing and preparing boys for their expected performance in the economic and political worlds. 421 U. S., at 14-15.","Stanton v. Stanton is cited as precedent supporting the application of Reed v. Reed, but the Acting Decision does not distinguish, criticize, or otherwise alter its holding; it is used as supporting authority."
109570,108404,Reed v. Reed (1971),Mentioned,"Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that Reed emphasized that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are 'subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.' 404 U. S., at 75. To withstand constitutional challenge, previous cases establish that classifications by gender must serve important governmental objectives and must be substantially related to achievement of those objectives. Thus, in Reed, the objectives of 'reducing the workload on probate courts,' id., at 76, and 'avoiding intrafamily controversy,' id., at 77, were deemed of insufficient importance to sustain use of an overt gender criterion in the appointment of administrators of intestate decedents’ estates.","Reed v. Reed is treated as controlling precedent and is repeatedly cited as the standard for gender discrimination analysis, but the Acting Decision does not alter, criticize, or limit it; it applies Reed as binding authority."
109570,105152,Barrows v. Jackson (1953),Mentioned,"our decisions have settled that limitations on a litigant’s assertion of jus tertii are not constitutionally mandated, but rather stem from a salutary 'rule of self-restraint' designed to minimize unwarranted intervention into controversies where the applicable constitutional questions are ill-defined and speculative. See, e. g., Barrows v. Jackson, 346 U. S. 249, 255, 257 (1953); see also Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U. S. 106, 123-124 (1976) (Powell, J.; dissenting).","Barrows v. Jackson is cited as precedent for third-party standing, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes nor distinguishes it; it is referenced as supporting authority."
109570,108497,Stanley v. Illinois (1972),Mentioned,"Decisions following Reed similarly have rejected administrative ease and convenience as sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-based classifications. See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 656 (1972); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 690 (1973); cf. Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498, 506-507 (1975).","Stanley v. Illinois is cited as an example of a case rejecting administrative convenience as a justification for gender discrimination, but the Acting Decision does not alter or question its holding."
109570,109013,Kahn v. Shevin (1974),Distinguished,"Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498 (1975), upholding the use of gender-based classifications, rested upon the Court’s perception of the laudatory purposes of those laws as remedying disadvantageous conditions suffered by women in economic and military life. See 416 U. S., at 353-354; 419 U. S., at 508. Needless to say, in this case Oklahoma does not suggest that the age-sex differential was enacted to ensure the availability of 3.2% beer for women as compensation for previous deprivations. That this was the true purpose is not at all self-evident.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Kahn v. Shevin by noting that the justification for the gender-based classification in Kahn (remedying disadvantage to women) is not present in the Oklahoma statute at issue.
109570,108781,Frontiero v. Richardson (1973),Mentioned,"Decisions following Reed similarly have rejected administrative ease and convenience as sufficiently important objectives to justify gender-based classifications. See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U. S. 645, 656 (1972); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U. S. 677, 690 (1973); cf. Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498, 506-507 (1975).","Frontiero v. Richardson is cited as precedent supporting the application of heightened scrutiny to gender classifications, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, distinguish, or limit it."
109570,108489,Eisenstadt v. Baird (1972),Mentioned,"Indeed, the jus tertii question raised here is answered by our disposition of a like argument in Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra. There, as here, a state statute imposed legal duties and disabilities upon the claimant, who was convicted of distributing a package of contraceptive foam to a third party. ... Since the statute was directed at Baird and penalized his conduct, the Court did not hesitate — again as here — to conclude that the 'case or controversy' requirement of Art. Ill was satisfied. 405 U. S., at 443.","Eisenstadt v. Baird is cited as directly analogous precedent for third-party standing, but the Acting Decision does not alter or criticize its holding."
109570,109132,Schlesinger v. Ballard (1975),Distinguished,"Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U.

109570,104606,Goesaert v. Cleary (1948),Criticized,"Insofar as Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948), may be inconsistent, that decision is disapproved. Undoubtedly reflecting the view that Goesaert’s equal protection analysis no longer obtains, the District Court made no reference to that decision in upholding Oklahoma’s-statute. Similarly, the opinions of the federal and state courts cited earlier in the text invalidating gender lines with respect to alcohol regulation uniformly disparaged the contemporary vitality of Goesaert.","The Acting Decision expressly disapproves Goesaert v. Cleary to the extent it is inconsistent with current equal protection analysis, indicating that its reasoning is no longer valid."
108990,96819,Ex Parte Young,Distinguished,"Ex parte Young was a watershed case in which this Court held that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar an action in the federal courts seeking to enjoin the Attorney General of Minnesota from enforcing a statute claimed to violate the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. This holding has permitted the Civil War Amendments to the Constitution to serve as a sword, rather than merely as a shield, for those whom they were designed to protect. But the relief awarded in Ex parte Young was prospective only... But the retroactive portion of the District Court’s order here, which requires the payment of a very substantial amount of money which that court held should have been paid, but was not, stands on quite a different footing.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Ex parte Young by holding that while prospective injunctive relief is permitted under Ex parte Young, retroactive monetary relief is not, thus limiting the scope of Ex parte Young to prospective relief only."
108990,106821,Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama State Docks Department,Distinguished,"Both Parden and Employees involved a congressional enactment which by its terms authorized suit by designated plaintiffs against a general class of defendants which literally included States or state instrumentalities... But in this case the threshold fact of congressional authorization to sue a class of defendants which literally includes States is wholly absent. Thus respondent is not only precluded from relying on this Court’s holding in Employees, but on this Court’s holdings in Parden and Petty as well.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Parden by noting that, unlike in Parden, there is no congressional authorization to sue states in the relevant statute, so the precedent does not apply."
108990,108763,Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health,Distinguished,"Both Parden and Employees involved a congressional enactment which by its terms authorized suit by designated plaintiffs against a general class of defendants which literally included States or state instrumentalities... But in this case the threshold fact of congressional authorization to sue a class of defendants which literally includes States is wholly absent. Thus respondent is not only precluded from relying on this Court’s holding in Employees, but on this Court’s holdings in Parden and Petty as well.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Employees by stating that the necessary congressional authorization to sue states is absent in the present case, so Employees does not control."
108990,105869,Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission,Distinguished,"Similarly, Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm’n, supra, involved congressional approval, pursuant to the Compact Clause, of a compact between Tennessee and Missouri, which provided that each compacting State would have the power 'to contract, to sue, and be sued in its own name.' ... But in this case the threshold fact of congressional authorization to sue a class of defendants which literally includes States is wholly absent. Thus respondent is not only precluded from relying on this Court’s holding in Employees, but on this Court’s holdings in Parden and Petty as well.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Petty by explaining that, unlike in Petty, there is no congressional authorization for suit against states in the present context."
108990,104057,Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury,Mentioned,"Thus the rule has evolved that a suit by private parties seeking to impose a liability which must be paid from public funds in the state treasury is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Great Northern Life Insurance Co. v. Read, supra; Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm’n, 327 U. S. 573 (1946). ... Were we to uphold this portion of the District Court’s decree, we would be obligated to overrule the Court’s holding in Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, supra. ... We reach a similar conclusion with respect to the retroactive portion of the relief awarded by the District Court in this case.","The Acting Decision applies and affirms the rule from Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, using it as direct precedent for its holding, but does not overrule, criticize, or limit it."
108990,307980,"John Jordan, by His Next Friend, Jeanette Bryant, Individually and on Behalf of All Other Persons Similarly Situated, Cross-Appellees v. Edward T. Weaver, Cross-Appellants",Reversed,For the foregoing reasons we decide that the Court of Appeals was wrong in holding that the Eleventh Amendment did not constitute a bar to that portion of the District Court decree which ordered retroactive payment of benefits found to have been wrongfully withheld. The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.,The Acting Decision expressly reverses the judgment of the cited Court of Appeals decision.
108990,108113,Rosado v. Wyman,Distinguished,"It is, of course, true that Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U. S. 397 (1970), held that suits in federal court under § 1983 are proper to secure compliance with the provisions of the Social Security Act on the part of participating States. 18 But it has not hereto *676 fore been suggested that § 1983 was intended to create a waiver of a State’s Eleventh Amendment immunity merely because an action could be brought under that *677 section against state officers, rather than against the State itself. ... We do not regard Rosado as controlling either way since the Court was not faced with a district court judgment ordering retroactive payments or with a challenge based on the Eleventh Amendment.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Rosado v. Wyman, stating that it did not address the Eleventh Amendment issue or retroactive payments, and thus is not controlling."
108990,107743,King v. Smith,Mentioned,"We adhere to King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309 (1968), which implicitly rejected the argument that the statutory provisions for HEW review of plans should be read to curtail judicial relief and held Alabama’s ‘substitute father’ regulation to be inconsistent with the federal statute.","The Acting Decision references King v. Smith as precedent for judicial review of state welfare plans, but does not discuss, criticize, or limit its holding."
108990,8901897,Rothstein v. Wyman,Mentioned,"Because of an apparent conflict on the Eleventh Amendment issue with the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d 226 (1972), cert. denied, 411 U. S. 921 (1973), we granted the petition for certiorari... Addressing himself to a similar situation in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d 226 *665 (CA2 1972), cert. denied, 411 U. S. 921 (1973), Judge McGowan 10 observed for the court: ...

108990,102271,Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi,Mentioned,"Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934), reaffirmed the principle that the Eleventh Amendment was no bar to a suit by the United States against a State. Id., at 329.","The Acting Decision mentions Monaco v.

108990,107901,Shapiro v. Thompson,Limited,"Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U. S. 618 (1969), is the only instance in which the Eleventh Amendment objection to such retroactive relief was actually presented to this Court in a case which was orally argued. ... This case, therefore, is the first opportunity the Court has taken to fully explore and treat the Eleventh Amend *671 ment aspects of such relief in a written opinion. Shapiro v. Thompson and these three summary affirmances obviously are of precedential value in support of the contention that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar the relief awarded by the District Court in this case. Equally obviously, they are not of the same precedential value as would be an opinion of this Court treating the question on the merits. Since we deal with a constitutional question, we are less constrained by the principle of stare decisis than we are in other areas of the law. 14 Having now had an opportunity to more fully consider the Eleventh Amendment issue after briefing and argument, we disapprove the Eleventh Amendment holdings of those cases to the extent that they are inconsistent with our holding today.","The Acting Decision limits the precedential value of Shapiro v.

109532,108605,Furman v. Georgia,Distinguished,"While Furman did not hold that the infliction of the death penalty per se violates the Constitutions ban on cruel and unusual punishments, it did recognize that the penalty of death is different in kind from any other punishment imposed under our system of criminal justice. Because of the uniqueness of the death penalty, Furman held that it could not be imposed under sentencing procedures that created a substantial risk that it would be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner... The new Georgia sentencing procedures, by contrast, focus the jury’s attention on the particularized nature of the crime and the particularized characteristics of the individual defendant.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Furman by holding that the constitutional deficiencies identified in Furman are not present under Georgia's revised procedures, thus upholding the death penalty under a different statutory scheme."

109532,1220970,Coley v. State,Mentioned,"As an important additional safeguard against arbitrariness and caprice, the Georgia statutory scheme provides for automatic appeal of all death sentences to the State’s Supreme Court... In Coley, it held that '[t]he prior cases indicate that the past practice among juries faced with similar factual situations and like aggravating circumstances has been to impose only the sentence of life imprisonment for the offense of rape, rather than death.' 231 Ga., at 835, 204 S.

See Chenault v. State, 234 Ga. 216, 216 S. E. 2d 223 (1975). On the other hand, the court expressly reversed a finding of great risk when the victim was simply kid-naped in a parking lot.

State is the direct lower court decision under review and is described factually; the Acting Decision affirms it but does not otherwise analyze or alter its reasoning.
109532,97242,Weems v. United States,Mentioned,"The Court early recognized that 'a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth.' Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 373 (1910). Thus the Clause forbidding 'cruel and unusual' punishments 'is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.'

109532,1260876,People v. Anderson,Mentioned,"In the only statewide referendum occurring since Fur-man and brought to our attention, the people of California adopted a constitutional amendment that authorized capital punishment, in effect negating a prior ruling by the Supreme Court of California in People v.

O'NEAL,Mentioned,"Indeed, a recent regression study, based on Ehrlich’s theoretical model but using cross-section state data for the years 1950 and 1960, found no support for the conclusion that executions act as a deterrent. 12 The Ehrlich study, in short, is of little, if any, assistance in assessing the deterrent impact of the death penalty. Accord, Commonwealth v. O’Neal, -Mass. -, -, 339 N. E. 2d 676, 684 (1975).",Commonwealth v. O'NEAL is cited in a dissenting opinion as agreeing with the lack of deterrent effect of the death penalty; it is not analyzed or criticized.
109532,106451,Robinson v. California,Mentioned,"The substantive limits imposed by the Eighth Amendment on what can be made criminal and punished were discussed in Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962). The Court found unconstitutional a state statute that made the status of being addicted to a narcotic drug a criminal offense.","Robinson v.

109532,108329,McGautha v. California,Limited,"In McGautha v. California, supra, this Court held that the *196 Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require that a jury be provided with standards to guide its decision whether to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment or death or that the capital-sentencing proceeding be separated from the guilt-determination process. McGautha was not an Eighth Amendment decision, and to the extent it purported to deal with Eighth Amendment concerns, it must be read in light of the opinions in Furman v. Georgia. There the Court ruled that death sentences imposed under statutes that left juries with untrammeled discretion to impose or withhold the death penalty violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. While Furman did not overrule Mc-Gautha, it is clearly in substantial tension with a broad reading of McGautha’s holding.",The Acting Decision limits McGautha by stating that its holding must be read in light of Furman and that it cannot be broadly applied to Eighth Amendment challenges to capital sentencing procedures.
109615,104587,Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Stone (1948),Mentioned,"The narrowing of the rule to one of draftsmanship and phraseology began with another Mississippi case, Memphis Gas Co. v.

S. 100 (1975). ... By a 7-to-1 vote, this Court affirmed. ... Accordingly, on the authority of Memphis Gas, the tax was held to be constitutional.","The Acting Decision uses Colonial Pipeline Co. v.

109716,105646,Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States (1958),Mentioned,"Per se rules of il *50 legality are appropriate only when they relate to conduct that is manifestly anticompetitive. As the Court explained in Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S. 1, 5 (1958), 'there are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.'","Northern Pacific Railway Co. is cited as authority for the general standard regarding per se rules, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes nor limits its holding, instead using it as a foundational reference."

There the Court held that the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970 was constitutional as applied to temporarily freeze the wages of state and local government employees. ... These factors distinguish the statute in Fry from the provisions at issue here.","The Acting Decision explains why Fry does not control the present case, distinguishing it based on the temporary and emergency nature of the statute in Fry versus the permanent and intrusive nature of the statute at issue."

Bowles does not apply to the present issues, distinguishing it from the case at hand."
109499,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt (1938),Mentioned,"No direct quote provided, but the case is referenced in the context of federal taxation and state sovereignty.","The Acting Decision mentions Helvering v. Gerhardt as part of the historical discussion of state immunity from federal taxation, but does not discuss or alter its authority."
109499,97448,Coyle v. Smith (1911),Mentioned,"In Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911), the Court gave this example of such an attribute: 'The power to locate its own seat of government and to determine when and how it shall be changed from one place to another, and to appropriate its own public funds for that purpose, are essentially and peculiarly state powers.'","The Acting Decision cites Coyle v. Smith as an example of state sovereignty, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
109499,87985,Lane County v. Oregon (1869),Mentioned,"In Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 (1869), his opinion for the Court said: 'Both the States and the United States existed before the Constitution. ...'","The Acting Decision references Lane County v. Oregon to support its discussion of state sovereignty, without criticism or limitation."
109499,106821,Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama State Docks Department (1964),Mentioned,"For the same reasons, despite Mr. Justice Brennan’s claims to the contrary, the holdings in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), are likewise unimpaired by our decision today.","The Acting Decision states that its holding does not affect or overrule Parden, thus merely mentioning it."
109499,108763,Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health (1973),Mentioned,"No direct quote provided, but the case is referenced in the context of the scope of federal power over state employment.","The Acting Decision references Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health in passing, without discussion or alteration of its authority."
109580,86317,Pollard's Lessee v. HAGAN,Mentioned,"Pollard’s Lessee v. Hagan, supra, holds that the State receives absolute title to the beds of navigable waterways within its boundaries upon admission to the Union, and contains not the slightest suggestion that such title is 'defeasible' in the technical sense of that term.","The Acting Decision discusses and applies the rule from Pollard’s Lessee v. Hagan as foundational precedent, but does not alter, criticize, or limit its holding. The case is treated as authoritative and is used to support the Court's reasoning."
109580,108897,Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona,Overruled,"Upon full reconsideration of our decision in Bonelli, we conclude that it was wrong in treating the equal-footing doctrine as a source of federal common law after that doctrine had vested title to the riverbed in the State of Arizona as of the time of its admission to the Union... For all of these reasons, we have now decided that Bonelli’s application of federal common law to cases such as this must be overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly overrules Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona, stating that its application of federal common law was incorrect and must be abandoned."
109580,93804,Shively v. Bowlby,Mentioned,"And in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1 (1894), the Court recounted in extenso the many cases which had followed the doctrine of Pollard’s Lessee... In summarizing its holding, 152 U. S., at 57-58, the Court stated: 'The new States admitted into the Union since the adoption of the Constitution have the same rights as the original States in the tide waters, and in the lands under them, within their respective jurisdictions. The title and rights of riparian or littoral proprietors in the soil below [the] high water mark, therefore, are governed by the laws of the several States, subject to the rights granted to the United States by the Constitution.'","The Acting Decision relies on Shively v. Bowlby as supporting precedent for its holding, summarizing and applying its rule, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
109580,102485,"Borax Consolidated, Ltd. v. Los Angeles",Distinguished,"In Borax, the city of Los Angeles brought suit to quiet title in certain land in Los Angeles Harbor... The Court went on to hold that the boundary between the upland and tideland was to be determined by federal law... This same principle would require that determination of the initial boundary between a riverbed, which the State acquired under the equal-footing doctrine, and riparian fast lands likewise be decided as a matter of federal law rather than state law. But that determination is solely for the purpose of fixing the boundaries of the riverbed acquired by the State at the time of its admission to the Union; thereafter the role of the equal-footing doctrine is ended, and the land is subject to the laws of the State.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Borax by limiting its application to the determination of initial boundaries at statehood, clarifying that it does not support the broader federal common law rule applied in Bonelli."
109580,89473,Barney v. Keokuk,Mentioned,"In Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324, 338 (1877), the Court extended the doctrine to waters which were nontidal but nonetheless navigable, consistent with its earlier extension of admiralty jurisdiction to such waters in The Propeller Genesee Chief v. Fitzhugh, 12 How. 443 (1852).","The Acting Decision references Barney v. Keokuk as part of the historical development of the law, using it to support its reasoning, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
109580,89097,County of St. Clair v. Lovingston,Mentioned,"This statement of the law was quoted by the Court in County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 68 (1874).","The Acting Decision references County of St. Clair v. Lovingston as an example of the common law doctrine of accretion, but does not discuss, criticize, or limit its holding."
109580,107555,Hughes v. Washington,Questioned,"Amici Utah and New Mexico also urge us to reconsider our decision in Hughes v. Washington, 389 U. S. 290 (1967). They advance the same reasons for such reconsideration as they do with respect to Bonelli. But Hughes was not cited by the Oregon courts below, and in Bonelli we expressly declined to rely upon it as a basis for our decision there, see 414 U. S., at 321 n. 11. We therefore have no occasion to address the issue. We are aware of the fact that Hughes gave to Borax the same sort of expansive construction as did Bonelli, but we are likewise aware that Hughes dealt with oceanfront property, a fact which the Court thought sufficiently different from the usual situation so as to justify a 'federal common law' rule of riparian proprietorship...","The Acting Decision expresses doubt about the continuing validity of Hughes v. Washington, noting its expansive reading and suggesting it may be overruled in the future, but stops short of formally overruling it."
109580,96443,Joy v. City of St. Louis,Mentioned,"For example, this Court has held that subsequent changes in the contour of the land, as well as subsequent transfers of the land, are governed by the state law. Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 343 (1906).","The Acting Decision cites Joy v. City of St. Louis as supporting precedent for the proposition that state law governs subsequent changes in land, but does not criticize or limit its authority."
109580,86113,Wilcox v. Jackson,Mentioned,"Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498 (1839); ... As long ago as 1839, the Court said: 'We hold the true principle to be this, that whenever the question in any Court, state or federal, is, whether a title to land which had once been the property of the United States has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws of the United States; but that whenever, according to those laws, the title shall have passed, then that property, like all other property in the state, is subject to state legislation; so far as that legislation is consistent with the admission that the title passed and vested according to the laws of the United States.' Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet., at 517.","The Acting Decision references Wilcox v. Jackson as historical authority for the principle that state law governs property after federal title has passed, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its holding."
109450,108848,Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations (1973),Distinguished,"That simplistic approach, which by then had come under criticism or was regarded as of doubtful validity by Members of the Court, 16 was avoided in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm’n, 413 U. S. 376 (1973). There the Court upheld an ordinance prohibiting newspapers from listing employment advertisements in columns according to whether male or female employees were sought to be hired. The Court, to be sure, characterized the advertisements as 'classic examples of commercial speech,' id., at 385 , and a newspaper’s printing of the advertisements as of the same character. The Court, however, upheld the ordinance on the ground that the restriction it imposed was permissible because the discriminatory hirings proposed by the advertisements, and by their newspaper layout, were themselves illegal.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Pittsburgh Press by noting that the restriction there was upheld because the underlying conduct was illegal, whereas the present case involves truthful, legal activity. The distinction is explicitly drawn and the reasoning is not adopted as controlling."
109450,109271,Bigelow v. Virginia (1975),Mentioned,"Last Term, in Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975), the notion of unprotected 'commercial speech' all but passed from the scene. We reversed a conviction for violation of a Virginia statute that made the circulation of any publication to encourage or promote the *760 processing of an abortion in Virginia a misdemeanor. ... We rejected the contention that the publication was unprotected because it was commercial. Chrestenserís continued validity was questioned, and its holding was described as 'distinctly a limited one' that merely upheld 'a reasonable regulation of the manner in which commercial advertising could be distributed.' 421 U. S., at 819.","Bigelow is cited as a recent precedent that questioned the validity of a blanket commercial speech exception, but the Acting Decision goes further and addresses the issue more directly. The case is mentioned as part of the doctrinal development."
109450,106761,New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964),Mentioned,"Moreover, the Court several times has stressed that communications to which First Amendment protection was given were not 'purely commercial.' New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 266 *759 (1964); Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S., at 533 ; Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, 111 (1943); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413, 417 (1943).","New York Times Co. v.

109450,2239749,Patterson Drug Company v. Kingery (1969),Distinguished,"Shortly after the phrase was added to the statute in 1968, 8 a suit seeking to enjoin its operation was instituted by a drug retailing company and one of its pharmacists. Although the First Amendment was invoked, the challenge appears to have been based primarily on the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. In any event, the prohibition on drug price advertising was upheld. Patterson Drug Co. v. Kingery, 305 F. Supp. 821 (WD Va. 1969). ... The District Court seized on the identity of the plaintiff-appellees as consumers as a feature distinguishing the *755 present case from Patterson Drug Co. v. Kingery, supra. Because the unsuccessful plaintiffs in that earlier case were pharmacists, the court said, 'theirs was a prima facie commercial approach,' 373 F. Supp., at 686 . The present plaintiffs, on the other hand, were asserting an interest in their own health that was 'fundamentally deeper than a trade consideration.' Ibid.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Patterson Drug Co. v. Kingery on the basis of the parties involved and the nature of the challenge, noting that the earlier case was brought by pharmacists and focused on due process and equal protection, not the First Amendment rights of consumers."
109450,103347,Thornhill v. Alabama (1940),Mentioned,"It was observed in Thornhill that 'the practices in a single factory may have economic repercussions upon a whole region and affect widespread systems of marketing.' Id., at 103 .","Thornhill v. Alabama is cited for a general principle about the economic impact of speech, but the Acting Decision does not analyze or alter its holding. It is used illustratively."
109450,2098134,"Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. v. State Board of Pharmacy (1974)",Mentioned,"The three-judge District Court declared the quoted portion of the statute 'void and of no effect,' Jurisdictional Statement, App. 1, and enjoined the defendant-appellants, the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy and the individual members of that Board, from enforcing it. 373 F. Supp. 683 (ED Va. 1974). We noted probable jurisdiction of the appeal. 420 U. S. 971 (1975).","The Acting Decision references the lower court decision as the procedural posture of the case under review, but does not discuss or critique its reasoning independently."
109450,103654,Valentine v. Chrestensen (1942),Criticized,"In Valentine v. Chrestensen, supra, the Court upheld a New York statute that prohibited the distribution of any 'handbill, circular ... or other advertising matter whatsoever in or upon any street.' The Court concluded that, although the First Amendment would forbid the banning of all communication by handbill in the public thoroughfares, it imposed 'no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising.' 316 U. S., at 54 . ... Chrestenserís continued validity was questioned, and its holding was described as 'distinctly a limited one' that merely upheld 'a reasonable regulation of the manner in which commercial advertising could be distributed.' 421 U. S., at 819 .","The Acting Decision directly questions the continued validity of Valentine v. Chrestensen, describes its holding as limited, and moves away from its reasoning, thus criticizing its precedential value."
109450,105285,"Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc. (1955)",Distinguished,"The District Court recognized that this Court had upheld — against federal constitutional challenges other than on First Amendment grounds — state restric *756 tions on the advertisement of prices for optometrists’ services, Head v. New Mexico Board, 374 U. S. 424 (1963), for eyeglass frames, Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483 (1955), and for dentists’ services, Semler v. Dental Examiners, 294 U. S. 608 (1935). 13 ... The challenge now made, however, is based on the First Amendment. This casts the Board’s justifications in a different light, for on close inspection it is seen that the State’s protectiveness of its citizens rests in large measure on the advantages of their being kept in ignorance.","Williamson v. Lee Optical is distinguished because it addressed due process and equal protection, not the First Amendment, and the Acting Decision finds the First Amendment challenge to be materially different."
109450,107970,National Labor Relations Board v. Gissel Packing Co. (1969),Mentioned,"It has long been settled that both the employee and the employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome.

Grove is cited only in reference to a dissenting opinion and is not discussed or analyzed by the Acting Decision. It is merely mentioned."
109835,109344,Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages (1976),Mentioned,"In Michelin the Court upheld the application of a general ad valorem property tax to imported tires and tubes. The Court surveyed the history and purposes of the Import-Export-Clause to determine, for the first time, which taxes fell within the absolute ban on 'Imposts or Duties.' ... Michelin initiated a different approach to Import-Export Clause cases. It ignored the simple question whether the tires and tubes were imports. Instead, it analyzed the nature of the tax to determine whether it was an 'Impost or Duty.' 423 U. S., at 279, 290-294.","The Acting Decision discusses and applies the analytical framework from Michelin, using it as precedent for its own analysis, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority. Thus, Michelin is mentioned and followed."
109835,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady (1977)",Mentioned,"We conclude that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, where the Court held that a State under appropriate conditions may tax directly the privilege of conducting interstate business, requires such rejection. ... The principles of Complete Auto also lead us now to question the underpinnings of the Stevedoring Cases.","The Acting Decision relies on Complete Auto as controlling precedent and uses its reasoning to overrule earlier cases, but does not criticize or limit Complete Auto itself. It is mentioned as authoritative and applied."
109835,104388,Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. (1947),Overruled,"To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n and Joseph v.

Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. is overruled to the extent it conflicts with the new analysis, thus nullifying its precedential value."
109835,104859,Canton Railroad v. Rogan (1951),Mentioned,"In Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511 (1951), the Court upheld a gross-receipts tax on a steam railroad operating exclusively within the Port of Baltimore. ... The Court rejected that argument primarily on the ground that immunity of services incidental to importing and exporting was not so broad as the immunity of the goods themselves.","The Acting Decision discusses and applies the reasoning from Canton Railroad v. Rogan as supportive precedent, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority. It is mentioned and followed."
109835,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue (1938),Mentioned,"Petitioner replied that this Court had invited rejection *741 of those cases by casting doubt on the Commerce Clause analysis that distinguished between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce. Id., at 25-37, citing, e. g., Interstate Pipe Line Co. v. Stone, 337 U. S. 662 (1949); Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938). ... The Court repeatedly has sustained taxes that are applied to activity with a substantial nexus with the State, that are fairly apportioned, that do not discriminate against interstate commerce, and that are fairly related to the services provided by the State. E. g., General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436 (1964); Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959); Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, 335 U. S. 80 (1948); Wisconsin v. J. C.

109344,85534,Brown v. Maryland (1827),Distinguished,"But the opinion in Brown v. Maryland cannot properly be read to propose such a broad definition of 'imposts' or 'duties.' ... Despite the language and objectives of the Import-Export Clause, and despite the limited nature of the holding in Brown v. Maryland, the Court in Low v. Austin ignored the warning that the boundary between the power of States to tax persons and property within their jurisdictions and the limitations on the power of the States to impose imposts or duties with respect to 'imports' was a subtle and difficult line which must be drawn, as the cases arise.","The Acting Decision carefully analyzes Brown v. Maryland, explains its limited holding, and distinguishes its facts and reasoning from the present case, concluding that Brown does not control the outcome here."
109344,88429,Low v. Austin (1872),Overruled,"It follows from the foregoing that Low v. Austin was wrongly decided. That decision therefore must be, and is, overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Low v. Austin is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value."

Bowers (1959),Mentioned,"Taxes imposed after an initial sale, after the breakup of the shipping packages, or the moment goods imported for use are committed to current operational needs are also all likely to have an incidental effect on the volume of goods imported; yet all are permissible. See, e. g., Waring v. The Mayor, 8 Wall. 110 (1869) (taxation after initial sale); May v. New Orleans, supra (taxation after breakup of shipping packages); Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers, 358 U. S. 534 (1959) (taxation of goods committed to current operational needs by manufacturer).","The Acting Decision references Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers as an example of permissible taxation but does not analyze, criticize, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
109344,86429,Thurlow v. Massachusetts (1847),Mentioned,"Low v. Austin compounded the error in misreading the Brown opinion by the further error of misreading the views of Mr. Chief Justice Taney as expressed in his opinion in the License Cases, 5 How. 504 (1847) (six Justices wrote separately in the cases).","The Acting Decision mentions the License Cases (which includes Thurlow v. Massachusetts) in the context of discussing Chief Justice Taney's views, but does not analyze or alter the holding of Thurlow v. Massachusetts."
110325,106022,Jones v. United States (1960),Overruled,"The automatic standing, rule of Jones v.

United States, 390 U.

110325,108760,Brown v. United States (1973),Mentioned,"Thus, as we stated in Brown v. United States, 411 U. S., at 228 , '[t]he self-incrimination dilemma, so central to the Jones decision, can no longer occur under the prevailing interpretation of the Constitution [in Simmons].'","Brown v. United States is referenced to support the Court's analysis of the self-incrimination issue, but its reasoning is not criticized or altered; it is used to clarify the current state of the law."
110325,107872,Alderman v. United States (1969),Mentioned,"The same argument has been rejected by this Court as a sufficient basis for allowing persons whose Fourth Amendment rights were not violated to nevertheless claim the benefits of the exclusionary rule. In Alderman v. United States, 394 U. S., at 174-175 , we explicitly stated: ...","Alderman is cited to reinforce the Court's position on the limits of the exclusionary rule, but the decision is not criticized or limited; it is referenced as settled authority."
110212,105789,Hawkins v. United States (1958),Overruled,"Our consideration of the foundations for the privilege and its history satisfy us that reason and experience’ no longer justify so sweeping a rule as that found acceptable by the Court in Hawkins. Accordingly, we conclude that the existing rule should be modified so that the witness-spouse alone has a privilege to refuse to testify adversely; the witness may be neither compelled to testify nor foreclosed from testifying.","The Acting Decision expressly rejects and replaces the rule established in Hawkins, stating that it is no longer justified and modifying the law so that the privilege is vested only in the witness-spouse. This constitutes an overruling of Hawkins."
110212,102164,Funk v. United States (1933),Mentioned,"Indeed, it was not until 1933, in Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371, that this Court abolished the testimonial disqualification in the federal courts, so as to permit the spouse of a defendant to testify in the defendant’s behalf. Funk, however, left undisturbed the rule that either spouse could prevent the other from giving adverse testimony.","Funk is referenced for historical context regarding the evolution of spousal testimonial privileges, but its holding is not criticized, overruled, or otherwise materially altered."

United States, 340 U. S. 332 (1951). In neither case, however, did the Court adopt the Wigmore view that the communications privilege be substituted in place of the privilege against adverse spousal testimony. The privilege as to confidential marital communications is not at issue in the instant case; accordingly, our holding today does not disturb Wolfle and Blau.","Wolfle is referenced to clarify that the confidential marital communications privilege remains undisturbed by the present decision, indicating it is merely mentioned."

110063,94405,Geer v. Connecticut (1896),Overruled,"Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U. S. 519 (1896), on which the Court of Criminal Appeals relied, is overruled. In that circumstance, § 4-115 (B) cannot survive appellant’s Commerce Clause attack. ...

110063,100325,Lacoste v. Department of Conservation of Louisiana (1924),Distinguished,"The law challenged in Foster-Fountain Packing Co. was passed in July 1926. The state legislature may have been encouraged to take such action by certain language in Lacoste v. Louisiana Dept. of Conservation, 263 U. S. 545 (1924), language also relied on by the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals in this case. ... Nevertheless, Lacoste expressly declined to uphold the tax 'by virtue of the power of the State to prohibit, and therefore to condition, the removal of wild game from the State.' Ibid. Rather than reach this issue, the Court upheld the measure as a valid police regulation designed to conserve and protect wild animals, noting that the tax applied to all skins taken within the State, whether kept within the State or shipped out. Id., at 550-551. Thus, despite its citation of Geer, Lacoste is actually more compatible with the cases following the views of the Justices dissenting in Geer.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Lacoste by explaining that, although it cited Geer, it was actually decided on different grounds and is more compatible with later cases that rejected Geer's rationale."
110063,101328,Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel (1928),Distinguished,"Foster-Fountain Packing struck down the statute as economic protectionism abhorrent to the Commerce Clause. The analysis resembled that employed in the natural gas cases, which were cited with approval, id., at 10-11, 13. ... Geer was distinguished on the ground that there '[n]o part of the game was permitted by the statute to become an article of interstate commerce.' 278 U. S., at 12.","The Acting Decision discusses how Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel moved away from Geer's reasoning and distinguished Geer on specific grounds, using a different analytical approach."
110063,104652,"H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond (1949)",Mentioned,"See H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 533-534 (1949). The Commerce Clause has accordingly been interpreted by this Court not only as an authorization for congressional action, but also, even in the absence of a conflicting federal statute, as a restriction on permissible state regulation.","The Acting Decision references H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond to provide background on Commerce Clause jurisprudence, but does not analyze or alter its holding."
110063,97421,West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. (1911),Mentioned,"The erosion of Geer began only 15 years after it was decided. A Commerce Clause challenge was addressed to an Oklahoma statute designed to prohibit the transportation beyond the State of natural gas produced by wells within the State. West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911). ... In subsequent Commerce Clause challenges to state regulation of exports of natural resources, the West analysis emerged as the dominant approach.","The Acting Decision discusses West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. as part of the historical development of Commerce Clause doctrine, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
110063,108085,"Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. (1970)",Mentioned,"Today’s principle is that stated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970): 'Where the statute regulates evenhandedly to effectuate a legitimate local public interest, and its effects on interstate commerce are only incidental, it will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits. ...'","The Acting Decision quotes and applies the balancing test from Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc. as the controlling standard, but does not criticize or limit it."
110063,109662,"Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc. (1977)",Mentioned,"Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 (1977), dispelled any doubts on that score. In rejecting the argument that Virginia’s 'ownership' of fish swimming in its territorial waters empowered the State to forbid fishing by federally licensed ships owned by nonresidents while permitting residents to fish, Seacoast Products explicitly embraced the analysis of the Geer dissenters...","The Acting Decision references Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc. as part of the evolution away from Geer's rationale, but does not criticize or limit its holding."

New Jersey (1978),Mentioned,"This formulation was employed only last Term to strike down New Jersey’s attempt to 'conserve' the natural resource of landfill areas within the State for the disposal of waste generated within the State. Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617, 624 (1978).","The Acting Decision cites City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey as a recent application of the Commerce Clause balancing test, but does not criticize or limit its holding."

S. 385, 402 (1948), which struck down as violations of the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and *334 Immunities Clause certain South Carolina laws discriminating against out-of-state commercial fishermen: 'The whole ownership theory, in fact, is now generally regarded as but a fiction expressive in legal shorthand of the importance to its people that a State have power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of an important resource.'","The Acting Decision references Toomer v. Witsell as part of the doctrinal shift away from the state ownership theory, but does not criticize or limit its holding."
109895,109631,United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co. (1977),Mentioned,"Only last Term, this Court relied upon these precedents in United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., 430 U. S. 564 (1977), and held that the Government could not appeal the granting of a motion to acquit pursuant to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29 where a second trial would be required upon remand. The Court, quoting language in Ball, supra, at 671, stated: 'Perhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that [a] verdict of acquittal . . . could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.' 430 U. S., at 571.","The Acting Decision references Martin Linen as precedent for the rule that acquittals cannot be appealed if a new trial would be required, but does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its holding. It is used as supporting authority and not distinguished or limited."
109895,109688,Lee v. United States (1977),Distinguished,"However, only last Term, in Lee, supra, the Government was permitted to institute a second prosecution after a midtrial dismissal of an indictment. The Court found the circumstances presented by that case 'functionally indistinguishable from a declaration of mistrial.' 432 U. S., at 31. Thus, Lee demonstrated that, at least in some cases, the dismissal of an indictment may be treated on the same basis as the declaration of a mistrial.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Lee by explaining that Lee involved circumstances similar to a mistrial, whereas the present case involves a midtrial dismissal on the defendant's motion for reasons unrelated to guilt or innocence. The distinction is drawn to clarify why the rule in Lee does not control the outcome here."
109895,109200,United States v. Wilson (1975),Mentioned,"In our first encounter with the new statute, we concluded that 'Congress intended to remove all statutory, barriers to Government appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit.' United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 337 (1975).","Wilson is cited for its interpretation of the statutory framework for government appeals, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its holding. It is used as background authority."
109895,109201,United States v. Jenkins (1975),Overruled,"We have therefore decided to overrule Jenkins, and thus to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case... Accordingly, the contrary holding of United States v. Jenkins is overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Jenkins is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value."
109895,105594,Green v. United States (1957),Mentioned,"As this Court has described the purpose underlying the prohibition against double jeopardy: 'The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.' Green, supra, at 187-188.","Green is quoted for its articulation of the policy behind the Double Jeopardy Clause, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its holding. It is used as supporting authority."

109895,109773,Arizona v. Washington (1978),Mentioned,"In our recent decision in Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 (1978), we reviewed this Court’s attempts to give content to the term 'manifest necessity.' That case, like Doumum, supra, 8, arose from a motion of the prosecution for a mistrial, and we noted that the trial court’s discretion must be exercised with a, careful regard for the interests first described in United States v. Perez. Arizona v. Washington, supra, at 514-516.","Arizona v. Washington is cited for its discussion of 'manifest necessity' in mistrial situations, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its holding."
109895,96129,Kepner v. United States (1904),Mentioned,"Because of the statutory restrictions upon Government appeals in criminal cases, this Court in the years after Ball was faced with that question only in unusual circumstances, such as were present in Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100 (1904).","Kepner is referenced as historical precedent for double jeopardy principles, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its holding."
109895,109204,Serfass v. United States (1975),Mentioned,"Since up to that point Government appeals had been subject to statutory restrictions independent of the Double Jeopardy Clause, our previous cases construing the statute proved to be of little assistance in determining when the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment would *86 prohibit further prosecution. A detailed canvass of the history of the double jeopardy principles in English and American law led us to conclude that the Double Jeopardy Clause was primarily 'directed at the threat of multiple prosecutions,' and posed no bar to Government appeals 'where those appeals would not require a new trial.' Id., at 342.","Serfass is cited for its analysis of the Double Jeopardy Clause and government appeals, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its holding."
109895,108233,United States v. Jorn (1971),Mentioned,"Such a motion ,by the defendant is deemed to be a deliberate election on his part to forgo his valued right to have his guilt or innocence determined before the first trier of fact. 'The important considera *94 tion, for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause, is that the defendant retain primary control over the course to be followed in the event of such error.' United States v. Dinitz, 424 U. S. 600, 609 (1976). But '[t]he Double Jeopardy Clause does protect a defendant against governmental actions intended to provoke mistrial requests and thereby to subject defendants to the substantial burdens imposed by multiple prosecutions.' Id., at 611.","Jorn is cited for its discussion of the defendant's control over mistrial motions and double jeopardy, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its holding."

S. 141 (1962), this Court reviewed the issuance of a writ of mandamus by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit instructing a District Court to vacate certain judgments of acquittal. Although indicating its agreement with the Court of Appeals that the judgments had been entered erroneously, this Court nonetheless held that a second trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Id., at 143.","Fong Foo is referenced as precedent for the rule that acquittals, even if erroneous, bar retrial, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its holding."
109881,106170,Monroe v. Pape (1961),Overruled,"That other day has come and we now overrule Monroe v. Pape, supra, insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under § 1983.","The Acting Decision expressly states that it is overruling Monroe v. Pape to the extent that it held local governments are immune from suit under § 1983, thus directly nullifying a key holding of Monroe."
109881,86231,Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842),Mentioned,"Of legislation mentioned by Shellabarger, the closest analog of the Sherman amendment, ironically, was the statute implementing the fugitives from justice and fugitive slave provisions of Art. IV — the Act of Feb. 12, 1793, 1 Stat. 302 — the constitutionality of which had been sustained in 1842, in Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539.","Prigg v. Pennsylvania is referenced as historical context for constitutional arguments about federal power, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes, overrules, nor distinguishes it."

C. § 1988 cannot be used to create a federal cause of action where § 1983 does not otherwise provide one...","The Acting Decision explicitly states that its holding does not affect the conclusion in Moor regarding the use of § 1988, thereby limiting Moor's scope but not overruling or criticizing it."

Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871)] that there is no power in the Government of the United States, under its authority to tax, to tax the salary of a State officer.","Collector v. Day is cited as an example of then-recent Supreme Court doctrine on federalism, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or distinguish it."

And although in many of these cases jurisdiction was not questioned, we ought not 'disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years.' ... especially as Monroe’s, immunizing principle was extended to suits for injunctive relief in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507 (1973). ... Nothing we say today affects the conclusion reached in ... City of Kenosha, see 412 U. S., at 513, that nothing . . . suggest [s] that the generic word person’ in § 1983 was intended to have a bifurcated application to municipal corporations depending on the nature of the relief sought against them.","The Acting Decision notes that its holding does not disturb the specific conclusion in City of Kenosha regarding the application of 'person' in § 1983, thus limiting its own impact on that precedent."

Indeed, a Circuit Judge, writing in 1873 in what is apparently the first reported case under § 1, read the Dictionary Act in precisely this way in a case involving a corporate plaintiff and a municipal defendant. ... There is certainly no constitutional impediment to municipal liability.

Our affirmance indicates only our agreement with the result reached by the District Court. Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U. S. 490, 499 (1981). That result is not necessarily inconsistent with the Nebraska Supreme Court’s holding in this case. For Texas law differs significantly from Nebraska law regarding the rights of a surface owner to ground water that he has withdrawn.","The Acting Decision distinguishes City of Altus, Oklahoma v.

S. 229 (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State, 8 and Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, 262 U. S. 553 (1923), which invalidated a West Virginia statute *948 that accorded a preference to the citizens of that State in the purchase of natural gas produced therein.","The Acting Decision references West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. as background for the arguments in City of Altus, but does not analyze, criticize, or otherwise materially engage with its reasoning, so the treatment is 'Mentioned.'"

110719,110119,Arkansas v. Sanders,Limited,"Nevertheless, the doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude this action. Although we have rejected some of the reasoning in Sanders, we adhere to our holding in that case; although we reject the precise holding in Robbins, there was no Court opinion supporting a single rationale for its judgment, and the reasoning we adopt today was not presented by the parties in that case.","The Acting Decision expressly states that it rejects some of the reasoning in Sanders but adheres to its holding, thereby narrowing the scope and precedential value of Sanders without overruling it."
110719,100567,Carroll v. United States,Mentioned,"In Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, the Court held that a warrantless search of an automobile stopped by police officers who had probable cause to believe the vehicle contained contraband was not unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.","Carroll is repeatedly cited as foundational precedent and its rule is reaffirmed and applied, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or overrule it."
110719,109714,United States v. Chadwick,Distinguished,"That argument, however, was squarely rejected in United States v. Chadwick, 433 U. S. 1... In sum, the Court in Chadwick declined to extend the rationale of the 'automobile exception' to permit a warrantless search of any movable container found in a public place... In neither Chadwick nor Sanders did the police have probable cause to search the vehicle or anything within it except the footlocker in the former case and the green suitcase in the latter.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Chadwick on its facts, noting that in Chadwick, probable cause was directed at a specific container, not the entire vehicle, unlike the present case."
110719,110558,Robbins v. California,Overruled,"Our decision today is inconsistent with the disposition in Robbins v. California and with the portion of the opinion in Arkansas v.

111103,102987,Helvering v. Mitchell (1938),Mentioned,"In Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391 (1938), the Court considered the preclusive effect of a prior criminal acquittal on a subsequent action for a monetary penalty... The Mitchell Court viewed the criminal acquittal as nothing more than a determination that the evidence in the criminal setting was not sufficient to overcome all reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.","The Acting Decision discusses and applies the reasoning from Helvering v. Mitchell, using it as a controlling precedent to support its holding, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
111103,110331,United States v. Ward (1980),Mentioned,"As the Court noted in United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980): 'Our inquiry in this regard has traditionally proceeded on two levels.

111218,104463,United States v. Yellow Cab Co. (1947),Overruled,"The problem began with United States v. Yellow Cab Co., 332 U. S. 218 (1947)... It is the underscored language that later breathed life into the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine. The passage as a whole, however, more accurately stands for a quite different proposition... In Yellow Cab, the affiliation of the defendants was irrelevant because the original acquisitions were themselves illegal... To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly reinterprets and overrules Yellow Cab to the extent it supported the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, stating that such prior decisions are 'disapproved and overruled.'"
111218,104915,Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States (1951),Overruled,"Later cases invoking the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine do little more than cite Yellow Cab or Kiefer-Stewart, and in none of the cases was the doctrine necessary to the result reached. Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 593 (1951)... To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.",The Acting Decision discusses Timken as an example of the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine and explicitly overrules prior decisions supporting that doctrine.
111218,104839,"Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. (1951)",Overruled,"The ambiguity of the Yellow Cab holding yielded the one case giving support to the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine. 8 In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 340 U. S. 211 (1951)... To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.",The Acting Decision identifies Kiefer-Stewart as a key support for the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine and expressly overrules it to the extent it is contrary to the new rule.
111218,107732,"Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp. (1968)",Overruled,"The same is true of Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U. S. 134 (1968)... To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.","Perma Life Mufflers is discussed as an example of the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, and the Acting Decision overrules it to the extent it conflicts with the new holding."
111218,102041,"Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States (1933)",Distinguished,"The Court’s opinion relies on Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States, 288 U. S. 344 (1933); however, examination of that case reveals that it gives very little support for the broad doctrine Yellow Cab has been thought to announce. On the contrary, the language of Chief Justice Hughes speaking for the Court in Appalachian Coals supports a contrary conclusion.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Appalachian Coals, stating that it does not support the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine and is not contrary to the new rule."
111218,104037,United States v. Crescent Amusement Co. (1944),Distinguished,"The Crescent Amusement Court, however, in affirming an order of divestiture, noted that such a remedy was appropriate when 'creation of the combination is itself the violation.' Id., at 189. This suggests that both Crescent Amusement and Yellow Cab... stand for a narrow rule based on the original illegality of the affiliation.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Crescent Amusement, limiting its holding to cases involving illegal acquisitions, not to the broader intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine."
111218,1292673,United States v. American Tobacco Co. (1911),Distinguished,"Although the Court in the latter case suggested that the contracts between affiliated companies, and not merely the original combination, could be viewed as the conspiracy, id., at 184 , the Court left no doubt that 'the combination in and of itself' was a restraint of trade and a monopolization, id., at 187.","The Acting Decision distinguishes American Tobacco, clarifying that its holding was based on the illegality of the original combination, not on post-acquisition conduct between parent and subsidiary."
111218,106009,"United States v. Parke, Davis & Co. (1960)",Mentioned,"A § 1 agreement may be found when 'the conspirators had a unity of purpose or a common design and understanding, or a meeting of minds in an unlawful arrangement.' American Tobacco Co. v. United States, 328 U. S. 781, 810 (1946). But in reality a parent and a wholly owned subsidiary always have a 'unity of purpose or a common design.' ... See Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U. S. 145, 149 (1968); accord, Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Corp., supra, at 761.","Parke, Davis & Co. is cited in passing for a general proposition about § 1 of the Sherman Act, without significant discussion or alteration of its precedential value."

We granted certiorari to reexamine the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, 462 U. S. 1131 (1983), and we reverse.",The Acting Decision directly reverses the judgment of the cited Court of Appeals decision.
111404,91894,Ex Parte Bain (1887),Limited,"To the extent Bain stands for the proposition that it constitutes an unconstitutional amendment to drop from an indictment those allegations that are unnecessary to an offense that is clearly contained within it, that case has simply not survived. To avoid further confusion, we now explicitly reject that proposition. Rejecting this aspect of Bain is hardly a radical step, however, given that in the years since Bain this Court has largely ignored this element of the case. Moreover, in rejecting this proposition’s continued validity, we do not limit Bain’s more general proposition concerning the impermissibility of actual additions to the offenses alleged in an indictment, a proposition we have repeatedly reaffirmed.","The Acting Decision explicitly rejects the specific aspect of Bain that would invalidate an indictment when unnecessary allegations are dropped, but preserves its broader rule against adding new offenses. This constitutes a limitation of Bain."
111404,105978,Stirone v. United States (1960),Distinguished,"The Court of Appeals principally relied on this Court’s decision in Stirone v. United States, 361 U. S. 212 (1960), to support its conclusion that the Fifth Amendment’s grand jury right is violated by a conviction for a criminal plan narrower than, but fully included within, the plan set forth in the indictment. Stirone, however, stands for a very different proposition. In Stirone the offense proved at trial was not fully contained in the indictment, for trial evidence had 'amended' the indictment by broadening the possible bases for conviction from that which appeared in the indictment. Stirone was thus wholly unlike the cases discussed in Part II, supra, and unlike respondent’s case, all of which involve trial evidence that narrowed the indictment’s charges without adding any new offenses.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Stirone by explaining that Stirone involved a broadening of the indictment, whereas the present case involved only a narrowing, making the situations materially different."
111404,423986,United States v. James Rual Miller (1983),Reversed,"The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and vacated the judgment of conviction. ... We granted certiorari, 469 U.

111404,100951,Salinger v. United States (1926),Mentioned,"In Salinger v. United States, supra, for example, the Court was presented with facts quite similar to the instant case. ... This Court unanimously rejected Salinger’s argument on the ground that the offense proved was fully contained within the indictment.","Salinger is discussed as a supporting precedent for the Acting Decision’s reasoning, but its holding is neither changed nor criticized."
110563,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady",Mentioned,"As an alternative basis for its resolution of the Commerce Clause issue, the Montana court held, as a matter of law, that the tax survives scrutiny under the four-part test articulated by this Court in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977). ... We agree with appellants that the Montana tax must be evaluated under Complete Auto Transit’s four-part test. Under that test, a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it 'is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.' 430 U. S., at 279.","The Acting Decision applies the four-part test from Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady as the controlling standard for Commerce Clause analysis of state taxes, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority. It is treated as binding precedent and its test is applied."
110563,109835,Department of Revenue v. Ass'n of Washington Stevedoring Companies,Mentioned,"Correspondingly, the Court has rejected the notion that state taxes levied on interstate commerce are per se invalid. See, e. g., Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., 435 U. S. 734 (1978); Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra. ... See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 276-281 (1978); Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., supra, at 743-751; Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra, at 277-279.","The Acting Decision references this case as part of the evolution of Commerce Clause doctrine and as support for its analysis, but does not criticize, distinguish, or limit it. It is cited for its principles and applied as precedent."
110563,877181,Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State,Affirmed,"Without receiving any evidence, the court upheld the tax and dismissed the complaints. On appeal, the Montana Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. -Mont.-, 615 P. 2d 847 (1980). ... We now affirm.","The Acting Decision is a review of the Montana Supreme Court's decision in Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State and explicitly affirms its judgment, upholding the lower court's decision."

Richmond, 327 U. S. 416, 423-424 (1946). ... As the Court explained in Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., supra, at 446 (emphasis added), 'the incidence of the tax as well as its measure [must be] tied to the earnings which the State . .. has made possible, insofar as government is the prerequisite for the fruits of civilization for which, as Mr. Justice Holmes was fond of saying, we pay taxes.' ... Cf. Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S., at 427.","Nippert v. City of Richmond is cited for general principles regarding Commerce Clause analysis and the relationship between state taxes and interstate commerce. The Acting Decision neither criticizes nor distinguishes it, but uses it to support its reasoning."
110563,110488,Maryland v. Louisiana,Mentioned,"We are not, therefore, confronted here with the type of differential tax treatment of interstate and intrastate commerce that the Court has found in other 'discrimination' cases. See, e. g., Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S. 725 (1981); Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Comm’n, 429 U. S. 318 (1977); cf. Lewis v. BT Investment Managers, Inc., 447 U. S. 27 (1980); Philadelphia v. New Jersey, 437 U. S. 617 (1978). ... Furthermore, there can be no question that Montana may constitutionally raise general revenue by imposing a severance tax on coal mined in the State. The entire value of the coal, before transportation, originates in the State, and mining of the coal depletes the resource base and wealth of the State, thereby diminishing a future source of taxes and economic activity. 13 Cf. Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U. S., at 758-759.","Maryland v. Louisiana is cited as an example of a discrimination case and for comparison, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, distinguish, or limit its holding. It is used illustratively."
110563,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,Mentioned,"As the Court has stated, ' '[e]ven interstate business must pay its way.' ' Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250, 254 (1938), quoting Postal Telegraph-Cable *617 Co. v. Richmond, 249 U. S. 252, 259 (1919). ... The 'just share of state tax burden' includes sharing in the cost of providing 'police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and The advantages of a civilized society.’.' Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S. 207, 228 (1980), quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S. 434, 445 (1979). See Washington Revenue Dept. v.

S. 436, 440-441 (1964). Furthermore, there can be no question that Montana may constitutionally raise general revenue by imposing a severance tax on coal mined in the State. ... the taxpayer is shouldering its fair share of supporting the State’s provision of 'police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and the advantages of a civilized society.’ ' Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U. S., at 228, quoting Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U. S., at 445.",Western Live Stock v.

110563,106846,General Motors Corp. v. Washington,Mentioned,"As we explained in General Motors Corp. v. Washington, supra, at 440-441: '[T]he validity of the tax rests upon whether the State is exacting a constitutionally fair demand for that aspect of interstate commerce to which it bears a special relation. For our purposes, the decisive issue turns on the operating incidence of the tax. In other words, the question is whether the State has exerted its power in proper proportion to appellant’s activities within the State and to appellant’s consequent enjoyment of the opportunities and protections which the State has afforded. ...'","General Motors Corp. v. Washington is quoted and its reasoning is adopted as part of the analysis for determining the validity of the Montana tax. The Acting Decision does not criticize, distinguish, or limit it."

Paul Gray, Inc.",Mentioned,"In reviewing appellants’ contentions, we put to one side those cases in which the Court reviewed challenges to 'user' fees or 'taxes' that were designed and defended as a specific charge imposed by the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportation or other facilities and services. See, e. g., Evans *622 ville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972); Clark v. Paul Cray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939); Ingels v. Morf, 300 U. S. 290 (1937).","Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc. is cited as an example of a 'user fee' case, which the Acting Decision distinguishes from the general revenue tax at issue, but it does not criticize or limit the authority of Clark. The reference is descriptive and not critical."
110563,100063,Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co.,Criticized,We agree that Heisler’s reasoning has been undermined by more recent cases. The Heisler analysis evolved at a time when the Commerce Clause was thought to prohibit the States from imposing any direct taxes on interstate commerce. ... We therefore hold that a state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce. Any contrary statements in Heisler and its progeny are disapproved.,"The Acting Decision expressly states that the reasoning of Heisler has been undermined and disapproves any contrary statements, indicating criticism and a departure from its approach, though not a formal overruling."
110563,105195,Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert,Mentioned,"See, e. g., Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157 (1954); ... Correspondingly, when the measure of a tax bears no relationship to the taxpayers’ presence or activities in a State, a court may properly conclude under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test that the State is imposing an undue burden on interstate commerce. See Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S., at 427 ; cf. Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert, 347 U. S. 157 (1954).","Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v.

Morf,Mentioned,"In reviewing appellants’ contentions, we put to one side those cases in which the Court reviewed challenges to 'user' fees or 'taxes' that were designed and defended as a specific charge imposed by the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportation or other facilities and services.

111308,110881,Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Wyoming,Mentioned,"It is equally true, however, that the text of the Constitution provides the beginning rather than the final answer to every inquiry into questions of federalism, for '[bjehind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control.' Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 322 (1934). National League of Cities reflected the general conviction that the Constitution precludes 'the National Government [from] devouring] the essentials of state sovereignty.' Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 205 (dissenting opinion). ... The States unquestionably do 'retai[n] a significant measure of sovereign authority.' EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S., at 269 (Powell, J., dissenting). They do so, however, only to the extent that the Constitution has not divested them of their original powers and transferred those powers to the Federal Government.","EEOC v. Wyoming is cited as an example and for a quotation, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or distinguish it; it is simply referenced for context."
111308,110516,"Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc.",Mentioned,"The prerequisites for governmental immunity under National League of Cities were summarized by this Court in Hodel, supra.

111308,110673,United Transportation Union v. Long Island Rail Road,Mentioned,"During the pendency of those appeals, Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678 (1982), was decided. In that case, the Court ruled that commuter rail service provided by the state-owned Long Island Rail Road did not constitute a 'traditional governmental function' and hence did not enjoy constitutional immunity, under National League of Cities, from the requirements of the Railway Labor Act.","Long Island Rail Road is discussed as an application of the National League of Cities doctrine, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or distinguish it; it is referenced for its factual and doctrinal context."

Brush v. Commissioner, 300 U. S., at 365. ... That distinction was abandoned in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), unanimously to conclude that the distinction between 'governmental' and 'proprietary' functions was 'untenable' and must be abandoned.

Powers, 293 U. S. 214 (1934). Justice Black, in Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 427 (1938), was moved to observe: 'An implied constitutional distinction which taxes income of an officer of a state-operated transportation system and exempts income of the manager of a municipal water works system manifests the uncertainty created by the “essential” and “non-essential” test' (concurring opinion).",Helvering v.

111940,89308,Board of Liquidation v. McComb (1876),Mentioned,"Within 15 years of the decision in Dennison it was said that 'when a plain official duty, requiring no exercise of discretion, is to be performed, and performance is refused, any person who will sustain personal injury by such refusal may have a mandamus to compel its performance,' and it was no objection that such an order might be sought in the federal courts against a state officer.

112276,107978,North Carolina v. Pearce (1969),Limited,"While the Pearce opinion appeared on its face to announce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent cases have made clear that its presumption of vindictiveness 'do[es] not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.' ... we have limited its application, like that of 'other ‘judicially created means of effectuating the rights secured by the [Constitution],’' to circumstances 'where its ‘objectives are thought most efficaciously served,’' Texas v. McCullough, supra, at 138...","The Acting Decision discusses Pearce at length and expressly narrows its application, stating that the presumption of vindictiveness does not apply in all cases and is limited to certain circumstances."
112276,108569,Colten v. Kentucky (1972),Distinguished,"In Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104 (1972), for example, we refused to apply the presumption when the increased sentence was imposed by the second court in a two-tiered system ... Each of these factors distinguishes the present case, and others like it, from cases like Pearce.","The Acting Decision uses Colten as an example of a situation where the presumption of vindictiveness does not apply, distinguishing its facts and reasoning from those in Pearce and the present case."
112276,111602,Texas v. McCullough (1986),Mentioned,"As we explained in Texas v. McCullough, 'the evil the [Pearce] Court sought to prevent' was not the imposition of 'enlarged sentences after a new trial' but 'vindictiveness of a sentencing judge.'

Goodwin (1982),Mentioned,"Because the Pearce presumption 'may operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus . . . block a legitimate response to criminal conduct,' United States v. Goodwin, supra, at 373, we have limited its application ... Such circumstances are those in which there is a 'reasonable likelihood,' United States v. Goodwin, supra, at 373, that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.","United States v. Goodwin is referenced to support the standard for when the presumption of vindictiveness applies, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or distinguish it; it is simply cited for authority."
111555,110478,Parratt v. Taylor (1981),Overruled,"Upon reflection, we agree and overrule Parratt to the extent that it states that mere lack of due care by a state *331 official may 'deprive' an individual of life, liberty, or property under the Fourteenth Amendment.",The Acting Decision expressly overrules Parratt v. Taylor to the extent that it held negligent acts by state officials could constitute a deprivation under the Due Process Clause.
111555,111252,Hudson v. Palmer (1984),Mentioned,"because respondent maintains that he is entitled to the defense of sovereign immunity in a state tort suit, petitioner is without an 'adequate' state remedy, cf. Hudson v.

111555,87021,South v. Maryland Ex Rel. Pottle (1856),Distinguished,"We read South v. Maryland, supra, an action brought under federal diversity jurisdiction on a Maryland sheriff’s bond, as stating no more than what this Court thought to be the principles of common law and Maryland law applicable to that case; it is not cast at all in terms of constitutional law, and indeed could not have been, since at the time it was rendered there was no due process clause applicable to the States.","The Acting Decision distinguishes South v. Maryland by clarifying it was based on common law, not constitutional law, and thus not controlling for the constitutional question at issue."
111555,106170,Monroe v. Pape (1961),Mentioned,"As explained in Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.

111555,110169,Martinez v. California (1980),Mentioned,"In Martinez v. California, 444 U. S. 277 (1980), we held that California’s immunity statute did not violate the Due Process Clause simply because it operated to defeat a tort claim arising under state law.","Martinez v. California is cited as precedent for the proposition that state immunity statutes do not necessarily violate due process, but its holding is not questioned or altered."
112258,109016,Procunier v. Martinez (1974),Limited,"Furthermore, we acknowledge today that the logic of our analyses in Martinez and Turner requires that Martinez be limited to regulations concerning outgoing correspondence. As we have observed, outgoing correspondence was the central focus of our opinion in Martinez. ... To the extent that Martinez itself suggests such a distinction, we today overrule that case; the Court accomplished much of this step when it decided Turner. In so doing, we recognize that it might have been possible to apply a reasonableness standard to all incoming materials without overruling Martinez: we instead could have made clear that Martinez does not uniformly require the application of a 'least restrictive alternative' analysis. We choose not to go that route, however, for we prefer the express flexibility of the Turner reasonableness standard.","The Acting Decision expressly limits the precedential scope of Procunier v. Martinez to outgoing correspondence, declining to apply its standard to incoming publications and adopting a different standard for the latter. This is a clear narrowing of Martinez's applicability."
112258,111904,Turner v. Safley (1987),Mentioned,"We now hold that the District Court correctly anticipated that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the regulations are 'reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,' Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987), and we conclude that under this standard the regulations are facially valid.","Turner v.

Edwin Meese, Iii, Attorney General of the United States (1987)",Reversed,"We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals on the issue of facial validity, but we agree with that court’s remand of the case to the District Court for a determination of the validity of the regulations as applied to each of the 46 publications. ... The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.","The Acting Decision vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals in Abbott v. Meese (the cited case), disagreeing with its application of the Martinez standard and reversing its facial invalidation of the regulations."

112301,111683,Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority,Mentioned,"On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court upheld the statute as modified by the legislature and construed in the Department of Liquor Control’s declaratory ruling, resting its decision on Seagram, supra, and distinguishing this Court’s subsequent decision in Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573 (1986), which struck down a statute analogous to Connecticut’s 1981 beer-affirmation statute. ... Furthermore, relying on Brown-Forman, supra, the court rejected appellants’ argument that the statute was a proper exercise of its regulatory authority under the Twenty-first Amendment. 849 F. 2d, at 761.","Brown-Forman is discussed at length and its principles are applied to the Connecticut statute, but the Acting Decision does not overrule, criticize, or distinguish it; rather, it relies on and reaffirms its holding.

The Court in Seelig struck down a New York statute that set minimum prices for milk purchased from producers in New York and other States and banned the resale within New York of milk that had been purchased for a lower price. ... Writing for the Court, Justice Cardozo pronounced that the Commerce Clause does not permit a State 'to establish a wage scale or a scale of prices for use *333 in other states, and to bar the sale of the products . . . unless the scale has been observed.' Id., at 528.","Baldwin is cited as foundational precedent and its principles are applied, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes, limits, nor distinguishes it. It is used as background authority, so the treatment is 'Mentioned'."
112301,110758,Edgar v. Mite Corp.,Mentioned,"The Brown-Forman Court cited a third extraterritorial decision, Edgar v. MITE Carp., 457 U. S. 624 (1982), which, though not discussed at length there, significantly illuminates the contours of the constitutional prohibition on extraterritorial legislation. In MITE Corp., the Court struck down the Illinois Business Takeover Act, which required that a takeover offer for a target company having a specified connection to Illinois be registered with the Secretary of State and mandated that such an offer was not to become effective for 20 days, during which time the offer would be subject to administrative evaluation. ... Under the Commerce Clause the projection of these extrater *334 ritorial ‘“practical effeet[s],’” regardless of the statute’s intention, “‘ex-ceedfed] the inherent limits of the State’s power.’ ” Id., at 642-643 , quoting Shaffer v.

See 849 F. 2d, at 759. ... More generally, the end result of the Connecticut statute’s incorporation of out-of-state prices, as the Court of Appeals concluded, is that '[a] brewer can . . . undertake competitive pricing based on the market realities of either Massachusetts or Connecticut, but not both, because the Connecticut statute ties pricing to the regulatory schemes of the border states.' 849 F. 2d, at 759.","The Acting Decision references the Second Circuit's analysis and conclusions in this case as part of its reasoning, but does not criticize, overrule, or distinguish it.

112301,2370562,United States Brewers Ass'n v. Healy (1987),Mentioned,"In the wake of the 1984 amendments, appellees (a brewers’ trade association and major producers and importers of beer) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and claiming that the effect of the amended law was not different from that of the law struck down in Healy I 8 See United States Brewers Assn. v. Healy, 669 F. Supp. 543, 544-545 (1987). ... On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court upheld the statute as modified by the legislature and construed in the Department of Liquor Control’s declaratory ruling, resting its decision on Seagram, supra, and distinguishing this Court’s subsequent decision in Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority, 476 U. S. 573 (1986), which struck down a statute analogous to Connecticut’s 1981 beer-affirmation statute. The District Court found the 1984 Connecticut law constitutional on its face because, 'unlike the version in Healy I and Brown-Forman,' the 1984 law 'leaves brewers free to raise or lower prices in the border states before and after posting in Connecticut and does not, therefore, regulate interstate commerce.' 669 F. Supp., at 553.","The Acting Decision describes the District Court's reasoning and outcome but does not criticize, overrule, or distinguish it; it is referenced as part of the procedural history.

112471,100734,Beazell v. Ohio (1925),Mentioned,"So well accepted were these principles that the Court in Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925), was able to confidently summarize the meaning of the Clause as follows: 'It is settled, by decisions of this Court so well known that their citation may be dispensed with, that any statute which punishes as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; which makes more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission, or which deprives one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed, is prohibited as ex post facto.'

State (1983),Limited,"In Bogany, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a jury verdict which included a punishment unauthorized by law was void at its inception and had to be set aside. It concluded that Texas law at that time did not give appellate courts authority to reform such verdicts... a new Texas statute designed to modify the Bogany decision became effective. Article 37.10(b), as of June 11, 1985, allows an appellate court to reform an improper verdict that assesses a punishment not authorized by law.","The Acting Decision describes how the Texas Legislature enacted a statute to modify the rule established in Bogany, thereby narrowing its applicability and limiting its precedential effect."

112609,88300,Insurance Co. v. Dunham (1871),Mentioned,"In Insurance Co. v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1, 24 (1871)... the Court explained that, in determining whether a contract falls within admiralty, 'the true criterion is the nature and subject-matter of the contract, as whether it was a maritime contract, having reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.' Id., at 26.","The Acting Decision references Dunham as authority for the modern approach to admiralty jurisdiction, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
112609,105375,Archawski v. Hanioti (1956),Mentioned,"In Archawski, supra, the Court held that an action cognizable as assumpsit would no longer be automatically excluded from admiralty.

Maynard, nullifying its precedential value regarding the exclusion of agency contracts from admiralty jurisdiction."
112608,110719,United States v. Ross,Mentioned,"In United States v. Ross, 456 U. S. 798 , decided in 1982, we held that a warrantless search of an automobile under the Carroll doctrine could include a search of a container or package found inside the car when such a search was supported by probable cause. ... We decided that the search of Ross’ car was not unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment: 'The scope of a warrantless search based on probable cause is no narrower — and no broader — than the scope of a search authorized by a warrant supported by probable cause.' Id., at 823.","The Acting Decision discusses Ross extensively, clarifies its holding, and reaffirms its principles, but does not overrule, criticize, or limit it. Instead, Ross is used as the foundation for the new rule."
112608,109714,United States v. Chadwick,Overruled,"In light of the minimal protection to privacy afforded by the Chadwick-Sanders rule, and our serious doubt whether that rule substantially serves privacy interests, we now hold that the Fourth Amendment does not compel separate treatment for an automobile search that extends only to a container within the vehicle.","The Acting Decision expressly rejects and replaces the rule established in Chadwick, thereby overruling it."
112608,110119,Arkansas v. Sanders,Overruled,We conclude that it is better to adopt one clear-cut rule to govern automobile searches and eliminate the warrant requirement for closed containers set forth in Sanders.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that it is eliminating the rule set forth in Sanders, thus overruling it."
112608,111305,United States v. Johns,Distinguished,"In United States v. Johns, 469 U. S. 478 (1985), ... We rejected that argument and found Chadwick and Sanders inapposite because the agents had probable cause to search the entire body of each truck, although they had chosen not to do so.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Johns from the present case, explaining why the Chadwick and Sanders rules did not apply in Johns."
112608,100567,Carroll v. United States,Mentioned,"In Carroll , this Court established an exception to the warrant requirement for moving vehicles, for it recognized 'a necessary difference between a search of a store, dwelling house or other structure ... and a search of a ship, motor boat, wagon or automobile, for contraband goods, where it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.' 267 U. S., at 153.","The Acting Decision discusses Carroll as the origin of the automobile exception and reaffirms its principles, but does not alter or criticize it."
112608,104504,Johnson v. United States,Mentioned,"In his opinion for the Court in Johnson v. United States, id., at 13-14, Justice Jackson explained: 'The point of the Fourth Amendment, which often is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.'","Johnson is quoted for its general Fourth Amendment principles, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
112608,108184,Chambers v. Maroney,Mentioned,"The Court refined the exigency requirement in Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 (1970), when it held that the existence of exigent circumstances was to be determined at the time the automobile is seized.","Chambers is cited as part of the historical development of the automobile exception, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or overrule it."
112608,110979,United States v. Place,Distinguished,"The first case cited by the dissent, United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983), however, did not involve an automobile at all. We considered in Place the temporary detention of luggage in an airport. Not only was no automobile involved, but the defendant, Place, was waiting at the airport to board his plane rather than preparing to leave the airport in a car. Any similarity to Sanders, in which the defendant was leaving the airport in a car, is remote at best. Place had nothing to do with the automobile exception and is inapposite.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Place is inapposite and does not apply to the automobile exception, thus distinguishing it."
112608,110558,Robbins v. California,Mentioned,"We have noted the virtue of providing '""clear and unequivocal"" guidelines to the law enforcement profession.' Minnick v. Mississippi, 498 U. S. 146, 151 (1990), quoting Arizona v. Roberson, 486 U. S. 676, 682 (1988). ... See also Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420, 425-426 (1981) (listing cases decided by Federal Courts of Appeals since Chadwick had been announced).","Robbins is mentioned in passing as part of a list of cases and for its discussion of confusion in the law, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its holding."
112640,111020,Michigan v. Long,Distinguished,"In Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032 (1983), we provided a partial solution to this problem in the form of a conclusive presumption... After Long, a state court that wishes to look to federal law for guidance or as an alternative holding while still relying on an independent and adequate state ground can avoid the presumption by stating 'clearly and expressly that [its decision] is ... based on bona fide separate, adequate, and independent grounds.' ... Long and Caldwell were direct review cases. We first considered the problem of ambiguous state court decisions in the application of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in a federal habeas case in Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255 (1989).","The Acting Decision discusses Long as establishing a presumption for direct review cases, but distinguishes its application in the federal habeas context, limiting its reach and clarifying that the presumption does not apply as broadly as in Long."
112640,112205,Harris v. Reed,Limited,Coleman contends that the presumption of Long and Harris applies in this case and precludes a bar to habeas because the Virginia Supreme Court’s order dismissing Coleman’s appeal did not 'clearly and expressly' state that it was based on state procedural grounds. Coleman reads Harris too broadly... We decline to so expand the Harris presumption.,"The Acting Decision expressly limits the scope of Harris, rejecting the broader reading urged by Coleman and clarifying that the Harris presumption does not apply in all cases where federal claims are presented to state courts."
112640,109717,Wainwright v. Sykes,Mentioned,"See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 81, 87 (1977); Ulster County Court v. Allen, 442 U. S. 140, 148 (1979). See generally Harris, supra, at 262.","The Acting Decision references Wainwright v. Sykes as precedent for the independent and adequate state ground doctrine, but does not alter, criticize, or otherwise significantly engage with its reasoning."
112640,106548,Fay v. Noia,Overruled,"Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963), overruled this holding... We now make it explicit: In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice. Fay was based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules. The several cases after Fay that applied the cause and prejudice standard to a variety of state procedural defaults represent a different view.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Fay v. Noia, replacing its standard with the cause and prejudice standard for federal habeas review."
112640,105074,Brown v. Allen,Mentioned,"In Daniels v. Allen, the companion case to Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S. 443 (1953), we confronted a situation nearly identical to that here.","Brown v. Allen is mentioned as context for Daniels v. Allen, but the Acting Decision does not alter, criticize, or otherwise significantly engage with its reasoning."
112640,110692,Engle v. Isaac,Mentioned,"Our cases since Sykes have been unanimous in applying the cause and prejudice standard. Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107 (1982), held that the standard applies even in cases in which the alleged constitutional error impaired the truthfinding function of the trial.","The Acting Decision cites Engle v. Isaac as supporting authority for the cause and prejudice standard, but does not alter or criticize its holding."
112640,111880,Pennsylvania v. Finley,Mentioned,"There is no constitutional right to an attorney in state post-conviction proceedings. Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551 (1987); Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U. S. 1 (1989) (applying the rule to capital cases).","The Acting Decision references Pennsylvania v. Finley as authority for the proposition that there is no constitutional right to counsel in state post-conviction proceedings, but does not alter or criticize its holding."
112640,111727,Murray v. Carrier,Mentioned,Murray v. Carrier considered the circumstances under which attorney error constitutes cause. Carrier argued that his attorney’s inadvertence in failing to raise certain claims in his state appeal constituted cause for the default sufficient to allow federal habeas review. We rejected this claim...,"The Acting Decision applies the rule from Murray v. Carrier, but does not alter, criticize, or distinguish it; it is used as supporting precedent."
112640,1280169,O'BRIEN v. Socony Mobil Oil Company,Distinguished,"Coleman cites also O’Brien v. Socony Mobil Oil Co., 207 Va. 707, 152 S. E. 2d 278 (1967)... The court then addressed O’Brien’s constitutional claim on the merits and ruled against her. As a result, there was no need to decide if she should be allowed an exception to the 'mandatory' time requirement... The court also explicitly declined to announce a rule that there is a constitutional exception to the time requirement for filing a notice of appeal. There is no evidence other than O’Brien that the Virginia Supreme Court has ever conducted such a review, and O’Brien explicitly declined to announce such a practice. We decline Coleman’s invitation to announce such a practice for that court.","The Acting Decision distinguishes O'Brien, explaining that it does not establish a general rule for constitutional exceptions to procedural bars, and declines to extend its reasoning."
112640,106591,Sanders v. United States,Mentioned,"As Justice Harlan once observed, '[b]oth the individual criminal defendant and society have an interest in insuring that there will at some point be the certainty that comes with an end to litigation, and that attention will ultimately be focused not on whether a conviction was free from error but rather on whether the prisoner can be restored to a useful place in the community.' Sanders v. United States, 373 U. S. 1, 24-25 (1963) (dissenting opinion).","The Acting Decision quotes Sanders v. United States for a general principle about finality, but does not alter, criticize, or otherwise significantly engage with its reasoning."
112640,536051,"Roger K. Coleman v. Charles Thompson, Warden",Mentioned,The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed. 895 F. 2d 139 (1990). The court held that Coleman had defaulted all of the claims that he had presented for the first time in state habeas.,"The Acting Decision references the lower court decision as part of the procedural history, but does not analyze or alter its reasoning."
112640,109439,Francis v. Henderson,Mentioned,"Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), involved a Louisiana prisoner challenging in federal habeas the composition of the grand jury that had indicted him... We held that Francis’ claim was barred in federal habeas unless he could establish cause and prejudice. Id., at 542.","The Acting Decision cites Francis v. Henderson as precedent for the cause and prejudice standard, but does not alter or criticize its holding."
111948,107953,O'Callahan v. Parker (1969),Overruled,"We hold that it does not, and overrule our earlier decision in O’Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258 (1969).","The lead opinion explicitly states that O'Callahan is overruled, leaving no ambiguity about the treatment."
111948,105326,United States Ex Rel. Toth v. Quarles (1955),Distinguished,"Yet the Court in Toth v. Quarles was addressing only the question whether an ex-serviceman may be tried by court-martial for crimes committed while serving in the Air Force. Thus, the dictum may be also interpreted as limited to that context.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Toth by clarifying that its holding is limited to ex-servicemen and does not control the present issue regarding active duty personnel.
111948,8982256,"Relford v. Commandant, US Disciplinary Barracks, Fort Leavenworth (1971)",Limited,"In fact, within two years after O’Callahan, this Court found it necessary to expound on the meaning of the decision, enumerating a myriad of factors for courts to weigh in determining whether an offense is service connected. Relford v. Commandant, U. S. Disciplinary Barracks, 401 U. S. 355 (1971). Yet the service connection approach, even as elucidated in Relford, has proved confusing and difficult for military courts to apply.","The Court acknowledges Relford as an elaboration of O'Callahan but finds its approach unworkable and confusing, thereby limiting its precedential value and practical application."
111948,105525,Reid v. Covert (1957),Mentioned,"Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 22-23 (1957) (plurality opinion); ... As explained in Kinsella v. Singleton, supra: 'The test for jurisdiction ... is one of status, namely, whether the accused in the court-martial proceeding is a person who can be regarded as falling within the term ‘land and naval Forces.’ ...' ... To say that military jurisdiction ‘defies definition in terms of military “status” ’ is to defy the unambiguous *440 language of Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, as well as the historical background thereof and the precedents with reference thereto.'","Reid v. Covert is cited as part of the historical and doctrinal background but is not criticized, overruled, or otherwise materially altered; it is simply referenced for context."

To say that military jurisdiction ‘defies definition in terms of military “status” ’ is to defy the unambiguous *440 language of Art. I, § 8, cl. 14, as well as the historical background thereof and the precedents with reference thereto.'","Kinsella is referenced for its articulation of the 'status' test for court-martial jurisdiction, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its holding."
111948,89821,Coleman v. Tennessee (1879),Mentioned,"Coleman v. Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509, 513-514 (1879); ... Implicit in the military status test was the principle that determinations concerning the scope of court-martial jurisdiction over offenses committed by servicemen was a matter reserved for Congress: '[T]he rights of men in the armed forces must perforce be conditioned to meet certain overriding demands of discipline and duty, and the civil courts are not the agencies which must determine the precise balance to be struck in this adjustment. The Framers expressly entrusted that task to Congress.' Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137, 140 (1953) (plurality opinion) (footnote omitted). See also Coleman v.

112728,112640,Coleman v. Thompson (1991),Mentioned,"Again addressing the issue of state procedural default in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), we described Fay as based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules, 501 U. S., at 750, and went on to hold that the cause-and-prejudice standard applicable to failure to raise a particular claim should apply as well to failure to appeal at all. Ibid.","The Acting Decision references Coleman v. Thompson as part of the development of the cause-and-prejudice standard, but does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its precedential value."
112728,106544,Townsend v. Sain (1963),Overruled,"Because the holding of Townsend v. Sain that Fay v. Noia’s deliberate bypass standard is applicable in a case like this had not been reversed, it is quite understandable that the Court of Appeals applied that standard in this case. However, in light of more recent decisions of this Court, Townsend’s holding in this respect must be overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly states that the relevant holding of Townsend v. Sain is overruled, thus nullifying its precedential value on this point."
112728,112573,McCleskey v. Zant (1991),Mentioned,"In McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), we held that the same standard used to excuse state procedural defaults should be applied in habeas corpus cases where abuse of the writ is claimed by the government. Id., at 493.","The Acting Decision cites McCleskey v. Zant as supporting authority for the cause-and-prejudice standard, but does not criticize or alter its holding."
112728,105074,Brown v. Allen (1953),Distinguished,"It also expressly stated that the rules it was announcing 'must be considered to supersede, to the extent of any inconsistencies, the opinions in Brown v. Allen[, 344 U. S. 443 (1953)].' Id., at 312. This was necessary because Brown was inconsistent with the holding of Townsend regarding habeas petitioners who failed to adequately develop federal claims in state-court proceedings.","The Acting Decision discusses Brown v. Allen as being inconsistent with Townsend and distinguishes its approach, but does not overrule or criticize it directly."
112728,109717,Wainwright v. Sykes (1977),Mentioned,"In Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), we rejected the application of Fay’s standard of 'knowing waiver' or 'deliberate bypass' to excuse a petitioner’s failure to comply with a state contemporaneous-objection rule, stating that the state rule deserved more respect than the Fay standard accorded it. 433 U. S., at 88.","The Acting Decision references Wainwright v. Sykes as part of the doctrinal evolution toward the cause-and-prejudice standard, but does not criticize or alter its holding."
112728,111727,Murray v. Carrier (1986),Mentioned,"The writ strikes at finality of a state criminal conviction, a matter of particular importance in a federal system. Id., at 491, citing Murray v.

112728,111235,Reed v. Ross (1984),Mentioned,"We have consistently reaffirmed that the 'cause-and-prejudice' standard embodies the correct accommodation between the competing concerns implicated in a federal court’s habeas power. Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 11 (1984);","The Acting Decision references Reed v. Ross as supporting authority for the cause-and-prejudice standard, but does not criticize or alter its holding."
112728,109439,Francis v. Henderson (1976),Mentioned,"In Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), we acknowledged a federal court’s power to entertain an application for habeas even where the claim has been procedurally waived in state proceedings, but nonetheless examined the appropriateness of the exercise of that power and recognized, as we had in Fay, that considerations of comity and concerns for the orderly administration of criminal justice may in some circumstances require a federal court to forgo the exercise of its habeas corpus power. 425 U. S., at 538-539.","The Acting Decision references Francis v. Henderson as part of the doctrinal development, but does not criticize or alter its holding."
117931,105287,United States v. Bramblett (1955),Overruled,VI Bmmblett is hereby overruled. We hold that a federal court is neither a “department” nor an “agency” within the meaning of § 1001.,"The Acting Decision explicitly states that Bramblett is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value regarding the interpretation of § 1001."
117931,112296,Patterson v. McLean Credit Union (1989),Mentioned,"Stare decisis is “a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon ‘an arbitrary discretion.’” Patterson v.

United States (1962),Mentioned,"The seeds of the exception were planted by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit only seven years after Bramblett was decided. In Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d 234 (1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), the defendant, who had falsely held himself out to be a bona fide member of the bar, was prosecuted on three counts of violating § 1001 for concealing from the court his name, identity, *709 and nonadmission to the bar. After first acknowledging that, but for Bramblett , it might well have accepted the argument that Congress did not intend § 1001 to apply to the courts, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction.","Morgan is described as the origin of the 'judicial function exception' and its reasoning is summarized, but the Acting Decision neither criticizes nor overrules it; it is discussed as part of the historical development."
117931,276778,United States v. James Ralph Erhardt (1967),Mentioned,"Relying on Morgan , the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a conviction several years later “because § 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents as evidence in a criminal proceeding.” United States v.

S. 393 (1932), made the point this way: “Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation.” Id., at 406 (citations omitted).",Burnet is quoted for a general principle about the value of stare decisis and is not otherwise discussed or affected by the Acting Decision.
112040,111308,Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority (1985),Mentioned,"The Tenth Amendment limits on Congress’ authority to regulate state activities are set out in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985). Garcia holds that the limits are structural, not substantive— i. e., that States must find their protection from congressional regulation through the national political process, not through judicially defined spheres of unregulable state activity.

112040,104222,New York v. United States (1946),Mentioned,"For a time, only the States’ governmental, as opposed to proprietary, activities enjoyed tax immunity, see e. g., Helvering v. Powers, 293 U. S. 214, 227 (1934); South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 454-463 (1905), but this distinction was subsequently abandoned as untenable by all eight Justices participating in *524 New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946).

112040,110718,Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Mississippi (1982),Distinguished,"They cite FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742 (1982), which left open the possibility that the Tenth Amendment might set some limits on Congress’ power to compel States to regulate on behalf of federal interests, id., at 761-764 . ... Because, by hypothesis, § 310 effectively prohibits issuing unregistered bonds, it presents the very situation FERC distinguished from a commandeering of state regulatory machinery: the extent to which the Tenth Amendment “shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations.” 456 U. S., at 759.","The Acting Decision distinguishes FERC by explaining that the statute at issue in FERC involved commandeering state regulatory machinery, whereas the present case involves generally applicable federal regulation of state activities."
112040,101762,Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States (1931),Mentioned,"The commonality of the rationale underlying all these immunities for government contracts *520 was highlighted by Indian Motocycle, 283 U. S. 570 (1931). In that case, the Court reviewed the then current status of intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine, observing that a tax on interest earned on a state or federal bond was unconstitutional because it would burden the exercise of the government’s power to borrow money and that a tax on the salary of a State or Federal Government employee was unconstitutional because it would burden the government’s power to obtain the employee’s services. Id., at 576-578.","The Acting Decision references Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States as part of the historical rationale for intergovernmental tax immunity, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."
112040,94174,Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. (1895),Overruled,"We thus confirm that subsequent case law has overruled the holding in Pollock that state bond interest is immune from a nondiscriminatory federal tax. We see no constitutional reason for treating persons who receive interest on government bonds differently than persons who receive income from other types of contracts with the government, and no tenable rationale for distinguishing the costs imposed on States by a tax on state bond interest from the costs imposed *525 by a tax on the income from any other state contract.",The Acting Decision expressly states that it is overruling the holding in Pollock regarding the immunity of state bond interest from nondiscriminatory federal taxation.
117958,101414,Sinclair v. United States,Overruled,"Other reasoning in Sinclair, not yet repudiated, we repudiate now... We do not minimize the role that stare decisis plays in our jurisprudence... And we think stare decisis cannot possibly be controlling when, in addition to those factors, the decision in question has been proved manifestly erroneous, and its underpinnings eroded, by subsequent decisions of this Court...

117958,109698,Patterson v. New York,Mentioned,"The Government’s position is that 'materiality,' whether as a matter of logic or history, is a 'legal' question, and that although we have sometimes spoken of 'requiring the jury to decide ‘all the elements of a criminal offense,’ e. g., Estelle v. McGuire, [ 502 U. S. 62, 69 ] (1991); see Victor v. Nebraska, [ 511 U. S. 1, 5 ] (1994); Patterson v. New York, 432 U.

117958,94082,Sparf v. United States,Distinguished,"Sparf, supra, the case on which the Government relies, had nothing to do with the issue before us here... But our decision in no way undermined the historical and constitutionally guaranteed right of criminal defendants to demand that the jury decide guilt or innocence on every issue, which includes application of the law to the facts.","The Acting Decision explains that Sparf addressed a different issue (jury's power to decide pure questions of law) and does not control the present question, thus distinguishing it."
117958,112052,Kungys v. United States,Distinguished,"The Government also claims stare decisis benefit from our decision in Kungys v. United States, 485 U. S. 759 (1988)... It is hard to imagine questions more diverse than, on the one hand, whether an appellate court must remand to a district court for a determination of materiality in a denaturalization proceeding (Kungys) and, on the other hand, whether the Constitution requires the finding of the element of materiality in a criminal prosecution to be made by the jury (the present case).",Kungys is distinguished on the grounds that it involved a different procedural context (appellate review in a civil denaturalization proceeding) and not the Sixth Amendment right at issue here.
112739,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady (1977)",Mentioned,"With respect to the Commerce Clause, the court emphasized that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), rejected the line of cases holding that the direct taxation of interstate commerce was *304 impermissible and adopted instead a 'consistent and rational method of inquiry [that focused on] the practical effect of [the] challenged tax.' ... Complete Auto emphasized the importance of looking past 'the formal language of the tax statute [to] its practical effect,' 430 U.

It is used as a framework for analysis."
112739,1591860,State Ex Rel. Heitkamp v. Quill Corp. (1991),Reversed,"Having granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 808, we must either reverse the State Supreme Court *302 or overrule Bellas Hess. While we agree with much of the state court’s reasoning, we take the former course. ... The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Dakota is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that it is reversing the judgment of the North Dakota Supreme Court in this case.
112739,107425,"National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue (1967)",Limited,"Thus, to the extent that our decisions have indicated that the Due Process Clause requires physical presence in a State for the imposition of duty to collect a use tax, we overrule those holdings as superseded by developments in the law of due process. ... To the contrary, the continuing value of a bright-line rule in this area and the doctrine and principles of stare deci-sis indicate that the Bellas Hess rule remains good law.","The Acting Decision overrules Bellas Hess only as to its Due Process Clause holding, but expressly retains its Commerce Clause holding, thus narrowing (limiting) its scope and precedential value."
112739,109630,National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization (1977),Distinguished,"Thus, three weeks after Complete Auto was handed down, we cited Bellas Hess for this proposition and discussed the case at some length. In National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551, 559 (1977), we affirmed the continuing vitality of Bellas Hess’ 'sharp distinction . . . between mail-order sellers with [a physical presence in the taxing] State and those ... who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business.' ... Although we agree with the state court’s assessment of the evolution of our cases, we do not share its conclusion that this evolution indicates that the Commerce Clause ruling of Bellas Hess is no longer good law. First, as the state court itself noted, 470 N. W. 2d, at 214, all of these cases involved taxpayers who had a physical presence in the taxing State and therefore do not directly conflict with the rule of Bellas Hess or compel that it be overruled.","The Acting Decision distinguishes National Geographic by noting that it involved taxpayers with a physical presence in the state, unlike the present case, and thus does not conflict with or overrule Bellas Hess."

In deciding to reject the Attleboro analysis, we were influenced by the fact that the 'mechanical test' was 'anachronistic,' that the Court had rarely relied on the test, and that we could 'see no strong reliance interests' that would be upset by the rejection of that test. 461 U.

112906,92534,Nielsen (1889),Distinguished,"The fountainhead of the same-conduct rule, he asserts, is In re Nielsen, 131 U. S. 176 (1889). That is demonstrably wrong. Nielsen simply applies the common proposition, entirely in accord with Blockburger, that prosecution for a greater offense (cohabitation, defined to require proof of adultery) bars prosecution for a lesser included offense (adultery).","The Acting Decision discusses Nielsen at length, explaining that it is not the source of the 'same-conduct' rule and instead applies the Blockburger test regarding greater and lesser included offenses. The Court distinguishes Nielsen from the present case, clarifying its limited application."

Heath, 474 U. S., at 88 . This determination, we explained, turns on whether the two entities draw their authority to punish the offender from distinct sources of power, ibid. , not on whether they are pursuing separate interests. Indeed, the Court has rejected the United States precise argument in the past, perhaps nowhere more resolutely than in Grafton v. United States, 206 U.

112906,109736,Harris v. Oklahoma (1977),Mentioned,"There we held that a subsequent prosecution for robbery with a firearm was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, because the defendant had already been tried for felony murder based on the same underlying felony. We have described our terse per curiam in Harris as standing for the proposition that, for double jeopardy purposes, the crime generally described as felony murder is not a separate offense distinct from its various elements. Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410, 420-421 (1980). Accord, Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684, 694 (1980).","Harris v.

That such authority was conferred upon administrative agencies is prima facie evidence that Congress intended to provide for a civil sanction. See Helvering, supra, at 402 ; ... We have long recognized that 'revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted,' such as a debarment, 'is characteristically free of the punitive criminal element.' Helvering, 303 U.

118230,104079,House v. Mayo (1945),Overruled,"Our decision, we must acknowledge, is in direct conflict with the portion of our decision in House v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42, 44 (1945) (per curiam), holding that we lack statutory certiorari jurisdiction to review refusals to issue certificates of probable cause. ... Its conclusion was erroneous, and it should not be followed. ... This consideration, when combined with our analysis of the legal issue in question, convinces us the contrary holding of House v. Mayo cannot stand. We hold this Court has jurisdiction under § 1254(1) to review denials of applications for certificates of appealability by a circuit judge or a panel of a court of appeals. The portion of House v. Mayo holding this Court lacks statutory certiorari jurisdiction over denials of certificates of probable cause is overruled.","The Acting Decision expressly states that the relevant holding of House v. Mayo is overruled, directly nullifying its precedential value on the point at issue."
118230,103707,Ex Parte Quirin (1942),Mentioned,"In Ex parte Quirin, 317 U. S. 1 (1942), we confronted the analogous question whether a request for leave to file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus was a case in a district court for the purposes of the then-extant statute governing court of appeals review of district court decisions. ... We held the request for leave constituted a case in the district court over which the court of appeals could assert jurisdiction, even though the district court had denied the request.","The Acting Decision references Ex Parte Quirin as analogous precedent supporting its reasoning, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority; it is used as supporting analysis."
118230,112643,Payne v. Tennessee (1991),Mentioned,"Stare decisis is 'the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.' Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991). ... The role of stare decisis, furthermore, is 'somewhat reduced ... in the case of a procedural rule ... which does not serve as a guide to lawful behavior.' United States v. Gaudin, 515 U. S. 506, 521 (1995) (citing Payne, supra, at *252 828 ).","Payne v.

118011,92702,Hans v. Louisiana,Mentioned,"That presupposition, first observed over a century ago in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), has two parts: first, that each State is a sovereign entity in our federal system; and second, that “ ‘[i]t is inherent in the nature of sovereignty not to be amenable to the suit of an individual without its consent,’ ” id., at 13 (emphasis deleted), quoting The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C.

118011,84681,Chisholm v. Georgia,Mentioned,"The dissent cites not a single decision since Hans (other than Union Gas) that supports its view of state sovereign immunity, instead relying upon the now-discredited decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793). See, e. g., post, at 152, n. 47. Its undocumented and highly speculative extralegal explanation of *69 the decision in Hans is a disservice to the Court’s traditional method of adjudication.","Chisholm v. Georgia is mentioned as a historical reference and is described as 'now-discredited,' but the Acting Decision does not itself overrule or otherwise directly treat Chisholm beyond noting its lack of current authority."

118011,102271,Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi,Mentioned,"In Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934), the Court held that the Eleventh Amendment barred a suit brought against a State by a foreign state. Chief Justice Hughes wrote for a unanimous Court: '[NJeither the literal sweep of the words of Clause one of § 2 of Article III, nor the absence of restriction in the letter of the Eleventh Amendment, permits the conclusion that in all controversies of the sort described in Clause one, and omitted from the words of the Eleventh Amendment, a State may be sued without her consent.'","The Acting Decision references Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi as precedent for the scope of the Eleventh Amendment, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority."

We hold that Ex parte Young is inapplicable to petitioner’s suit against the Governor of Florida, and therefore that suit is barred by the Eleventh Amendment and must be dismissed for a lack of jurisdiction.","The Acting Decision holds that Ex parte Young does not apply to the statutory scheme at issue, thereby limiting the scope of the Ex parte Young doctrine in this context."
118011,85330,Cohens v. Virginia,Mentioned,"In Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264 (1821), for instance, Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, emphasized that the Amendment had no effect on federal courts’ jurisdiction grounded on the 'arising under' provision of Article III and concluded that 'a case arising under the constitution or laws of the United States, is cognizable in the Courts of the Union, whoever may be the parties to that case.'

118011,109520,Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,Mentioned,"In Fitzpatrick, we recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment, by expanding federal power at the expense of state autonomy, had fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution. Id., at 455 . We noted that § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contained prohibitions expressly directed at the States and that § 5 of the Amendment expressly provided that 'The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.' See id., at 453 (internal quotation marks omitted). We held that through the Fourteenth Amendment, federal power extended to intrude upon the province of the Eleventh Amendment and therefore that § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to abrogate the immunity from suit guaranteed by that Amendment.","Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer is referenced as precedent for the proposition that Congress may abrogate state immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment, but the Acting Decision does not criticize or otherwise alter its holding."
118011,111949,Welch v. Texas Department of Highways & Public Transportation,Mentioned,"Rather, as we said in Dellmuth v. Muth, 491 U. S. 223 (1989): 'To temper Congress’ acknowledged powers of abrogation with due concern for the Eleventh Amendment’s role as an essential component of our constitutional structure, we have applied a simple but stringent test: ‘Congress may abrogate the States’ constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.’ Id., at 227-228 . See also Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U.

Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.",Mentioned,"Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the suit violated the State’s sovereign immunity from suit in federal court. The District Court denied respondents’ motion, 801 F. Supp. 655 (SD Fla. 1992), and respondents took an interlocutory appeal of that decision. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v.

Folsom, Governor, State of Alabama",Mentioned,"The Eleventh Circuit consolidated petitioner’s appeal with an appeal from another suit brought under § 2710(d)(7)(A)(i) by a different Indian tribe. Although the District Court in that ease had granted the defendants’ motions to dismiss, the legal issues presented by the two appeals were virtually identical. See Poarch Band of Creek Indians v. Alabama, 776 F. Supp. 550 (SD Ala. 1991) (Eleventh Amendment bars suit against State), and 784 F. Supp. 1549 (SD Ala. 1992) (Eleventh Amendment bars suit against Governor). Following its conclusion that petitioner’s suit should be dismissed, the Court of Appeals went on to consider how § 2710(d)(7) would operate in the wake of its decision. The court decided that those provisions of § 2710(d)(7) that were problematic could be severed from the rest of the section, and read the surviving provisions of § 2710(d)(7) to provide an Indian tribe with immediate recourse to the Secretary of the Interior from the dismissal of a suit against a State. 11 F. 3d 1016 , 1029 (1994).","The cited Eleventh Circuit decision is mentioned as the lower court decision under review and for its reasoning, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its precedential value beyond affirming its result."
118023,110312,Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission,Mentioned,"In Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm’n of N. Y., 447 U. S. 557 (1980), we took stock of our developing commercial speech jurisprudence. ... In those circumstances, 'a ban on speech could screen from public view the underlying governmental policy.' ... As a result, the Court concluded that 'special care' should attend the review of such blanket bans, and it pointedly remarked that 'in recent years this Court has not approved a blanket ban on commercial speech unless the expression itself was flawed in some way, either because it was deceptive or related to unlawful activity.' ... It necessarily follows that the price advertising ban cannot survive the more stringent constitutional review that Central Hudson itself concluded was appropriate for the complete suppression of truthful, nonmisleading commercial speech. 447 U. S., at 566, n. 9.","The Acting Decision applies and discusses the Central Hudson test as the controlling framework for commercial speech, but does not overrule, criticize, or limit it. The case is treated as authoritative and is repeatedly cited as the standard, so the treatment is 'Mentioned.'"

Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U. S. 748 (1976), we expanded on our holding in Bigelow and held that the State’s blanket ban on advertising the price of prescription drugs violated the First Amendment. Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy reflected the conclusion that the same interest that supports regulation of potentially misleading advertising, namely, the public’s interest in receiving accurate commercial information, also supports an interpretation of the First Amendment that provides constitutional protection for the dissemination of accurate and nonmis-leading commercial messages.","The Acting Decision discusses Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy as a foundational precedent for commercial speech protection, applying its principles without criticism or limitation. It is cited as supportive authority, so the treatment is 'Mentioned.'"
118023,111744,Posadas De Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico,Criticized,"The reasoning in Posadas does support the State’s argument, but, on reflection, we are now persuaded that Posadas erroneously performed the First Amendment analysis. ... Given our longstanding hostility to commercial speech regulation of this type, Posadas clearly erred in concluding that it was 'up to the legislature' to choose suppression over a less speech-restrictive policy. The Posadas majority’s conclusion on that point cannot be reconciled with the unbroken line of prior eases striking down similarly broad regulations on truthful, nonmisleading advertising when non-speech- related alternatives were available. ... As the entire Court apparently now agrees, the statements in the Posadas opinion on which Rhode Island relies are no longer persuasive.","The Acting Decision expressly criticizes the reasoning and holding of Posadas, stating it 'erroneously performed the First Amendment analysis' and that its statements are 'no longer persuasive.' However, it does not formally overrule Posadas, so the treatment is 'Criticized.'"

Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S. 476, 491 (1995). ... For that reason, the State bears the burden of showing not merely that its regulation will advance its interest, but also that it will do so 'to a material degree.' Edenfield, 507 U. S., at 771 ; see also Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 486-488.","Rubin v.

118023,1877168,"44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine",Mentioned,"Indeed, the District Court’s considered and un-contradicted finding on this point is directly to the contrary. Id., at 549 . ... As a matter of law, he concluded that the price advertising ban was unconstitutional because it did not 'directly advance' the State’s interest in reducing alcohol consumption and was 'more extensive than necessary to serve that interest.' Id., at 555 .","The Acting Decision references the District Court's findings and legal conclusions in Racine as part of the procedural history and factual record, but does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its precedential value.

Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U. S. 410, 426 (1993). ... The State’s regulation must indicate a 'carefu[l] calculation of the costs and benefits associated with the burden on speech imposed by its prohibition.' Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc., 507 U.

118023,112899,United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co.,Distinguished,"Rhode Island errs in concluding that Edge and Posadas establish the degree of deference that its decision to impose a price advertising ban warrants. In Edge, we upheld a federal statute that permitted only those broadcasters located in States that had legalized lotteries to air lottery advertising. The statute was designed to regulate advertising about an activity that had been deemed illegal in the jurisdiction in which the broadcaster was located. 509 U. S., at 433-434 . Here, by contrast, the commercial speech ban targets information about entirely lawful behavior.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Edge Broadcasting by noting that it involved advertising about illegal activity in the relevant jurisdiction, whereas the present case involves lawful activity. Thus, Edge is not controlling, and the treatment is 'Distinguished.'"
118023,109649,"Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Township of Willingboro",Mentioned,"For example, in Linmark, 431 U.

S., at 771 . ... As a result, even under the less than strict standard that generally applies in commercial speech cases, the State has failed to establish a 'reasonable fit' between its abridgment of speech and its temperance goal. ... see also Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 491 (explaining that defects in a federal ban on alcohol advertising are 'further highlighted by the availability of alternatives that would prove less intrusive to the First Amendment’s protections for commercial speech'); Linmark, 431 U. S., at 97 (suggesting that the State use financial incentives or counterspeech, rather than speech restrictions, to advance its interests).","Linmark is cited as precedent for the principle that content-based bans on truthful commercial speech are subject to heightened scrutiny and that alternatives to speech bans should be considered.

Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 633-634 (1995). ... The scope of the restriction on speech must be reasonably,, though it need not be perfectly, targeted to address the harm, intended to be regulated. See Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc., 515 U. S. 618, 632-634 (1995).","Went for It is cited as an example of a narrowly tailored restriction on commercial speech that left open alternative channels of communication.

App., at 304-305 , 370 N. W. 2d, at 333-335 . ... cf. Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Assn. v. Attorney General, 142 Mich. App., at 311 , 370 N. W. 2d, at 336 (explaining that 'any additional impact on the level of consumption attributable to the absence of price advertisements would be negligible').","The Acting Decision references Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Ass'n for its factual findings and analysis regarding the impact of advertising bans, but does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its authority.

118023,108636,California v. LaRue,Limited,"In reaching its conclusion, the Court of Appeals relied on our decision in California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109 (1972). ... Without questioning the holding in LaRue , we now disavow its reasoning insofar as it relied on the Twenty-first Amendment. ... As we recently noted: 'LaRue did not involve commercial speech about alcohol, but instead concerned the regulation of nude dancing in places where alcohol was served.' Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co., 514 U. S., at 483, n. 2 .","The Acting Decision expressly limits LaRue by disavowing its reasoning to the extent it relied on the Twenty-first Amendment, while not questioning its holding on other grounds.

C. § 1400 et seq., was constitutional as applied to a deaf student who sought to bring his state-employed sign-language interpreter with him to his Roman Catholic high school. We held that this was permissible, expressly disavowing the notion that 'the Establishment Clause [laid] down [an] absolute bar to the placing of a public employee in a sectarian school.' 509 U.

Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed., 739 F. 2d 48, 51 (CA2 1984), the Board initially arranged to transport children to public schools for after-school Title I instruction.",The Acting Decision references this case for factual background and does not discuss its legal reasoning or precedential value.
118133,117870,Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet,Mentioned,"Petitioners also argue that there have been two significant legal developments since Aguilar was decided: a majority of Justices have expressed their views that Aguilar should be reconsidered or overruled, see supra, at 214; and Aguilar has in any event been undermined by subsequent Establishment Clause decisions, including Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993), and Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995). Respondents counter that, because the costs of providing Title I services off site were known at the time Aguilar was decided, and because the relevant case law has not changed, the District Court did not err in denying petitioners’ motions. Obviously, if neither the law supporting our original decision in this litigation nor the facts have changed, there would be no need to decide the propriety of a Rule 60(b)(5) motion. Accordingly, we turn to the threshold issue whether the factual or legal landscape has changed since we decided Aguilar . We agree with respondents that petitioners have failed to establish the significant change in factual conditions required by Rufo . Both petitioners and this Court were, at the time Aguilar was decided, aware that additional costs would be incurred if Title I services could not be provided in parochial school classrooms. See App. 66-68 (Defendants’ Joint Statement of Material Facts Not In Dispute, filed in 1982, detailing costs of providing off-premises services); Aguilar, 473 U. S., at 430-431 (O’Connor, J., dissenting) (observing that costs of complying with Aguilar decision would likely cause a decline in Title I services for 20,000 New York City students). That these predictions of additional costs turned out to be accurate does not constitute a change in factual conditions warranting relief under Rule 60(b)(5). Accord, Rufo, *217 supra, at 385 ('Ordinarily . . . modification should not be granted where a party relies upon events that actually were anticipated at the time [the order was entered]').","The Acting Decision mentions Grumet as a case in which Justices called for reconsideration of Aguilar, but does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its holding."
118133,109251,Meek v. Pittenger,Criticized,"First, drawing upon the analysis in Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349 (1975), the Court observed that 'the teachers participating in the programs may become involved in intentionally or inadvertently inculcating particular religious tenets or beliefs.' 473 U. S., at 385. Meek invalidated a Pennsylvania program in which full-time public employees provided supplemental 'auxiliary services'... Although the auxiliary services themselves were secular, they were mostly dispensed on the premises of parochial schools, where 'an atmosphere dedicated to the advancement of religious belief [was] constantly maintained.' Meek, 421 U. S., at 371. Instruction in that atmosphere was sufficient to create '[t]he potential for impermissible fostering of religion.' Id., at 372... Our more recent cases have undermined the assumptions upon which Ball and Aguilar relied... we have abandoned the presumption erected in Meek and Ball that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that the assumptions underlying Meek have been undermined and abandoned, criticizing its reasoning and diminishing its precedential value."
118133,112679,Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,Mentioned,"In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, supra, at 384, we held that it is appropriate to grant a Rule 60(b)(5) motion when the party seeking relief from an injunction or consent decree can show 'a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.'","Rufo is cited as authority for the standard governing Rule 60(b)(5) motions, but its reasoning or holding is not criticized, limited, or otherwise altered."

Insofar as Evans holds to the contrary, that case, in O’Malley’s words, 'cannot survive.' 307 U.S., at 283.","The Acting Decision expressly states that it is overruling Evans v. Gore to the extent that it prohibited nondiscriminatory taxes on judges, making clear that Evans is no longer good law on that point."
118428,103214,O'MALLEY v. Woodrough (1939),Mentioned,"And in so doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans dissent. The Court said that the question was whether judges are immune 'from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes ... is subjected.' 307 U.S., at 282. Holding that judges are not 'immun[e] from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government,' ibid., the Court pointed out that the legal profession had criticized Evans’ contrary conclusion, and that courts outside the United States had resolved similar matters differently, 307 U.S., at 281.","The Acting Decision discusses O'Malley v. Woodrough as precedent and adopts its reasoning, but does not alter, criticize, or limit its holding. It is cited as supporting authority and its reasoning is followed."
118428,110365,United States v. Will (1980),Mentioned,"Still later, this Court noted that '[b]ecause Miles relied on Evans v. Gore, O’Malley must also be read to undermine the reasoning of Evans.' United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 227, n. 31 (1980). ... Finally, the Government looks to our decision in Will for support. ... The Will Year One example, however, shows only that, in the circumstances, and unlike the case before us, the later salary increase was related to the earlier salary diminishment. Regardless, the very fact that the matter was 'unquestioned' in Will shows that it was not argued. See 449 U. S., at 206, n. 3 (noting that the judges’ complaint sought relief for Year One’s diminution only up to the moment of the subsequent salary increase). Hence the Court did not decide the matter now before us.","United States v. Will is discussed for its factual and legal context, but the Acting Decision neither overrules, criticizes, nor limits it. The case is mentioned as background and for comparison."
118428,702629,Hatter v. United States (1995),Reversed,"Hence, insofar as the Court of Appeals found that application of the Medicare tax law to federal judges is unconstitutional, we reverse its decision. ... Insofar as that court found the application of Social Security taxes to the salaries of judges taking office before 1984 unconstitutional, its judgment is affirmed.","The Acting Decision directly reverses the Court of Appeals' (Hatter v. United States, 64 F.3d 647) holding regarding the Medicare tax, while affirming its holding regarding Social Security taxes. Thus, the treatment is 'Reversed' as to the Medicare tax issue."
118317,118011,Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida (1996),Mentioned,"Our decision three Terms ago in Seminole Tribe, supra, held that the power “to regulate Commerce” conferred by Article I of the Constitution gives Congress no authority to abrogate state sovereign immunity. As authority for the abrogation in the present case, petitioner relies upon §5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, which we held in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, supra, and reaffirmed in Seminole Tribe, see 517 U. S., at 72-73 , could be used for that purpose.","The Acting Decision references Seminole Tribe as precedent for the proposition that Congress cannot abrogate state sovereign immunity under Article I, but does not criticize, overrule, or otherwise alter its holding. It is cited as controlling law."
118317,108763,Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health (1973),Distinguished,"Only nine years later, in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279 (1973), we began to retreat from Parden . That case held — in an opinion written by one of the Parden dissenters over the solitary dissent of Parderis author — that the State of Missouri was immune from a suit brought under the Fair Labor Standards Act by employees of its state health facilities. Although the statute specifically covered the state hospitals in question, ... we did not think that the statute expressed with clarity Congress’s intention to supersede the States’ immunity from suits brought by individuals. We “put to one side” the Parden case, which we characterized as involving “dramatic circumstances” and “a rather isolated state activity,” 411 U. S., at 285 , unlike the provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act in question that applied to a broad class of state employees.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Employees from Parden, noting that Employees involved different circumstances and did not address the same issue of constructive waiver, thereby treating Employees as factually and legally distinct."
118317,106821,Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama State Docks Department (1964),Overruled,"In short, Parden stands as an anomaly in the jurisprudence of sovereign immunity, and indeed in the jurisprudence of constitutional law. Today, we drop the other shoe: Whatever may remain of our decision in Parden is expressly overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Parden is 'expressly overruled,' leaving no doubt as to its treatment."
118317,111949,Welch v. Texas Department of Highways & Public Transportation (1987),Mentioned,"Several Terms later, in Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468 (1987), although we expressly avoided addressing the constitutionality of Congress’s conditioning a State’s engaging in Commerce Clause activity upon the State’s waiver of sovereign immunity, we said there was “no doubt that Parden’s discussion of congressional intent to negate Eleventh Amendment immunity is no longer good law,” and overruled Parden “to the extent [it] is inconsistent with the requirement that an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity by Congress must be expressed in unmistakably clear language,” 483 U. S., at 478 , and n. 8.","Welch is mentioned as part of the historical development of the law regarding sovereign immunity and waiver, but its holding is neither criticized nor changed by the Acting Decision."
118317,111503,Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon (1985),Mentioned,"Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 478 U. S. 234 , 241 (1985). Generally, we will find a waiver either if the State voluntarily invokes our jurisdic *676 tion, Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 200 U. S. 273, 284 (1906), or else if the State makes a clear declaration” that it intends to submit itself to our jurisdiction, Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 54 (1944). See also Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S., at 99 (State’s consent to suit must be unequivocally expressed”).","Atascadero is cited for the general principle that waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocal, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its holding."
118317,112291,Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. (1989),Mentioned,"As further evidence that constructive waiver is little more than abrogation under another name, consider the revealing facts of this case: The statutory provision relied upon to demonstrate that Florida constructively waived its sovereign immunity is the very same provision that purported to abrogate it. ... “All congressional creations of private rights of action attach recovery to the defendant’s commission of some act, or possession of some status, in a field where Congress has authority to regulate conduct. Thus, all federal prescriptions are, insofar as their prospective application is concerned, in a sense conditional, and — to the extent that the objects of the prescriptions consciously engage in the activity or hold the status that produces liability — can be rede-scribed as invitations to ‘waiver.’ ” Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 43 (1989) (Scalia, J., dissenting).","Union Gas is mentioned in a parenthetical as part of a quotation from a dissenting opinion, used to illustrate a point about waiver and abrogation, but not otherwise discussed or altered."
118317,110880,"White v. Massachusetts Council of Construction Employers, Inc. (1983)",Distinguished,"The “market participant” eases from our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, relied upon by the United States, are inapposite. See, e.g., White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204 (1983); Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429 (1980); and Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794 (1976). Those cases hold that, where a State acts as a participant in the private market, it may prefer the goods or services of its own citizens, even though it could not do so while acting as a market regulator. ... In contrast, a suit by an individual against an unconsenting State is the very evil at which the Eleventh Amendment is directed — and it exists whether or not the State is acting for profit, in a traditionally “private” enterprise, and as a “market participant.”","The Acting Decision distinguishes White and similar cases, explaining that the market participant doctrine in dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence does not apply to the sovereign immunity context at issue."
118317,105513,California v. Taylor (1957),Mentioned,"Parden itself cited authority that found related “waivers” in at least roughly comparable circumstances. United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), for example, held that a State, “by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has subjected itself to the commerce power,” id., at 185 , which amounted to a waiver of a (different though related) substantive immunity. See also Taylor, supra, at 568.","California v. Taylor is mentioned as a precedent cited by Parden, but the Acting Decision does not discuss or alter its holding."
118317,109520,Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer (1976),Mentioned,"First, Congress may authorize such a suit in the exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment — an Amendment enacted after the Eleventh Amendment and specifically designed to alter the federal-state balance. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976).","Fitzpatrick is cited for the proposition that Congress may abrogate state sovereign immunity when legislating under the Fourteenth Amendment, but the Acting Decision does not criticize, limit, or otherwise alter its holding."
118386,118133,Agostini v. Felton,Mentioned,"In Agostini, however, we brought some clarity to our ease law, by overruling two anomalous precedents (one in whole, the other in part) and by consolidating some of our previously disparate considerations under a revised test. ... Whereas in Lemon we had considered whether a statute (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or (3) creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion, see 403 U. S., at 612-613, in Agostini we modified Lemon for purposes of evaluating aid to schools and examined only the first and second factors, see 521 U. S., at 222-223.","The Acting Decision relies on Agostini as the controlling precedent and framework for analysis, applying its test and referencing its holdings, but does not overrule, criticize, or otherwise alter its precedential value. Agostini is treated as authoritative and is positively cited."
118386,112887,Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District,Mentioned,"Judge Livaudais cited our 1993 decision in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dish, 509 U. S. 1 , in which we held that a State could, as part *805 of a federal program for the disabled, provide a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at a Catholic high school. ... The heart of our reasoning in Zobrest, upholding governmental provision of a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at his Catholic high school, was as follows: 'The service at issue in this ease is part of a general government program that distributes benefits neutrally to any child qualifying as ‘disabled’ under the [statute], without regard to the ‘sectarian-nonseetarian, or publie-nonpublic nature’ of the school the child attends.'","Zobrest is discussed at length and its reasoning is applied to the facts of the present case. The Acting Decision neither overrules nor criticizes Zobrest, but instead treats it as good law and uses it to support its own holding."
118386,111561,Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind,Mentioned,"In Witters, we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from including within a neutral program providing tuition payments for vocational rehabilitation a blind person studying at a Christian college to become a pastor, missionary, or youth director. We explained: 'Any aid . . . that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.'","Witters is cited as a supporting precedent for the principle of neutrality and private choice in government aid programs. The Acting Decision applies Witters' reasoning and treats it as valid and controlling, without criticism or limitation."
118386,107737,Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,Mentioned,"The Ninth Circuit acknowledged in Walker, as Judge Heebe had in his 1990 summary judgment ruling, that Meek and Wolman appeared to erect a constitutional distinction between providing textbooks (permissible) and providing any other in-kind aid (impermissible). 46 F. 3d, at 1464-1465; see Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968) (upholding textbook program). ... We have repeatedly reaffirmed Allen since then, see, e. g., Agostini, supra, at 231.","Allen is repeatedly cited as a foundational precedent for the constitutionality of textbook lending programs. The Acting Decision reaffirms Allen and distinguishes it from overruled cases, treating it as good law."
118386,104373,Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing,Mentioned,"In the over 50 years since Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), we have consistently struggled to apply these simple words in the context of governmental aid to religious schools. ... In disregarding the nature of the school, Zobrest and Agostini were merely returning to the approach of Everson and Allen, in which the Court upheld aid programs to students at pervasively sectarian schools.","Everson is cited as a historical precedent and is used to support the general principle of neutrality in government aid. The Acting Decision does not alter, criticize, or limit Everson, but treats it as a foundational case."
118386,109722,Wolman v. Walter,Overruled,"We therefore hold that Chapter 2 is not a 'law respecting an establishment of religion.' In so holding, we acknowledge what both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits saw was inescapable — Meek and Wolman are anomalies in our case law. We therefore conclude that they are no longer good law. ... To the extent that Meek and Wolman conflict with this holding, we overrule them.","The Acting Decision expressly states that Wolman is 'no longer good law' and is overruled to the extent it conflicts with the present holding, thus expressly nullifying its precedential value."
118386,109251,Meek v. Pittenger,Overruled,"We therefore hold that Chapter 2 is not a 'law respecting an establishment of religion.' In so holding, we acknowledge what both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits saw was inescapable — Meek and Wolman are anomalies in our case law. We therefore conclude that they are no longer good law. ...

118386,111003,Mueller v. Allen,Mentioned,"The tax deduction for educational expenses that we upheld in Mueller was, in these respects, the same as the tuition grant in Witters. We upheld it chiefly because it 'neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens,' 463 U. S., at 398-399, and because 'numerous, private choices of individual parents of school-age children,' id., at 399, determined which schools would benefit from the deductions.",Mueller is cited as a supporting precedent for the principles of neutrality and private choice in government aid. The Acting Decision applies its reasoning and treats it as good law.
118386,108380,Lemon v. Kurtzman,Mentioned,"Whereas in Lemon we had considered whether a statute (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or (3) creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion, see 403 U. S., at 612-613, in Agostini we modified Lemon for purposes of evaluating aid to schools and examined only the first and second factors, see 521 U. S., at 222-223.","Lemon is referenced as the origin of the three-part test for Establishment Clause cases, but the Acting Decision notes that Agostini modified Lemon for school aid cases. Lemon is not overruled or criticized, but its test is updated for the context at issue."
118386,117967,Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of University of Virginia,Mentioned,"Finally, in addition to relying on our decision in Zobrest and the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Walker, Judge Livaudais invoked Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 615 U. S. 819 (1995), in which, a few months after Walker, we held that the Establishment Clause does not require a public university to exclude a student-run religious publication from assistance available to numerous other student-run publications.",Rosenberger is cited as a supporting precedent for the principle that the Establishment Clause does not require exclusion of religious entities from generally available public benefits. The Acting Decision treats it as good law and applies its reasoning.
118273,111516,Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife v. Klamath Indian Tribe (1985),Distinguished,"To attack the conclusion that the 1855 Treaty rogate the usufructuary rights guaranteed under the 1837 Treaty, the State relies primarily on our decision in Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, 473 U. S. 753 (1985). ... This understanding of the Tribe’s usufructuary rights under the 1864 Treaty — that those rights were exclusive, on-reservation rights — informed our conclusion that the Klamath Tribe did not retain any usufructuary rights on the land that it ceded in the 1901 agreement, land that was not part of the reservation. ... First, the Chippewa’s usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty existed independently of land ownership; they were neither tied to a *202 reservation nor exclusive. In contrast to Klamath, there is no background understanding of the rights to suggest that they are extinguished when title to the land is extinguished.","The Acting Decision explains that the facts and treaty language in Klamath are materially different from those in the present case, and thus the reasoning and result in Klamath do not control the outcome here."
118273,96304,United States v. Winans (1905),Mentioned,"We interpret Indian treaties to give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood them. See Washington v.

118273,94506,Ward v. Race Horse (1896),Criticized,"This case does not bear the weight the State places on it, however, because it has been qualified by later decisions of this Court. ... But Race Horse rested on a subsequent eases have made clear, an Indian tribe’s treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on state land are not irreconcilable with a State’s sovereignty over the natural resources in the State. ... Thus, contrary to the State’s contentions, Race Horse does not compel the conclusion that Minnesota’s admission to the Union extinguished Chippewa usufructuary rights guaranteed by the 1837 Treaty.","The Acting Decision disagrees with the reasoning and continuing authority of Race Horse, explaining that its rationale has been undermined by later cases."
118273,110146,Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn. (1979),Mentioned,"We interpret Indian treaties to give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood them. See Washington v.

118273,2261846,Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v. Minnesota (1994),Mentioned,"With respect to the 1850 Executive Order, the District Court held, in relevant part, that the order was unlawful because the President had no authority to order removal of the Chippewa without their consent. Id., at 823-826 . The District Court also concluded that the United States ultimately abandoned and repealed the removal policy embodied in the 1850 order. Id., at 829-830 . With respect to the 1855 Treaty, the District Court reviewed the historical record and found that the parties to that agreement did not intend to abrogate the usufructuary privileges guaranteed by the 1837 Treaty. Id., at 830-835 .",The Acting Decision summarizes the District Court's findings as background but does not analyze or critique its reasoning; it is referenced as part of the procedural history.

118273,98773,New York Ex Rel. Kennedy v. Becker (1916),Mentioned,"In New York ex rel. Kennedy v. (1916), the Court considered significantly different language. The Big Tree Treaty of 1797, as the agreement was known, provided that the Seneca were to retain “the privilege of fishing and hunting on the said tract of land” conveyed by the agreement. 7 Stat. 602 (emphasis added); see also 241 U. S., at 562 (quoting the reservation clause). ... The only fair reading of Kennedy is that the Treaty reserved for the Seneca a privilege in common with all persons to whom the State chose to extend fishing and hunting privileges.","Kennedy is discussed as an example of different treaty language and its interpretation, but the Acting Decision does not rely on or distinguish its holding for the present case."
118273,103642,Tulee v. Washington (1942),Mentioned,"The conservation necessity standard appears to have its origin in Tulee v. Washington, 315 U. S. 681 (1942). In the 1859 Treaty with the Yakima Indians, the Yakima reserved “The right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory.’ ” Id., at 683 (quoting 12 Stat. 953 ). The Court held that Washington State had the “power to impose on Indians, equally with others, such restrictions of a purely regulatory nature concerning the time and manner of fishing outside the reservation as are necessary for the conservation offish,” but that the Treaty foreclosed “the state from charging the Indians a fee of the kind in question.” 315 U.
