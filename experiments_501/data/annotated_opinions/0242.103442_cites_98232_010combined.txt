**Combined Opinion**
 See United States v. Ferger, supra; Virginian Ry. Co. v. Federation, 300 U. S. 515, 553 .  Congress, having by the present Act adopted the policy of excluding from interstate commerce all goods produced for the commerce which do not conform to the specified labor standards, it may choose the means reasonably adapted to the attainment of the permitted end, even though they involve control of intrastate activities.  Such legislation has often been sustained with respect to powers, other than the commerce power granted to the national government, when the means chosen, although not themselves within the granted power, were nevertheless deemed appropriate aids to the accomplishment of some purpose within an admitted power of the national government.  See Jacob Ruppert, Inc. v. Caffey, 251 U. S. 264 ; Everard’s Breweries v. Day, 265 U. S. 545, 560 ; Westfall v. United States, 274 U. S. 256, 259 .  As to state power under the Fourteenth Amendment, compare Otis v. Parker, 187 U. S. 606, 609 ; St. John v. New York, 201 U. S. 633 ; Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, 226 U. S. 192, 201-202 .  A familiar like exercise of power is the regulation of intrastate transactions which are so commingled with or related to interstate commerce that all must be regulated if the interstate commerce is to be effectively controlled.  Shreveport Case, <citedDecision>234 U. S. 342</citedDecision> ; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563 ; United States v. New York Central R. Co., supra, 464; Currin v. Wallace, 306 U. S. 1 ; Mulford v. Smith, supra. Similarly Congress may require inspection and preventive treatment of all cattle in a disease infected area in order to prevent shipment in interstate commerce of some of the cattle without the treatment.  Thornton v. United States, 271 U. S. 414 .  It may prohibit the removal, at destination, of labels required by the Pure Pood & Drugs Act to be affixed to ar *122 tides transported in interstate commerce.  McDermott v. Wisconsin, 228 U. S. 115 .  And we have recently held that Congress in the exercise of its power to require inspection and grading of tobacco shipped in interstate commerce may compel such inspection and grading of all tobacco sold at local auction rooms from which a substantial part but not all of the tobacco sold is shipped in interstate commerce.  Currin v. Wallace, supra, 11 , and see to the like effect United States v. Rock Royal Co-op., supra, 568, note 37.  We think also that § 15 (a) (2), now under consideration, is sustainable independently of § 15 (a) (1), which prohibits shipment or transportation of the proscribed goods.
**Combined Opinion**
 (a) The Congress hereby finds that the existence, in industries engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce, of labor conditions detrimental to the maintenance of the minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general well-being of workers (1) causes commerce and the channels and instrumentalities of commerce to be used to spread and perpetuate such labor conditions among the workers of the several States; (2) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; (3) constitutes an unfair method of competition in commerce; (4) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce; and (5) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods in commerce.  Section 3 (b) defines “commerce” as “trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or from any State to any place outside thereof,” 2 Cf. Administrator’s Opinion, Interpretative Bulletin No. 5, 1940 Wage and Hour Manual, p. 131 et seq. 3 It may prohibit wholly intrastate activities which, if permitted, would result in restraint of interstate commerce.  Coronado Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, 268 U. S. 295, 310 ; Local 167 v. United States, 291 U. S. 293, 297 .  It may regulate the activities of a local grain exchange shown to have an injurious effect on interstate commerce.  Chicago Board of Trade v. Olsen, 262 U. S. 1 .  It may regulate intrastate rates of interstate carriers where the effect of the rates is to burden interstate commerce.  Houston, E. & W. Texas Ry. Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>234 U. S. 342</citedDecision> ; Railroad Commission of Wisconsin v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 257 U. S. 563 ; United States v. Louisiana, 290 U. S. 70, 74 ; Florida v. United States, 292 U. S. 1 .  It may compel the adoption of safety appliances on rolling stock moving intrastate because of the relation to and effect of such appliances upon interstate traffic moving over the same railroad.  Southern Ry. Co. v. United States, 222 U. S. 20 .  It may prescribe maximum hours for employees engaged in intrastate activity connected with the movement of any train, such as train dispatchers and telegraphers.  Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm’n, 221 U. S. 612 , 619.
