<p id="b200-10">I dissent. If the policy of judicial conservatism were to be followed in this case, which forbids deciding constitu<page-number citation-index="1" label="113">*113</page-number>tional and other important questions hypothetically or prematurely, I would favor remanding the cause to the Court of Appeals for determination of the narrow and comparatively minor question whether, under the applicable local law, the cause of action has been barred by lapse of time. That question has not been decided,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> may be determined in respondent’s favor, and in that event the important question affecting federal judicial power now resolved, in a manner contrary to all prior decision here, will have been determined without substantial ultimate effect upon the litigation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b201-4">But the Court conceives itself confronted with the necessity for making that determination and in doing so overturns a rule of decision which has prevailed in the federal courts from almost the beginning. I am unable to assent to that decision, for reasons stated by the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and others to be mentioned only briefly. One may give full adherence to the rule of <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U. S. 64, and its extension to cases in equity in so far as they affect clearly substantive'rights, without conceding or assuming that the long tradition, both federal and state, which regards statutes of limitations as falling within the category of remedial rather than substantive law, necessarily must be ruled in the same way; and without conceding further that only a different jurisprudential climate or a kind of “brooding omnipresence in the sky” <page-number citation-index="1" label="114">*114</page-number>has dictated the hitherto unvaried policy of the federal courts in their general attitude toward the strict application of local statutes of limitations in equity causes.</p>
<p id="b202-4">If any characteristic of equity jurisprudence has descended unbrokenly from and within “the traditional scope of equity as historically evolved in the English Court of Chancery,” it is that statutes of limitations, often in terms applying only to actions at law, have never been deemed to be rigidly applicable as absolute barriers to suits in equity as they are to actions at law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That tradition, it would seem, should be regarded as having been incorporated in the various Acts of Congress which have conferred equity jurisdiction upon the federal courts. So incorporated, it has been reaffirmed repeatedly by the decisions of this and other courts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is now excised from those Acts. If there is to be excision, Congress, not this Court, should make it.</p>
<p id="b202-5">Moreover, the decision of today does not in so many words rule that Congress could not authorize the federal courts to administer equitable relief in accordance with the substantive rights of the parties, notwithstanding state courts had been forbidden by local statutes of limitations to do so. Nevertheless the implication to that effect seems strong, in view of the reliance upon <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. Tompkins.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In any event, the question looms more largely in the issues than the Court’s opinion appears to <page-number citation-index="1" label="115">*115</page-number>make it. For if legislative acquiescence in long-established judicial construction can make it part of a statute, it has done so in this instance. More is at stake in the implications of the decision, if not in the words of the opinion, than simply bringing federal and local law into accord upon matters clearly and exclusively within the constitutional power of the state to determine. It is one thing to require that kind of an accord in diversity cases when the question is merely whether the federal court must follow the law of the state as to burden of proof, <em>Cities Service Co. </em>v. <em>Dunlap, </em>308 U. S. 208; contributory negligence, <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>318 U. S. 109, 117; or perhaps in application of the so-called parol evidence rule. These ordinarily involve matters of substantive law, though nominated in terms of procedure. But in some instances their application may lie along the border between procedure or remedy and substance, where the one may or may not be in fact but another name for the other. It is exactly in this borderland, where procedural or remedial rights may or may not have the effect of determining the substantive ones completely, that caution is required in extending the rule of the <em>Erie </em>case by the very rule itself.</p>
<p id="b203-4">The words “substantive” and “procedural” or “remedial” are not talismanic. Merely calling a legal question by one or the other does not resolve it otherwise than as a purely authoritarian performance. But they have come to designate in a broad way large and distinctive legal domains within the greater one of the law and to mark, though often indistinctly or with overlapping limits, many divides between such regions.</p>
<p id="b203-5">One of these historically has been the divide between the substantive law and the procedural or remedial law to be applied by the federal courts in diversity cases, a division sharpened but not wiped out by <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins </em>and subsequent decisions extending the scope <page-number citation-index="1" label="116">*116</page-number>of its ruling. The large division between adjective law and substantive law still remains, to divide the power of Congress from that of the states and consequently to determine the power of the federal courts to apply federal law or state law in diversity matters.</p>
<p id="b204-5">This division, like others drawn by the broad allocation of adjective or remedial and substantive, has areas of admixture of these two aspects of the law. In these areas whether a particular situation or issue presents one aspect or the other depends upon how one looks at the matter. As form cannot always be separated from substance in a work of art, so adjective or remedial aspects cannot be parted entirely from substantive ones in these borderland regions.</p>
<p id="b204-6">Whenever this integration or admixture prevails in a substantial measure, so that a clean break cannot be made, there is danger either of nullifying the power of Congress to control not only how the federal courts may act, but what they may do by way of affording remedies, or of usurping that function, if the <em>Erie </em>doctrine is to be expanded judicially to include such situations to the utmost extent.</p>
<p id="b204-7">It may be true that if the matter were wholly fresh the barring of rights in equity by statutes of limitation would seem to partake more of the substantive than of the remedial phase of law. But the matter is not fresh and it is not without room for debate. A long tradition, in the states and here, as well as in the common law which antedated both state and federal law, has emphasized the remedial character of statutes of limitations, more especially in application to equity causes, on many kinds of issues requiring differentiation of such matters from more clearly and exclusively substantive ones. We have recently reaffirmed the distinction in relation to the power of a state to change its laws with retroactive effect, giving renewed vigor, if not new life to <em>Campbell v. </em>Holt, 115 <page-number citation-index="1" label="117">*117</page-number>U. S. 620. <em>Chase Securities Corp. </em>v. <em>Donaldson, </em>325 U. S. 304. Similar, though of course not identical, arguments were advanced in that case to bring about departure from the long-established rule, but without success. The tradition now in question is equally long and unvaried. I cannot say the tradition is clearly wrong in this case more than in that. Nor can I say, as was said in the <em>Erie </em>case, that the matter is beyond the power of Congress to control. If that be conceded, I think Congress should make the change if it is to be made. The <em>Erie </em>decision was rendered in 1938. Seven years have passed without action by Congress to extend the rule to these matters. That is long enough to justify the conclusion that Congress also regards them as not governed by <em>Erie </em>and as wishing to make no change. This should be reason enough for leaving the matter at rest until it decides to act.</p>
<p id="b205-4">Finally, this case arises from what are in fact if not in law interstate transactions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It involves the rights of security holders in relation to securities which were distributed not in New York or Ohio alone but widely throughout the country. They are the kind of rights which Congress acted to safeguard when it adopted the Securities and Exchange legislation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Specific provisions of that legislation are not involved in this litigation. The broad policies underlying it may be involved or affected, <page-number citation-index="1" label="118">*118</page-number>namely, by the existence of adequate federal remedies, whether judicial or legislative, for the protection of security holders against the misconduct of issuers or against the breach of rights by trustees. Even though the basic rights may be controlled by state law, in such situations the question is often a difficult one whether the law of one state or another applies; and this is true not only of rights clearly substantive but also of those variously characterized as procedural or remedial and substantive which involve the application of statutes of limitations.</p>
<p id="b206-4">Applicable statutes of limitations in state tribunals are not always the ones which would apply if suit were instituted in the courts of the state which creates the substantive rights for which enforcement is sought. The state of the forum is free to apply its own period of limitations, regardless of whether the state originating the right has barred suit upon it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Whether or not <em>the action </em>will be held to be barred depends therefore not upon the law of the state which creates the substantive right, but upon the law of the state where suit may be brought. This in turn will depend upon where it may be possible to secure service of process, and thus jurisdiction of the person of the defendant. It may be therefore that because of the plaintiff's inability to find the defendant in the jurisdiction which creates his substantive right, he will be foreclosed of remedy by the sheer necessity of going to the haven of refuge within which the defendant confines its “presence" for jurisdictional purposes. The law of the latter may bar the suit even though suit still would be allowed under the law of the state creating the substantive right.</p>
<p id="b206-5">It is not clear whether today's decision puts it into the power of corporate trustees, by confining their jurisdictional “presence" to states which allow their courts to give equitable remedies only within short periods of time, to <page-number citation-index="1" label="119">*119</page-number>defeat the purpose and intent of the law of the state creating the substantive right. If so, the “right” remains alive, with full-fledged remedy, by the law of its origin, and because enforcement must be had in another state, which affords refuge against it, the remedy and with it the right are nullified. I doubt that the Constitution of the United States requires this, or that the Judiciary Acts permit it. A good case can be made, indeed has been made, that the diversity jurisdiction was created to afford protection against exactly this sort of nullifying state legislation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b207-4">In my judgment this furnishes added reason for leaving any change, if one is to be made, to the judgment of Congress. The next step may well be to say that in applying the doctrine of laches a federal court must surrender its own judgment and attempt to find out what a state court sitting a block away would do with that notoriously amorphous doctrine.</p>
