**Concurrence Opinion**
 See Bell v. Clapp, 10 Johns. 263 (N. Y. 1813); 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries 288 (1769).  By restricting the issuance of war *582 rants, the Framers endeavored to preserve the jury’s role in regulating searches and seizures.  Amar, supra; Posner, Rethinking the Fourth Amendment, 1981 S. Ct. Rev. 49, 72-73; see also T. Taylor, Two Studies in Constitutional Interpretation 41 (1969).  Although the Fourth Amendment does not explicitly impose the requirement of a warrant, it is of course textually possible to consider that implicit within the requirement of reasonableness.  For some years after the (still continuing) explosion in Fourth Amendment litigation that followed our announcement of the exclusionary rule in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 (1914), our jurisprudence lurched back and forth between imposing a categorical warrant requirement and looking to reasonableness alone.  (The opinions preferring a warrant involved searches of structures.) Compare Harris v. United States, 331 U. S. 146 (1947), with Johnson v. United States, <citedDecision>333 U. S. 10</citedDecision> (1948); compare Trupiano v. United States, 334 U. S. 699 (1948), with United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950).  See generally Chimel v. California, 395 U. S. 752 (1969).  By the late 1960’s, the preference for a warrant had won out, at least rhetorically.  See Chimel; Coolidge v. New Hampshire, 403 U. S. 443 (1971).  The victory was illusory.  Even before today’s decision, the “warrant requirement” had become so riddled with exceptions that it was basically unrecognizable.  In 1985, one commentator cataloged nearly 20 such exceptions, including “searches incident to arrest.
