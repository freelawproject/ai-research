<p id="Aq1">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b242-4">- Having “some information that [the petitioner here] was selling narcotics,” three deputy sheriffs of the County of Los Angeles, on the morning of July 1, 1949, made for the two-story dwelling house in which Rochin lived with his mother, commonrlaw wife, brothers and sisters. Finding,the outside door open, they entered and then forced open the door to Rochin’s room, on the second floor. Inside they found petitioner sitting partly dressed on the side of the bed, upon which his wife was lying. On a “night stand” beside the bed the deputies spied two capsules. When asked “Whose stuff is this?” Rochin seized the capsules and put them in his mouth. A struggle ensued, in the course of which the three officers “jumped upon him” and attempted to extract, the capsules. The force they applied proved unavailing against Rochin’s resistance. He was handcuffed and taken to a hospital.' At the direction of one of the officers a doctor forced an emetic solution through a tube into Rochin’s stomach against his will. This “stomach pumping” produced vomiting. In the vomited matter were found two capsules which proved to contain morphine.</p>
<p id="b242-5">Rochin was brought to trial before a California Superior Court, sitting without a jury, on the charge of possessing “a preparation of morphine” in violation of the California Health and Safety Code, 1947, § 11,500. Rochin was convicted and sentenced to sixty days’ imprisonment. The chief evidence against him was the two capsules. They were admitted over petitioner’s objection, although the means of obtaining them was frankly set forth in the testimony by one of,the deputies, substantially as here narrated.</p>
<p id="b242-6">On appeal, the District Court of Appeal affirmed the Conviction, despite the finding that the officers “were <page-number citation-index="1" label="167">*167</page-number>guilty of unlawfully breaking into and entering defendant’s room and were guilty of unlawfully assaulting and battering defendant while in the room,” and “were guilty of unlawfully assaulting, battering, torturing and falsely imprisoning the defendant at the alleged hospital.” 101 Cal. App. 2d 140, 143, 225 P. 2d 1, 3. One of the three judges, while finding that “the record in this case reveals a shocking series of violations of constitutional rights,” concurred only because he felt bound by decisions of his Supreme Court. These, he asserted, “have been looked upon by law enforcement officers as an encouragement, if not an invitation, to the commission of such lawless acts.” <em>Ibid. </em>The Supreme Court of California denied without opinion Rochin’s petition for a hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Two justices dissented from this denial, and in doing so expressed themselves thus: “. . . a conviction which rests upon evidence of incriminating objects obtained from the body of the accused by physical abuse is as invalid as a conviction which rests upon a verbal confession extracted from him by such abuse. . . . Had the- evidence forced from the defendant’s lips consisted of an oral confession that he illegally possessed a drug ... he would have the protection of the rule of law which excludes coerced confessions from evidence. But because the evidence forced from his lips consisted of real objects the People of this state are permitted to base a conviction upon it. [We] find no valid ground of distinction between a verbal confession extracted by physical abuse and a confession wrested from defendant’s body by physical abuse.” 101 Cal. App. 2d 143, 149-150, 225 P. 2d 913, 917-918.</p>
<p id="b244-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="168">*168</page-number>This Court granted certiorari, 341 U. S. 939, because a serious question is raised as to the limitations which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes on the conduct of criminal proceedings by the States.</p>
<p id="b244-4">In our federal system the administration of criminal justice is predominantly committed to the care of the States. The power to define crimes belongs to Congress only as an appropriate means of carrying into execution its limited grant of legislative powers. U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 18. Broadly speaking, crimes in the United States are what the laws of the individual States, make them, subject to the limitations of Art. I, § 10, cl. 1, in the original Constitution, prohibiting bills of attainder and <em>ex post jacto </em>laws, and of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>
<p id="b244-5">These limitations, in the main, concern not restrictions upon the powers of the States to define crime, except in the restricted area where federal authority has pre-empted the field, but restrictions upon the manner in which the States may enforce their penal codes. Accordingly, in reviewing a State criminal conviction under a claim of right guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, from which is derived the most far-reaching and most frequent federal basis of challenging State criminal justice, “we must be deeply mindful of the responsibilities of the States for the enforcement of criminal laws, and exercise with due humility our merely negative function in subjecting convictions from state courts to the very narrow scrutiny which the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment authorizes.” <em>Malinski </em>v. <em>New York, </em>324 U. S. 401, 412, 418. Due process of law, “itself a historical product,” <em>Jackman </em>v. <em>Rosenbaum Co., </em>260 U. S. 22, 31, is not to be turned into a destructive dogma against the States in the .administration of their systems of criminal justice.</p>
<p id="b245-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="169">*169</page-number>However, this Court too has its responsibility. Regard for the requirements of the Due Process Clause “inescapably imposes upon this Court an exercise of judgment upon the whole course of the proceedings [resulting in a conviction] in order to ascertain whether they offend those canons of decency and fairness which express the notions of justice of English-speaking peoples even toward those charged with the most heinous offenses.” <em>Malinski </em>v. <em>New York, supra, </em>at 416-417. These standards of justice are not authoritatively formulated anywhere as though they were specifics. Due process of law is a summarized constitutional guarantee of respect for those personal immunities which, as Mr. Justice Cardozo twice wrote for the Court, are “so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,” <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>291 U. S. 97, 105, or are “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.” <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>302 U. S. 319, 325.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b245-4">The Court’s function in the observance of this settled conception of the Due Process Clause does, not leave us without adequate guides in subjecting State criminal procedures to constitutional judgment. In dealing not with the machinery of government but with human rights, the absence of formal exactitude, or want of fixity of meaning, is not an unusual or even regrettable attribute of constitutional provisions. Words being symbols do not speak without a gloss. On the one hand the gloss may be the deposit of history, whereby a term gains technical content. Thus the requirements of the Sixth and Seventh Amendments for trial by jury in the federal <page-number citation-index="1" label="170">*170</page-number>courts have a rigid meaning. No changes or chances can alter the content of the verbal symbol of “jury” — a body of twelve men who must reach a unanimous conclusion if the verdict is to go against the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the other hand, the gloss of some of the verbal symbols of the Constitution does not give them a fixed technical content. It exacts a continuing process of application.</p>
<p id="b246-4">When the gloss has thus not been fixed but is a function of the process of judgment, the judgment is bound to fall differently at different times and differently at the same time through different judges. Even more specific provisions, such as the guaranty of freedom of speech and the detailed protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, have inevitably evoked as sharp divisions in this Court as the least specific and most comprehensive protection of liberties, the Due Process Clause.</p>
<p id="b246-5">The vague contours of the Due Process Clause do not leave judges at large.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We may not draw on our merely personal and private notions and disregard the limits that bind judges in their judicial function. Even though the concept of due process of law is not final and fixed, these limits are derived from considerations that are fused in' the whole nature of our judicial process. See Cardozo, <page-number citation-index="1" label="171">*171</page-number>The Nature of the Judicial Process; The Growth of the Law; The Paradoxes of Legal Science. These are considerations deeply rooted in reason and in the compelling traditions of .the legal profession. The Due Process Clause places upon this Court the duty of exercising a judgment, within the narrow confines of judicial power in reviewing State convictions, upon interests of society pushing in opposite directions.</p>
<p id="b247-4">Due process of law thus conceived is not to be derided as resort to a revival of “natural law.” <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To believe that this judicial exercise of judgment could be avoided by freezing “due process of law” at some fixed stage of time or thought is to suggest that the most important aspect of constitutional adjudication is a function for inanimate machines and not for judges, for whom the independence safeguarded by Article III of the Constitution was designed and who are presumably guided by established standards of judicial behavior. Even cybernetics has not yet made that haughty claim. To practice the requisite detachment and to achieve sufficient objectivity no doubt demands of judges the habit of self-discipline and self-criticism, incertitude that one’s own views are incontestable and alert tolerance toward views-not shared. But <page-number citation-index="1" label="172">*172</page-number>these are precisely the presuppositions of our judicial process.. They are precisely the qualities society has a right to expect from those entrusted with ultimate judicial power.</p>
<p id="b248-4">Restraints on our jurisdiction are self-imposed only in the sense that there is from our decisions no immediate appeal short of impeachment or constitutional amendment. But that does not make due process of law a matter of judicial caprice. The faculties of the Due Process Clause may be indefinite and vague, but the mode of their ascertainment is not self-willed. In each case “due process of law” requires an evaluation based on a. disinterested inquiry pursued in the spirit of science, on a balanced order of facts exactly and fairly stated, on the detached consideration of conflicting claims, see <em>Hudson County Water Co. </em>v. <em>McCarter, </em>209 U. S. 349, 355, on a judgment not <em>ad hoc </em>and episodic but duly mindful of reconciling the needs both of continuity and of change in a progressive society.</p>
<p id="b248-5">Applying these general considerations to the circumstances of the present case, we are compelled to conclude that the proceedings by which this conviction was obtained do more than offend some fastidious squeamishness or private sentimentalism about combatting crime too energetically. This is conduct that shocks the conscience. Illegally breaking into the privacy of the petitioner, the struggle to open his mouth and remove what was there, the forcible extraction of his stomach’s contents — this course of proceeding by agents of government to obtain evidence is bound to offend even hardened sensibilities. They are methods too close to the rack and the screw to permit of constitutional differentiation.</p>
<p id="b248-6">It has long since ceased to be true that due process of law is heedless of the means by which otherwise'relevant and credible evidence is obtained. This was not true even before the series of recent cases enforced the constitutional principle that the States may not base convictions upon <page-number citation-index="1" label="173">*173</page-number>confessions, however much verified, obtained by ®0®r« cion. These decisions are not arbitrary exceptions to the comprehensive right of States to fashion their own rules of evidence for criminal trials. They are not sports in our constitutional law but applications of a general principle. They are only instances of the general requirement that States in their prosecutions respect certain decencies of civilized conduct. Due process of law, as a historic and generative principle, precludes defining, and thereby confining, these standards of conduct more precisély than to say that convictions cannot be brought about by methods that offend “a sense of justice.” See Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, speaking for a unanimous Court in <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>297 U. S. 278, 285-286. It would be a stultification of the responsibility which the course of constitutional history has cast upon this Court to hold that in order to convict a man the police cannot extract by force what is in his mind but can extract what is in his stomach.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b249-5">To attempt in this case to distinguish what lawyers call “real evidence” from verbal evidence is to ignore the reasons for excluding coerced confessions. Use of involuntary verbal confessions in State criminal trials is constitutionally obnoxious not only because of their unreliability. They are inadmissible under the Due Process Clause even though statements contained in them may be independently established as true. Coerced confessions offend the community’s sense of fair play and decency. So here, to sanction the brutal conduct which naturally enough was condemned by the court whose judgment is before us, would be to afford brutality the cloak of law. Nothing <page-number citation-index="1" label="174">*174</page-number>would be more calculated to discredit law and thereby to brutalize the temper of a society.</p>
<p id="b250-6">In deciding this case we do not heedlessly bring into question decisions in many States dealing with essentially different, even if related, problems. We therefore put to one side cases which have arisen in the State courts through use of modern methods and devices for discovering wrongdoers and bringing them to book. It does not fairly represent these decisions to suggest that they legalize force so brutal and so offensive to human dignity in securing evidence from a suspect as is revealed by this record. Indeed the California Supreme Court has not sanctioned this mode of securing a conviction. It merely exercised its discretion to decline a review of the conviction. All the California judges who have expressed themselves in this case have condemned the conduct in the strongest language.</p>
<p id="b250-7">We are not unmindful that hypothetical situations can be conjured up, shading imperceptibly from the circumstances of this case and by gradations producing practical differences despite seemingly logical extensions. But the Constitution is “intended to preserve practical and substantial rights, not to maintain theories.” <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Mills, </em>194 U. S. 451, 457.</p>
<p id="b250-8">On the facts of this case the’ conviction of the petitioner has been obtained by methods that offend the Due Process Clause. The judgment below must be</p>
