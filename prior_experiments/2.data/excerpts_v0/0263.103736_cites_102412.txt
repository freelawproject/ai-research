Passage 1:
pronounced, and that whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such state, and none others, could be pleaded in any other court in the United States." That view has survived substantially intact. Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U.S. 230. This Court only recently stated that Art. IV, ยง 1 and the Act of May 26, 1790 require that "not some, but full" faith and credit be given judgments of a state court. Davis v. Davis, 305 U.S. 32, 40. Thus, even though the cause of action could not be entertained in the state of the forum, either because it had been barred by the local statute of limitations or contravened local policy, the judgment thereon obtained in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit. See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290; Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 252 U.S. 411; Titus v. Wallick, 306 U.S. 282, 291. Some exceptions have been engrafted on the rule laid down by Chief Justice Marshall. But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in Broderick v. Rosner, <targetCase>294 U.S. 629</targetCase>, 642, "the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one." So far as judgments are concerned, the decisions,[5] as distinguished from dicta,[6] show that the *295 actual exceptions have been few and far between, apart from Haddock v. Haddock. For this Court has been reluctant to admit exceptions in case of judgments rendered by the courts of a sister state, since the "very purpose" of Art. IV, ยง 1 was "to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation." Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, pp. 276-277.
This Court, to be sure, has recognized that in case of statutes, "the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed," some "accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states" is necessary. Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 294 U.S. 532, 547. But that p

ne of the parties to the action, the court shall require corroboration of the evidence of such residence." L. 1931, p. 277.

[5]  Fall v. Eastin, 215 U.S. 1; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U.S. 386; Hood v. McGehee, 237 U.S. 611. These decisions refuse to require courts of one state to allow acts or judgments of another to control the disposition or devolution of realty in the former. They seem to rest on the doctrine that the state where the land is located is "sole mistress" of its rules of real property. See Hood v. McGehee, supra, p. 615; and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in Fall v. Eastin, supra, p. 14.

That the case of Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., 191 U.S. 373, is not an exception but only an appropriate application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens, see Broderick v. Rosner, <targetCase>294 U.S. 629</targetCase>, 642-643.
[6]  It has been repeatedly stated that the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to enforce the penal laws of another. See, for example, Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U.S. 657, 666; Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U.S. 243, 260; Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U.S. 145, 160.

But the question of whether a judgment based on a penalty is entitled to full faith and credit was reserved in Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U.S. 268, 279.
For other dicta that the application of the full faith and credit clause may be limited by the policy of the law of the forum, see Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, supra, p. 160; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 294 U.S. 532, 546; Broderick v. Rosner, supra, note 5, p. 642.
