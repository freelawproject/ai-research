**Combined Opinion**
322 , 327, 328; Grant v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218 , 241, 242. The principle of the immunity from state taxation of instrumentalities of the Federal Government, and of the corresponding immunity of state instrumentalities from Federal taxation  essential to the maintenance of our dual system  has its inherent limitations. It is aimed at the protection of the operations of government ( McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316 , 436), and the immunity does not extend "to anything lying outside or beyond governmental functions and their exertions." Indian Motocycle Co., v. United States, 283 U.S. 570 , 576, 579. Where the immunity exists, it is absolute, resting upon an "entire absence of power" ( Johnson v. Maryland, 254 U.S. 51 , 55, 56), but it does not exist "where no direct burden is laid upon the governmental instrumentality, and there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of government." Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U.S. 216 , 225. In this instance, the mere fact that a copyright is property derived from a grant by the United States is insufficient to support the claim of exemption. Nor does the fact that the grant is made in furtherance of a governmental policy of the United States, and because of the benefits which are deemed to accrue to the public in the execution of that policy, furnish ground for immunity. The disposition by the Government of public lands, in order to advance the general interest by promoting settlement, illustrates the principle and its limitation. The property of the United States is not subject to state taxation ( Van Brocklin v. Tennessee, ) 117 U.S. 151 , but the property of individual owners, although derived from the United States under its public land laws, may be taxed. The power to tax exists as soon as the ownership is changed.
