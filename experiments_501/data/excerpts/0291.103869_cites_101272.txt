 The validity of the taxes on the transfer of the land presents a somewhat different problem.  Some of these lands are exempt from direct taxation by virtue of explicit congressional command.  The Act of May 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 495 , for example, provides that Indians of a class which includes the three deceased should select up to 160 acres of his allotted, inherited or devised restricted lands, which “shall remain exempt from taxation while the title remains in the Indian designated ... or in any full-blood Indian heir or devisee,” while all other restricted lands are made subject to taxation by Oklahoma.  The State argues that congressional exemption of the land *611 from direct state taxation does not exempt the land from an estate tax, because of the principles announced in United States Trust Co. v. Helvering, supra. A majority of the Court concludes that this principle does not apply to Indian lands specifically exempted from direct taxation.  We therefore hold that the transfer of those lands which Congress has exempted from direct taxation by the State are also exempted from estate taxes.  To summarize: In No. 623, the transfer of the cash and securities is taxable, the transfer of the homestead and other allotted land, exempted under the Act of May 10, 1928, is not.  The 43 acres purchased for the intestate from her restricted funds was taxable at the time of her death, Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., <citedDecision>276 U. S. 575</citedDecision> , and hence is subject to the estate tax. In No. 624, the transfer of the cash and securities and the personal property is taxable.  The deceased died before the Act of May 10,1928, took effect, but her 240-acre holding was specifically exempt from direct taxation at the time of her death under § 19 of the Act of April 26, 1906, and the transfer of lands is therefore not taxable.  In No. 625, the same result as in No. 623 follows for the restricted lands which were appropriately selected for exemption under the Act of May 10, 1928, and for the personal property, cash, and securities.  The judgment and the insurance policy are to be treated as in a class with the personal property, cash, and securities.  It is conceded that the 160 acres of inherited property held by the deceased was taxable at the time of his death because in excess of the exemption permitted by the 1928 Act, and this land is, therefore, subject to the estate tax. While the status of the deceased’s four-fifths interest in a 40-acre tract is not clear from the record, no showing has been made that it is not taxable.  *612 The Government is entitled to recovery of the estate tax paid on the transfer of lands exempt from direct taxation, and to no more.  The judgment below is vacated and the cause is remanded to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

 14 At the time the allotments to the members of the Five Civilized Tribes were made there was no State of Oklahoma.  It had been held that Congress had power to lay taxes upon Indian property within Indian Territory, Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616 , and its creature, the Territorial government, was agitating for the taxation of Indian property.  15 Restrictions, designed to protect the Indians from themselves and the actions of third parties, including state governments, did not bar taxation by the federal government which was the guardian of their interests.  16 Accordingly, specific tax exemptions were written into the allotment acts.  17 Express provisions as to the taxable status of restricted property in the later legislation appear only where the immunity is being limited and expressly waived in part or the restrictions are being changed.  18 All of the lands which the opinion of the Court holds immune from Oklahoma’s estate tax because of express exemptions were therefore also exempt at the moment of death on the additional ground that they were then subject to restrictions imposed by Congress and the concomitant tax immunity had not been waived.  The other restricted lands in the estates are lands to whose taxation Congress has specifically consented, or else were of the type *622 to be taxable at the time of death under the decision in Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., <citedDecision>276 U. S. 575</citedDecision> .  The origin of restrictions upon the fund of members of the Five Civilized Tribes is somewhat different from that upon the lands, but the effect of the restrictions upon the taxability of the cash and securities in the three estates with which we are dealing is the same.  Proceeds from sales or leases of restricted lands have always been regarded as “trust” or “restricted” funds by the Secretary of the Interior, who by regulations has required them to be paid to him or his representatives and held for the benefit of the Indian owner.  19 The validity of those administrative restrictions and the power of the United States to enforce them have been recognized.  Parker v. Richard, 250 U. S. 235 ; Mott v. United States, 283 U. S. 747 .  And it has been held that funds so restricted by departmental regulation are exempt from state and local taxation.  See United States v. Thurston County, 143 F. 287 ; United States v. Hughes, 6 F. Supp. 972 .

 For example, among the statutes applicable to the Creeks and Seminóles, see §§ 3 and 4 of the Act of May 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 495 and 733.  See generally the statutes collected in Note 11, supra. Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567 ; Act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861 ; Act of June 30,1902, 32 Stat. 500 ; § 19 of Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; § 4 of the Act of May 10,1928, 45 Stat. 495 and 733.  See Sen. Doc. 169, 58th Cong., 2d Sess. It is for this historical reason that cases such as Superintendent v. Commissioner, 295 U. S. 418 , and Landman v. Commissioner, 123 F. 2d 787 , have no bearing upon a consideration of the effect of restrictions upon the power of a state to tax. See Act of July 1,1898, 30 Stat. 567 ; Act of March 1,1901, 31 Stat. 861 ; Act of June 30,1902, 32 Stat. 500 .  Act of April 26,1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; Act of May 10,1928, 45 Stat. 495 .  Since 1908 the regulations prescribed by the Secretary under § 2 of the Act of 1908, 35 Stat. 312 and related statutes governing oil, gas and other mining leases of restricted lands, have recognized that proceeds from such leases are restricted and have required that all such money be paid to a representative of the Secretary.  See 25 C. F. R. §§ 183.18 , 183.20; see also § 20 of the regulations approved April 20, 1908.  In Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., <citedDecision>276 U. S. 575</citedDecision> , the interest of an oil lessee in land purchased for an Indian by the Secretary of the Interior with the Indian’s restricted funds and conveyed to the Indian by a restricted form of deed pursuant to conditions imposed by the Secretary, was held subject to an Oklahoma oil production tax. The opinion emphasized the difference between “a mere conveyancer’s restriction” and action by Congress.  Two of the decedents died before the Act was passed.  The House Committee report, however, makes it clear that the restriction on funds was intended to be declaratory and retroactive.  H. Rep. No. 1015, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. In view of this there is no reason why the restricted funds in the estates of those decedents, held by the Secretary, should not be deemed covered by that Act, and hence tax exempt by virtue of the restrictions.
