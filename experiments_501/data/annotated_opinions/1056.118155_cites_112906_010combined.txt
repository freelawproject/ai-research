 "Good faith" is considered by OCC in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed, § 93(b)(2), but a penalty can be imposed even in the absence of bad faith.  The fact that petitioners' "good faith" was considered in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed in this case is irrelevant, as we look only to "the statute on its face" to determine whether a penalty is criminal in nature.  Kennedy, 372 U. S., at 169 .  Similarly, while debarment may be imposed for a "willful" disregard "for the safety or soundness of [an] insured depository institution," *105 willfulness is not a prerequisite to debarment; it is sufficient that the disregard for the safety and soundness of the institution was "continuing." § 1818(e)(1)(C)(ii).  Fourth, the conduct for which OCC sanctions are imposed may also be criminal (and in this case formed the basis for petitioners' indictments).  This fact is insufficient to render the money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, 518 U. S., at 292 , particularly in the double jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, <citedDecision>509 U. S. 688, 704</citedDecision> (1993) (rejecting "same-conduct" test for double jeopardy purposes).  Finally, we recognize that the imposition of both money penalties and debarment sanctions will deter others from emulating petitioners' conduct, a traditional goal of criminal punishment.  But the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence "may serve civil as well as criminal goals." Ursery, supra, at 292 ; see also Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 452 (1996) ("[F]orfeiture .  .  .  serves a deterrent purpose distinct from any punitive purpose").

 Accordingly, I am pleased to concur. Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment.  The maxim that "hard cases make bad law" may also apply to easy cases. As I shall explain, this case could easily be decided by the straightforward application of wellestablished precedent.  Neither such a disposition, nor anything in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, would require a reexamination of the central holding in United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), or of the language used in that unanimous opinion.  Any proper concern about the danger that that opinion might be interpreted too expansively would be more appropriately addressed in a case that was either incorrectly decided or that at least raised a close or difficult *107 question.  In my judgment it is most unwise to use this case as a vehicle for the substitution of a rather open-ended attempt to define the concept of punishment for the portions of the opinion in Halper that trouble the Court. Accordingly, while I have no hesitation about concurring in the Court's judgment, I do not join its opinion.  I As is evident from the first sentence of the Court's opinion, this is an extremely easy case. It has been settled since the decision in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932), that the Double Jeopardy Clause is not implicated simply because a criminal charge involves "essentially the same conduct" for which a defendant has previously been punished.  See, e. g., United States v. Dixon, <citedDecision>509 U. S. 688, 696, 704</citedDecision> (1993); Rutledge v. United States, 517 U. S. 292, 297 (1996).  Unless a second proceeding involves the "same offense" as the first, there is no double jeopardy.  The two proceedings at issue here involved different offenses that were not even arguably the same under Blockburger .  Under Blockburger `s "same-elements" test, two provisions are not the "same offense" if each contains an element not included in the other.  Dixon, <citedDecision>509 U. S., at 696</citedDecision> .  The penalties imposed on the petitioners in 1989 were based on violations of 12 U. S. C. §§ 84 (a)(1) and 375b (1982 ed.) and 12 CFR §§ 31.2 (b) and 215.4(b) (1986).  Each of these provisions required proof that extensions of credit exceeding certain limits were made, [1] but did not require proof of an intent to defraud or the making of any false entries in bank records.  The 1992 indictment charged violations of 18 U. S. C. §§ 371 , 656, and 1005 and alleged a conspiracy to willfully misapply *108 bank funds and to make false banking entries, as well as the making of such entries; none of those charges required proof that any lending limit had been exceeded.  Thus, I think it would be difficult to find a case raising a double jeopardy claim that would be any easier to decide than this one.  [2] II The Court not only ignores the most obvious and straightforward basis for affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals; it also has nothing to say about that court's explanation of why the reasoning in our opinion in United States v. Halper supported a rejection of petitioners' double jeopardy claim.  Instead of granting certiorari to consider a possible error in the Court of Appeals' reasoning or its judgment, the Court candidly acknowledges that it was motivated by "concerns about the wide variety of novel double jeopardy claims spawned in the wake of Halper .

 As the Court notes, ante, at 102, we have already recognized that Halper `s statements of standards for identifying what is criminally punitive under the Fifth Amendment needed revision, United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267 , 284 285, n. 2 (1996), and there is obvious sense in employing common criteria to point up the criminal nature of a statute for purposes of both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  See United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, 465 U. S. 354, 362-366 (1984); United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248-249 (1980); Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963); see also Ward, supra, at 254 ("[I]t would be quite anomalous to hold that [the statute] created a criminal penalty for the purposes of the Self-Incrimination Clause but a civil penalty for all other purposes").  Applying the Court's Kennedy-Ward criteria leads me directly to the conclusion of Justice Stevens's opinion concurring *113 in the judgment.  The fifth criterion calls for a court to determine whether "the behavior to which [the penalty] applies is already a crime." Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, supra, at 168-169 .  The efficient starting point for identifying constitutionally relevant "behavior," when considering an objection to a successive prosecution, is simply to apply the same-elements test as originally stated in Blockburger v. United States, 284 U. S. 299 (1932).  See United States v. Dixon, <citedDecision>509 U. S. 688</citedDecision> (1993).  When application of Blockburger under Kennedy-Ward shows that a successive prosecution is permissible even on the assumption that each penalty is criminal, the issue is necessarily settled.  Such is the case here, as Justice Stevens explains.  See ante, at 107 (opinion concurring in judgment).  Applying the KennedyWard criteria, therefore, I would stop just where Justice Stevens stops.  My acceptance of the Kennedy-Ward analytical scheme is subject to caveats, however.  As the Court points out, under Ward , once it is understood that a legislature intended a penalty to be treated as civil in character, that penalty may be held criminal for Fifth Amendment purposes (and, for like reasons, under the Sixth Amendment) only on the "clearest proof" of its essentially criminal proportions.

 We upheld such forfeitures, relying on the historical support for the notion that such forfeitures are civil and thus do not implicate double jeopardy.  Id., at 292 .  [1]  Title 12 U. S. C. § 84 (a)(1) prohibits total loans and extensions of credit by a national banking association to any one borrower from exceeding 15 percent of the bank's unimpaired capital and surplus.  Title 12 U. S. C. § 375b and 12 CFR §§ 31.2 (b) and 215.4(b) (1986) impose similar lending limits on loans to bank officers and other insiders.  [2]  Petitioners challenge this conclusion by relying on dicta from Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U. S.346, 370 (1997).  There, after rejecting a double jeopardy challenge to Kansas' Sexually Violent Predator Act, the Court added: "The Blockburger test, however, simply does not apply outside of the successive prosecution context." Ibid. This statement, pure dictum, was unsupported by any authority and contradicts the earlier ruling in United States v. Dixon, <citedDecision>509 U. S. 688, 704-705</citedDecision> (1993), that the Blockburger analysis applies to claims of successive punishment as well as successive prosecution.  See also 509 U. S., at 745-746 (Souter, J.,concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (explaining why the Blockburger test applies in the multiple punishments context).  I cannot imagine a good reason why Blockburger should not apply here.  [3]  "We .  .  .  hold that under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution."
