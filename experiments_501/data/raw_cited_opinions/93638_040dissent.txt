<p id="Az6">dissenting.</p>
<p id="b431-7">T dissent because, in my judgment, this case comes within th√© rule laid down in <em>Chicago, Milwaukee &amp;c. Railway </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>112 U. S. 377, and the decision unreasonably enlarges the exemption of the master from liability for injury to one of his servants by the fault of another.</p>
