 III The Court of Appeals upheld the judges claim of tax immunity upon the authority of Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920).  That ease arose in 1919 when Judge Walter Evans challenged Congress’ authority to include sitting federal judges within the scope of a federal income tax law that the Sixteenth Amendment had authorized a few years earlier.  See Revenue Act of 1918, §213, 40 Stat. 1065 (defining “gross income” to include judicial salaries).  In Evans itself, the Court held that the Compensation Clause barred application of the tax to Evans, who had been appointed a judge before Congress enacted the tax. 253 U. S., at 264 .  A few years later, the Court extended Evans , making clear that its rationale covered not only judges appointed before Congress enacted a tax but also judges whose appointments took place after the tax had become law. See Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501, 509 (1925).  Fourteen years after deciding Miles , this Court overruled Miles.  O’Malley v. Woodrough, <citedDecision>307 U.S. 277</citedDecision> (1939).  But, *567 as the Court of Appeals noted, this Court did not expressly overrule Evans itself.  64 F. 3d, at 650 .  The Court of Appeals added that, if “changes in judicial doctrine” had significantly undermined Evans’ holding, this “Court itself would have overruled the case.” Ibid. Noting that this case is like Evans (involving judges appointed before enactment of the tax), not like O’Malley (involving judges appointed after enactment of the tax), the Court of Appeals held that Evans controlled the outcome.  64 F. 3d, at 650 .  Hence application of both Medicare and Social Security taxes to these preenactment judges violated the Compensation Clause.  The Court of Appeals was correct in applying Evans to the instant ease, given that “it is this Court’s prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.” State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3,20 (1997); see also Rodriguez de Quijos v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989).
