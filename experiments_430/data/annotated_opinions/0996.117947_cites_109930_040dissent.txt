 Ante, at 225-226.  But two decisive distinctions separate those two cases. First, Metro Broadcasting involved a federal program, whereas Croson involved a city ordinance.  Metro Broadcasting thus drew primary support from Fullilove , which predated Croson and which Croson distinguished on the grounds of the federal-state dichotomy that the majority today discredits.  Although Members of today’s majority trumpeted the importance of that distinction in Croson, they now reject it in the name of “congruence.” It is therefore *257 quite wrong for the Court to suggest today that overruling Metro Broadcasting merely restores the status quo ante, for the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the Court reached.  Today's decision is an unjustified departure from settled law. Second, Metro Broadcasting’s holding rested on more than its application of “intermediate scrutiny.” Indeed, I have always believed that, labels notwithstanding, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program we upheld in that case would have satisfied any of our various standards in affirmative-action cases — including the one the majority fashions today.  What truly distinguishes Metro Broadcasting from our other affirmative-action precedents is the distinctive goal of the federal program in that case. Instead of merely seeking to remedy past discrimination, the FCC program was intended to achieve future benefits in the form of broadcast diversity.  Reliance on race as a legitimate means of achieving diversity was first endorsed by Justice Powell in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, <citedDecision>438 U. S. 265, 311-319</citedDecision> (1978).  Later, in Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), I also argued that race is not always irrelevant to governmental decisionmaking, see id., at 314-315 (Stevens, J., dissenting); in response, Justice O’Connor correctly noted that, although the school board had relied on an interest in providing black teachers to serve as role models for black students, that interest “should not be confused with the very different goal of promoting racial diversity among the faculty.” Id., at 288 , n. She then added that, because the school board had not relied on an interest in diversity, it was not “necessary to discuss the magnitude of that interest or its applicability in this case.” Ibid. Thus, prior to Metro Broadcasting, the interest in diversity had been mentioned in a few opinions, but it is perfectly clear that the Court had not yet decided whether that interest had sufficient magnitude to justify a racial classification.  Metro Broadcasting, of course, answered that question in the *258 affirmative.  The majority today overrules Metro Broadcasting only insofar as it is “inconsistent with [the] holding” that strict scrutiny applies to “benign” racial classifications promulgated by the Federal Government.  Ante, at 227.  The proposition that fostering diversity may provide a sufficient interest to justify such a program is not inconsistent with the Court’s holding today — indeed, the question is not remotely presented in this case — and I do not take the Court’s opinion to diminish that aspect of our decision in Metro Broadcasting.  The Court’s suggestion that it may be necessary in the future to overrule Fullilove in order to restore the fabric of the law, ante, at 235, is even more disingenuous than its treatment of Metro Broadcasting.  For the Court endorses the “strict scrutiny” standard that Justice Powell applied in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> , see ante, at 224, and acknowledges that he applied that standard in Fullilove as well, ante, at 218-219.  Moreover, Chief Justice Burger also expressly concluded that the program we considered in Fullilove was valid under any of the tests articulated in <citedDecision>Bakke</citedDecision> , which of course included Justice Powell’s.  448 U. S., at 492 .  The Court thus adopts a standard applied in Fullilove at the same time it questions that case’s continued vitality and accuses it of departing from prior law. I continue to believe that the Fullilove case was incorrectly decided, see id., at 532-554 (Stevens, J., dissenting), but neither my dissent nor that filed by Justice Stewart, id., at 522-532 , contained any suggestion that the issue the Court was resolving had been decided before.  13 As was true *259 of Metro Broadcasting, the Court in Fullilove decided an important, novel, and difficult question.  Providing a different answer to a similar question today cannot fairly be characterized as merely “restoring” previously settled law. V The Court’s holding in Fullilove surely governs the result in this case. The Public Works Employment Act of 1977 (1977 Act), 91 Stat. 116 , which this Court upheld in Fullilove , is different in several critical respects from the portions of the Small Business Act (SBA), 72 Stat. 384 , as amended, 15 U. S. C. § 631 et seq., and STURAA, 101 Stat. 132 , challenged in this case. Each of those differences makes the current program designed to provide assistance to DBE’s significantly less objectionable than the 1977 categorical grant of $400 million in exchange for a 10% set-aside in public contracts to “a class of investors defined solely by racial characteristics.” Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 532 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  In no meaningful respect is the current scheme more objectionable than the 1977 Act.  Thus, if the 1977 Act was constitutional, then so must be the SBA and STURAA.

 13 CFR § 124.208 (1995).  As with other phases of the statutory policy of encouraging the formation and growth of small business enterprises, this program is intended to facilitate entry and increase competition in the free market.  Significantly, the current program, unlike the 1977 set-aside, does not establish any requirement — numerical or otherwise — that a general contractor must hire DBE subcontractors.  The program we upheld in Fullilove required that 10% of the federal grant for every federally funded project be expended on minority business enterprises.  In contrast, the current program contains no quota.  Although it provides monetary incentives to general contractors to hire DBE subcontractors, it does not require them to hire DBE’s, *263 and they do not lose their contracts if they fail to do so. The importance of this incentive to general contractors (who always seek to offer the lowest bid) should not be underestimated; but the preference here is far less rigid, and thus more narrowly tailored, than the 1977 Act.  Cf. Bakke, <citedDecision>438 U. S., at 319-320</citedDecision> (opinion of Powell, J.) (distinguishing between numerical set-asides and consideration of race as a factor).  Finally, the record shows a dramatic contrast between the sparse deliberations that preceded the 1977 Act, see Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 549-550 (Stevens, J., dissenting), and the extensive hearings conducted in several Congresses before the current program was developed.  18 However we might *264 evaluate the benefits and costs — both fiscal and social — of this or any other affirmative-action program, our obligation to give deference to Congress’ policy choices is much more demanding in this case than it was in Fullilove .  If the 1977 program of race-based set-asides satisfied the strict scrutiny dictated by Justice Powell’s vision of the Constitution — a vision the Court expressly endorses today — it must follow as night follows the day that the Court of Appeals’ judgment upholding this more carefully crafted program should be affirmed.  VI My skeptical scrutiny of the Court’s opinion leaves me in dissent.  The majority’s concept of “consistency” ignores a difference, fundamental to the idea of equal protection, between oppression and assistance.  The majority’s concept of “congruence” ignores a difference, fundamental to our constitutional system, between the Federal Government and the States.
