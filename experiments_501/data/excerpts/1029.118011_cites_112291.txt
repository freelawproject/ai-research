**Lead Opinion**
 Previously, in conducting that inquiry, we have found authority to abrogate under only two provisions of the Constitution.  In Fitzpatrick, we recognized that the Fourteenth Amendment, by expanding federal power at the expense of state autonomy, had fundamentally altered the balance of state and federal power struck by the Constitution.  Id., at 455 .  We noted that § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment contained prohibitions expressly directed at the States and that § 5 of the Amendment expressly provided that “The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.” See id., at 453 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We held that through the Fourteenth Amendment, federal power extended to intrude upon the province of the Eleventh Amendment and therefore that § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment allowed Congress to abrogate the immunity from suit guaranteed by that Amendment.  In only one other case has congressional abrogation of the States’ Eleventh Amendment immunity been upheld.  In Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., <citedDecision>491 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1989), a plurality of the Court found that the Interstate Commerce Clause, Art. I, §8, cl. 3, granted Congress the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity, stating that the power to regulate interstate commerce would be “incomplete without the authority to render States liable in damages.” 491 U. S., at 19-20.  Justice White added the fifth vote necessary to the result in that case, but wrote separately in order to express *60 that he “[did] not agree with much of [the plurality’s] reasoning.” Id., at 57 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  In arguing that Congress through the Act abrogated the States’ sovereign immunity, petitioner does not challenge the Eleventh Circuit’s conclusion that the Act was passed pursuant to neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor the Interstate Commerce Clause.  Instead, accepting the lower court’s conclusion that the Act was passed pursuant to Congress’ power under the Indian Commerce Clause, petitioner now asks us to consider whether that Clause grants Congress the power to abrogate the States’ sovereign immunity.  Petitioner begins with the plurality decision in Union Gas and contends that “[t]here is no principled basis for finding that congressional power under the Indian Commerce Clause is less than that conferred by the Interstate Commerce Clause.” Brief for Petitioner 17.  Noting that the Union Gas plurality found the power to abrogate from the “plenary” character of the grant of authority over interstate commerce, petitioner emphasizes that the Interstate Commerce Clause leaves the States with some power to regulate, see, e. g., West Lynn Creamery, Inc. v. Healy, 512 U. S. 186 (1994), whereas the Indian Commerce Clause makes “Indian relations ... the exclusive province of federal law.” County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y., 470 U. S. 226, 234 (1985).  Contending that the Indian Commerce Clause vests the Federal Government with “the duty of protect-ting]” the tribes from “local ill feeling” and “the people of the States,” United States v. Kagama, 118 U. S. 375, 383-384 (1886), petitioner argues that the abrogation power is necessary “to protect the tribes from state action denying federally guaranteed rights.” Brief for Petitioner 20.  Respondents dispute petitioner’s analogy between the Indian Commerce Clause and the Interstate Commerce Clause.  They note that we have recognized that “the Interstate Commerce and Indian Commerce Clauses have very differ *61 ent applications." Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U. S. 163, 192 (1989), and from that they argue that the two provisions are “wholly dissimilar.” Brief for Respondents 21.  Respondents contend that the Interstate Commerce Clause grants the power of abrogation only because Congress’ authority to regulate interstate commerce would be “incomplete” without that “necessary” power.  Id., at 23, citing <citedDecision>Union Gas, supra, at 19-20</citedDecision> .  The Indian Commerce Clause is distinguishable, respondents contend, because it gives Congress complete authority over the Indian tribes.  Therefore, the abrogation power is not “necessary” to Congress’ exercise of its power under the Indian Commerce Clause.  10 Both parties make their arguments from the plurality decision in Union Gas, and we, too, begin there.  We think it clear that Justice Brennan’s opinion finds Congress’ power to abrogate under the Interstate Commerce Clause from the States’ cession of their sovereignty when they gave Congress plenary power to regulate interstate commerce.  See Union Gas, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 17</citedDecision> (“The important point ... is that the provision both expands federal power and contracts state power”).  Respondents’ focus elsewhere is misplaced.  While the plurality decision states that Congress’ power under the Interstate Commerce Clause would be incomplete without the power to abrogate, that statement is made solely in order to emphasize the broad scope of Congress’ authority over interstate commerce.  <citedDecision>Id., at 19-20</citedDecision> .  Moreover, respondents’ rationale would mean that where Congress has *62 less authority, and the States have more, Congress’ means for exercising that power must be greater.  We read the plurality opinion to provide just the opposite.  Indeed, it was in those circumstances where Congress exercised complete authority that Justice Brennan thought the power to abrogate most necessary.  <citedDecision>Id., at 20</citedDecision> (“Since the States may not legislate at all in [the aforementioned] situations, a conclusion that Congress may not create a cause of action for money damages against the States would mean that no one could do so. And in many situations, it is only money damages that will carry out Congress’ legitimate objectives under the Commerce Clause”).  Following the rationale of the Union Gas plurality, our inquiry is limited to determining whether the Indian Commerce Clause, like the Interstate Commerce Clause, is a grant of authority to the Federal Government at the expense of the States.  The answer to that question is obvious.  If anything, the Indian Commerce Clause accomplishes a greater transfer of power from the States to the Federal Government than does the Interstate Commerce Clause.  This is clear enough from the fact that the States still exercise some authority over interstate trade but have been divested of virtually all authority over Indian commerce and Indian tribes.  Under the rationale of Union Gas, if the States’ partial cession of authority over a particular area includes cession of the immunity from suit, then their virtually total cession of authority over a different area must also include cession of the immunity from suit.  See <citedDecision>id., at 42</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O’Connor and Kennedy, JJ., dissenting) (“[I]f the Article I commerce power enables abrogation of state sovereign immunity, so do all the other Article I powers”); see Ponca Tribe of Oklahoma v. Oklahoma, 37 F. 3d 1422, 1428 (CA10 1994) (Indian Commerce Clause grants power to abrogate), cert. pending, No. 94-1029; Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe v. South Dakota, 3 F. 3d 273, 281 (CA8 1993) (same); cf. Chavez v. Arte Publico *63 Press, 59 F. 3d 539, 546-547 (CA5 1995) (After Union Gas, Copyright Clause, U. S. Const., Art. I, §8, cl. 8, must grant Congress power to abrogate).  We agree with petitioner that the plurality opinion in Union Gas allows no principled distinction in favor of the States to be drawn between the Indian Commerce Clause and the Interstate Commerce Clause.  Respondents argue, however, that we need not conclude that the Indian Commerce Clause grants the power to abrogate the States’ sovereign immunity.  Instead, they contend that if we find the rationale of the Union Gas plurality to extend to the Indian Commerce Clause, then “Union Gas should be reconsidered and overruled.” Brief for Respondents 25.  Generally, the principle of stare decisis, and the interests that it serves, viz., “the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, .  .  .  reliance on judicial decisions, and ... the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process,” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991), counsel strongly against reconsideration of our precedent.  Nevertheless, we always have treated stare decisis as a “principle of policy,” Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940), and not as an “inexorable command,” Payne, 501 U. S., at 828 .  “[W]hen governing decisions are unworkable or are badly reasoned, ‘this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent.’” Id., at 827 (quoting Smith v. Allwright, 321 U. S. 649, 665 (1944)).  Our willingness to reconsider our earlier decisions has been “particularly true in constitutional cases, because in such cases ‘correction through legislative action is practically impossible.’” Payne, supra, at 828 (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 407 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)).  The Court in Union Gas reached a result without an expressed rationale agreed upon by a majority of the Court. We have already seen that Justice Brennan’s opinion received the support of only three other Justices.  See Union Gas, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 5</citedDecision> (Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens, JJ., *64 joined Justice Brennan).  Of the other five, Justice White, who provided the fifth vote for the result, wrote separately in order to indicate his disagreement with the plurality’s rationale, <citedDecision>id., at 57</citedDecision> (opinion concurring in judgment and dissenting in part), and four Justices joined together in a dissent that rejected the plurality’s rationale, <citedDecision>id., at 35-45</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., dissenting, joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and O’Connor and Kennedy, JJ.).  Since it was issued, Union Gas has created confusion among the lower courts that have sought to understand and apply the deeply fractured decision.  See, e.g., Chavez v. Arte Publico Press, supra, at 543-545 (“Justice White’s concurrence must be taken on its face to disavow” the plurality’s theory); 11 F. 3d, at 1027 (Justice White’s “vague concurrence renders the continuing validity of Union Gas in doubt”).  The plurality’s rationale also deviated sharply from our established federalism jurisprudence and essentially eviscerated our decision in Hans .  See Union Gas, supra, at 36 (“If Hans means only that federal-question suits for money damages against the States cannot be brought in federal court unless Congress clearly says so, it means nothing at all”) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  It was well established in 1989 when Union Gas was decided that the Eleventh Amendment stood for the constitutional principle that state sovereign immunity limited the federal courts’ jurisdiction under Article III. The text of the Amendment itself is clear enough on this point: “The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit.  ...” And our decisions since Hans had been equally clear that the Eleventh Amendment reflects “the fundamental principle of sovereign immunity [that] limits the grant of judicial authority in Art. III,” Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 97-98 (1984); see Union Gas, supra, at 38 (“ ‘[T]he entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given ...’”) (Scalia, *65 J., dissenting) (quoting Ex parte New York, 256 U. S. 490, 497 (1921)); see also cases cited at n. 7, supra. As the dissent in Union Gas recognized, the plurality’s conclusion — that Congress could under Article I expand the scope of the federal courts’ jurisdiction under Article III — “contradicted] our unvarying approach to Article III as setting forth the exclusive catalog of permissible federal-court jurisdiction.” Union Gas, supra, at 39.  Never before the decision in Union Gas had we suggested that the bounds of Article III could be expanded by Congress operating pursuant to any constitutional provision other than the Fourteenth Amendment.  Indeed, it had seemed fundamental that Congress could not expand the jurisdiction of the federal courts beyond the bounds of Article III. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803).  The plurality’s citation of prior decisions for support was based upon what we believe to be a misreading of precedent.  See Union Gas, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 40-41</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The plurality claimed support for its decision from a case holding the unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that the States may waive their sovereign immunity, see <citedDecision>id.,</citedDecision> at 14-15 (citing Parden v. Terminal Railway of Ala. Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184 (1964)), and cited as precedent propositions that had been merely assumed for the sake of argument in earlier cases, see 491 U. S., at 15 (citing Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S., at 475-476 , and n. 5, and County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N. Y. 470 U. S., at 252 ).  The plurality’s extended reliance upon our decision in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976), that Congress could under the Fourteenth Amendment abrogate the States’ sovereign immunity was also, we believe, misplaced.  Fitzpatrick was based upon a rationale wholly inapplicable to the Interstate Commerce Clause, viz., that the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted well after the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment and the ratification of the Constitution, oper *66 ated to alter the pre-existing balance between state and federal power achieved by Article III and the Eleventh Amendment.  Id., at 454 .  As the dissent in Union Gas made clear, Fitzpatrick cannot be read to justify “limitation of the principle embodied in the Eleventh Amendment through appeal to antecedent provisions of the Constitution.” Union Gas, supra, at 42 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  In the five years since it was decided, Union Gas has proved to be a solitary departure from established law. See Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U. S. 139 (1993).  Reconsidering the decision in Union Gas, we conclude that none of the policies underlying stare decisis require our continuing adherence to its holding.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice Souter, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer join, dissenting.  In holding the State of Florida immune to suit under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, the Court today holds for the first time since the founding of the Republic that Congress has no authority to subject a State to the jurisdiction of a federal court at the behest of an individual asserting a federal right.  Although the Court invokes the Eleventh Amendment as authority for this proposition, the only sense in which that amendment might be claimed as pertinent here was tolerantly phrased by Justice Stevens in his concurring opinion in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., <citedDecision>491 U. S. 1, 23</citedDecision> (1989).  There, he explained how it has come about that we have two Eleventh Amendments, the one ratified in 1795, the other (so-called) invented by the Court nearly a century later in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890).  Justice Stevens saw in that second Eleventh Amendment no bar to the exercise of congressional authority under the Commerce Clause in providing for suits on a federal question by individuals against a State, and I cap only say that after my own canvass of the matter I believe he was entirely correct in that view, for reasons given below.  His position, of course, was also the holding in Union Gas, which the Court now overrules and repudiates.  The fault I find with the majority today is not in its decision to reexamine Union Gas, for the Court in that case produced no majority for a single rationale supporting congressional authority.  Instead, I part company from the Court because I am convinced that its decision is fundamentally mistaken, and for that reason I respectfully dissent.  *101 f — 1 It is useful to separate three questions: (1) whether the States enjoyed sovereign immunity if sued in their own courts in the period prior to ratification of the National Constitution; (2) if so, whether after ratification the States were entitled to claim some such immunity when sued in a federal court exercising jurisdiction either because the suit was between a State and a nonstate litigant who was not its citizen, or because the issue in the case raised a federal question; and (3) whether any state sovereign immunity recognized in federal court may be abrogated by Congress.

 292 U. S., at 322 .  Many of those rules, as Justice Stevens points out, are prudential in nature and therefore not unalterable by Congress.  See ante, at 88-90.  22 More generally, the proponents of the Court’s theory have repeatedly referred to state sovereign immunity as a “background principle,” ante, at 72, “postulate,” Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 437 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), or “implicit limitation,” Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468, 496 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and as resting on the “inherent nature of sovereignty,” Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), rather than any explicit con *127 stitutional provision.  23 But whatever set of quotations one may prefer, taking heed of such jurisprudential creations in assessing the contents of federal common law is a very different thing from reading them into the Founding Document itself.  The most damning evidence for the Court’s theory that Hans rests on a broad rationale of immunity unalterable by Congress, however, is the Court’s proven tendency to disregard the post-Hans dicta in cases where that dicta would have mattered.  24 If it is indeed true that “private suits against States [are] not permitted under Article III (by virtue of the understanding represented by the Eleventh Amendment),” Union Gas, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 40</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), then it is hard to see how a State’s sovereign immunity may be waived any more than it may be abrogated by Congress.  See, e. g., Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 238 (recognizing that immunity may be waived).  After all, consent of a party is in all other instances wholly insufficient to create subject- *128 matter jurisdiction where it would not otherwise exist.  See, e. g., Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 398 (1975); see also E. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction § 7.6, p. 405 (2d ed. 1994) (noting that “allowing such waivers seems inconsistent with viewing the Eleventh Amendment as a restriction on the federal courts’ subject matter jurisdiction”).  Likewise, the Court’s broad theory of immunity runs doubly afoul of the appellate jurisdiction problem that I noted earlier in rejecting an interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment’s text that would bar federal-question suits.  See supra, at 109-116.  If “the whole sum of the judicial power granted by the Constitution to the United States does not embrace the authority to entertain a suit brought by a citizen against his own State without its consent,” Duhne v. New Jersey, 251 U. S. 311, 313 (1920), and if consent to suit in state court is not sufficient to show consent in federal court, see Atascadero, supra, at 241 , then Article III would hardly permit this Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction over issues of federal law arising in lawsuits brought against the States in their own courts.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 John Marshall recognized it over a century and a half ago in the very context of state sovereign immunity in federal-question cases: *185 “The jurisdiction of the court, then, being extended by the letter of the constitution to all cases arising under it, or under the laws of the United States, it follows that those who would withdraw any case of this description from that jurisdiction, must sustain the exemption they claim on the spirit and true meaning of the constitution, which spirit and true meaning must be so apparent as to overrule the words which its framers have employed.” Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat., at 379-380 .  Because neither text, precedent, nor history supports the majority’s abdication of our responsibility to exercise the jurisdiction entrusted to us in Article III, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The two Citizen-State Diversity Clauses provide as follows: “The judicial Power shall extend ... to Controversies .  .  .  between a State and Citizens of another State;... and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.” U. S. Const., Art. Ill, §2.  In his opinion in Union Gas, Justice Stevens referred to these Clauses as the “citizen-state” and “alien-state” Clauses, respectively, Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., <citedDecision>491 U. S. 1, 24</citedDecision> (1989) (concurring opinion).  I have grouped the two as “Citizen-State Diversity Clauses” for ease in frequent repetition here.  The first of these notions rests on the ancient maxim that “the Eing can do no wrong.” See, e. g., 1W.  Blackstone, Commentaries *244.  Professor Jaffe has argued this expression “originally meant precisely the contrary to what it later came to mean,” that is, “ ‘it meant that the king must not, was not allowed, not entitled, to do wrong.’” Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 4 (quoting L. Ehrlich, Proceedings Against the Crown (1216-1377), p. 42, in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History (P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921), p. 42); see also 1 Blackstone, supra, at *246 (interpreting the maxim to mean that “the prerogative of the crown extends not to do any injury”).  In any event, it is clear that the idea of the sovereign, or any part of it, being above the law in this sense has not survived in American law. See, e. g., Langford v. United States, 101 U. S. 341, 342-343 (1880); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 415 (1979).  The text reads that “[t]he Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; — to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; — to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; — to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; — to Controversies between two or more States; — between a State and Citizens of another State; — between Citizens of different States, — between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.” The one statement I have found on the subject of States’ immunity in federal-question eases was an opinion that immunity would not be applicable in these cases: James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania ratification debate, stated that the federal-question clause would require States to make good on pre-Revolutionary debt owed to English merchants (the enforcement of which was promised in the Treaty of 1783) and thereby “show the world that we make the faith of treaties a constitutional part of the character of the United States; that we secure its performance no longer nominally, for the judges of the United States will be enabled to carry it into effect, let the legislatures of the different states do what they may.” 2 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 490 (2d ed. 1836) (Elliot’s Debates).

 v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 27 (1990).  Although Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 412 (1821), is cited for this proposition, that case involved a State as plaintiff.  See generally Jackson, 98 Yale L. J., at 32-35 (rejecting the appeal/suit distinction).  The appeal/suit distinction, in any ease, makes no sense.  Whether or not an appeal is a “suit” in its own right, it is certainly a means by which an appellate court exercises jurisdiction over a “suit” that began in the courts below.  Cf. Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58 (1982) (per curiam) (“The filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance — it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal”).  See also <citedDecision>Pennsylvania</citedDecision> v. Union Gas Co., <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 31</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“If this text [of the Eleventh Amendment] were intended as a comprehensive description of state sovereign immunity in federal courts ... then it would unquestionably be most reasonable to interpret it as providing immunity only when the sole basis of federal jurisdiction is the diversity of citizenship that it describes (which of course tracks some of the diversity jurisdictional grants in U. S. Const., Art. Ill, §2).  For there is no plausible reason why one would wish to protect a State from being sued in federal court for violation of federal law .  .  .  when the plaintiff is a citizen of another State or country, but to permit a State to be sued there when the plaintiff is citizen of the State itself”).  The Court does suggest that the drafters of the Eleventh Amendment may not have had federal-question jurisdiction in mind, in the apparent belief that this somehow supports its reading.  Ante, at 69-70.

 The point, however, is not that historical circumstance may undermine an otherwise defensible decision; on the contrary, it is just because Hans is so utterly indefensible on the merits of its legal analysis *123 that one is forced to look elsewhere in order to understand how the Court could have gone so far wrong.  Nor is there anything new or remarkable in taking such a look, for we have sought similar explanations in other cases. In Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U. S. 219 (1987), for example, we suggested that the Court’s holding in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861), that “the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it,” id., at 107 , was influenced by “the looming shadow of a Civil War,” Branstad, supra, at 227 , and we ultimately determined that Dennison should be overruled, 483 U. S., at 230.  The author of the Court’s opinion today joined that analysis, as did the other Members of today’s majority who were then on the Court. See ibid. (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (joining the relevant portion of the majority opinion); id., at 231 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (same).  See also Georgia Railroad & Banking Co. v. Redwine, 342 U. S. 299, 304 (1952) (same); Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U. S. 516, 524 (1899) (same).  Even Justice Scalia’s dissent in Union Gas, the reasoning of which the majority adopts today, acknowledged that its view of sovereign immunity depended upon “some other constitutional principle beyond the immediate text of the Eleventh Amendment.” 491 U. S., at 31 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  To the extent that our prior eases do refer to Hans immunity as part of the Eleventh Amendment, they can only be referring to Justice Stevens’s “other” Eleventh Amendment.  Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U. S. 30, 53 (1994) (Stevens, J., concurring); see also <citedDecision>Pennsylvania</citedDecision> v. Union Gas Co., supra, at 23-29 (Stevens, J., concurring) (same).  See also Union Gas, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 31-32</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“What we said in Hans was, essentially, that the Eleventh Amendment was important not merely for what it said but for what it reflected: a consensus that the doctrine of sovereign immunity, for States as well as for the Federal Government, was part of the understood background against which the Constitution was adopted, and which its jurisdictional provisions did not mean to sweep away”); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 440 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (interpreting Monaco as *125 “reifying] on precepts underlying but not explicit in Art. Ill and the Eleventh Amendment”).  There are good reasons not to take many of these statements too seriously.  Some are plainly exaggerated; for example, the suggestion in Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), that “[a] state’s freedom from litigation was established as a constitutional right through the Eleventh Amendment” obviously ignores a State’s liability to suit by other States, see, e. g., South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286 (1904), and by the National Government, see, e. g., United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892).  See also Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 420, n. 19 (noting that “the Eleventh Amendment has not accorded the States absolute sovereign immunity in federal-court actions”).  Similarly, statements such as in Ex parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497 , that “the entire judicial *126 power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given” should not necessarily be taken as affirming that Article III itself incorporated a constitutional immunity doctrine.  How else to explain Justice Harlan’s concurring opinion in Hans , which stated, practically in the same breath, that “a suit directly against a State by one of its own citizens is not one to which the judicial power of the United States extends,” and that Chisholm “was based upon a sound interpretation of.  the Constitution as that instrument then was”?

Hall, 440 U. S., at 437 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), or “implicit limitation,” Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U. S. 468, 496 (1987) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and as resting on the “inherent nature of sovereignty,” Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), rather than any explicit con *127 stitutional provision.  23 But whatever set of quotations one may prefer, taking heed of such jurisprudential creations in assessing the contents of federal common law is a very different thing from reading them into the Founding Document itself.  The most damning evidence for the Court’s theory that Hans rests on a broad rationale of immunity unalterable by Congress, however, is the Court’s proven tendency to disregard the post-Hans dicta in cases where that dicta would have mattered.  24 If it is indeed true that “private suits against States [are] not permitted under Article III (by virtue of the understanding represented by the Eleventh Amendment),” Union Gas, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 40</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), then it is hard to see how a State’s sovereign immunity may be waived any more than it may be abrogated by Congress.  See, e. g., Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 238 (recognizing that immunity may be waived).  After all, consent of a party is in all other instances wholly insufficient to create subject- *128 matter jurisdiction where it would not otherwise exist.  See, e. g., Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 398 (1975); see also E. Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction § 7.6, p. 405 (2d ed. 1994) (noting that “allowing such waivers seems inconsistent with viewing the Eleventh Amendment as a restriction on the federal courts’ subject matter jurisdiction”).  Likewise, the Court’s broad theory of immunity runs doubly afoul of the appellate jurisdiction problem that I noted earlier in rejecting an interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment’s text that would bar federal-question suits.  See supra, at 109-116.  If “the whole sum of the judicial power granted by the Constitution to the United States does not embrace the authority to entertain a suit brought by a citizen against his own State without its consent,” Duhne v. New Jersey, 251 U. S. 311, 313 (1920), and if consent to suit in state court is not sufficient to show consent in federal court, see Atascadero, supra, at 241 , then Article III would hardly permit this Court to exercise appellate jurisdiction over issues of federal law arising in lawsuits brought against the States in their own courts.

 John Marshall recognized it over a century and a half ago in the very context of state sovereign immunity in federal-question cases: *185 “The jurisdiction of the court, then, being extended by the letter of the constitution to all cases arising under it, or under the laws of the United States, it follows that those who would withdraw any case of this description from that jurisdiction, must sustain the exemption they claim on the spirit and true meaning of the constitution, which spirit and true meaning must be so apparent as to overrule the words which its framers have employed.” Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat., at 379-380 .  Because neither text, precedent, nor history supports the majority’s abdication of our responsibility to exercise the jurisdiction entrusted to us in Article III, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The two Citizen-State Diversity Clauses provide as follows: “The judicial Power shall extend ... to Controversies .  .  .  between a State and Citizens of another State;... and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.” U. S. Const., Art. Ill, §2.  In his opinion in Union Gas, Justice Stevens referred to these Clauses as the “citizen-state” and “alien-state” Clauses, respectively, Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., <citedDecision>491 U. S. 1, 24</citedDecision> (1989) (concurring opinion).  I have grouped the two as “Citizen-State Diversity Clauses” for ease in frequent repetition here.  The first of these notions rests on the ancient maxim that “the Eing can do no wrong.” See, e. g., 1W.  Blackstone, Commentaries *244.  Professor Jaffe has argued this expression “originally meant precisely the contrary to what it later came to mean,” that is, “ ‘it meant that the king must not, was not allowed, not entitled, to do wrong.’” Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 4 (quoting L. Ehrlich, Proceedings Against the Crown (1216-1377), p. 42, in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History (P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921), p. 42); see also 1 Blackstone, supra, at *246 (interpreting the maxim to mean that “the prerogative of the crown extends not to do any injury”).  In any event, it is clear that the idea of the sovereign, or any part of it, being above the law in this sense has not survived in American law. See, e. g., Langford v. United States, 101 U. S. 341, 342-343 (1880); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 415 (1979).  The text reads that “[t]he Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; — to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; — to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; — to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; — to Controversies between two or more States; — between a State and Citizens of another State; — between Citizens of different States, — between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.” The one statement I have found on the subject of States’ immunity in federal-question eases was an opinion that immunity would not be applicable in these cases: James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania ratification debate, stated that the federal-question clause would require States to make good on pre-Revolutionary debt owed to English merchants (the enforcement of which was promised in the Treaty of 1783) and thereby “show the world that we make the faith of treaties a constitutional part of the character of the United States; that we secure its performance no longer nominally, for the judges of the United States will be enabled to carry it into effect, let the legislatures of the different states do what they may.” 2 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 490 (2d ed. 1836) (Elliot’s Debates).

 v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 27 (1990).  Although Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 412 (1821), is cited for this proposition, that case involved a State as plaintiff.  See generally Jackson, 98 Yale L. J., at 32-35 (rejecting the appeal/suit distinction).  The appeal/suit distinction, in any ease, makes no sense.  Whether or not an appeal is a “suit” in its own right, it is certainly a means by which an appellate court exercises jurisdiction over a “suit” that began in the courts below.  Cf. Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58 (1982) (per curiam) (“The filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance — it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal”).  See also <citedDecision>Pennsylvania</citedDecision> v. Union Gas Co., <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 31</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“If this text [of the Eleventh Amendment] were intended as a comprehensive description of state sovereign immunity in federal courts ... then it would unquestionably be most reasonable to interpret it as providing immunity only when the sole basis of federal jurisdiction is the diversity of citizenship that it describes (which of course tracks some of the diversity jurisdictional grants in U. S. Const., Art. Ill, §2).  For there is no plausible reason why one would wish to protect a State from being sued in federal court for violation of federal law .  .  .  when the plaintiff is a citizen of another State or country, but to permit a State to be sued there when the plaintiff is citizen of the State itself”).  The Court does suggest that the drafters of the Eleventh Amendment may not have had federal-question jurisdiction in mind, in the apparent belief that this somehow supports its reading.  Ante, at 69-70.

 The point, however, is not that historical circumstance may undermine an otherwise defensible decision; on the contrary, it is just because Hans is so utterly indefensible on the merits of its legal analysis *123 that one is forced to look elsewhere in order to understand how the Court could have gone so far wrong.  Nor is there anything new or remarkable in taking such a look, for we have sought similar explanations in other cases. In Puerto Rico v. Branstad, 483 U. S. 219 (1987), for example, we suggested that the Court’s holding in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861), that “the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it,” id., at 107 , was influenced by “the looming shadow of a Civil War,” Branstad, supra, at 227 , and we ultimately determined that Dennison should be overruled, 483 U. S., at 230.  The author of the Court’s opinion today joined that analysis, as did the other Members of today’s majority who were then on the Court. See ibid. (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (joining the relevant portion of the majority opinion); id., at 231 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (same).  See also Georgia Railroad & Banking Co. v. Redwine, 342 U. S. 299, 304 (1952) (same); Fitts v. McGhee, 172 U. S. 516, 524 (1899) (same).  Even Justice Scalia’s dissent in Union Gas, the reasoning of which the majority adopts today, acknowledged that its view of sovereign immunity depended upon “some other constitutional principle beyond the immediate text of the Eleventh Amendment.” 491 U. S., at 31 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  To the extent that our prior eases do refer to Hans immunity as part of the Eleventh Amendment, they can only be referring to Justice Stevens’s “other” Eleventh Amendment.  Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U. S. 30, 53 (1994) (Stevens, J., concurring); see also <citedDecision>Pennsylvania</citedDecision> v. Union Gas Co., supra, at 23-29 (Stevens, J., concurring) (same).  See also Union Gas, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 31-32</citedDecision> (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“What we said in Hans was, essentially, that the Eleventh Amendment was important not merely for what it said but for what it reflected: a consensus that the doctrine of sovereign immunity, for States as well as for the Federal Government, was part of the understood background against which the Constitution was adopted, and which its jurisdictional provisions did not mean to sweep away”); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 440 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (interpreting Monaco as *125 “reifying] on precepts underlying but not explicit in Art. Ill and the Eleventh Amendment”).  There are good reasons not to take many of these statements too seriously.  Some are plainly exaggerated; for example, the suggestion in Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), that “[a] state’s freedom from litigation was established as a constitutional right through the Eleventh Amendment” obviously ignores a State’s liability to suit by other States, see, e. g., South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286 (1904), and by the National Government, see, e. g., United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892).  See also Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 420, n. 19 (noting that “the Eleventh Amendment has not accorded the States absolute sovereign immunity in federal-court actions”).  Similarly, statements such as in Ex parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497 , that “the entire judicial *126 power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given” should not necessarily be taken as affirming that Article III itself incorporated a constitutional immunity doctrine.  How else to explain Justice Harlan’s concurring opinion in Hans , which stated, practically in the same breath, that “a suit directly against a State by one of its own citizens is not one to which the judicial power of the United States extends,” and that Chisholm “was based upon a sound interpretation of.  the Constitution as that instrument then was”?
