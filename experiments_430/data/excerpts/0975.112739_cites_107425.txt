*301 Justice Stevens delivered the opinion of the Court. This case, like National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., <citedDecision>386 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1967), involves a State’s attempt to require an out-of-state mail-order house that has neither outlets nor sales representatives in the State to collect and pay a use tax on goods purchased for use within the State.  In Bellas Hess we held that a similar Illinois statute violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and created an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce.  In particular, we ruled that a “seller whose only connection with customers in the State is by common carrier or the United States mail” lacked the requisite minimum contacts with the State.  <citedDecision>Id., at 758</citedDecision> .  In this case, the Supreme Court of North Dakota declined to follow Bellas Hess because “the tremendous social, economic, commercial, and legal innovations” of the past quarter-century have rendered its holding “obsolete].” 470 N. W. 2d 203, 208 (1991).  Having granted certiorari, 502 U. S. 808 , we must either reverse the State Supreme Court *302 or overrule Bellas Hess.  While we agree with much of the state court’s reasoning, we take the former course.  I Quill is a Delaware corporation with offices and warehouses in Illinois, California, and Georgia.  None of its employees work or reside in North Dakota, and its ownership of tangible property in that State is either insignificant or nonexistent.  1 Quill sells office equipment and supplies; it solicits business through catalogs and flyers, advertisements in national periodicals, and telephone calls.
**Lead Opinion**
 Consequently, the State, through its Tax Commissioner, filed this action to require Quill to pay taxes (as well as interest and penalties) on all such sales made after July 1, 1987.  The trial court ruled in Quill’s favor, finding the case indistinguishable from Bellas Hess; specifically, it found that because the State had not shown that it had spent tax revenues for the benefit of the mail-order business, there was no “nexus to allow the state to define retailer in the manner it chose.” App. to Pet. for Cert. A41.  The North Dakota Supreme Court reversed, concluding that “wholesale changes” in both the economy and the law made it inappropriate to follow Bellas Hess today.  470 N. W. 2d, at 213 .  The principal economic change noted by the court was the remarkable growth of the mail-order business “from a relatively inconsequential market niche” in 1967 to a “goliath” with annual sales that reached “the staggering figure of $183.3 billion in 1989.” Id., at 208,209 .  Moreover, the court observed, advances in computer technology greatly eased the burden of compliance with a “‘welter of complicated obligations’ ” imposed by state and local taxing authorities.  Id., at 215 (quoting Bellas Hess, <citedDecision>386 U. S., at 759-760</citedDecision> ).  Equally important, in the court’s view, were the changes in the “legal landscape.” With respect to the Commerce Clause, the court emphasized that Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), rejected the line of cases holding that the direct taxation of interstate commerce was *304 impermissible and adopted instead a “consistent and rational method of inquiry [that focused on] the practical effect of [the] challenged tax.” Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 443 (1980).  This and subsequent rulings, the court maintained, indicated that the Commerce Clause no longer mandated the sort of physical-presence nexus suggested in Bellas Hess.  Similarly, with respect to the Due Process Clause, the North Dakota court observed that cases following Bellas Hess had not construed “minimum contacts” to require physical presence within a State as a prerequisite to the legitimate exercise of state power.  The state court then concluded that “the Due Process requirement of a ‘minimal connection’ to establish nexus is encompassed within the Complete Auto test” and that the relevant inquiry under the latter test was whether “the state has provided some protection, opportunities, or benefit for which it can expect a return.” 470 N. W. 2d, at 216 .  Turning to the case at hand, the state court emphasized that North Dakota had created “an economic climate that fosters demand for” Quill’s products, maintained a legal infrastructure that protected that market, and disposed of 24 tons of catalogs and flyers mailed by Quill into the State every year.  Id., at 218-219 .  Based on these facts, the court concluded that Quill’s “economic presence” in North Dakota depended on services and benefits provided by the State and therefore generated “a constitutionally sufficient nexus to justify imposition of the purely administrative duty of collecting and remitting the use tax.” Id., at 219 .  2 *305 II As in a number of other cases involving the application of state taxing statutes to out-of-state sellers, our holding in Bellas Hess relied on both the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause.  Although the “two claims are closely related,” Bellas Hess, <citedDecision>386 U. S., at 756</citedDecision> , the Clauses pose distinct limits on the taxing powers of the States.  Accordingly, while a State may, consistent with the Due Process Clause, have the authority to tax a particular taxpayer, imposition of the tax may nonetheless violate the Commerce Clause.  See, e. g., Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232 (1987).  The two constitutional requirements differ fundamentally, in several ways.  As discussed at greater length below, see Part IV, infra, the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause reflect different constitutional concerns.  Moreover, while Congress has plenary power to regulate commerce among the States and thus may authorize state actions that burden interstate commerce, see International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310, 315 (1945), it does not similarly have the power to authorize violations of the Due Process Clause.  Thus, although we have not always been precise in distinguishing between the two, the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause are analytically distinct.

 Yet it may fall because of its burdening effect upon the commerce.  And, although the two notions cannot always be separated, clarity of consideration and of decision would be promoted if the two issues are approached, where they are presented, at least tentatively as if they were separate and distinct, not intermingled ones.” International Harvester Co. v. Department of Treasury, 322 U. S. 340, 353 (1944) (Rutledge, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Heeding Justice Rutledge’s counsel, we consider each constitutional limit in turn.  Ill The Due Process Clause “requires some definite link, some minimum connection, between a state and the person, property or transaction it seeks to tax,” Miller Brothers Co. v. Maryland, 347 U. S. 340, 344-345 (1954), and that the “income attributed to the State for tax purposes must be rationally related to ‘values connected with the taxing State,’” Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U. S. 267, 273 (1978) (citation omitted).  Here, we are concerned primarily with the first of these requirements.  Prior to Bellas Hess, we had held that that requirement was satisfied in a variety of circumstances involving use taxes.  For example, the presence of sales personnel in the State 3 or the maintenance of local retail stores in the State 4 justified the exercise of that power because the seller’s local activities were “plainly accorded the protection and services of the taxing State.” Bellas Hess, <citedDecision>386 U. S., at 757</citedDecision> .  The furthest extension of that power was recognized in Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S. 207 (1960), in which the Court upheld a use tax despite the fact that all of the seller’s in-state solicitation was performed by independent contractors.  These cases all involved some sort of physical presence within the State, and in Bellas Hess *307 the Court suggested that such presence was not only sufficient for jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause, but also necessary.  We expressly declined to obliterate the “sharp distinction ... between mail-order sellers with retail outlets, solicitors, or property within a State, and those who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as a part of a general interstate business.” <citedDecision>386 U. S., at 758</citedDecision> .  Our due process jurisprudence has evolved substantially in the 25 years since Bellas Hess, particularly in the area of judicial jurisdiction.  Building on the seminal case of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U. S. 310 (1945), we have framed the relevant inquiry as whether a defendant had minimum contacts with the jurisdiction “such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend ‘traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.’” Id., at 316 (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U. S. 457, 463 (1940)).  In that spirit, we have abandoned more formalistic tests that focused on a defendant’s “presence” within a State in favor of a more flexible inquiry into whether a defendant’s contacts with the forum made it reasonable, in the context of our federal system of Government, to require it to defend the suit in that State.  In Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 212 (1977), the Court extended the flexible approach that International Shoe had prescribed for purposes of in personam jurisdiction to in rem jurisdiction, concluding that “all assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in International Shoe and its progeny.” Applying these principles, we have held that if a foreign corporation purposefully avails itself of the benefits of an economic market in the forum State, it may subject itself to the State’s in personam jurisdiction even if it has no physical presence in the State.  As we explained in Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U. S. 462 (1985): “Jurisdiction in these circumstances may not be avoided merely because the defendant did not physi *308 cally enter the forum State.  Although territorial presence frequently will enhance a potential defendant’s affiliation with a State and reinforce the reasonable foreseeability of suit there, it is an inescapable fact of modern commercial life that a substantial amount of business is transacted solely by mail and wire communications across state lines, thus obviating the need for physical presence within a State in which business is conducted.

 Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 312 U. S. 369 (1941).  Under our current Commerce Clause jurisprudence, “with certain restrictions, interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes.” D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 31 (1988); see also Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 623-624 (1981) (“It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of [the] state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  North Dakota’s use tax illustrates well how a state tax might unduly burden interstate commerce.  On its face, North Dakota law imposes a collection duty on every vendor who advertises in the State three times in a single year.  Thus, absent the Bellas Hess rule, a publisher who included a subscription card in three issues of its magazine, a vendor whose radio advertisements were heard in North Dakota on three occasions, and a corporation whose telephone sales force made three calls into the State, all would be subject to the collection duty.  What is more significant, similar obligations might be imposed by the Nation’s 6,000-plus taxing jurisdictions.  See National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., <citedDecision>386 U. S. 753, 769-760</citedDecision> (1967) (noting that the “many variations in rates of tax, in allowable exemptions, and in administrative and record-keeping requirements could entangle [a mail-order house] in a virtual welter of complicated obligations”) (footnotes omitted); see also Shaviro, An Economic and Political Look at Federalism in Taxation, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 895 , 925-926 (1992).  We have sometimes stated that the “Complete Auto test, while responsive to Commerce Clause dictates, encompasses as well .  .  .  due process requirement^].” Trinova Corp. v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 498 U. S. 358, 373 (1991).  Although such comments might suggest that every tax that passes contemporary Commerce Clause analysis is also valid under the Due Process Clause, it does not follow that the converse is as well *314 true: A tax may be consistent with due process and yet unduly burden interstate commerce.  See, e. g., Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232 (1987).
**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., 386 U. S. 763 (1967), held that the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution prohibit a State from imposing the duty of use-tax collection and payment upon a seller whose only connection with the State is through common carrier or the United States mail. I agree with the Court that the Due Process Clause holding of Bellas Hess should be overruled. Even before Bellas Hess, we had held, correctly I think, that state regulatory jurisdiction could be asserted on the basis of contacts with the State through the United States mail. See Travelers Health Assn. v. Virginia ex rel. State Corp. Comm’n, 339 U. S. 643, 646-650 (1950) (blue sky laws). It is difficult to discern any principled basis for distinguishing between jurisdiction to regulate and jurisdiction to tax. As an original matter, it might have been possible to distinguish between jurisdiction to tax and jurisdiction to compel collection of taxes as agent for the State, but we have rejected that. National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551, 558 (1977); Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S. 207, 211 (1960). I agree with the Court, moreover, that abandonment of Bellas Hess’ due process holding is compelled by reasoning “ [comparable” to that contained in our post-1967 cases dealing with state jurisdiction to adjudicate. Ante; at 308. I do not understand this to mean that the due process standards for *320 adjudicative jurisdiction and those for legislative (or prescriptive) jurisdiction are necessarily identical; and on that basis I join Parts I, II, and III of the Court’s opinion. Compare Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102 (1987), with American Oil Co. v. Neill, 380 U. S. 451 (1965). I also agree that the Commerce Clause holding of Bellas Hess should not be overruled. Unlike the Court, however, I would not revisit the merits of that holding, but would adhere to it on the basis of stare decisis. American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, 496 U. S. 167, 204 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment). Congress has the final say over regulation of interstate commerce, and it can change the rule of Bellas Hess by simply saying so. We have long recognized that the doctrine of stare decisis has “special force” where “Congress remains free to alter what we have done.” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172-173 (1989). See also Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm’n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977). Moreover, the demands of the doctrine are “at their acme . . . where reliance interests are involved.” Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 828 (1991). As the Court notes, “the Bellas Hess rule has engendered substantial reliance and has become part of the basic framework of a sizable industry.” Ante, at 317. I do not share Justice White’s view that we may disregard these reliance interests because it has become unreasonable to rely upon Bellas Hess. Post, at 331-332. Even assuming for the sake of argument (I do not consider the point) that later decisions in related areas are inconsistent with the principles upon which Bellas Hess rested, we have never acknowledged that, but have instead carefully distinguished the case on its facts. See, e. g., D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988); National Geographic Society, supra, at 559. It seems to me important that we retain our ability — and, what comes to the same thing, that *321 we maintain public confidence in our ability — sometimes to adopt new principles for the resolution of new issues without abandoning clear holdings of the past that those principles contradict. We seemed to be doing that in this area. Having affirmatively suggested that the “physical presence” rule could be reconciled with our new jurisprudence, we ought not visit economic hardship upon those who took us at our word. We have recently told lower courts that “[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, [they] should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.” Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477, 484 (1989). It is strangely incompatible with this to demand that private parties anticipate our overrulings. It is my view, in short, that reliance upon a square, unabandoned holding of the Supreme Court is always justifiable reliance (though reliance alone may not always carry the day). Finally, the “physical presence” rule established in Bellas Hess is not “unworkable,” Patterson, supra, at 173 ; to the contrary, whatever else may be the substantive pros and cons of the rule, the “bright-line” regime that it establishes, see ante, at 314, is unqualifiedly in its favor. Justice White’s concern that reaffirmance of Bellas Hess will lead to a flurry of litigation over the meaning of “physical presence,” see post, at 331, seems to me contradicted by 25 years of experience under the decision. For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court and join Parts I, II, and III of its opinion.
**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
Justice White, concurring in part and dissenting in part.  Today the Court repudiates that aspect of our decision in National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., <citedDecision>386 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1967), which restricts, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the power of the States to impose use tax collection responsibilities on out- *322 of-state mail-order businesses that do not have a “physical presence” in the State.  The Court stops short, however, of giving Bellas Hess the complete burial it justly deserves.  In my view, the Court should also overrule that part of Bellas Hess which justifies its holding under the Commerce Clause.  I, therefore, respectfully dissent from Part IV. M In Part IV of its opinion, the majority goes to some lengths to justify the Bellas Hess physical-presence requirement under our Commerce Clause jurisprudence.  I am unpersuaded by its interpretation of our cases. In Bellas Hess, the majority placed great weight on the interstate quality of the mail-order sales, stating that “it is difficult to conceive of commercial transactions more exclusively interstate in character than the mail-order transactions here involved.” <citedDecision>Id., at 759</citedDecision> .  As the majority correctly observes, the idea of prohibiting States from taxing “exclusively interstate” transactions had been an important part of our jurisprudence for many decades, ranging intermittently from such cases as Case of State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232, 279 (1873), through Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249, 256 (1946), and Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O’Connor, 340 U. S. 602 (1951).  But though it recognizes that Bellas Hess was decided amidst an upheaval in our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, in which we began to hold that “a State, with proper drafting, may tax exclusively interstate commerce so long as the tax does not create any effect forbidden by the Commerce Clause,” Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 285 (1977), the majority draws entirely the wrong conclusion from this period of ferment.  The Court attempts to paint Bellas Hess in a different hue from Freeman and Spector because the former “did not rely” on labeling taxes that had “direct” and “indirect” effects on interstate commerce.  See ante, at 310.  Thus, the Court concludes, Bellas Hess “did not automatically fall with Free *323 man and its progeny” in our decision in Complete Auto. See ante, at 311.  I am unpersuaded by this attempt to distinguish Bellas Hess from Freeman and Spector, both of which were repudiated by this Court. See Complete Auto, supra, at 288-289 , and n. 15.

As an original matter, it might have been possible to distinguish between jurisdiction to tax and jurisdiction to compel collection of taxes as agent for the State, but we have rejected that.  National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551, 558 (1977); Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S. 207, 211 (1960).  I agree with the Court, moreover, that abandonment of Bellas Hess' due process holding is compelled by reasoning "[c]omparable" to that contained in our post-1967 cases dealing with state jurisdiction to adjudicate.

 It is strangely incompatible with this to demand that private parties anticipate our overrulings.  It is my view, in short, that reliance upon a square, unabandoned holding of the Supreme Court is always justifiable reliance (though reliance alone may not always carry the day).  Finally, the "physical presence" rule established in Bellas Hess is not "unworkable," Patterson, supra, at 173 ; to the contrary, whatever else may be the substantive pros and cons of the rule, the "bright-line" regime that it establishes, see ante, at 314, is unqualifiedly in its favor.  Justice White's concern that reaffirmance of Bellas Hess will lead to a flurry of litigation over the meaning of "physical presence," see post, at 331, seems to me contradicted by 25 years of experience under the decision.  For these reasons, I concur in the judgment of the Court and join Parts I, II, and III of its opinion.  Justice White, concurring in part and dissenting in part.  Today the Court repudiates that aspect of our decision in National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., <citedDecision>386 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1967), which restricts, under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the power of the States to impose use tax collection responsibilities on outof-state *322 mail-order businesses that do not have a "physical presence" in the State.  The Court stops short, however, of giving Bellas Hess the complete burial it justly deserves.  In my view, the Court should also overrule that part of Bellas Hess which justifies its holding under the Commerce Clause.  I, therefore, respectfully dissent from Part IV. I In Part IV of its opinion, the majority goes to some lengths to justify the Bellas Hess physical-presence requirement under our Commerce Clause jurisprudence.  I am unpersuaded by its interpretation of our cases. In Bellas Hess, the majority placed great weight on the interstate quality of the mail-order sales, stating that "it is difficult to conceive of commercial transactions more exclusively interstate in character than the mail-order transactions here involved." <citedDecision>Id., at 759</citedDecision> .  As the majority correctly observes, the idea of prohibiting States from taxing "exclusively interstate" transactions had been an important part of our jurisprudence for many decades, ranging intermittently from such cases as Case of State Freight Tax, 15 Wall. 232, 279 (1873), through Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249, 256 (1946), and Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor, 340 U. S. 602 (1951).  But though it recognizes that Bellas Hess was decided amidst an upheaval in our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, in which we began to hold that "a State, with proper drafting, may tax exclusively interstate commerce so long as the tax does not create any effect forbidden by the Commerce Clause," Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274, 285 (1977), the majority draws entirely the wrong conclusion from this period of ferment.  The Court attempts to paint Bellas Hess in a different hue from Freeman and Spector because the former "did not rely" on labeling taxes that had "direct" and "indirect" effects on interstate commerce.  See ante, at 310.  Thus, the Court concludes, Bellas Hess "did not automatically fall with Free- *323 man and its progeny" in our decision in Complete Auto. See ante, at 311.  I am unpersuaded by this attempt to distinguish Bellas Hess from Freeman and Spector, both of which were repudiated by this Court. See Complete Auto, supra, at 288-289 , and n. 15.

 [5]  Under our current Commerce Clause jurisprudence, "with certain restrictions, interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes." D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 31 (1988); see also Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 623-624 (1981) ("It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of [the] state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  [6]  North Dakota's use tax illustrates well how a state tax might unduly burden interstate commerce.  On its face, North Dakota law imposes a collection duty on every vendor who advertises in the State three times in a single year.  Thus, absent the Bellas Hess rule, a publisher who included a subscription card in three issues of its magazine, a vendor whose radio advertisements were heard in North Dakota on three occasions, and a corporation whose telephone sales force made three calls into the State, all would be subject to the collection duty.  What is more significant, similar obligations might be imposed by the Nation's 6,000-plus taxing jurisdictions.  See National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., <citedDecision>386 U. S. 753, 759-760</citedDecision> (1967) (noting that the "many variations in rates of tax, in allowable exemptions, and in administrative and record-keeping requirements could entangle [a mail-order house] in a virtual welter of complicated obligations") (footnotes omitted); see also Shaviro, An Economic and Political Look at Federalism in Taxation, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 895 , 925-926 (1992).  [7]  We have sometimes stated that the " Complete Auto test, while responsive to Commerce Clause dictates, encompasses as well .  .  .  due process requirement[s]." Trinova Corp. v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 498 U. S. 358, 373 (1991).  Although such comments might suggest that every tax that passes contemporary Commerce Clause analysis is also valid under the Due Process Clause, it does not follow that the converse is as well true: A tax may be consistent with due process and yet unduly burden interstate commerce.
