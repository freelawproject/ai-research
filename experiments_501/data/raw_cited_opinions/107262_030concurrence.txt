<p id="b870-7">In joining the Courtâ€™s opinion I desire to add the following comment. While agreeing with the Court that the taking of this blood test involved no testimonial compulsion, I would go further and hold that apart from this consideration the case in no way implicates the Fifth Amendment. Cf. my dissenting opinion and that of Mr. Justice White in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, ante, </em>pp. 504, 526.</p>
