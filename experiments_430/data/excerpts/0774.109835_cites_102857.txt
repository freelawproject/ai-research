Mr. Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court. For the second time in this century, the State of Washington would apply its business and occupation tax to stevedoring.  The State’s first application of the tax to stevedoring was unsuccessful, for it was held to be unconstitutional as violative of the Commerce Clause 1 of the United States Constitution.  Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm’n, <citedDecision>302 U. S. 90</citedDecision> (1937).  The Court now faces the question whether Washington’s second attempt violates either the Commerce Clause or the Import-Export Clause.  2 *737 I Stevedoring is the business of loading and unloading cargo from ships.  3 Private stevedoring companies constitute respondent Association of Washington Stevedoring Companies; respondent Washington Public Ports Association is a nonprofit corporation consisting of port authorities that engage in stevedoring activities.  App. 3.  In 1974 petitioner Department of Revenue of the State of Washington adopted Revised Rule 193, pt. D, Wash. Admin. Code 458-20-193-D, to implement the State’s 1% business and occupation tax on *738 services, set forth in Wash. Rev. Code §§82.04.220 and 82.04.290 (1976) 4 The Rule applies the tax to stevedoring and reads in pertinent part as set forth in the margin.  5 Revised Rule 193D restores the original scope of the Washington business and occupation tax. After initial imposition *739 of the tax in 1935, 6 the then State Tax Commission 7 adopted Rule 198 of the Rules and Regulations Relating to the Revenue Act of 1935.

 Hence, we find it unnecessary to discuss the aforementioned cases beyond the fact that nowhere in them do we find language criticizing, expressly contradicting, or overruling (even impliedly) the stevedoring cases. “Fully mindful of our prior criticism of the principles and reasoning of the stevedore cases (see Washington-Oregon Shippers Cooperative Ass’n v. Schumacher, 59 Wn. 2d 159 , 167, 367 P. 2d 112 , 115-116 (1961)), we must nevertheless hold the instant tax on stevedoring invalid.” 88 Wash. 2d, at 318-320 , 559 P. 2d, at 998-999 .  The two dissenting justices would have upheld the tax against the Commerce Clause attack on the ground that recent cases had eroded the direct-indirect taxation analysis employed in the Stevedoring Cases. They found no violation of the Import-Export Clause because the State had taxed only the activity of stevedoring, not the imports or exports themselves.  Even if stevedoring were considered part of interstate or foreign commerce, the Washington tax was valid because it did not discriminate against importing or exporting, did not impair transportation, did not impose multiple burdens, and did not *743 regulate commerce.  88 Wash. 2d, at 320-322 , 559 P. 2d, at 999-1000 .  Because of the possible impact on the issues made by our intervening decision in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S. 274 (1977), filed after the Washington Supreme Court’s ruling, we granted certiorari.  434 U. S. 815 (1977).  II The Commerce Clause A In Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. <citedDecision>State Tax Comm’n</citedDecision> , the Court invalidated the Washington business and occupation tax on stevedoring only because it applied directly to interstate commerce.  Stevedoring was interstate commerce, according to the Court, because: “Transportation of a cargo by water is impossible or futile unless the thing to be transported is put Aboard the ship and taken off at destination.  A stevedore who in person or by servants does work so indispensable is as much an agency of commerce as shipowner or master.” <citedDecision>302 U. S., at 92</citedDecision> .  Without further analysis, the Court concluded: “The business of loading and unloading being interstate or foreign commerce, the State of Washington is not at liberty to tax the privilege of doing it by exacting in return therefor a percentage of the gross receipts.  Decisions to that effect are many and controlling.” <citedDecision>Id., at 94</citedDecision> .  The petitioners (officers of New York City) in Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co., urged the Court to overrule Puget Sound.  They argued that intervening cases 14 had per *744 mitted local taxation of gross proceeds derived from interstate commerce.  They concluded, therefore, that the Commerce Clause did not preclude the application to stevedoring of the New York City business tax on the gross receipts of a stevedoring corporation.  The Court disagreed on the theory that the intervening cases permitted taxation only of local activity separate and distinct from interstate commerce.  330 U. S., at 430-433 .  This separation theory was necessary, said the Court, because it served to diminish the threat of multiple taxation on commerce; if the tax actually fell on intrastate activity, there was less likelihood that other taxing jurisdictions could duplicate the levy.

 The situation was the same in Complete Auto, and that case, thus, is not distinguishable from the present one.  Third, respondents suggest that what they regard as such an important change in Commerce Clause jurisprudence should come from Congress and not from this Court. To begin with, our rejection of the Stevedoring Cases does not effect a significant present change in the law. The primary alteration occurred in Complete Auto. Even if this case did effect an important change, it would not offend the sepa.ration-of-powers principle because it does not restrict the ability of Congress to regulate commerce.  The Commerce Clause does not state a prohibition; it merely grants specific power to Congress.  The prohibitive effect of the Clause on state legislation results from the Supremacy Clause and the decisions of this Court. See, e. g., Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299 (1852); Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824).  If Congress prefers less disruption of interstate commerce, it will act.  18 Consistent with Complete Auto, then, we hold that the Washington business and occupation tax does not violate the *750 Commerce Clause by taxing the interstate commerce activity of stevedoring.  To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. <citedDecision>State Tax Comm’n</citedDecision> and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. stand to the contrary, each is overruled.  C With the distinction between direct and indirect taxation of interstate commerce thus discarded, the constitutionality under the Commerce Clause of the application of the Washington business and occupation tax to stevedoring depends upon the practical effect of the exaction.  As was recognized in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938), interstate commerce must bear its fair share of the state tax burden.  The Court repeatedly has sustained taxes that are applied to activity with a substantial nexus with the State, that are fairly apportioned, that do not discriminate against interstate commerce, and that are fairly related to the services provided by the State.  E. g., General Motors Corp. v. Washington, 377 U. S. 436 (1964); Northwestern Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450 (1959); Memphis Gas Co. v. Stone, 335 U. S. 80 (1948); Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co., 311 U. S. 435 (1940); see Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., at 279 , and n. 8.  Respondents proved no facts in the Superior Court that, under the above test, would justify invalidation of the Washington tax. The record contains nothing that minimizes the obvious nexus between Washington and respondents; indeed, respondents conduct their entire stevedoring operations within the State.  Nor have respondents successfully attacked the apportionment of the Washington system.

 That the holding in Spector parallels that in Puget Sound is demonstrated by the authorities relied upon or provided by both cases in the past.  Spector relied on Carter & Weekes, which reaffirmed Puget Sound, and upon Freeman v. Hewit, 329 U. S. 249 (1946).  340 U. S.„ at 609.  Freeman, in turn, relied upon Puget Sound, 329 U. S., at 257, and Carter & Weekes relied upon Freeman, 330 17.  S., at 433.  Both Freeman and Puget Sound relied upon Galveston, H. & S. A. R. Co. v. Texas, 210 U. S. 217 (1908).  329 U. S., at 257; <citedDecision>302 U. S., at 94</citedDecision> .  Respondents, also, have observed the parallel between Spector and the Stevedoring Cases. In their reply brief to the Superior Court, they argued that Spector, which had not then been overruled by Complete Auto, was dispositive on the question of the continued vitality of Puget Sound and Carter & Weekes.  See n. 11, supra. Subsequent to Carter & Weekes, the Court explained more precisely its concern about multiple burdens on interstate commerce: “While the economic wisdom of state net income taxes is one of state policy not for our decision, one of the 'realities’ raised by the parties is the possibility of a multiple burden resulting from the exactions in question.  The answer is that none is shown to exist here.  .  .  .
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Powell, concurring in part and concurring in the result. I join the opinion of the Court with the exception of Part 1II-B. As that section of the Court’s opinion appears to *762 resurrect the discarded “direct-indirect” test, I cannot join it. In Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages, 423 U. S. 276 (1976), this Court abandoned the traditional, formalistic methods of determining the validity of state levies under the Import-Export Clause and applied a functional analysis based on the exaction’s relationship to the three policies that underlie the Clause: (i) preservation of uniform federal regulation of foreign relations; (ii) protection of federal revenue derived from imports; and (iii) maintenance of harmony among the inland States and the seaboard States. The nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax in Michelin was held not to violate any of those policies, but the Court suggested that even a nondiscriminatory tax on goods merely in transit through the State might run afoul of the Import-Export Clause. The question the Court addresses today in Part III-B is whether the business tax at issue here is such a tax upon goods in transit. The Court gives a negative answer, apparently for two reasons. The first is that Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511 (1951), indicates that this is a tax “not on the goods but on the handling of them at the port.” Id., at 514 (emphasis in original). While Canton R. Co. provides precedential support for the proposition that a tax of this kind is not invalid under the Import-Export Clause, its rather artificial distinction between taxes on the handling of the goods and taxes on the goods themselves harks back to the arid “direct-indirect” distinction that we rejected in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U. S., 274 (1977), in favor of analysis framed in light of economic reality. The Court’s second reason for holding that the instant tax is not one on goods in transit has the surface appearance of economic-reality analysis, but turns out to be the “direct-indirect” test in another guise. The Court likens this tax to the one at issue in Canton R. Co. and declares that since “ [t] axation in neither setting relates to the value of the goods,... in neither can it be considered taxation upon the goods themselves.” *763 Ante, at 757. That this distinction has no economic significance is apparent from the fact that it is possible to design transit fees that are imposed “directly” upon the goods, even though the amount of the exaction bears no relation to the value of the goods. For example, a State could levy a transit fee of $5 per ton or $10 per cubic yard. These taxes would bear no more relation to the value of the goods than does the tax at issue here, which is based on the volume of the stevedoring companies’ business, and, in turn, on the volume of goods passing through the port. Thus, the Court does not explain satisfactorily its pronouncement that Washington’s business tax upon stevedoring — in economic terms — is not the type of transit fee that the Michelin Court questioned. In my view, this issue can be resolved only with reference to the analysis adopted in Michelin. The Court’s initial mention of the validity of transit fees in that decision is found in a discussion concerning the right of the taxing state to seek a quid pro quo for benefits conferred by the State: “There is no reason why local taxpayers should subsidize the services used by the importer; ultimate consumers should pay for such services as police and fire protection accorded the goods just as much as they should pay transportation costs associated with those goods. An evil to be prevented by the Import-Export Clause was the levying of taxes which could only be imposed because of the peculiar geographical situation of certain States that enabled them to single out goods destined for other States. In effect, the Clause was fashioned to prevent the imposition of exactions which were no more than transit fees on the privilege of moving through a State. [The tax at issue] obviously stands on a different footing, and to the extent there is any conflict whatsoever with this purpose of the Clause, it may be secured merely by prohibiting the assessment of even nondiscriminatory property taxes on goods which are merely in transit through the State when *764 the tax is assessed.” 423 U. S., at 289-290 . (Footnotes omitted.) In questioning the validity of “transit fees,” the Michelin Court was concerned with exactions that bore no relation to services and benefits conferred by the State. Thus, the transit-fee inquiry cannot be answered by determining whether or not the tax relates to the value of the goods; instead, it must be answered by inquiring whether the State is simply making the imported goods pay their own way, as opposed to exacting a fee merely for “the privilege of moving through a State.” Ibid. The Court already has answered that question in this case. In Part II-C; the Court observes that “nothing in the record suggests that the tax is not fairly related to services and protection provided by the State.” Ante, at 750-751. Since the stevedoring companies undoubtedly avail themselves of police and fire protection, as well as other benefits Washington offers its local businesses, this statement cannot be questioned. For that reason, I agree with the Court’s conclusion that the business tax at issue here is not a “transit fee” within the prohibition of the Import-Export Clause.

 True, the service did not begin or end at the ship's side, where the cargo is placed upon a sling attached to the ship's tackle.  It took in the work of carriage to and from the `first place of rest,' which means that it covered the space between the hold of the vessel and a convenient point of discharge upon the dock.  .  .  .  The fact is stipulated, however, that no matter by whom the work is done or paid for, `stevedoring services are essential to waterborne commerce and always commence in the hold of the vessel and end at the "first place of rest," and vice versa.'" <citedDecision>302 U.

Such tax shall be measured by the application of rates against value of products, gross proceeds of sales, or gross income of the business, as the case may be." Section 82.04.290 reads in pertinent part: "Upon every person engaging within this state in any business activity other than or in addition to those enumerated in .  .  .  ; as to such persons the amount of tax on account of such activities shall be equal to the gross income of the business multiplied by the rate of one percent.
