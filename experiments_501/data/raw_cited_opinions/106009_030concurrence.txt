<p id="b107-6">I concur in the judgment. The Court’s opinion amply demonstrates that the present record shows an illegal combination to maintain retail prices. I therefore find no occasion to question, even by innuendo, the continuing validity of the <em>Colgate </em>decision, 250 U. S. 300, or of the Court’s ruling as to the jury instruction in <em>Cudahy, </em>256 U. S. 210-211.</p>
