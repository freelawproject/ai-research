<p id="b381-11">The question presented for decision is whether Okla. Stat., Tit. 29, § 4-115 (B) (Supp. 1978), violates the Commerce Clause, Art. I, § 8, cl. 3, of the United States Constitution, insofar as it provides that “ [n] o person may transport or ship minnows for sale outside the state which were seined or procured within the waters of this state ...”<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b382-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="324">*324</page-number>Appellant William Hughes holds a Texas license to operate a commercial minnow business near Wichita Falls, Tex. An Oklahoma game ranger arrested him on a charge of violating § 4-115 (B) by transporting from Oklahoma to Wichita Falls a load of natural minnows purchased from a minnow dealer licensed to do business in Oklahoma. Hughes’ defense that § A-115 (B) was unconstitutional because it was repugnant to the Commerce Clause was rejected, and he was convicted and fined. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, stating:</p>

<p id="b383-8">The few simple words of the Commerce Clause — “The Congress shall have Power ... To regulate Commerce . . . among the several States . . .” — reflected a central concern of the Framers that was an immediate reason for calling the Constitutional Convention: the conviction that in order to succeed, the new Union would have to avoid the tendencies toward economic Balkanization that had plagued relations among the Colonies and later among the States under the Articles of Con<page-number citation-index="1" label="326">*326</page-number>federation.

The Commerce Clause has accordingly been interpreted by this Court not only as an authorization for congressional action, but also, even in the absence of a conflicting federal statute, as a restriction on permissible state regulation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The cases defining the scope of permissible state regulation in areas of congressional silence reflect an often controversial evolution of rules to accommodate federal and state interests.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em><span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v.

This conclusion followed in turn from the view that the State had the power, as representative for its citizens, who “owned” in common all wild animals within the State, to control not only the <em>taking </em>of game but also the <em>ownership </em>of game that had been lawfully reduced to possession.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> By virtue of this power, Connecticut could qualify the ownership of wild game taken within the State by, for example, prohibiting its removal from the State: “The common ownership imports the right to keep the property, if the sovereign so chooses, always within its jurisdiction for every purpose.” <span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/#530" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v. Connecticut">161 U. S., at 530</a></span>. Accordingly, the State's power to qualify ownership raised serious doubts whether the sale or exchange of wild game constituted “commerce” at all; in any event the Court held that the qualification imposed by the challenged statute removed any transactions involving wild game killed in Connecticut from <em>interstate </em>commerce.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>

Connecticut">Geer</a></span> </em>began only 15 years after it was decided. A Commerce Clause challenge was addressed to an Oklahoma statute designed to prohibit the transportation beyond the State of natural gas produced by wells within the State. <em>West </em>v. <em>Kansas Natural Gas Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="97421"><a href="/opinion/97421/west-v-kansas-natural-gas-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: West v.

Based on reasoning parallel to that in <em><span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v. Connecticut">Geer</a></span>, </em>Oklahoma urged its right to “conserve” the gas for the use of its own citizens, stressing the limited supply and the absence of alternative sources of fuel within the State. Nevertheless, the Court, in a passage reminiscent of the dissents in <em><span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v. Connecticut">Geer</a></span>, </em>condemned the obvious protectionist motive in the Oklahoma statute and rejected the State’s arguments with a powerful reaffirmation of the vision of the Framers:</p>
<blockquote id="b387-8">“The statute of Oklahoma recognizes [gas] to be a subject of intrastate commerce, but seeks to prohibit it from being the subject of interstate commerce, and this is the purpose of its conservation. ... If the States have such power a singular situation might result. Pennsylvania might keep its coal, the Northwest its timber, the mining <page-number citation-index="1" label="330">*330</page-number>States their minerals. And why may not the products of the field be brought within the principle? Thus enlarged, or without that enlargement, its influence on interstate commerce need not be pointed out. To what consequences does such power tend? If one State has it, all States have it; embargo may be retaliated by embargo, and commerce will be halted at state lines. And yet we have said that 'in matters of foreign and interstate commerce there are no state lines.’ In such commerce, instead of the States, a new power appears and a new welfare, a welfare which transcends that of any State. But rather let us say it is constituted of the welfare of all of the States and that of each State is made the greater by a division of its resources, natural and created, with every other State, and those of every other State with it. This was the purpose, as it is the result, of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States. If there is to be a turning backward it must be done by the authority of another instrumentality than a court.” <span class="citation" data-id="97421"><a href="/opinion/97421/west-v-kansas-natural-gas-co/#255" aria-description="Citation for case: West v.

<p id="b388-5">The Court distinguished discriminatory or prohibatory regulations offensive to the Commerce Clause, such as the Oklahoma statute, from a valid "exercise of the police power to regulate the taking of natural gas” that was "universal in its application and justified by the nature of the gas and which allowed its transportation to other states.” <span class="citation" data-id="97421"><a href="/opinion/97421/west-v-kansas-natural-gas-co/#257" aria-description="Citation for case: West v.

<p id="b394-6">We turn then to the question whether the burden imposed on interstate commerce in wild game by § 4-115 (B) is permissible under the general rule articulated in our precedents governing other types of commerce.

Under that general rule, we must inquire (1) whether the challenged statute regulates evenhandedly with only “incidental” effects on interstate commerce, or discriminates against interstate commerce either on its face or in practical effect; (2) whether the statute serves a legitimate local purpose; and, if so, (3) whether alternative means could promote this local purpose as well without discriminating against interstate commerce. The burden to show discrimination rests on the party challenging the validity of the statute, but “[w]hen discrimination against commerce ... is demonstrated, the burden falls on the State to justify it both in terms of the local benefits flowing from the statute and the unavailability of nondiscriminatory alternatives adequate to preserve, the local interests at stake.” <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Washington Apple Advertising Comm’n, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109703"><a href="/opinion/109703/hunt-v-washington-state-apple-advertising-commission/#353" aria-description="Citation for case: Hunt v.

<p id="b395-5">Oklahoma argues that § A-115 (B) serves a legitimate local purpose in that it is “readily apparent as a conservation measure.” Brief for Appellee 8. The State’s interest in maintaining the ecological balance in state waters by avoiding the removal of inordinate numbers of minnows may well qualify as a legitimate local purpose. We consider the States’ interests in conservation and protection of wild animals as legitimate local purposes similar to the States’ interests in protecting the health and safety of their citizens. See, <em>e. g., Firemen </em>v. <em>Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="9423842"><a href="/opinion/107797/brotherhood-of-locomotive-firemen-enginemen-v-chicago-rock-island/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen &amp; Enginemen v.

The fiction of state ownership may no longer be used to force those outside the State to bear the full costs of “conserving” the wild animals within its borders when-equally effective nondiscriminatory conservation measures are available.</p>
<p id="b395-6">Far from choosing the least discriminatory alternative, <page-number citation-index="1" label="338">*338</page-number>Oklahoma has chosen to “conserve” its minnows in the way that most overtly discriminates against interstate commerce. The State places no limits on the numbers of minnows that can be taken by licensed minnow dealers; nor does it limit in any way how these minnows may be disposed of within the State.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Yet it forbids the transportation of any commercially significant number of natural minnows out of the State for sale.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Section 4-115 (B) is certainly not a “last ditch” attempt at conservation after nondiscriminatory alternatives have proved unfeasible. It is rather a choice of the most discriminatory means even though nondiscriminatory alternatives would seem likely to fulfill the State’s purported legitimate local purpose more effectively.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>

That this was not an “alternative basis,” however, is made clear in a sentence not quoted by our Brother Rehnquist:</p>
<blockquote id="b386-8">“The power of a State to protect by adequate police regulation its people against the adulteration of articles of food, . . . although in doing so commerce might be remotely affected, necessarily carries with it the existence of a like power to preserve a food supply <em>which belongs in common to all the people of the State, which can only become the subject of ownership in a qualified way, and which can never be the object of commerce except with the consent of the State and subject to the conditions which it may deem best to impose for the public good.” </em><span class="citation" data-id="94405"><a href="/opinion/94405/geer-v-connecticut/#535" aria-description="Citation for case: Geer v.

<p id="b396-10"> In its brief, Oklahoma argues, apparently for the first time, that the discrimination against out-of-state sales of natural minnows is justified because minnows purchased in the State are more likely to be used for bait in state waters. Brief for Appellee 3. The State contends that minnows “returned” to state waters as bait do not upset the ecological balance as much as those that never “return.” The late appearance of this argument and the total absence of any record support for the questionable factual assumptions that underlie it give it the flavor of a <em>post hoc </em>rationalization. The State’s bare assertion is certainly inadequate to survive the scrutiny invoked by the facial discrimination of § 4r-115 (B). In any case, Oklahoma itself concedes that the “return” of natural minnows as bait is irrelevant to most aspects of preserving ecological balance. Brief for Appellee 4.</p>
