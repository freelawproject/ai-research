92291,88699,Osborne v. Mobile,Overruled,"In view of the course of decisions which have been made since that time, it is very certain that such an ordinance would now be regarded as repugnant to the power conferred upon Congress to regulate commerce among the several States.","The court explicitly states that Osborne's holding would no longer be valid under current jurisprudence, effectively overruling its precedential value regarding state taxation of interstate commerce."
92291,89664,Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co.,Mentioned,"In the case of The Pensacola Telegraph Company v. The Western Union Telegraph Company, 96 U. S. 1, we held that it was not only the right, but the duty of Congress to take care that intercourse among the States and the transmission of intelligence between them be not obstructed or unnecessarily incumbered by state legislation","The court cites this case to support its reasoning about Congress's authority over interstate commerce, without modifying or criticizing its holding."
92291,90600,Telegraph Co. v. Texas,Mentioned,"In Western Union Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U. S. 460, we decided that a State cannot lay a tax on the interstate business of a telegraph company, as it is interstate commerce","The court references this case to support its current reasoning about state taxation of interstate commerce, without any negative treatment."
92291,91869,Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District,Mentioned,"It comes plainly within the principle of the decisions lately made by this court in Robbins v. The Taxing District of Shelby County, 120 U. S. 489","The court cites this case as supporting precedent for its current decision, without any criticism or modification of its holding."
92291,91985,Philadelphia & Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania,Mentioned,"It comes plainly within the principle of the decisions lately made by this court in [...] Philadelphia and Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania, 122 U. S. 326","The court references this case as supporting precedent that aligns with its current decision, without any negative treatment."
93311,92988,Merrill v. Monticello,Distinguished,The case which seems to be much relied upon to support the present judgment is Merrill v. Monticello. But we submit that it does not sustain the broad doctrine that negotiable securities may not be issued in execution of an express power to borrow money.,"The dissenting opinion distinguishes Merrill by explaining it dealt with implied (not express) power to borrow money, making it materially different from the present case."
93311,87743,Rogers v. Burlington,Overruled,"We, therefore, must regard the cases of Rogers v. Burlington and Mitchell v. Burlington, as overruled in the particular referred to, by later cases in this court.",The court explicitly states that Rogers v. Burlington has been overruled by subsequent cases regarding municipal authority to issue negotiable bonds.
93311,91125,Claiborne County v. Brooks,Mentioned,"The court, speaking again by Mr. Justice Bradley, held that it did not, and said: 'Our opinion is, that mere political bodies, constituted as counties are...have no power or authority to make and utter commercial paper of any kind, unless such power is expressly conferred upon them by law'","The case is cited as supporting precedent without criticism or distinction, merely to explain the development of the law."
93311,87776,Mitchell v. Burlington,Overruled,"We, therefore, must regard the cases of Rogers v. Burlington and Mitchell v. Burlington, as overruled in the particular referred to, by later cases in this court.",The court explicitly states that Mitchell v. Burlington has been overruled by subsequent cases regarding municipal authority to issue negotiable bonds.
93311,88640,Police Jury v. Britton,Mentioned,"We do not mean to be understood that it requires, in all cases, express authority for such bodies to issue negotiable paper. The power has frequently been implied from other express powers granted.","The case is cited and discussed to explain the development of the law, without being criticized or distinguished."
92059,91368,Poindexter v. Greenhow,Distinguished,"The case then of the plaintiff below is reduced to this: He had paid the tax demanded of him by a lawful tender. The defendant had no authority of law thereafter to attempt to enforce other payment by seizing his property. In doing so he ceased to be an officer of the law, and became a private wrongdoer.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Poindexter by noting that while officers can be sued for individual wrongdoing like property seizure, the present case involves officers acting in their official capacity on behalf of the state."
92059,91371,Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad,Distinguished,"And now it is adjudged, in the cases before us, that a suit merely against state officers to enjoin them from bringing actions against tax-payers who have previously tendered tax-receivable coupons is a suit against the State.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Allen by explaining that while injunctions against property seizure were allowed, enjoining officers from bringing suits on behalf of the state is fundamentally different."
92059,88673,Davis v. Gray,Limited,"Making a state officer a party does not make the State a party, although her law may have prompted his action and the State may stand behind him as the real party in interest.","The Acting Decision limits Davis by clarifying that while making an officer a party doesn't automatically make it a suit against the state, this principle doesn't apply when the state is the real party in interest."
92059,87371,Kentucky v. Dennison,Mentioned,"This view was reiterated by this court in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66, 98, where it was said to be settled, that where the State is a party, plaintiff or defendant, the Governor represents the State.",The Acting Decision merely references Dennison to explain how states can be represented in litigation by their officers.
92059,91583,Hagood v. Southern,Mentioned,"The converse of that case is to be found in Hagood v. Southern, 117 U.S. 52. There, the State of South Carolina, which was the party in interest, was not nominally a defendant.",The Acting Decision cites Hagood as an example of when a state is the real party in interest despite not being named as a defendant.
92059,90667,United States v. Lee,Distinguished,"That was an action to recover a body of land in Alexandria County, Virginia... As the United States were not parties to the record, and because they could not be made parties, the court proceeded to a determination of the case between the parties before it.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Lee by explaining that it involved recovery of specific property, unlike the present case which seeks to enjoin state officers from bringing suits."
92059,85451,Osborn v. Bank of United States,Limited,"But what was said by Chief Justice Marshall in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, supra, must be taken in connection with its immediate context... This conveys the intimation, that where the defendants who are sued as officers of the State, have not a real, but merely a nominal interest in the controversy, the State appearing to be the real defendant, and therefore an indispensable party.",The Acting Decision limits Osborn by explaining that its rule about parties on the record must be understood in context of whether the state is the real party in interest.
91306,88061,Texas v. White,Limited,"It is apparent that the original decision of the court in reference to the Texas indemnity bonds in Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, has been questioned and limited in important particulars in the subsequent cases involving the same questions.","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Texas v. White has been questioned and limited in important aspects, particularly regarding its positions on bond negotiability and legislative restrictions."
91306,88994,Vermilye & Co. v. Adams Express Co.,Distinguished,"Mr. Justice Miller then added: 'We have not quoted the language from the opinion in that case with any view of affirming it. It may admit of grave doubt whether such bonds, redeemable but not payable at a certain day, except at the option of the government, do become overdue in the sense of being dishonored if not paid or redeemed on that day.'",The Acting Decision distinguishes Vermilye by questioning its applicability to bonds that are redeemable but not payable at a certain day.
91306,87633,Murray v. Lardner,Mentioned,"The rules established in Murray v. Lardner, 2 Wall. 110, 118 — 'that the purchaser of coupon bonds, before due, without notice and in good faith, is unaffected by want of title in the seller, and that the burden of proof in respect-to notice and want of good faith is on the claimant of the bonds as against the purchaser' — were repeated and reaffirmed",The Acting Decision simply references and restates the rules established in Murray v. Lardner without criticism or modification.
91306,88240,Texas v. Hardenberg,Mentioned,"The case came before the court again in another aspect, and is reported as Texas v. Hardenberg, 10 Wall. 68, in which the grounds of the former decision were reconsidered and declared to be satisfactory.",The Acting Decision merely references Hardenberg as part of the historical discussion of the Texas bond cases without any significant treatment.
91306,88693,Huntington v. Texas,Mentioned,"The same questions, as to part of the same issue of bonds, came again before the court in Huntington v. Texas, 16 Wall. 402, in which the two prior decisions were relied on",The Acting Decision simply mentions Huntington as part of the historical progression of Texas bond cases without any significant treatment.
91306,88924,National Bank of Washington v. Texas,Mentioned,"Some of the same issue of bonds were in litigation before this court in National Bank of Washington v. Texas, 20 Wall. 72.",The Acting Decision references the case as part of the historical discussion without providing any significant treatment or modification.
91306,89668,Cromwell v. County of Sac,Mentioned,"'To hold otherwise,' said this court in Cromwell v. County of Sac, 96 U.S. 51, 58, 'would throw discredit upon a large class of securities issued by municipal and private corporations, having years to run, with interest payable annually or semi-annually.'",The Acting Decision cites Cromwell simply to support its reasoning about interest payments without any significant treatment.
91306,90400,Railroad Co. v. Sprague,Mentioned,"And the doctrine was reaffirmed in Railway Co. v. Sprague, 103 U.S. 756.",The Acting Decision merely mentions that Sprague reaffirmed the doctrine discussed in Cromwell without any significant treatment.
93904,93354,Roberts v. Lewis (1892),Mentioned,"This certificate distinctly presents for decision the question (argued, but not decided, when this case was before this court at a former term, reported in 144 U. S. 653)","The Acting Decision merely references the prior case to provide procedural context, without any substantive treatment of its holdings."
93904,87423,Suydam v. Williamson,Mentioned,"The opinion of the Supreme Court of the State appears to have been formed upon full consideration of the difficulties of the case; and is entitled to great weight, especially upon the construction of the statute of the State. Suydam v. Williamson, 24 How. 427",The Cited Decision is referenced only to support the principle of giving weight to state court interpretations of state statutes.
93904,84798,Lambert's Lessee v. Payne,Mentioned,"He begins by giving her 'all my estate, real and personal,' which of itself would carry a fee, unless restricted by other words. Lambert v. Paine, 3 Cranch, 97",The Cited Decision is referenced only to support a general principle of law regarding estate interpretation.
93904,89382,Brant v. Virginia Coal & Iron Co.,Distinguished,"In Brant v. Virginia Coal Co., the bequest which was held to give a life estate, and no power to convey a fee, was only of the testator's estate, real and personal, to his wife, 'to have and to hold during her life, and to do with as she sees proper, before her death.' 93 U. S. 327. The numerous cases cited in the briefs have been examined, and show that the general current of authority in other courts is in favor of our present conclusion",The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes Brant by noting the different language used in the bequest and reaching a different conclusion.
93904,90983,Howard v. Carusi,Mentioned,"See Howard v. Carusi, 109 U. S. 725",The Cited Decision is only briefly referenced as supporting authority without substantial discussion.
93904,93152,Potter v. Couch,Mentioned,"See Howard v. Carusi, 109 U. S. 725; Potter v. Couch, 141 U. S. 296, 315, 316",The Cited Decision is only briefly referenced as supporting authority without substantial discussion.
93904,90455,Giles v. Little,Overruled,"this court is of opinion that the sound construction of this will, as to the extent of the power conferred on the widow, is in accordance with the conclusion of the state court, and not with the former decision of this court, which must, therefore, be considered as overruled","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Giles v. Little is overruled, rejecting its previous interpretation in favor of the state court's construction."
98124,96356,Rogers v. Peck,Mentioned,"Due process of law, this court has held, does not require the State to adopt any particular form of procedure, so long as it appears that the accused has had sufficient notice of the accusation and an adequate opportunity to defend himself in the prosecution. Rogers v. Peck, 199 U. S. 425, 435","The Acting Decision cites Rogers v. Peck as supporting precedent for its interpretation of due process requirements, without criticizing or modifying the earlier decision."
98124,94455,Crain v. United States,Overruled,"Holding this view, notwithstanding our reluctance to overrule former decisions of this court, we now are constrained to hold that the technical enforcement of formal rights in criminal procedure sustained in the Crain Case is no longer required in the prosecution of offenses under present systems of law, and so far as that case is not in accord with the views herein expressed it is necessarily overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Crain v. United States, stating that its technical requirements for formal arraignment are no longer necessary under modern criminal procedure."
101368,92485,Friedlander v. Texas & Pacific Railway Co.,Overruled,We think that the Friedlander case should be overruled so far as it supports such an exception and that the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed.,"The court explicitly overrules Friedlander's holding that an employer is not liable for an agent's fraudulent acts done for the agent's own benefit, finding this exception inconsistent with the general rule of principal liability."
101368,4920593,Roy & Roy v. Northern Pacific Railway Co.,Mentioned,"To this extent the case has been often cited and followed. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Nat. Park Bk., 188 Ala. 109, 119; Roy & Roy v.

101368,5712559,Planters' Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants' National Bank,Mentioned,"The state courts, including those of Georgia where the cause of action arose, have very generally reached the opposite conclusion, holding that the liability of the principal for the false statement or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope of his authority is unaffected by his secret purpose or motives. Planters' Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants' Nat'l Bank, 78 Ga. 574","The case is cited as supportive precedent showing state courts' contrary position to Friedlander, but without detailed analysis."
101368,3931352,Havens v. Bank of Tarboro,Mentioned,"The state courts, including those of Georgia where the cause of action arose, have very generally reached the opposite conclusion, holding that the liability of the principal for the false statement or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope of his authority is unaffected by his secret purpose or motives... Havens v. Bank of Tarboro, 132 N. C. 214","The case is simply listed as one of several state court decisions that reached a conclusion opposite to Friedlander, without further discussion."
99004,95042,Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Railway Co. v. Smith,Overruled,"The views therein expressed which are inconsistent with the right of the States to fix reasonable commutation fares when the carrier has itself established fares for such service, must be regarded as overruled by the decision in this case.",The court explicitly states that it is overruling portions of Lake Shore that conflict with states' rights to regulate commutation fares.

99004,93379,Interstate Com. Commiss. v. B. & O. RAILROAD,Distinguished,this court held that a 'party rate ticket' for the transportation of ten or more persons at a less rate than that charged a single individual did not make a discrimination against an individual charged more for the same service,The court uses this case to distinguish between different types of rate discrimination and establish precedent for allowing certain types of differential pricing.

Eastern Paper Bag Co.,Distinguished,"I leave on one side the question of the effect of the Clayton Act, as the court has done, and also what I might think if the Paper Bag Case were not upheld","The dissenting opinion distinguishes this case from Paper Bag, suggesting different circumstances and application"

Tipaldo, 298 U.S. 587, came here on certiorari to the New York court, which had held the New York minimum wage act for women to be invalid... That view led to the affirmance by this Court of the judgment in the Morehead case, as the Court considered that the only question before it was whether the Adkins case was distinguishable and that reconsideration of that decision had not been sought.","The Court distinguishes Morehead by explaining it was decided narrowly on whether it could be distinguished from Adkins, without reconsidering Adkins itself."
102784,102224,Nebbia v. New York,Mentioned,"In Nebbia v. New York, 291 U.S. 502, dealing with the New York statute providing for minimum prices for milk, the general subject of the regulation of the use of private property and of the making of private contracts received an exhaustive examination","The Court cites Nebbia as supporting precedent for its analysis of state regulatory power, without criticism or distinction."

Co., 307 Pa. 203; 160 A. 859, the only duty owed to the plaintiff was to refrain from wilful or wanton injury.

103012,86188,Swift v. Tyson,Overruled,"The doctrine of Swift v. Tyson is, as Mr. Justice Holmes said, 'an unconstitutional assumption of powers by courts of the United States which no lapse of time or respectable array of opinion should make us hesitate to correct.'","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Swift v. Tyson, declaring it an unconstitutional assumption of power by federal courts."

Day's doctrine of implied constitutional immunity from income taxation of government employees' salaries.
103172,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt,Mentioned,The determination in the Gerhardt case that the federal income tax imposed on the employees of the Port Authority was not a burden on the Port Authority made it unnecessary to consider whether the Authority itself was immune from federal taxation,"The Court uses Gerhardt as supporting precedent for its current analysis, citing its reasoning about tax burdens on government employees."
103172,85272,M'culloch v. State of Maryland,Distinguished,"The arguments upon which McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, rested had their roots in actuality.

United States,Overruled,"In translating these important objectives for effectuating the Congressional scheme to enlarge the independent powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission into a seemingly technical distinction between 'negative' and 'affirmative' orders, the opinion in Procter & Gamble v.

103292,102488,Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co.,Overruled,We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine — untenable because they drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept and to which we adhere.,"The court explicitly rejects and overrules the distinctions made in this case, finding them incompatible with the principles established in Klein."
103292,101723,Klein v. United States,Mentioned,"Freed from the distinctions, introduced by the St. Louis Trust cases, the Klein case furnishes such a harmonizing principle.","The court reaffirms and relies on Klein's principles as the correct interpretation of the statute, using it as the foundation for overruling later cases."

David Burnet,Criticized,"These governing principles were indicated as early as 1927 and were thereafter developed, in application to specific cases, in a consistent line of authorities...

103505,99206,Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States,Overruled,But for the reasons stated that decision must be overruled.

103915,103633,Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co.,Distinguished,"We held in Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co., supra, that the Commission was not bound to the use of any single formula or combination of formulae in determining rates. Its rate-making function, moreover, involves the making of 'pragmatic adjustments.'","The Court distinguishes the current case by explaining that while Natural Gas Pipeline Co. established flexibility in rate-making formulas, the present case requires consideration of additional factors beyond just the rate-making methodology."
103915,101364,United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission,Mentioned,"Then, as now, the differences were 'due chiefly to the difference in value ascribed by each to the gas rights and leaseholds.'","The Court merely references this case to provide historical context about similar valuation issues, without expressing approval or criticism."
103915,102280,Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Util. Comm'n of Ohio,Mentioned,Later the 'value' of gas in the field was questioned in determining the amount a regulated company should be allowed to pay an affiliate therefor — a state determination also reviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment.,"The Court simply cites this case as part of the historical development of gas regulation, without indicating approval or disapproval of its principles."
103915,102091,Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission,Mentioned,Under the statutory standard of 'just and reasonable' it is the result reached not the method employed which is controlling. Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission,"The Court references this case to support its point about focusing on results rather than methods, but does not significantly analyze or critique it."
103915,102270,Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission,Mentioned,Later the 'value' of gas in the field was questioned in determining the amount a regulated company should be allowed to pay an affiliate therefor — a state determination also reviewed under the Fourteenth Amendment.,"The Court cites this case as another historical example of gas valuation issues, without expressing approval or criticism."
103915,92743,"Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Co. v. Minnesota",Questioned,"While legal issues touching the proper distribution of governmental powers under the Constitution may always be raised, Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, supra, may fairly be claimed. But in any event that issue is not here in controversy.","The Court questions the continued relevance of this precedent while acknowledging its historical influence, suggesting uncertainty about its current applicability."
103915,101492,United Rs. & Elec. Co. of Baltimore v. West,Overruled,"We cannot approve the contrary holding of United Railways Co. v. West, 280 U. S. 234, 253-254.",The Court explicitly rejects and overrules the holding from this case regarding annual depreciation calculations.
103927,95840,The Osceola,Mentioned,"But the admiralty rule that the vessel and owner are liable to indemnify a seaman for injury caused by unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment, has been the settled law since this Court's ruling to that effect in The Osceola","The court cites The Osceola as establishing the foundational principle of vessel owner liability for unseaworthiness, using it as supporting precedent rather than criticizing or distinguishing it"
103927,100007,Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger,Mentioned,"Moreover it would not be enough to say that this case concerns a consumable supply, for in Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, the owner was held liable to a seaman for unseaworthiness, where a consumable supply of the ship was stored in such fashion as to render it dangerous to the seaman who used it","The court uses Carlisle as supporting precedent to demonstrate that unseaworthiness can apply to consumable supplies, citing it favorably without modification or criticism"
103927,103121,Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith,Mentioned,"We have often had occasion to emphasize the conditions of the seaman's employment, see Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, supra, 430-431 and cases cited, which have been deemed to make him a ward of the admiralty","The court cites Socony-Vacuum as supporting precedent for the special protections afforded to seamen, without criticizing or distinguishing it"
103927,101292,Plamals v. S. S. 'Pinar Del Rio',Overruled,"So far as this statement supports these assumptions, it is disapproved. We cannot follow it, and also follow The Osceola, supra, the cases which it approved and Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra. We prefer to follow the latter as the more consonant with principle and authority","The court explicitly overrules The Pinar Del Rio's holding regarding unseaworthiness, finding it incompatible with other precedents"
103927,102648,The Arizona v. Anelich,Mentioned,"Whether petitioner knew of the defective condition of the rope does not appear, but in any case the seaman, in the performance of his duties, is not deemed to assume the risk of unseaworthy appliances. The Arizona v. Anelich, supra, 123-124",The court cites The Arizona v. Anelich as supporting precedent for the principle that seamen do not assume the risk of unseaworthy appliances
103962,103531,United States v. Classic,Distinguished,It is suggested that Grovey v. Townsend was overruled sub silentio in United States v. Classic... The case is not mentioned in either of the opinions in the Classic case. Again and again it is said in the opinion of the court in that case that the voter who was denied the right to vote was a fully qualified voter.,"The court explicitly distinguishes Classic from the present case, noting that Classic dealt with denial of voting rights to qualified voters, while the current case deals with party membership qualification."
103962,102431,Grovey v. Townsend,Overruled,Grovey v. Townsend is overruled.,"The court explicitly overrules Grovey v. Townsend, rejecting its previous holding that exclusion from primary elections through denial of party membership was not state action."
103962,101911,Nixon v. Condon,Mentioned,"The court refused to decide whether a political party in Texas had inherent power to determine its membership. The court said, however: 'Whatever inherent power a state political party has to determine the content of its membership resides in the state convention.'","The court references Nixon v. Condon to provide historical context for the development of Texas primary election law, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
103962,4209365,Bell v. Hill,Criticized,"Despite Texas decision that the exclusion is produced by private or party action, Bell v. Hill, supra, federal courts must for themselves appraise the facts leading to that conclusion.","The court criticizes and rejects Bell v. Hill's conclusion that exclusion from primary elections was private action, asserting federal courts' authority to make their own determination."
104285,101446,United States v. Schwimmer,Overruled,"We conclude that the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases do not state the correct rule of law.","The Court explicitly overrules Schwimmer, stating that its interpretation of the naturalization oath requirements was incorrect and represented a misunderstanding of religious liberty protections."
104285,101765,United States v. MacIntosh,Overruled,"We conclude that the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases do not state the correct rule of law.","The Court explicitly overrules MacIntosh along with the other cases, rejecting its interpretation that refusing to bear arms due to religious beliefs disqualifies one from citizenship."
104285,101766,United States v. Bland,Overruled,"We conclude that the Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases do not state the correct rule of law.","The Court explicitly overrules Bland alongside Schwimmer and MacIntosh, rejecting the previous interpretation of naturalization requirements regarding conscientious objectors."
104285,103367,Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader,Distinguished,"We stated in Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U.S. 106, 119, that 'It would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from reexamining its own doctrines.' It is at best treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law.",The Court distinguishes this case from Apex Hosiery by explaining why its principle about Congressional silence adopting judicial interpretations does not apply in the current situation.
103916,101696,Carbice Corp. of America v. American Patents Development Corp.,Mentioned,"Ever since Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, was overruled by Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U. S. 602, this Court has consistently held that the owner of a patent may not employ it to secure a limited monopoly of an unpatented material used in applying the invention. Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., supra","The court cites Carbice as part of a line of cases establishing the principle that patent owners cannot extend their monopoly to unpatented materials, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
103916,97018,Leeds & Catlin Company v. Victor Talking Machine Company (No. 2),Overruled,The rule of the Leeds & Catlin case (No. 2) accordingly must no longer prevail against the defense that a combination patent is being used to protect an unpatented part from competition.,The court explicitly overrules Leeds & Catlin's holding regarding contributory infringement when a combination patent is being used to protect unpatented parts.
103916,102889,Leitch Manufacturing Co. v. Barber Co.,Mentioned,"Ever since Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, was overruled by Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U. S. 602, this Court has consistently held that the owner of a patent may not employ it to secure a limited monopoly of an unpatented material used in applying the invention. Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., supra; Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., supra",The court cites Leitch as supporting precedent for the principle that patent owners cannot extend their monopoly to unpatented materials.
103916,98917,Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Manufacturing Co.,Mentioned,"Ever since Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, was overruled by Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U. S. 602, this Court has consistently held that the owner of a patent may not employ it to secure a limited monopoly of an unpatented material",The court references Motion Picture as the seminal case that established the principle against extending patent monopolies to unpatented materials.
103916,103578,B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis,Mentioned,"Ever since Henry v. A. B. Dick Co., 224 U. S. 1, was overruled by Motion Picture Co. v. Universal Film Co., 243 U. S. 602, this Court has consistently held that the owner of a patent may not employ it to secure a limited monopoly of an unpatented material used in applying the invention. Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp., supra; Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co., supra; Morton Salt Co. v. G. S. Suppiger Co., 314 U. S. 488; B. B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis, 314 U. S. 495.","The court cites B. B. Chemical as part of a line of cases supporting the principle against patent misuse, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
103916,103678,United States v. Masonite Corp.,Mentioned,"The fact that the patentee has the power to refuse a license does not enable him to enlarge the monopoly of the patent by the expedient of attaching conditions to its use. United States v. Masonite Corp., supra, p. 277.",The court cites Masonite to support its argument that patent holders cannot extend their monopoly through licensing conditions.
103869,103816,Board of County Commissioners v. Seber,Mentioned,"This issue is not foreclosed by Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U. S. 705, since there we decided no more than that Congress might authorize the exemption of certain Indian lands from taxation because of an historic policy in respect to those lands.","The Acting Decision references Seber to distinguish its holding, but does not criticize or substantially engage with its reasoning."
103869,102466,Superintendent of Five Civilized Tribes v. Commissioner,Distinguished,"It is for this historical reason that cases such as Superintendent v. Commissioner, 295 U. S. 418, and Landman v. Commissioner, 123 F. 2d 787, have no bearing upon a consideration of the effect of restrictions upon the power of a state to tax.",The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes Superintendent as not applicable to the current case's consideration of state taxing power.
103869,101272,Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp.,Mentioned,"In Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 U. S. 575, the interest of an oil lessee in land purchased for an Indian by the Secretary of the Interior with the Indian's restricted funds and conveyed to the Indian by a restricted form of deed pursuant to conditions imposed by the Secretary, was held subject to an Oklahoma oil production tax.",The Acting Decision simply describes Shaw's holding without criticizing or substantially engaging with its reasoning.
103869,103192,United States Trust Co. v. Helvering,Distinguished,"As pointed out before, contrary to the general rule Indian tax exemptions are to be liberally construed. See Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363, 366-67. For that reason decisions, such as U. S. Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U. S. 57, that statutory exemptions from taxation do not include an exemption from estate taxes, have no application here.",The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes this case as inapplicable due to different rules for interpreting Indian tax exemptions.
103869,97425,Tiger v. Western Investment Co.,Mentioned,"See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 309",The Acting Decision merely cites Tiger without substantial discussion or analysis.

103869,98689,Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma,Mentioned,"Indian Territory Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522",The Acting Decision simply lists this case among others without substantial discussion.
103869,100916,Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir,Mentioned,"Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir, 271 U. S. 609",The Acting Decision merely lists this case without substantial analysis or criticism.
103869,99897,Gillespie v. Oklahoma,Overruled,"This immunity for lessees was withdrawn by Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376, which overruled Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra.",The Acting Decision explicitly notes that Gillespie was overruled by Mountain Producers Corp.

103869,97639,Choate v. Trapp,Mentioned,"Non-alienability and tax exemption have been said to be distinct things so far as vested rights are concerned, see Choate v. Trapp, 224 U. S. 665, 673",The Acting Decision references Choate only to note a legal principle without criticism or substantial analysis.
103869,99118,McCurdy v. United States,Mentioned,"This issue is not foreclosed by Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 318 U. S. 705, since there we decided no more than that Congress might authorize the exemption of certain Indian lands from taxation because of an historic policy in respect to those lands. Cf. McCurdy v. United States, 246 U. S. 263, 269.",The Acting Decision merely cites McCurdy as a comparison without substantial discussion.

103870,103373,Minersville School District v. Gobitis,Overruled,The decision of this Court in Minersville School District v. Gobitis and the holdings of those few per curiam decisions which preceded and foreshadowed it are overruled,"The Court explicitly states it is overruling Gobitis, finding that compelling students to salute the flag violates First Amendment rights"
103870,102334,Hamilton v. Regents of the University of California,Distinguished,"In the present case attendance is not optional. That case is also to be distinguished from the present one because, independently of college privileges or requirements, the State has power to raise militia and impose the duties of service therein upon its citizens.","The Court distinguishes Hamilton because it involved optional college attendance and military training, unlike the mandatory public school attendance in the present case"
103870,100694,Pierce v. Society of Sisters,Mentioned,"West Virginia does not compel the attendance at its public schools of the children here concerned. West Virginia does not so compel, for it cannot. This Court denied the right of a state to require its children to attend public schools.","The Court cites Pierce to support that states cannot compel public school attendance, but this is not central to the main holding"
103870,101741,Stromberg v. California,Mentioned,Over a decade ago Chief Justice Hughes led this Court in holding that the display of a red flag as a symbol of opposition by peaceful and legal means to organized government was protected by the free speech guaranties of the Constitution.,"The Court references Stromberg as historical precedent for protecting symbolic speech, but does not significantly analyze or modify it"
103870,103705,Jones v. Opelika,Mentioned,"Long reflection convinced us that although the principle is sound, its application in the particular case was wrong. Jones v. Opelika, 316 U. S. 584, 623.","The citation appears in a concurrence explaining the justices' change of view, but does not significantly analyze Jones"
103870,102580,United States v. Butler,Mentioned,Not so long ago we were admonished that 'the only check upon our own exercise of power is our own sense of self-restraint.',The Court cites Butler for a general principle about judicial restraint without analyzing or modifying the decision

103870,96087,"Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Co. v. May",Mentioned,"When Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for this Court, wrote that 'it must be remembered that legislatures are ultimate guardians of the liberties and welfare of the people in quite as great a degree as the courts,'",The Court cites May for a general principle about legislative authority without analyzing the case itself

S. 69, 79.",The Court cites Skiriotes alongside Rippey to emphasize the scope of its ruling without analyzing the case
103870,102879,Palko v. Connecticut,Mentioned,"When we are dealing with the Constitution of the United States, and more particularly with the great safeguards of the Bill of Rights, we are dealing with principles of liberty and justice 'so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental'",The Court cites Palko for a general constitutional principle without analyzing the case
103870,91054,Hurtado v. California,Mentioned,"When we are dealing with the Constitution of the United States, and more particularly with the great safeguards of the Bill of Rights, we are dealing with principles of liberty and justice 'so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental' ...

103870,96230,Jacobson v. Massachusetts,Distinguished,"Compulsory vaccination, see Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11, food inspection regulations... these are but illustrations of conduct that has often been compelled in the enforcement of legislation of general applicability",The dissent distinguishes Jacobson as involving different types of state compulsion than the flag salute requirement

104380,97674,David Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club of America,Overruled,"Cases like Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club, 225 U. S. 489, are obsolete insofar as they are based on a view of diversity jurisdiction which came to an end with Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64.",The Acting Decision explicitly states that Lupton's Sons Co. is obsolete and no longer valid law following Erie Railroad v. Tompkins.
104380,103012,Erie Railroad v. Tompkins,Mentioned,That decision drastically limited the power of federal district courts to entertain suits in diversity cases that could not be brought in the respective State courts or were barred by defenses controlling in the State courts.,"The Acting Decision references Erie to explain the current state of law regarding diversity jurisdiction, without any negative treatment."
104704,104459,Caldarola v. Eckert,Distinguished,"We are impelled to the conclusion that the Clarification Act affords no basis for distinguishing the present case from the Hust case and that the reasoning in the later Caldarola case, which we accept as sound, calls for the rejection of the basis of the Hust case.","The court uses Caldarola's reasoning to reject Hust's precedent, distinguishing how general agents under standard service agreements were not in possession and control of vessels."
104704,104320,"Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines, Inc.",Overruled,"Notwithstanding there may be some undesirable results in overruling Hust, such as loss of rights under the Suits in Admiralty Act by reliance on Hust, we think that in view of Caldarola, the uncertainty as to remedies that the two decisions generate, and the desirability of clarifying the position of the United States as an employer through the War Shipping Administration, that case should be and is overruled.",The court explicitly overrules Hust due to uncertainty in remedies and the need to clarify the US government's position as employer through the War Shipping Administration.
104704,1476725,McAllister v. Cosmopolitan Shipping Co.,Mentioned,"On appeal the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed. McAllister v.

104704,104389,"American Stevedores, Inc. v. Porello",Mentioned,"The Jones Act was welfare legislation that created new rights in seamen for damages arising from maritime torts.

Porello, 330 U. S. 446.",The case is merely cited as a comparison point regarding liberal construction of welfare legislation without substantive discussion.
104704,103761,Brady v. Roosevelt Steamship Co.,Distinguished,"As to the first conclusion, we think it arises from a misconception of the ruling of the Brady case. The Brady case decided no more, directly or by implication, than that an action could be maintained against agents of the United States at common law for the agents' own torts.","The court distinguishes Brady by clarifying that it only dealt with agents' liability for their own torts, not employer liability under the Jones Act."
2764117,104139,Williams v. North Carolina (1945),Distinguished,"Here, unlike the situation presented in Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U. S. 226 (1945), the finding of the requisite jurisdictional facts was made in proceedings in which the defendant appeared and participated.","The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes this case from Williams by noting that unlike Williams, this case involved a defendant who appeared and participated in the proceedings."
2764117,103096,Stoll v. Gottlieb,Mentioned,"Thus in Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165, 172 (1938), it was said: 'Courts to determine the rights of parties are an integral part of our system of government. It is just as important that there should be a place to end as that there should be a place to begin litigation.'","The Acting Decision cites Stoll to support its reasoning about the importance of finality in litigation, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
2764117,103736,Williams v. North Carolina (1943),Mentioned,"If in its application local policy must at times be required to give way, such 'is part of the price of our federal system.' Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 302 (1942).",The Acting Decision uses Williams to support its argument about the necessity of sometimes subordinating local policy to federal requirements.
2764117,103084,Davis v. Davis,Mentioned,"In Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32 (1938), the courts of the District of Columbia had refused to give effect to a decree of absolute divorce rendered in Virginia... This Court held that in failing to give recognition to the Virginia decree, the courts of the District had failed to accord the full faith and credit required by the Constitution.",The Acting Decision cites Davis as supporting precedent for its holding about full faith and credit requirements.
2764117,103236,Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co.,Mentioned,"And it applies to questions of jurisdiction of subject matter as well as to that of persons. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U. S. 165; Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 308 U. S. 66.","The Acting Decision references Treinies as part of explaining the scope of res judicata principles, without criticism or distinction."
2764117,95768,Andrews v. Andrews,Limited,"But insofar as the rule of that case may be said to be inconsistent with the judgment herein announced, it must be regarded as having been superseded by subsequent decisions of this Court.",The Acting Decision explicitly limits the precedential value of Andrews by stating that it has been superseded to the extent it conflicts with current doctrine.
2764117,98932,Chicago Life Insurance v. Cherry,Mentioned,"Under such circumstances, there is nothing in the concept of due process which demands that a defendant be afforded a second opportunity to litigate the existence of jurisdictional facts. Chicago Life Insurance Co. v. Cherry, 244 U. S. 25 (1917)",The Acting Decision cites Cherry as supporting precedent for its position on due process requirements.
2764117,101758,Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men's Assn.,Mentioned,"Under such circumstances, there is nothing in the concept of due process which demands that a defendant be afforded a second opportunity to litigate the existence of jurisdictional facts.

Baxter State Bank,Mentioned,"Res judicata forecloses relitigation if there has been an opportunity to litigate once, whether or not it has been availed of, or carried as far as possible. Cromwell v. County of Sac, 94 U. S. 351; Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank, 308 U.

104641,102539,"Oklahoma Ex Rel. Oklahoma Tax Commission v. Barnsdall Refineries, Inc.",Overruled,"They 'are out of harmony with correct principle,' as were the Gillespie and Coronado decisions and, accordingly, they should be, and they now are, overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Barnsdall Refineries along with other cases that granted tax immunity to private lessees of Indian lands, finding them inconsistent with modern principles of intergovernmental tax immunity."
104641,102986,Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp.,Mentioned,The groundings of the Mountain Producers decision do not permit limiting its effects to so narrow an application.,"The Acting Decision relies on and expands Mountain Producers' reasoning about limiting tax immunities, using it as foundational support for overruling earlier cases."
104641,98296,"Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad v. Harrison",Overruled,"Moreover, since the decisions in Choctaw, O. & G. R. Co. v. Harrison, supra, and Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, supra, rest upon the same foundations as those underlying the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions, indeed supplied those foundations, we think they too should be, and they now are, overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Choctaw as it rested on the same now-rejected principles of broad tax immunity for private lessees of Indian lands.

105014,102991,Lovell v. City of Griffin,Mentioned,"In a series of decisions beginning with Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652 (1925), this Court held that the liberty of speech and of the press which the First Amendment guarantees against abridgment by the federal government is within the liberty safeguarded by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action.",The Acting Decision cites Lovell as part of a series of cases establishing First Amendment protections against state action.
105014,104623,Kovacs v. Cooper,Mentioned,That much is evident from the series of decisions of this Court with respect to other media of communication of ideas.,The Acting Decision references Kovacs as part of established precedent regarding regulation of different forms of expression.

105319,103173,Pacific Employers Insurance v. Industrial Accident Comm'n,Distinguished,"Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission, 306 U. S. 493, departed, however, from the Clapper decision. There a resident of Massachusetts regularly employed in Massachusetts by a Massachusetts corporation was injured while doing temporary duty in California.","The Court distinguishes Pacific Employers by noting its different factual circumstances and explaining how it departed from prior precedent, particularly regarding how the state where injury occurs can override the home state's compensation act."
105319,101915,Bradford Elec. Light Co. v. Clapper,Distinguished,"It was indeed held in the Clapper case that a Vermont Compensation Act, which purported to give an exclusive remedy, barred a common-law action on the same claim in the New Hampshire courts by a Vermont employee against a Vermont employer, even though the injury occurred in New Hampshire.",The Court distinguishes Clapper by highlighting its specific circumstances involving Vermont law and explaining how subsequent cases have departed from its holding.
105319,102412,Broderick v. Rosner,Mentioned,"This is not a case like Hughes v. Fetter, 341 U. S. 609, where the State of the forum seeks to exclude from its courts actions arising under a foreign statute. In that case, we held that Wisconsin could not refuse to entertain a wrongful death action under an Illinois statute for an injury occurring in Illinois, since we found no sufficient policy considerations to warrant such refusal. And see Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629.","The Court merely references Broderick in passing while discussing a different case, without analyzing or applying its principles to the present case."
105319,3551998,Bunner v.

W. 2d 153, 156-157.","The Court simply cites Bunner to illustrate Missouri's interpretation of its Compensation Act, without critiquing or analyzing the decision."
105319,104916,Hughes v. Fetter,Distinguished,"This is not a case like Hughes v. Fetter, 341 U. S. 609, where the State of the forum seeks to exclude from its courts actions arising under a foreign statute.",The Court explicitly distinguishes Hughes by noting that the present case involves different circumstances than those where a state tries to exclude foreign causes of action.
105543,103736,Williams v. North Carolina,Distinguished,"Where status is concerned, this Court held that the interest in certainty as to whether one is married or single outweighs the interest of home States in the marital status of their domiciliaries, so that North Carolina was forced to swallow Nevada's views as to what is sufficient cause for divorce even though the North Carolina wife had not appeared in the Nevada proceeding.","The court distinguishes Williams by explaining that while it requires states to recognize out-of-state divorces regarding marital status, this principle does not extend to requiring recognition of support rights determinations."
105543,89656,Pennoyer v. Neff,Mentioned,It has long been the constitutional rule that a court cannot adjudicate a personal claim or obligation unless it has jurisdiction over the person of the defendant.,"The court cites Pennoyer to support the established principle about personal jurisdiction requirements, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
105543,97747,Thompson v. Thompson,Overruled,"the Thompson case, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.",The court explicitly states that Thompson's holding regarding ex parte divorce's effect on alimony rights is no longer valid law.

S. 541, this Court decided that a Nevada divorce court, which had no personal jurisdiction over the wife, had no power to terminate a husband's obligation to provide her support as required in a preexisting New York separation decree.","The court references Estin to explain existing precedent regarding divorce courts' jurisdiction over support obligations, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
104965,96482,Ayer & Lord Co. v. Commonwealth of Kentucky,Limited,"The rationale of those cases was rejected in Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co., 336 U.

S. 18, first applied to railroad cars in interstate commerce.",The lead opinion indicates that the rationale used in Ayer & Lord was rejected in favor of an apportionment approach for taxing vessels in interstate commerce.

S. 299), Ohio, the state of the domicile, would have a strong claim to the whole of the tax that has been levied. But the rationale of those cases was rejected in Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co.","The court explicitly states that the rationale of this case, which supported domiciliary state taxation, was rejected in favor of an apportionment approach."
104965,96495,New York Ex Rel. New York Central & Hudson River Railroad v. Miller,Distinguished,"But in that case it did not appear that 'any specific cars or any average of cars' was so continuously in another state as to be taxable there. P. 597. [...] Those cases, though exceptional on their facts, illustrate the reach of the taxing power of the state of the domicile as contrasted to that of the other states. But they have no application here since most, if not all, of the barges and boats which Ohio has taxed were almost continuously outside Ohio during the taxable year.",The court explicitly distinguishes Miller from the present case based on the continuous presence of the vessels outside the domiciliary state.
104965,88336,St. Louis v. Ferry Co.,Limited,"Under the earlier view governing the taxability of vessels moving in the inland waters (St. Louis v. Ferry Co., 11 Wall. 423 [...]), Ohio, the state of the domicile, would have a strong claim to the whole of the tax that has been levied. But the rationale of those cases was rejected in Ott v.

S. 292, allowed the domiciliary state to tax the entire fleet of airplanes operating interstate; but in that case, as in the Miller case, it was not shown that 'a defined part of the domiciliary corpus' had acquired a taxable situs elsewhere. [...] But they have no application here since most, if not all, of the barges and boats which Ohio has taxed were almost continuously outside Ohio during the taxable year.",The court explicitly distinguishes this case from the present situation based on the continuous presence of the vessels outside the domiciliary state.
104965,96335,Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky,Mentioned,"The rule which permits taxation by two or more states on an apportionment basis precludes taxation of all of the property by the state of the domicile. See Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, 199 U. S. 194.",The case is cited positively to support the principle that apportioned taxation by multiple states precludes full taxation by the domiciliary state.
106235,104252,Commissioner v. Wilcox,Overruled,"Our conclusion is that the case of Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra, should be, and it is, overruled.","The lead opinion explicitly states that Wilcox was wrongly decided and should be overruled, with the majority of justices agreeing to overturn this precedent."
106235,104992,Rutkin v. United States,Distinguished,"In Rutkin, the Court did not overrule Wilcox, but stated: 'We do not reach in this case the factual situation involved in Commissioner v. Wilcox, 327 U. S. 404. We limit that case to its facts.'","The Court discusses how Rutkin was distinguished from Wilcox at the time, though ultimately uses this distinction to show why Wilcox should now be overruled."
106235,101568,Corliss v. Bowers,Mentioned,"In such case, the taxpayer has 'actual command over the property taxed - the actual benefit for which the tax is paid,' Corliss v. Bowers, supra.","The Court cites Corliss merely to support its reasoning about taxable income, without significantly analyzing or modifying the precedent."

Sullivan,Mentioned,"And, the Court has pointed out, with approval, that there 'has been a widespread and settled administrative and judicial recognition of the taxability of unlawful gains of many kinds,' Rutkin v.

Burnet,Mentioned,"If a taxpayer receives earnings under a claim of right and without restriction as to its [sic] disposition, he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the money.","The Court cites this case to explain principles of taxable income, without significantly analyzing or modifying the precedent."
106235,104867,United States v. Lewis,Mentioned,"When a law-abiding taxpayer mistakenly receives income in one year, which receipt is assailed and found to be invalid in a subsequent year, the taxpayer must nonetheless report the amount as 'gross income' in the year received.

105525,93107,In Re Ross,Overruled,"The Ross case is one of those cases that cannot be understood except in its peculiar setting; even then, it seems highly unlikely that a similar result would be reached today... The Ross approach that the Constitution has no applicability abroad has long since been directly repudiated by numerous cases.","The Court explicitly rejects Ross's holding that constitutional protections do not apply abroad, stating it was based on a fundamental misconception and should be left as a relic from a different era."
105525,105326,United States Ex Rel. Toth v. Quarles,Distinguished,"There are no supportable grounds upon which to distinguish the Toth case from the present cases. Toth, Mrs. Covert, and Mrs. Smith were all civilians. All three were American citizens. All three were tried for murder.",The Court analyzes Toth's similarities to the present cases but ultimately reaches a different conclusion based on the specific circumstances of civilian dependents abroad.
105525,96130,Dorr v. United States,Limited,The 'Insular Cases' can be distinguished from the present cases in that they involved the power of Congress to provide rules and regulations to govern temporarily territories with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions whereas here the basis for governmental power is American citizenship.,The Court limits Dorr's application by distinguishing it from cases involving American citizens abroad.
105525,105412,Kinsella v. Krueger,Overruled,"And, finally, the Court reverses, sets aside, and overrules two majority opinions and judgments of this Court in these same cases, reported in 351 U.S., at 470 and 487, and entered on June 11, 1956, less than 12 months ago.",The Court explicitly overrules its previous decision in Kinsella from just months earlier.
105525,95504,Downes v. Bidwell,Limited,"The 'Insular Cases,' which arose at the turn of the century, involved territories which had only recently been conquered or acquired by the United States...

105525,95894,Hawaii v. Mankichi,Limited,The 'Insular Cases' can be distinguished from the present cases in that they involved the power of Congress to provide rules and regulations to govern temporarily territories with wholly dissimilar traditions and institutions whereas here the basis for governmental power is American citizenship.,The Court limits Mankichi's application by distinguishing it from cases involving American citizens abroad.
105525,85272,McCulloch v. Maryland,Distinguished,"Nothing said here contravenes the rule laid down in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, at 421... Here the problem is different. Not only does Clause 14, by its terms, limit military jurisdiction to members of the 'land and naval Forces,' but Art. III, § 2 and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments require that certain express safeguards... shall be given in criminal prosecutions.","The Court distinguishes McCulloch by noting that unlike that case, here there are specific constitutional restraints on governmental power."

105525,1528394,Ex Parte Milligan,Mentioned,"Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, one of the great landmarks in this Court's history, held that military authorities were without power to try civilians not in the military or naval service by declaring martial law in an area where the civil administration was not deposed and the courts were not closed.",The Court cites Milligan approvingly as historical precedent but does not significantly rely on or modify its holding.
105525,99954,Balzac v. Porto Rico,Limited,"Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.

Covert decision from the previous year.
106576,100181,Adkins v. Children's Hospital of Columbia,Overruled,"reliance on Adams v. Tanner is as mistaken as would be adherence to Adkins v. Children's Hospital, overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937)",The court explicitly acknowledges that Adkins has been overruled by a previous case and uses it as an example of outdated jurisprudence.
106576,96276,Lochner v. New York,Criticized,"The doctrine that prevailed in Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns, and like cases — that due process authorizes courts to hold laws unconstitutional when they believe the legislature has acted unwisely — has long since been discarded.",The court explicitly criticizes the doctrine established in Lochner and states that it has been abandoned.
106576,101029,Tyson & Brother v. Banton,Mentioned,"Dissenting from the Court's invalidating a state statute which regulated the resale price of theatre and other tickets, Mr. Justice Holmes said...",The case is referenced neutrally to provide context for Justice Holmes' dissenting opinion.
106576,103522,"Olsen v. Nebraska Ex Rel. Western Reference & Bond Assn., Inc.",Mentioned,"As this Court stated in a unanimous opinion in 1941, 'We are not concerned . . . with the wisdom, need, or appropriateness of the legislation.'",The case is cited positively as support for the court's current approach but without significant discussion of its merits.

Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.",Mentioned,"...to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought",The case is referenced to support the court's position against judicial intervention in economic legislation.

106576,98999,Adams v. Tanner,Overruled,"Not only has the philosophy of Adams been abandoned, but also this Court almost 15 years ago expressly pointed to another opinion of this Court as having 'clearly undermined' Adams",The court explicitly states that Adams' philosophy has been abandoned and was undermined by previous decisions.
106883,106545,Gideon v. Wainwright,Mentioned,"In Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, we held that every person accused of a crime, whether state or federal, is entitled to a lawyer at trial.","The Acting Decision cites Gideon to establish the foundational right to counsel principle, using it as supporting precedent without criticism or modification."

106883,106822,Massiah v. United States,Mentioned,"In Massiah v. United States, 377 U. S. 201, this Court observed that 'a Constitution which guarantees a defendant the aid of counsel at ... trial could surely vouchsafe no less to an indicted defendant under interrogation by the police in a completely extrajudicial proceeding.'","The Acting Decision uses Massiah as supporting precedent to extend the right to counsel principles, without criticizing or modifying it."

106883,105917,Spano v. New York,Mentioned,"When petitioner requested, and was denied, an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, the investigation had ceased to be a general investigation of 'an unsolved crime.' Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 327","The Acting Decision uses Spano as supporting precedent to distinguish between general investigation and focused interrogation, without criticism or modification."

106285,104709,Wolf v. Colorado,Overruled,"Today we once again examine Wolf's constitutional documentation of the right to privacy free from unreasonable state intrusion, and, after its dozen years on our books, are led by it to close the only courtroom door remaining open to evidence secured by official lawlessness in flagrant abuse of that basic right, reserved to all persons as a specific guarantee against that very same unlawful conduct. We hold that all evidence obtained by searches and seizures in violation of the Constitution is, by that same authority, inadmissible in a state court.","The Court explicitly overrules Wolf's holding that states could admit evidence obtained through unconstitutional searches, replacing it with a rule requiring exclusion of such evidence in state courts."
106285,3599253,People v. Defore,Criticized,"Likewise, time has set its face against what Wolf called the 'weighty testimony' of People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13, 150 N.

106285,98094,Weeks v. United States,Mentioned,"Thus, in the year 1914, in the Weeks case, this Court 'for the first time' held that 'in a federal prosecution the Fourth Amendment barred the use of evidence secured through an illegal search and seizure.'","The Court references Weeks to establish historical context and precedent, but does not modify its holding or significance."
106285,105194,Irvine v. California,Mentioned,"Some five years after Wolf, in answer to a plea made here Term after Term that we overturn its doctrine on applicability of the Weeks exclusionary rule, this Court indicated that such should not be done until the States had 'adequate opportunity to adopt or reject the [Weeks] rule.' Irvine v. California, supra, at 134.","The Court cites Irvine as historical context for its current decision, without significantly affecting its precedential value."
106285,1237532,People v. Cahan,Mentioned,"Significantly, among those now following the rule is California, which, according to its highest court, was 'compelled to reach that conclusion because other remedies have completely failed to secure compliance with the constitutional provisions...' People v. Cahan, 44 Cal. 2d 434, 445, 282 P. 2d 905, 911 (1955).","The Court references Cahan as an example of state adoption of the exclusionary rule, without modifying its precedential value."
106285,91573,Boyd v. United States,Mentioned,"Seventy-five years ago, in Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 630 (1886), considering the Fourth and Fifth Amendments as running 'almost into each other' on the facts before it, this Court held that the doctrines of those Amendments 'apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employés of the sanctity of a man's home and the privacies of life.'","The Court cites Boyd to provide historical context for Fourth Amendment protections, without significantly affecting its precedential value."
107121,105848,Brown v. United States,Overruled,"We overrule Brown v. United States, supra, and reverse and remand this case for proceedings under Rule 42 (b).","The Court explicitly states it is overruling Brown v. United States, rejecting its previous interpretation of when Rule 42(a) versus 42(b) procedures should apply in contempt cases."
107121,268056,United States v. Andimo Pappadio,Mentioned,"In more than one instance in the Southern District of New York, from which this case comes, witnesses cited for testimonial contempt before the grand jury were given hearings under Rule 42 (b). E.g., United States v. Castaldi, 338 F. 2d 883; United States v. Tramunti, 343 F. 2d 548; United States v. Shillitani, 345 F. 2d 290; United States v. Pappadio, 346 F. 2d 5.",The case is merely cited as an example of proper Rule 42(b) procedure being followed in similar contempt cases.
107121,267423,United States v. Carmine Tramunti,Mentioned,"In more than one instance in the Southern District of New York, from which this case comes, witnesses cited for testimonial contempt before the grand jury were given hearings under Rule 42 (b). E.g., United States v. Castaldi, 338 F. 2d 883; United States v. Tramunti, 343 F. 2d 548; United States v. Shillitani, 345 F. 2d 290; United States v. Pappadio, 346 F. 2d 5.",The case is simply referenced as an example of proper Rule 42(b) procedure being followed in similar contempt cases.
107121,92334,Ex Parte Terry,Mentioned,"Rule 42 (a) was described by the Advisory Committee as 'substantially a restatement of existing law. Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289; Cooke v. United States...'","The case is merely cited as historical background for Rule 42(a), without any substantive treatment of its holdings."
107121,106057,Levine v. United States,Limited,"Brown v. United States was reaffirmed and followed in Levine v. United States, 362 U. S. 610.","Since the Court explicitly overrules Brown v. United States, it effectively limits the precedential value of Levine which had reaffirmed Brown."
107121,266063,United States v. Anthony Castaldi,Mentioned,"In more than one instance in the Southern District of New York, from which this case comes, witnesses cited for testimonial contempt before the grand jury were given hearings under Rule 42 (b). E.g., United States v. Castaldi, 338 F. 2d 883; United States v. Tramunti, 343 F. 2d 548; United States v. Shillitani, 345 F. 2d 290; United States v.

107081,104790,American Communications Assn. v. Douds,Overruled,"It is not difficult to find some of the cases and statutes which the necessary implications of the Court's approach will overrule or invalidate. American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, which upheld the predecessor statute to § 504 is obviously overruled.","The dissent explicitly states that Douds is overruled by the majority's decision, as the Court now forbids Congress from doing precisely what was validated in Douds."
107081,106267,Communist Party of United States v. Subversive Activities Control Bd.,Distinguished,"The Court apparently agrees that the Subversive Activities Control Act was not a bill of attainder with regard to the Communist Party because, as the Court pointed out in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 367 U. S. 1, the finding that the Party was a Communist-action organization was not made by the legislature but was made administratively, after a trial-type hearing and subject to judicial review.","The Court distinguishes this case by noting that unlike the present statute, the finding about the Communist Party was made administratively rather than legislatively."
107081,104353,Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System v. Agnew,Distinguished,"First, we note that § 504, unlike § 32 of the Banking Act, inflicts its deprivation upon the members of a political group thought to present a threat to the national security. Second, § 32 incorporates no judgment censuring or condemning any man or group of men.",The Court explicitly distinguishes Agnew by highlighting key differences in how the statutes operate and their underlying purposes.
107081,87778,Cummings v. Missouri,Mentioned,"A punitive purpose has been found when it could be said that a statute passed amid the fierce passions aroused by the Civil War bore no rational connection to any permissible legislative purpose. Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall. 277, 319, 322.","The case is cited as historical precedent to illustrate when legislative purpose has been found punitive, without being criticized or distinguished."
107081,104303,United States v. Lovett,Mentioned,"The next extended discussion of the Bill of Attainder Clause came in 1946, in United States v. Lovett, 328 U. S. 303, where the Court invalidated § 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act.","The case is cited as an important precedent in bill of attainder jurisprudence, with the Court following its reasoning rather than criticizing or distinguishing it."
107081,94855,Hawker v. New York,Distinguished,"Though the Court makes no attempt to distinguish the Hawker-type laws it apparently would save them, see Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 96-97 (Warren, C. J., announcing judgment), and with them the provision of the statute now before the Court which disqualifies felons from holding union office.",The Court implicitly distinguishes Hawker by suggesting it would preserve such laws while striking down the present statute.
107081,106534,Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,Mentioned,"We summarized the relevant considerations in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, supra: 'Whether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint, whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment...'","The case is cited for its analytical framework regarding punishment, without being criticized or distinguished."
107464,105658,Perez v. Brownell,Overruled,Perez v. Brownell is overruled.,"The Court explicitly states that it is overruling Perez, rejecting its previous holding that Congress could strip citizenship without the citizen's voluntary renunciation."
107464,94842,United States v. Wong Kim Ark,Mentioned,"And this was the unequivocal statement of the Court in the case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U. S. 649. The issues in that case were whether a person born in the United States to Chinese aliens was a citizen of the United States and whether, nevertheless, he could be excluded under the Chinese Exclusion Act.","The Court cites Wong Kim Ark as historical precedent discussing citizenship rights, but does not significantly rely on or modify its holding."
107464,91470,Kurtz v. Moffitt,Mentioned,"Third, the section was apparently understood by various courts to result in expatriation; in particular, Mr. Justice Strong, while a member of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, construed the section to cause a 'forfeiture of citizenship,' Huber v. Reily, 53 Pa. 112, 118, and although this point was not expressly reached, his general understanding of the statute was approved by this Court in Kurtz v. Moffitt, 115 U. S. 487, 501.","The Court references Kurtz merely as historical evidence of how certain statutes were interpreted, without significantly engaging with its holding."
107464,105659,Trop v. Dulles,Mentioned,"It was this provision that, after various recodifications, was held unconstitutional by this Court in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86.","The Court cites Trop as historical background regarding expatriation provisions, without significantly engaging with or modifying its holding."
107464,98579,MacKenzie v. Hare,Distinguished,"Despite counsel's invocation of Wong Kim Ark, id., at 302 and 303, the Court held in Mackenzie that marriage between an American citizen and an alien, unaccompanied by any intention of the citizen to renounce her citizenship, nonetheless permitted Congress to withdraw her nationality.","The Court distinguishes Mackenzie's holding about Congress's power to withdraw citizenship, as it takes a different view of Congress's authority in the present case."
107252,106625,Haynes v. Washington,Mentioned,"In Haynes v. Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 514 (1963). The denial of the defendant's request for his attorney thus undermined his ability to exercise the privilege","The Acting Decision cites Haynes as supporting precedent when discussing how denial of counsel can undermine a suspect's rights, without criticizing or distinguishing it"
107252,94782,Bram v. United States,Mentioned,"In Bram, the Court reviewed the British and American history and case law and set down the Fifth Amendment standard for compulsion which we implement today","The Acting Decision relies on Bram as foundational precedent supporting its analysis of Fifth Amendment protections, treating it as valid authority"
107252,106883,Escobedo v. Illinois,Mentioned,"We have undertaken a thorough re-examination of the Escobedo decision and the principles it announced, and we reaffirm it",The Acting Decision explicitly reaffirms and builds upon Escobedo's principles regarding custodial interrogation rights
107252,106862,Malloy v. Hogan,Mentioned,"Our decision in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964), necessitates an examination of the scope of the privilege in state cases as well",The Acting Decision treats Malloy as valid precedent that requires extending Fifth Amendment analysis to state cases
107252,105745,Crooker v. California,Overruled,"In accordance with our holdings today and in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 492, Crooker v. California, 357 U.S. 433 (1958) and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U.S. 504 (1958) are not to be followed","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Crooker should not be followed, effectively overruling it"
107252,103981,Ashcraft v. Tennessee,Mentioned,"Since Chambers v. Florida, 309 U.S. 227, this Court has recognized that coercion can be mental as well as physical, and that the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition",The Acting Decision cites Ashcraft as supporting precedent for the principle that psychological coercion is constitutionally significant
107252,106558,Lynumn v. Illinois,Mentioned,"Individual weakness or incapacities, Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U.S. 528",The Acting Decision cites Lynumn as precedent for considering individual vulnerabilities in assessing coercion
107252,100471,Ziang Sung Wan v. United States,Mentioned,"In 1924, Mr. Justice Brandeis wrote for a unanimous Court in reversing a conviction resting on a compelled confession, Wan v. United States, 266 U.S. 1",The Acting Decision cites Wan approvingly as precedent supporting its analysis of compelled confessions
107252,104108,Malinski v. New York,Mentioned,"This is so even if there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction, e.g., Malinski v. New York, 324 U.S. 401, 404",The Acting Decision cites Malinski as supporting precedent for the principle that coerced confessions are inadmissible regardless of other evidence
107252,91057,Hopt v. People of Territory of Utah,Distinguished,"Thus prior to Bram the Court, in Hopt v. Utah, 110 U.S. 574, 583-587, had upheld the admissibility of a confession made to police officers following arrest... The Court's holding today is neither compelled nor even strongly suggested by the language of the Fifth Amendment",The dissenting opinion distinguishes Hopt as representing a different approach to confession admissibility than the new rule being established
107252,105750,Cicenia v. Lagay,Overruled,"In accordance with our holdings today and in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 492, Crooker v. California, 357 U.S. 433 (1958) and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U.S. 504 (1958) are not to be followed","The Acting Decision explicitly states that Cicenia should not be followed, effectively overruling it"
107473,105880,Frank v. Maryland,Overruled,"Having concluded that Frank v. Maryland, to the extent that it sanctioned such warrantless inspections, must be overruled, we reverse.","The Court explicitly overrules Frank v. Maryland's holding that warrantless administrative inspections were constitutional, finding that such inspections violate Fourth Amendment rights."
107473,106109,Ohio Ex Rel. Eaton v. Price,Mentioned,"In Eaton v. Price, 364 U. S. 263, a similar conviction was affirmed by an equally divided Court.","The Court merely references Eaton v. Price as historical context, noting it was decided by an equally divided court."
107473,106641,Ker v. California,Mentioned,"As such, the Fourth Amendment is enforceable against the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 30.",The Court cites Ker only to support the established principle that the Fourth Amendment applies to states through the Fourteenth Amendment.
107473,2305304,Givner v. State,Distinguished,"Relying on Frank v. Maryland, Eaton v. Price, and decisions in other States, the District Court of Appeal held that § 503 does not violate Fourth Amendment rights",The Court implicitly distinguishes Givner by rejecting its reasoning along with similar state cases that had upheld warrantless administrative searches.
107473,106777,Stoner v. California,Mentioned,"See, e.g., Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483",The Court cites Stoner as one example supporting the principle that searches without proper consent are unreasonable unless authorized by valid warrant.
107473,104605,McDonald v. United States,Mentioned,"See, e.g., Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483; United States v. Jeffers, 342 U. S. 48; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451",The Court cites McDonald as one of several cases supporting the principle that warrantless searches are unreasonable without proper consent.
107473,2062881,Paquette v. City of Fall River,Mentioned,"See Abbate Bros. v. City of Chicago, 11 Ill. 2d 337, 142 N. E. 2d 691; [...] Paquette v. City of Fall River, 338 Mass. 368, 155 N. E. 2d 775",The Court cites Paquette as one of several cases supporting municipalities' police power to impose minimum standards on private property.

E. 2d 120",The Court cites Adamec as one of several cases supporting municipalities' police power to impose minimum standards on private property.
107473,107262,Schmerber v. California,Mentioned,"See Schmerber v. California, 384 U. S. 757, 770-771",The Court cites Schmerber to support its analysis of when public interest might justify exceptions to Fourth Amendment warrant requirements.
107564,107483,Berger v. New York,Distinguished,"In this respect today's opinion differs sharply from Berger v. New York, 388 U. S. 41, decided last Term, which held void on its face a New York statute authorizing wiretapping on warrants issued by magistrates on showings of probable cause.","The Court explicitly distinguishes its current approach from Berger, noting that unlike Berger which created obstacles to wiretapping laws, this decision provides clearer guidance for valid wiretapping regulations."
107564,107465,"Warden, Maryland Penitentiary v. Hayden",Mentioned,The premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited.,"The Court cites Hayden to support its broader interpretation of Fourth Amendment protections beyond just property interests, but does not significantly analyze or modify the cited case."
107564,106187,Silverman v. United States,Distinguished,The Court has in the past sustained instances of electronic eavesdropping against constitutional challenge... It has been insisted only that the electronic device not be planted by an unlawful physical invasion of a constitutionally protected area. Silverman v. United States.,The Court distinguishes Silverman's focus on physical intrusion from the current case's broader protection of privacy regardless of physical penetration.
107564,106622,Lopez v. United States,Mentioned,"The Court has in the past sustained instances of electronic eavesdropping against constitutional challenge, when devices have been used to enable government agents to overhear conversations which would have been beyond the reach of the human ear [citing Olmstead and Goldman]. It has been insisted only that the electronic device not be planted by an unlawful physical invasion of a constitutionally protected area.",The Court references Lopez as historical context for previous electronic surveillance doctrine without criticizing or substantially modifying it.
107564,106641,Ker v. California,Mentioned,"See Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 37-41","The Court merely cites Ker as an example regarding notice requirements, without significant analysis or modification of its holdings."

107564,103664,Goldman v. United States,Overruled,We conclude that the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the 'trespass' doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling.,The Court explicitly overrules Goldman's trespass doctrine as no longer valid for Fourth Amendment analysis.
107564,101320,Olmstead v. United States,Overruled,We conclude that the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been so eroded by our subsequent decisions that the 'trespass' doctrine there enunciated can no longer be regarded as controlling.,The Court explicitly overrules Olmstead's trespass doctrine and its narrow interpretation of Fourth Amendment protections.
107746,105055,Schwartz v. Texas,Overruled,"In view of the Nardone and Benanti decisions, the doctrine of Schwartz v. Texas cannot survive the demise of Wolf v. Colorado",The lead opinion explicitly states that Schwartz's doctrinal foundation has been removed and can no longer stand as valid precedent.
107746,104709,Wolf v. Colorado,Mentioned,"That doctrinal underpinning of the Schwartz decision was, of course, completely removed by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, which overruled Wolf","The court mentions Wolf only to note it was already overruled by Mapp, not to directly treat it in this case."
107746,102883,Nardone v. United States,Mentioned,"In Nardone v. United States, 302 U. S. 379, the Court was first called upon to decide whether § 605 had indeed served to render evidence of intercepted communications inadmissible in a federal trial","The court cites Nardone as supporting precedent and refers to it to explain the historical development of the law, without modifying or criticizing it."
107746,98094,Weeks v. United States,Mentioned,"This statutory question does not involve any constitutional exclusionary rule, cf. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, or the supervisory power of this Court over the lower federal courts, cf. Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383","Weeks is only mentioned in passing as a reference point for discussing the Court's supervisory power, without any substantive treatment."
107746,106107,Elkins v. United States,Mentioned,"We conclude, as we concluded in Elkins and in Mapp, that nothing short of mandatory exclusion of the illegal evidence will compel respect for the federal law","The court cites Elkins as supporting precedent for its conclusion, without modifying or criticizing its holding."
107685,102879,Palko v. Connecticut,Overruled,"Respectfully, we reject the prior dicta regarding jury trial in criminal cases.",The Court explicitly rejects Palko's position that jury trials are not essential to ordered liberty and may be dispensed with by states.

107685,107014,Pointer v. Texas,Mentioned,"The test has been asked whether a right is among those 'fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,'... and whether it is 'a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,' Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 343-344 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965).",The Court cites Pointer as part of a line of cases establishing the test for determining which rights are fundamental and thus applicable to states.

107685,102801,District of Columbia v. Clawans,Distinguished,"In Clawans the defendant was jailed for 60 days, but it was the 90-day authorized punishment on which the Court focused in determining that the offense was not one for which the Constitution assured trial by jury.",The Court distinguishes Clawans by noting that the present case involves a more serious potential punishment (2 years) than the 90-day sentence at issue in Clawans.
107685,106545,Gideon v. Wainwright,Mentioned,"The test has been asked whether a right is among those... 'a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,' Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.

107343,104974,Adler v. Board of Ed. of City of New York,Overruled,"Moreover, to the extent that Adler sustained the provision of the Feinberg Law constituting membership in an organization advocating forceful overthrow of government a ground for disqualification, pertinent constitutional doctrines have since rejected the premises upon which that conclusion rested. Adler is therefore not dispositive of the constitutional issues we must decide in this case.",The Court explicitly states that subsequent constitutional doctrines have rejected Adler's premises and that it is no longer controlling precedent for the issues at hand.
107343,106837,Baggett v. Bullitt,Mentioned,"This is not a case where abstention pending state court interpretation would be appropriate, Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 375-379","The Court cites Baggett simply as supporting precedent regarding when abstention is not appropriate, without criticizing or distinguishing it."

Tucker, supra, at 487",The Court cites Shelton approvingly to emphasize the importance of protecting constitutional freedoms in educational settings.
107343,105537,Yates v. United States,Mentioned,"This provision is plainly susceptible of sweeping and improper application. It may well prohibit the employment of one who merely advocates the doctrine in the abstract without any attempt to indoctrinate others, or incite others to action in furtherance of unlawful aims. See Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242; Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298",The Court cites Yates as supporting precedent for distinguishing between abstract advocacy and incitement to action.
107343,106311,Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction of Orange Cty.,Mentioned,"The regulatory maze created by New York is wholly lacking in 'terms susceptible of objective measurement.' Cramp v.

107689,107408,Nowakowski v. Maroney,Mentioned,"In Nowakowski, we held that 'when a district judge grants ... a certificate [of probable cause], the court of appeals must grant an appeal in forma pauperis (assuming the requisite showing of poverty), and proceed to a disposition of the appeal in accord with its ordinary procedure.'",The Court cites and applies Nowakowski as controlling precedent without criticizing or modifying it.
107689,104336,Fiswick v. United States,Mentioned,"Because of these 'disabilities or burdens [which] may flow from' petitioner's conviction, he has 'a substantial stake in the judgment of conviction which survives the satisfaction of the sentence imposed on him.' Fiswick v. United States, 329 U. S. 211, 222 (1946)",The Court cites Fiswick approvingly to support its reasoning about collateral consequences.
107689,265136,Nathan Thomas v. W. K. Cunningham,Mentioned,"See Thomas v. Cunningham, 335 F. 2d 67 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1964)",The decision is merely cited in a footnote without substantive discussion.
107689,107084,Linkletter v. Walker,Mentioned,"see also Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U. S. 618, 628, n. 13 and 639, n. 20 (1965)",The decision is cited only as a reference point without substantive discussion.

107689,95249,Ex Parte Baez,Mentioned,"See Parker v. Ellis, supra, at 582, n. 8 (WARREN, C. J., dissenting); Ex parte Baez, 177 U. S. 378 (1900)",The decision is merely referenced in discussing prior precedent without substantive treatment.

107689,103486,Ex Parte Hull,Mentioned,"Cf. Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S. 546 (1941)",The decision is cited only as a comparison point without substantive discussion.
107679,102317,McNally v. Hill,Overruled,We overrule McNally and hold that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is 'in custody' under any one of them for purposes of § 2241 (c)(3).,"The court explicitly overrules McNally, finding that its interpretation of the habeas corpus statute was unnecessarily narrow and inconsistent with the purpose of the writ."
107679,106507,Jones v. Cunningham,Mentioned,"What we said of the writ in a similar context in Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963), is equally applicable here. '[The writ] is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purpose.'",The court cites Jones approvingly to support its view that habeas corpus is a flexible remedy that should be interpreted broadly.
107679,100122,Moore v. Dempsey,Mentioned,"To that extent, it also undermines Moore v. Dempsey, supra, and is inconsistent with subsequent decisions of this Court which have reaffirmed Moore.",The court references Moore positively as establishing important precedent about the scope of habeas corpus that McNally undermined.
107679,106548,Fay v. Noia,Mentioned,"Calendar congestion, considerations of federalism, see, e. g., Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S., at 415-420","The court cites Fay as supporting authority regarding considerations of federalism in habeas corpus cases, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
107606,104585,Shapiro v. United States,Distinguished,"We think that neither Shapiro nor the cases upon which it relied are applicable here... Each of the three principal elements of the doctrine, as it is described in Shapiro, is absent from this situation.","The court explicitly distinguishes Shapiro by identifying three key differences: the type of records required, the public aspects of the information, and the regulatory vs. criminal nature of the inquiry."
107606,105090,United States v. Kahriger,Overruled,We conclude that nothing in the Court's opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner's assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.,The court explicitly overrules Kahriger after finding its reasoning about the privilege against self-incrimination no longer persuasive.
107606,101083,United States v. Sullivan,Distinguished,"Unlike the income tax return in question in United States v. Sullivan, every portion of these requirements had the direct and unmistakable consequence of incriminating petitioner; the application of the constitutional privilege to the entire registration procedure was in this instance neither 'extreme' nor 'extravagant.'","The court distinguishes Sullivan by explaining that unlike the income tax return in Sullivan, the wagering tax requirements were entirely self-incriminating."
107606,105280,Lewis v. United States,Overruled,We conclude that nothing in the Court's opinions in Kahriger and Lewis now suffices to preclude petitioner's assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted. To this extent Kahriger and Lewis are overruled.,The court explicitly overrules Lewis along with Kahriger after finding its reasoning about the privilege against self-incrimination no longer persuasive.
107606,107110,Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board,Mentioned,"Certiorari was limited to the following questions: 'Do not the federal wagering tax statutes here involved violate the petitioner's privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment? Should not this Court, especially in view of its recent decision in Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 382 U. S. 70 (1965), overrule United States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22 (1953), and Lewis v. United States, 348 U. S. 419 (1955)?'","Albertson is merely referenced as part of the questions presented for review, without any substantive discussion of its holdings or reasoning."
107606,106864,Murphy v. Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor,Distinguished,"Finally, we have been urged by the United States to permit continued enforcement of the registration and occupational tax provisions, despite the demands of the constitutional privilege, by shielding the privilege's claimants through the imposition of restrictions upon the use by federal and state authorities of information obtained as a consequence of compliance with the wagering tax requirements. It is suggested that these restrictions might be similar to those imposed by the Court in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission... Nonetheless, we think that it would be entirely inappropriate in the circumstances here for the Court to impose such restrictions.",The court distinguishes Murphy by explaining why its approach of imposing use restrictions would be inappropriate in this case.
107965,104914,Dennis v. United States,Criticized,"But in Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, we opened wide the door, distorting the 'clear and present danger' test beyond recognition.","The Court explicitly criticizes Dennis for distorting the 'clear and present danger' test and making it too broad, indicating strong disapproval of its reasoning."
107965,102821,Herndon v. Lowry,Mentioned,"The Court in Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242, overturned a conviction for exercising First Amendment rights to incite insurrection because of lack of evidence of incitement.","The case is cited as a historical example without criticism or substantial analysis, merely noting its holding regarding evidence requirements for incitement."
107965,105537,Yates v. United States,Mentioned,"Advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow of government as an abstract principle is immune from prosecution. Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 318.","The case is referenced neutrally to illustrate a legal principle about advocacy of abstract ideas, without criticism or substantial analysis."
107965,99321,Frohwerk v. United States,Mentioned,"Frohwerk v. United States, 249 U. S. 204, also authored by Mr. Justice Holmes, involved prosecution and punishment for publication of articles very critical of the war effort in World War I.","The case is cited as a historical example in discussing the development of First Amendment doctrine, without criticism or substantial analysis."
107965,99322,Debs v. United States,Mentioned,"Debs v. United States, 249 U. S. 211, was the third of the trilogy of the 1918 Term. Debs was convicted of speaking in opposition to the war where his 'opposition was so expressed that its natural and intended effect would be to obstruct recruiting.'",The case is referenced as historical context without any significant criticism or analysis of its holding.
107965,101097,Whitney v. California,Overruled,"The Court quite properly overrules Whitney v. California, 274 U. S. 357, which involved advocacy of ideas which the majority of the Court deemed unsound and dangerous.","The Court explicitly states that Whitney is overruled, indicating a complete rejection of its precedential value."
107980,107685,Duncan v. Louisiana,Mentioned,"Only last Term we found that the right to trial by jury in criminal cases was 'fundamental to the American scheme of justice,' Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 149 (1968), and held that the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial was applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.","The Acting Decision cites Duncan as supportive precedent for incorporating Bill of Rights protections to states, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
107980,102879,Palko v. Connecticut,Overruled,"Insofar as it is inconsistent with this holding, Palko v. Connecticut is overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Palko's holding that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply to states through the Fourteenth Amendment.
107980,94515,United States v. Ball,Mentioned,"This case is totally indistinguishable. Petitioner was acquitted of larceny. He has, under Green, a valid double jeopardy plea which he cannot be forced to waive. Yet Maryland wants the earlier acquittal set aside, over petitioner's objections, because of a defect in the indictment. This it cannot do.","The Acting Decision cites Ball as supportive precedent for its reasoning, using it to reinforce its conclusion without criticism or distinction."
107980,107730,Sibron v. New York,Mentioned,"In Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40 (1968), we held that a criminal case did not become moot upon the expiration of the sentence imposed.","The Acting Decision cites Sibron as supportive precedent regarding mootness doctrine, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
107980,106862,Malloy v. Hogan,Mentioned,"In an increasing number of cases, the Court 'has rejected the notion that the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the States only a watered-down, subjective version of the individual guarantees of the Bill of Rights....' Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1964)","The Acting Decision cites Malloy as supportive precedent for incorporating Bill of Rights protections to states, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
107979,104769,United States v. Rabinowitz,Overruled,"Rabinowitz and Harris have been the subject of critical commentary for many years, and have been relied upon less and less in our own decisions. It is time, for the reasons we have stated, to hold that on their own facts, and insofar as the principles they stand for are inconsistent with those that we have endorsed today, they are no longer to be followed.","The Court explicitly overrules Rabinowitz, rejecting its principle that warrantless searches incident to arrest may extend to areas under the arrestee's control"
107979,106641,Ker v. California,Mentioned,And this Court has regularly affirmed the validity of warrantless arrests without any indication whatever that there was no time to get a warrant,"The Court references Ker as an example of past precedent, without criticizing or distinguishing it"
107979,106021,Abel v. United States,Mentioned,"This Court has upheld an executive arrest warrant for deportation, permitting the arrest to occur without prior judicial scrutiny, Abel v. United States",The Court cites Abel as historical precedent without questioning or criticizing its holding
107979,98094,Weeks v. United States,Distinguished,"That statement made no reference to any right to search the place where an arrest occurs, but was limited to a right to search the 'person.'","The Court distinguishes Weeks by noting it only addressed searches of persons, not places"
107979,104576,Trupiano v. United States,Mentioned,"Less than two years later, however, the Court returned to the Harris rule in United States v. Rabinowitz, where the Court held that the reasonableness of a search does not depend upon the practicability of obtaining a search warrant, and that the fact of a valid arrest is relevant to reasonableness. Trupiano was pro tanto overruled.",The Court mentions Trupiano to provide historical context of how it was previously overruled by Rabinowitz
107979,101164,Marron v. United States,Limited,"That the Marron opinion did not mean all that it seemed to say became evident, however, a few years later in Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States and United States v. Lefkowitz",The Court notes how Marron's broad interpretation was later limited by subsequent cases
107979,101643,Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States,Mentioned,"The limiting views expressed in Go-Bart and Lefkowitz were thrown to the winds, however, in Harris v. United States",The Court references Go-Bart to illustrate the historical development of search incident to arrest doctrine
107979,107729,Terry v. Ohio,Mentioned,"Only last Term in Terry v. Ohio, we emphasized that 'the police must, whenever practicable, obtain advance judicial approval of searches and seizures through the warrant procedure'",The Court cites Terry to support its emphasis on the warrant requirement
107979,100567,Carroll v. United States,Distinguished,"Still, that assertion too was far from a claim that the 'place' where one is arrested may be searched so long as the arrest is valid",The Court distinguishes Carroll by noting it did not authorize broad searches of places incident to arrest
107979,104422,Harris v. United States,Overruled,"Rabinowitz and Harris have been the subject of critical commentary for many years, and have been relied upon less and less in our own decisions. It is time, for the reasons we have stated, to hold that on their own facts, and insofar as the principles they stand for are inconsistent with those that we have endorsed today, they are no longer to be followed.","The Court explicitly overrules Harris along with Rabinowitz, rejecting their broad approach to searches incident to arrest"
107919,106850,Reynolds v. Sims,Mentioned,"Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, held that a State in an apportionment of state representatives and senators among districts and counties could not deprive voters in the more populous counties of their proportionate share of representatives and senators.","The Acting Decision cites Reynolds v. Sims as supporting precedent for the one person, one vote principle, using it to build its argument without criticizing or distinguishing it."
107919,104593,MacDougall v. Green,Overruled,We have said enough to indicate why MacDougall v. Green is out of line with our recent apportionment cases... MacDougall v. Green is overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules MacDougall v. Green, stating it is inconsistent with more recent apportionment cases and the one person, one vote principle."
107919,107449,Dusch v. Davis,Distinguished,"Dusch v. Davis, 387 U. S. 112, is not relevant to the problem of this case. There each councilman was required to be a resident of the borough from which he was elected.",The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes Dusch v. Davis by explaining how its facts and legal context differ from the present case.
107919,104311,Colegrove v. Green,Limited,"While the majority cited Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549, as their authority for denying relief and while a few who took part in Colegrove put this type of question in the 'political' as distinguished from the 'justiciable' category... that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr",The Acting Decision limits Colegrove's precedential value by noting that Baker v. Carr had resolved the justiciability question differently.
107919,106366,Baker v. Carr,Mentioned,"that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr, 369 U. S. 186, 202. When a State makes classifications of voters which favor residents of some counties over residents of other counties, a justiciable controversy is presented.","The Acting Decision cites Baker v. Carr as established precedent that voting rights cases are justiciable, using it as supporting authority without criticism or distinction."
107748,90897,Civil Rights Cases,Distinguished,"That the Court did conclude in the Civil Rights Cases that 'the act of ... the owner of the inn, the public conveyance or place of amusement, refusing ... accommodation' cannot be 'justly regarded as imposing any badge of slavery or servitude upon the applicant.' 109 U. S., at 24.","The Court distinguishes the Civil Rights Cases by noting that while that case dealt with public accommodations, the entire Court there agreed that the 13th Amendment authorizes Congress to secure property rights against racial discrimination."
107748,104546,Hurd v. Hodge,Distinguished,"Although the covenants could have been enforced without denying the general right of Negroes to purchase or lease real estate, the enforcement of those covenants would nonetheless have denied the Negro purchasers 'the same right as is enjoyed by white citizens ... to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.'","The Court distinguishes Hurd by noting that while it involved state action through court enforcement of restrictive covenants, the current case involves purely private discrimination without state involvement."
107748,1447641,Hodges v. United States,Overruled,"The conclusion of the majority in Hodges rested upon a concept of congressional power under the Thirteenth Amendment irreconcilable with the position taken by every member of this Court in the Civil Rights Cases and incompatible with the history and purpose of the Amendment itself. Insofar as Hodges is inconsistent with our holding today, it is hereby overruled.",The Court explicitly overrules Hodges because its narrow interpretation of Congress's 13th Amendment powers conflicts with the Court's current understanding of those powers.
107748,100887,Corrigan v. Buckley,Distinguished,"Even if Corrigan should be regarded as an adjudication that 42 U.S.C. § 1982 does not prohibit private individuals from agreeing not to sell their property to Negroes, Corrigan would not settle the question whether § 1982 prohibits an actual refusal to sell to a Negro.","The Court distinguishes Corrigan by noting it only addressed private agreements not to sell, not actual refusals to sell based on race."
107748,90040,Virginia v. Rives,Distinguished,"But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra, actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial.","The Court distinguishes Rives by explaining it only addressed a narrow procedural issue about removal jurisdiction, not the substantive scope of civil rights protections."
108114,105687,Hoag v. New Jersey,Distinguished,"But in the present case Missouri did not have 'the widest latitude' because Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784 (1969), decided after Hoag, held that the Fifth Amendment guarantee that no person shall 'be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb' is enforceable against the States",The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes Hoag by noting that it was decided before Benton made the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy protection applicable to states
108114,105860,Abbate v. United States,Mentioned,"The two prosecutions, the first for the robbery of Knight and the second for the robbery of Roberts, grew out of one criminal episode, and therefore I think it clear on the facts of this case that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibited Missouri from prosecuting petitioner for each robbery at a different trial. Abbate v. United States, 359 U. S. 187, 196-201 (1959)","The Acting Decision merely references Abbate when discussing the concept of double jeopardy, without criticizing or substantially engaging with its reasoning"
108114,107978,North Carolina v. Pearce,Mentioned,"North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711 (1969), accorded fully retroactive effect to that holding","The Acting Decision simply cites Pearce to establish that Benton's double jeopardy holding applies retroactively, without any substantive analysis or criticism"
108114,107980,Benton v. Maryland,Mentioned,"The doctrine of Benton v. Maryland, 395 U. S. 784, puts the issues in the present case in a perspective quite different from that in which the issues were perceived in Hoag v. New Jersey","The Acting Decision references Benton to establish that double jeopardy protections apply to states, but does not criticize or substantially analyze its reasoning"
108114,105594,Green v. United States,Mentioned,"For whatever else that constitutional guarantee may embrace, North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717, it surely protects a man who has been acquitted from having to 'run the gantlet' a second time. Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 190","The Acting Decision cites Green to support its reasoning about double jeopardy protections, but does not critically engage with or modify Green's holding"
107973,1178568,"Adkins v. Lear, Inc.",Reversed,"The California Supreme Court unanimously vindicated the inventor's position. While the court recognized that generally a manufacturer is free to challenge the validity of an inventor's patent, it held that 'one of the oldest doctrines in the field of patent law establishes that so long as a licensee is operating under a license agreement he is estopped to deny the validity of his licensor's patent in a suit for royalties under the agreement.'",The Supreme Court reversed the California Supreme Court's holding that licensee estoppel barred Lear from challenging the validity of Adkins' patent.
107973,106758,"Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc.",Mentioned,"We granted certiorari in the present case, 391 U. S. 912, to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule in the light of our recent decisions emphasizing the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection. Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225 (1964); Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U. S. 234 (1964).",The Court merely references Compco as supporting precedent for the federal policy favoring free competition in ideas.
107973,8928994,"Automatic Radio Mfg. Co., Inc. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc",Overruled,"We are satisfied that Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., supra, itself the product of a clouded history, should no longer be regarded as sound law with respect to its 'estoppel' holding, and that holding is now overruled.",The Court explicitly overrules Hazeltine's holding regarding licensee estoppel.
107973,106757,"Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.",Mentioned,"We granted certiorari in the present case, 391 U. S. 912, to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule in the light of our recent decisions emphasizing the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection. Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225 (1964)",The Court cites Sears as supporting precedent for the federal policy favoring free competition in ideas.
107973,100520,Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. v. Formica Insulation Co.,Distinguished,"The estoppel rule was first stringently limited in a situation in which the patentee's equities were far more compelling than those presented in the typical licensing arrangement. Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. v. Formica Insulation Co., 266 U. S. 342 (1924), framed a rule to govern the recurring problem which arises when the original patent owner, after assigning his patent to another for a substantial sum, claims that the patent is worthless because it contains no new ideas.",The Court distinguishes Formica as dealing with a different situation involving patent assignment rather than licensing.
107973,104194,Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Manufacturing Co.,Mentioned,"In Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Manufacturing Co., 326 U. S. 249 (1945), this Court adopted a position similar to the Seventh Circuit's, undermining the basis of patent estoppel even more than Formica had done.",The Court references Scott Paper as precedent that had already begun undermining the doctrine of patent estoppel.
107973,103320,McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,Mentioned,"In McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 309 U. S. 430 (1940), the Court, while recognizing it had jurisdiction to determine whether a New York tax was an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce, refused to consider whether the tax was a prohibited impost or duty on imports and exports",The Court cites McGoldrick only in Justice White's concurrence discussing jurisdictional issues.
107973,104256,Wilson v. Cook,Mentioned,"Wilson v. Cook, 327 U. S. 474 (1946), reached a similar conclusion.",The Court references Wilson only in Justice White's concurrence discussing jurisdictional issues.
107973,106930,Brulotte v. Thys Co.,Mentioned,"Cf. Brulotte v. Thys Co., 379 U. S. 29, 31 (1964)",The Court only briefly references Brulotte in Justice White's concurrence discussing royalty issues.
108154,106432,Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson,Overruled,"Having concluded that Sinclair was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity, we overrule that decision and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.","The Court explicitly overrules Sinclair, finding it was wrongly decided and its continued application would frustrate federal labor policy regarding arbitration agreements."
108154,105511,Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.,Mentioned,"From the time Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U. S. 448 (1957), was decided, we have frequently found it necessary to consider various substantive and procedural aspects of federal labor contract law and questions concerning its application in both state and federal courts.","The Court references Lincoln Mills as foundational precedent for federal labor law interpretation, without criticizing or modifying its holdings."
108154,107655,Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735,Distinguished,"The decision in Avco, viewed in the context of Lincoln Mills and its progeny, has produced an anomalous situation which, in our view, makes urgent the reconsideration of Sinclair.",The Court distinguishes Avco by showing how its interaction with Sinclair created unintended consequences that needed to be addressed through overruling Sinclair.
108154,103292,Helvering v. Hallock,Mentioned,"Nevertheless, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote for the Court, '[S]tare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.' Helvering v. Hallock, 309 U. S. 106, 119 (1940).","The Court cites Helvering merely to support its discussion of stare decisis principles, without analyzing or modifying the actual holding of that case."
108164,105594,Green v. United States (1957),Mentioned,"There is no relevant factual distinction between this case and Green v. United States. Although the petitioner was not convicted of the greater charge on retrial, whereas Green was, the risk of conviction on the greater charge was the same in both cases","The court uses Green as supporting precedent, applying its reasoning to the current case without criticism or distinction."
108164,1276937,Price v. State (1968),Reversed,"We granted the writ, 395 U. S. 975 (1969), and now reverse.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses this lower court decision that had rejected the petitioner's double jeopardy argument.
108164,5726506,Brantley v. Georgia (1910),Overruled,"While the Brantley holding may have had some vitality at the time the Georgia courts rendered their decisions in this case, it is no longer a viable authority and must now be deemed to have been overruled by subsequent decisions of this Court.",The court explicitly states that Brantley is no longer valid precedent and has been overruled by subsequent decisions.
108164,94515,United States v. Ball (1896),Mentioned,The concept of continuing jeopardy implicit in the Ball case would allow petitioner's retrial for voluntary manslaughter after his first conviction for that offense had been reversed.,The court cites Ball to explain the concept of continuing jeopardy without criticizing or distinguishing it.
108164,1395638,Price v. State (1968),Mentioned,"The Georgia Supreme Court then heard the appeal and transferred the case to the Court of Appeals of Georgia, declaring that '[o]nly questions as to the application of plain and unambiguous provisions of the Constitution of the United States being involved'",The court merely references this procedural history without any significant treatment.
108164,8887067,United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins,Mentioned,"See United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F. 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 913 (1966)",The case is cited as supporting authority without any significant discussion or treatment.
108362,90728,United States v. Harris,Distinguished,"The constitutionality of § 1985 (3) might once have appeared to have been settled adversely by United States v. Harris... The Court in those cases, however, followed a severability rule that required invalidation of an entire statute if any part of it was unconstitutionally overbroad... This Court has long since firmly rejected that rule","The court distinguishes Harris by explaining that its reasoning relied on an outdated severability rule that has since been rejected, thus limiting its precedential value for the current case."
108362,107201,United States v. Guest,Mentioned,"Our cases have firmly established that the right of interstate travel is constitutionally protected, does not necessarily rest on the Fourteenth Amendment, and is assertible against private as well as governmental interference. Shapiro v. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 629-631; id., at 642-644 (concurring opinion); United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 757-760",The court cites Guest as supporting precedent for the established principle that the right of interstate travel is constitutionally protected and can be asserted against private interference.
108362,107748,Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.,Mentioned,"By the Thirteenth Amendment, we committed ourselves as a Nation to the proposition that the former slaves and their descendants should be forever free. To keep that promise, 'Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.' Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.",The court uses Jones as supporting authority for Congress's power under the Thirteenth Amendment to legislate against private discrimination.
108362,96885,Twining v. New Jersey,Mentioned,"The 'right to pass freely from State to State' has been explicitly recognized as 'among the rights and privileges of National citizenship.' Twining v. New Jersey, supra, at 97.",The court cites Twining to support the established principle that interstate travel is a right of national citizenship.
108362,104918,Collins v. Hardyman,Overruled,"Whether or not Collins v. Hardyman was correctly decided on its own facts is a question with which we need not here be concerned. But it is clear, in the light of the evolution of decisional law in the years that have passed since that case was decided, that many of the constitutional problems there perceived simply do not exist.","The court explicitly rejects Collins's interpretation of § 1985(3) as requiring state action, effectively overruling its central holding."
108350,103548,Reitz v. Mealey,Overruled,We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of Kesler and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than one of frustration.,"The Court explicitly rejects Reitz's approach of looking at legislative purpose rather than actual effect on federal bankruptcy law, calling it 'aberrational' and overruling it."
108350,1198518,Schecter v. Killingsworth,Mentioned,"In Schecter v. Killingsworth, 93 Ariz. 273, 380 P. 2d 136 (1963), the Supreme Court of Arizona held that '[t]he Financial Responsibility Act has for its principal purpose the protection of the public using the highways from financial hardship which may result from the use of automobiles by financially irresponsible persons.'",The Court cites Schecter neutrally to establish the Arizona Supreme Court's interpretation of the state's Financial Responsibility Act.
108350,288328,Perez v. Campbell,Mentioned,"The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on the same two decisions. 421 F. 2d 619 (CA9 1970).",The Court simply references this lower court decision as procedural history without critiquing or analyzing it.
108350,106365,Kesler v. Department of Public Safety of Utah,Overruled,We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of Kesler and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than one of frustration.,"The Court explicitly overrules Kesler, rejecting its approach of focusing on legislative purpose rather than actual effect on federal bankruptcy law."
108350,100616,Lewis v. Roberts,Mentioned,"This is long after the Bankruptcy Act was placed on the books and, indeed, long after this Court's decision in Lewis v. Roberts, 267 U. S. 467 (1925), that a personal injury judgment is a provable claim in bankruptcy.",The Court cites Lewis neutrally to establish the historical precedent that personal injury judgments are provable claims in bankruptcy.
108186,107685,Duncan v. Louisiana,Distinguished,"In Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), we held that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right to trial by jury in all criminal cases that — were they to be tried in a federal court — would come within the Sixth Amendment's guarantee... The question in this case then is whether the constitutional guarantee of a trial by 'jury' necessarily requires trial by exactly 12 persons, rather than some lesser number — in this case six.",The Court distinguishes Duncan by focusing on a different aspect of jury trials - the number of jurors required - rather than the basic right to a jury trial that Duncan established.
108186,94866,Thompson v. Utah,Overruled,"This Court's earlier decisions have assumed an affirmative answer to this question. The leading case so construing the Sixth Amendment is Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898)... We conclude, in short, as we began: the fact that the jury at common law was composed of precisely 12 is a historical accident, unnecessary to effect the purposes of the jury system and wholly without significance.","The Court explicitly rejects Thompson's holding that the Sixth Amendment requires a 12-person jury, calling it a 'historical accident' and overruling its core holding."
108186,95043,Capital Traction Co. v. Hof,Mentioned,"Similarly, cases interpreting the jury trial provisions of the Seventh Amendment generally leap from the fact that the jury possessed a certain feature at common law to the conclusion that that feature must have been preserved by the Amendment's simple reference to trial by 'jury.' E.g., Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, 174 U. S. 1, 13-14 (1899)",The Court merely references Hof as an example of historical interpretation without criticizing or relying on its reasoning.
108186,106862,Malloy v. Hogan,Mentioned,"Given Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964), I join that part of the Court's opinion in No. 927 relating to the Florida 'alibi' procedure.",The decision is only referenced in passing in a concurring opinion without substantive discussion of its holdings.
108186,96270,Rassmussen v. United States,Criticized,"A ruling that the Sixth Amendment refers to a common-law jury was essential to the holding in Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U. S. 516 (1905)... The ruling was accepted at the Government's concession without discussion or citation; the major focus of the case was on the question whether the Sixth Amendment was applicable to the territory in question at all.",The Court criticizes Rassmussen's acceptance of the 12-person jury requirement as being made without proper analysis or discussion.
108186,92280,Callan v. Wilson,Distinguished,"It is to the distinction between 'petty' and 'serious' offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937); Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65 (1904); Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 552 (1888).",The Court distinguishes Callan's relevance to the petty vs. serious offense distinction rather than the jury size requirement at issue.
108186,106641,Ker v. California,Mentioned,"In Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963), I noted in an opinion concurring in the result that: 'The rule [of 'incorporation'] is unwise because the States, with their differing law enforcement problems, should not be put in a constitutional strait jacket.'","The decision is only mentioned in a concurring opinion to illustrate a point about incorporation doctrine, without substantive analysis of its holdings."
108186,102801,District of Columbia v. Clawans,Mentioned,"It is to the distinction between 'petty' and 'serious' offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937)",The Court simply references Clawans as precedent for the petty vs. serious offense distinction without analyzing or questioning its holding.
108186,107486,United States v. Wade,Mentioned,"Although I have disagreed with particular holdings like Gilbert v. California, supra, where the Court held that the States must arrange presence of counsel at lineups, see Mr. Justice White's separate opinion in United States v. Wade, 388 U. S. 218, 250 (1967), which I joined","Wade is only mentioned in passing in a concurring opinion discussing other cases, without substantive analysis of its holdings."
108730,104590,Ahrens v. Clark,Overruled,"We can no longer view that decision as establishing an inflexible jurisdictional rule, dictating the choice of an inconvenient forum even in a class of cases which could not have been foreseen at the time of our decision.",The Court explicitly overrules Ahrens's interpretation that federal courts can only hear habeas petitions from prisoners physically present within their territorial jurisdiction.
108730,107824,Smith v. Hooey,Mentioned,"In Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969), we considered a speedy trial claim similar to the one presented in the case before us, and we held that a State which had lodged a detainer against a petitioner in another State must, on the prisoner's demand, 'make a diligent, good-faith effort' to bring the prisoner to trial.","The Court references Smith v. Hooey as precedent establishing the state's obligation regarding speedy trials, without criticizing or modifying its holding."
108730,107679,Peyton v. Rowe,Distinguished,"Peyton, however, was in a significantly different procedural posture from the instant case. There, the Court held that a state prisoner could challenge the constitutional validity of a sentence which he had not yet begun to serve when he was currently incarcerated pursuant to a valid conviction and sentence.",The Court distinguishes Peyton by noting its different procedural context while still using some of its principles to support the current decision.
108730,91598,Ex Parte Royall,Limited,"The judicial approach set forth in Ex parte Royall— that federal courts should not, absent extraordinary circumstances, interfere with the judicial administration and process of state courts prior to trial and conviction, even though the state prisoner claims that he is held in violation of the Constitution — has been consistently followed.","While not explicitly overruling Royall, the Court limits its application by allowing pre-trial federal habeas corpus review in certain circumstances."
108730,108193,Nelson v. George,Mentioned,We noted in Nelson that the resolution of any apparent dilemma 'caused' by this Court's holding in Ahrens is appropriately one to be undertaken by Congress.,"The Court simply references Nelson v. George as background context for discussing legislative solutions, without analyzing or modifying its holding."
108889,101340,Louis K. Liggett Co. v. Baldridge,Overruled,"The Liggett case, being a derelict in the stream of the law, is hereby overruled.","The court explicitly overrules Liggett, stating it was a creation at war with earlier constitutional views and opposed to more recent decisions."
108889,107235,Mills v. Alabama,Mentioned,"Mills v. Alabama, 384 U. S. 214, involved the constitutionality of a state statute in effect making it a crime for a newspaper editor on election day to urge people to vote a certain way on the issues being submitted.","The court cites Mills merely as an example to explain the concept of finality in judicial decisions, without criticizing or modifying its holding."
108889,86449,Forgay v. Conrad,Mentioned,"The exceptions noted have a long lineage dating back to Mr. Chief Justice Taney's opinion in Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, where the Court held 'final' an interlocutory decree requiring a litigant 'to deliver up property which he claims,'",The court references Forgay simply to illustrate the historical precedent for treating certain interlocutory orders as final judgments.
108889,104183,"Radio Station Wow, Inc. v. Johnson",Mentioned,"Mr. Justice Frankfurter, writing for the Court in Radio Station WOW v. Johnson, 326 U. S. 120, 124, summarized the requirement by Congress that in appeals from federal district courts as well as in review of state court decisions the judgments be 'final'","The court uses Radio Station WOW as an authoritative explanation of the finality requirement, without questioning or modifying its precedential value."
108721,102839,Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co.,Mentioned,"A state legislature, in the enactment of laws, has the widest possible latitude within the limits of the Constitution. In the nature of the case it cannot record a complete catalogue of the considerations which move its members to enact laws.","The Acting Decision cites Carmichael favorably to support its argument about legislative discretion in taxation, using it as supporting precedent without criticism or modification."
108721,2042261,Lake Shore Auto Parts Co. v. Korzen,Reversed,"The Illinois Supreme Court held that Art. IX-A did not affect all forms of real and personal property taxes but only personal property taxes on individuals... As so construed, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the tax violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Illinois Supreme Court's ruling that found the tax unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.
108721,103290,Madden v. Kentucky Ex Rel. Commissioner,Mentioned,There is a presumption of constitutionality which can be overcome 'only by the most explicit demonstration that a classification is a hostile and oppressive discrimination against particular persons and classes.',The Acting Decision cites Madden approvingly to support its position on the presumption of constitutionality in tax classification cases.
108721,97378,Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.,Mentioned,"The Flint case involved a federal tax upon the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity... These advantages are obvious, and have led to the formation of such companies in nearly all branches of trade.","The Acting Decision references Flint to illustrate historical precedent regarding different tax treatment for corporations, using it as supporting authority."
108721,101317,Quaker City Cab Co. v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania,Overruled,"Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania is only a relic of a bygone era. We cannot follow it and stay within the narrow confines of judicial review, which is an important part of our constitutional tradition.","The Acting Decision explicitly rejects Quaker City Cab as outdated precedent, effectively overruling it."
109346,108288,Durham v. United States,Overruled,"To the extent that Durham v. United States, 401 U. S. 481 (1971), may be inconsistent with this ruling, Durham is overruled.",The Court explicitly states that Durham is overruled to the extent it is inconsistent with the current ruling regarding the dismissal of cases when a petitioner dies.
109514,321071,Nancy Dukes v. City of New Orleans (1974),Reversed,"The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.",The Supreme Court explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals' decision that found the ordinance's grandfather clause unconstitutional.
109514,105546,Morey v. Doud,Overruled,"Morey is, as appellee and the Court of Appeals properly recognized, essentially indistinguishable from this case, but the decision so far departs from proper equal protection analysis in cases of exclusively economic regulation that it should be, and it is, overruled.","The Court explicitly overrules Morey v. Doud, stating it was erroneously decided and should no longer be followed in equal protection analysis."
109514,105285,"Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.",Mentioned,"Legislatures may implement their program step by step... adopting regulations that only partially ameliorate a perceived evil and deferring complete elimination of the evil to future regulations. See, e.g., Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483, 488-489 (1955).",The Court cites Williamson supportively to illustrate the principle that legislatures can implement economic regulations gradually.
109514,106576,Ferguson v. Skrupa,Mentioned,"in the local economic sphere, it is only the invidious discrimination, the wholly arbitrary act, which cannot stand consistently with the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., Ferguson v. Skrupa, 372 U. S. 726, 732 (1963).",The Court cites Ferguson to support its analysis of the standard for reviewing economic regulations under the Equal Protection Clause.
109514,107256,Katzenbach v. Morgan,Mentioned,"The governing constitutional principle was stated in Katzenbach v. Morgan, supra, at 657: '[W]e are guided by the familiar principles that a statute is not invalid under the Constitution because it might have gone farther than it did'",The Court cites Katzenbach to support the principle that legislative reform can proceed one step at a time.
109390,104216,Marsh v. Alabama,Distinguished,The Court adopts the view that Marsh has no bearing on this case because the privately owned property in Marsh involved all the characteristics of a typical town.,"The lead opinion distinguishes Marsh by emphasizing that it involved a company-owned town with all municipal characteristics, unlike the shopping center in the present case."
109390,107692,"Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, Inc.",Overruled,Our conclusion is that the rationale of Logan Valley did not survive the Court's decision in the Lloyd case.,The Court explicitly states that Logan Valley's rationale was rejected by Lloyd and formally overrules the decision in this case.
109390,108592,Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner,Mentioned,The Court in Lloyd held that there has been no such dedication of Lloyd's privately owned and operated shopping center to public use as to entitle respondents to exercise therein the asserted First Amendment rights.,The Court uses Lloyd as supporting precedent to explain why shopping centers are not subject to First Amendment restrictions.
109390,105389,National Labor Relations Board v. Babcock & Wilcox Co.,Mentioned,"Under the Act the task of the Board, subject to review by the courts, is to resolve conflicts between § 7 rights and private property rights, and to seek a proper accommodation between the two.",The Court references Babcock & Wilcox as establishing the framework for analyzing conflicts between labor rights and property rights under the NLRA.
109390,108591,Central Hardware Co. v. National Labor Relations Board,Mentioned,"Central Hardware involved a large commercial shopping center which the Court found had displaced, in certain relevant respects, the functions of the normal municipal business block.",The Court cites Central Hardware to explain the development of precedent regarding First Amendment rights in private property contexts.
109570,1489061,Walker v. Hall,Reversed,We reverse. I We first address a preliminary question of standing.,The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the District Court's ruling in Walker v. Hall that had sustained the constitutionality of the Oklahoma statute.
109570,109235,Stanton v. Stanton,Mentioned,"And only two Terms ago, Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U. S. 7 (1975), expressly stating that Reed v. Reed was 'controlling,' 421 U. S., at 13, held that Reed required invalidation of a Utah differential age-of-majority statute",The Acting Decision cites Stanton as supporting precedent to establish the legal framework for analyzing gender-based classifications.
109570,108404,Reed v. Reed,Mentioned,Analysis may appropriately begin with the reminder that Reed emphasized that statutory classifications that distinguish between males and females are 'subject to scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.',The Acting Decision uses Reed as foundational precedent for establishing the standard of review for gender-based classifications.
109570,105152,Barrows v. Jackson,Mentioned,"Accordingly, vendors and those in like positions have been uniformly permitted to resist efforts at restricting their operations by acting as advocates of the rights of third parties who seek access to their market or function. See, e. g., Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438 (1972); Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, supra; Barrows v. Jackson, supra.",The Acting Decision cites Barrows as supporting precedent for the principle of third-party standing.
109570,108497,Stanley v. Illinois,Mentioned,"See, e. g., Stanley v. Illinois, supra, at 658; cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, 414 U. S. 632, 650 (1974)",The Acting Decision references Stanley as precedent for rejecting administrative convenience as sufficient justification for gender-based classifications.
109570,109013,Kahn v. Shevin,Distinguished,"Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498 (1975), upholding the use of gender-based classifications, rested upon the Court's perception of the laudatory purposes of those laws as remedying disadvantageous conditions suffered by women in economic and military life.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Kahn by noting that unlike that case, the present statute does not serve to remedy past discrimination against women."
109570,108781,Frontiero v. Richardson,Mentioned,"Hence, 'archaic and overbroad' generalizations, Schlesinger v. Ballard, supra, at 508, concerning the financial position of servicewomen, Frontiero v. Richardson, supra, at 689 n. 23",The Acting Decision cites Frontiero as precedent rejecting overbroad gender-based generalizations.
109570,108489,Eisenstadt v. Baird,Mentioned,"Indeed, the jus tertii question raised here is answered by our disposition of a like argument in Eisenstadt v. Baird, supra.",The Acting Decision uses Eisenstadt as supporting precedent for analyzing third-party standing claims.
109570,109132,Schlesinger v. Ballard,Distinguished,"Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498 (1975), upholding the use of gender-based classifications, rested upon the Court's perception of the laudatory purposes of those laws as remedying disadvantageous conditions suffered by women in economic and military life.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Schlesinger by noting that unlike that case, the present statute does not serve to remedy past discrimination against women."
109570,104606,Goesaert v. Cleary,Overruled,"Insofar as Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U. S. 464 (1948), may be inconsistent, that decision is disapproved.","The Acting Decision explicitly disapproves of Goesaert to the extent it conflicts with the current ruling, effectively overruling it."
108990,96819,Ex Parte Young,Limited,"But the retroactive portion of the District Court's order here, which requires the payment of a very substantial amount of money which that court held should have been paid, but was not, stands on quite a different footing... We do not read Ex parte Young or subsequent holdings of this Court to indicate that any form of relief may be awarded against a state officer, no matter how closely it may in practice resemble a money judgment payable out of the state treasury, so long as the relief may be labeled 'equitable' in nature.","The Acting Decision limits Ex parte Young's scope by holding that it only permits prospective injunctive relief against state officials, not retroactive monetary relief from state treasuries."
108990,106821,Parden v. Terminal Railway,Distinguished,Both Parden and Employees involved a congressional enactment which by its terms authorized suit by designated plaintiffs against a general class of defendants which literally included States or state instrumentalities... But in this case the threshold fact of congressional authorization to sue a class of defendants which literally includes States is wholly absent.,"The Acting Decision distinguishes Parden by noting that unlike the present case, Parden involved explicit congressional authorization to sue states."
108990,108763,Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health,Mentioned,"Since Employees, supra, where Congress had expressly authorized suits against a general class of defendants and the only thing left to implication was whether the described class of defendants included States, was decided adversely to the putative plaintiffs on the waiver question, surely this respondent must also fail on that issue.",The Acting Decision references Employees as supporting precedent without significantly modifying or critiquing its holding.
108990,105869,Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Commission,Distinguished,"Similarly, Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, supra, involved congressional approval, pursuant to the Compact Clause, of a compact between Tennessee and Missouri, which provided that each compacting State would have the power 'to contract, to sue, and be sued in its own name.'","The Acting Decision distinguishes Petty by noting it involved explicit congressional approval of state consent to suit, unlike the present case."
108990,104057,Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury,Mentioned,"Were we to uphold this portion of the District Court's decree, we would be obligated to overrule the Court's holding in Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury, supra.",The Acting Decision relies on Ford Motor Co. as controlling precedent that supports its conclusion about state immunity from retroactive monetary relief.
108990,307980,Jordan v. Weaver,Reversed,"Because we believe the Court of Appeals erred in its disposition of the Eleventh Amendment claim, we reverse that portion of the Court of Appeals decision which affirmed the District Court's order that retroactive benefits be paid by the Illinois state officials.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals' judgment regarding retroactive benefits payments.
108990,108113,Rosado v. Wyman,Distinguished,The Court in Rosado was concerned with the compatibility of a provision of New York law which decreased benefits to some eligible public aid recipients and amendments to the federal act which required cost-of-living increases. The case did not purport to decide the Eleventh Amendment issue we resolve today.,The Acting Decision distinguishes Rosado by noting it did not address the Eleventh Amendment issue central to the present case.
108990,107743,King v. Smith,Mentioned,"We adhere to King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309 (1968), which implicitly rejected the argument that the statutory provisions for HEW review of plans should be read to curtail judicial relief.",The Acting Decision cites King v. Smith as supporting precedent without significantly modifying its holding.
108990,8901897,Rothstein v. Wyman,Mentioned,"Addressing himself to a similar situation in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d 226 (CA2 1972), cert. denied, 411 U. S. 921 (1973), Judge McGowan observed for the court...",The Acting Decision approvingly cites Rothstein's reasoning about retroactive payments without significantly modifying its holding.
108990,102271,Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi,Mentioned,"Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934), reaffirmed the principle that the Eleventh Amendment was no bar to a suit by the United States against a State.",The Acting Decision references Monaco to explain a principle about Eleventh Amendment interpretation without modifying its holding.
108990,107901,Shapiro v. Thompson,Limited,"Having now had an opportunity to more fully consider the Eleventh Amendment issue after briefing and argument, we disapprove the Eleventh Amendment holdings of those cases to the extent that they are inconsistent with our holding today.",The Acting Decision explicitly limits Shapiro's precedential value regarding Eleventh Amendment issues.
108990,108075,Wyman v. Bowens,Limited,"Having now had an opportunity to more fully consider the Eleventh Amendment issue after briefing and argument, we disapprove the Eleventh Amendment holdings of those cases to the extent that they are inconsistent with our holding today.",The Acting Decision explicitly limits Wyman's precedential value regarding Eleventh Amendment issues.
108990,8989511,Sterrett v. Mothers' & Children's Rights Organization,Limited,"Having now had an opportunity to more fully consider the Eleventh Amendment issue after briefing and argument, we disapprove the Eleventh Amendment holdings of those cases to the extent that they are inconsistent with our holding today.",The Acting Decision explicitly limits Sterrett's precedential value regarding Eleventh Amendment issues.
108990,8988675,State Department of Health & Rehabilitative Services v. Zarate,Limited,"Having now had an opportunity to more fully consider the Eleventh Amendment issue after briefing and argument, we disapprove the Eleventh Amendment holdings of those cases to the extent that they are inconsistent with our holding today.",The Acting Decision explicitly limits Zarate's precedential value regarding Eleventh Amendment issues.
109344,85534,Brown v. Maryland,Distinguished,"Although it was 'sufficient' in the context of Maryland's license tax on the right to sell imported goods to note that a tax imposed directly on imported goods which have not been acted upon in any way would clearly fall within the constitutional prohibition, that observation did not apply, as the foregoing analysis indicates, to a state tax which treated those same goods without regard to the fact of their foreign origin.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Brown by explaining that while Brown correctly prohibited discriminatory taxes on imports, it did not prohibit nondiscriminatory property taxes that treat imported and domestic goods equally."
109344,88429,Low v. Austin,Overruled,"Low v. Austin was wrongly decided. That decision therefore must be, and is, overruled.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Low v. Austin, finding that it misinterpreted Brown v. Maryland and incorrectly extended the Import-Export Clause's prohibition to nondiscriminatory ad valorem property taxes."
109344,105833,Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers,Mentioned,"Taxes imposed after an initial sale, after the breakup of the shipping packages, or the moment goods imported for use are committed to current operational needs are also all likely to have an incidental effect on the volume of goods imported; yet all are permissible. See, e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers","The Acting Decision merely cites Youngstown as an example of permissible taxation of imported goods, without criticizing or substantially analyzing its holding."
109344,86429,Thurlow v. Massachusetts,Mentioned,"Mr. Chief Justice Taney's opinion in the License Cases, 5 How. 504 (1847)","The Acting Decision only references the License Cases (Thurlow) as context for discussing Chief Justice Taney's views on import taxation, without analyzing or critiquing its holding."
109508,105999,National Labor Relations Board v. Insurance Agents' International Union,Distinguished,Insurance Agents held that such tactics would not support a finding by the NLRB that the union had failed to bargain in good faith as required by § 8 (b) (3) and rejected the per se rule applied by the Board that use of 'economically harassing activities' alone sufficed to prove a violation of that section.,"The Acting Decision distinguishes Insurance Agents by explaining it dealt with NLRB's authority to regulate union tactics, while the present case concerns state regulation of similar conduct."
109508,104636,"International Union, U. A. W. A., A. F. of L., Local 232 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board",Overruled,"We hold today that the ruling of Briggs-Stratton, permitting state regulation of partial strike activities such as are involved in this case is likewise 'no longer of general application.'",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Briggs-Stratton's holding that states could regulate partial strike activities.
109508,105866,San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,Distinguished,"San Diego Unions v. Garmon expressly recognized that 'the Board may decide that an activity is neither protected nor prohibited, and thereby raise the question whether such activity may be regulated by the States.'",The Acting Decision distinguishes Garmon by noting it addressed a different aspect of preemption based on NLRB's primary jurisdiction.
109508,107123,"Hanna Mining Co. v. District 2, Marine Engineers Beneficial Ass'n",Distinguished,"The state action in this case is not filling 'a regulatory void which Congress plainly assumed would not exist,' Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S., at 196",The Acting Decision distinguishes Hanna Mining by explaining the present case involves state interference with conduct Congress intended to leave unregulated.
109508,106827,"Local 20, Teamsters, Chauffeurs & Helpers Union v. Morton",Mentioned,"But the analysis of Garner and Insurance Agents came full bloom in the pre-emption area in Teamsters Union v. Morton, 377 U. S. 252 (1964), which held pre-empted the application of state law to award damages for peaceful union secondary picketing.","The Acting Decision cites Morton as supporting precedent that developed the preemption doctrine, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
109508,107886,Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co.,Mentioned,"Whether self-help economic activities are employed by employer or union, the crucial inquiry regarding pre-emption is the same: whether 'the exercise of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act's processes.'","The Acting Decision cites Railroad Trainmen to establish the test for preemption analysis, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
109615,104587,Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Stone,Distinguished,"He drew a distinction between a tax on 'the privilege of doing interstate business' and a tax on 'the privilege of exercising corporate functions within the State,' and held that while the former is unconstitutional, the latter is not barred by the Commerce Clause.","The Court uses Memphis Gas to show how the distinction between types of privilege taxes began to narrow the Spector rule, distinguishing between unconstitutional taxes on interstate business privilege versus constitutional taxes on corporate functions."
109615,109239,Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle,Mentioned,The unsatisfactory operation of the Spector rule is well demonstrated by our recent case of Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle,"The Court uses Colonial Pipeline as an example to demonstrate the problematic nature of the Spector rule, without criticizing or overruling Colonial Pipeline itself."
109615,104869,"Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor",Overruled,"Accordingly, we now reject the rule of Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor, that a state tax on the 'privilege of doing business' is per se unconstitutional when it is applied to interstate commerce, and that case is overruled.","The Court explicitly overrules Spector, rejecting its rule that state taxes on the privilege of doing interstate business are per se unconstitutional."
109615,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,Mentioned,It is a truism that the mere act of carrying on business in interstate commerce does not exempt a corporation from state taxation. It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business.,The Court cites Western Live Stock approvingly to support its position that interstate commerce is not immune from state taxation.
109615,105828,"Railway Express Agency, Inc. v. Virginia",Mentioned,"In upholding the statute, the Court's opinion recognized that the rule against taxing the 'privilege' of doing interstate business had created a situation where 'the use of magic words or labels' could 'disable an otherwise constitutional levy.'",The Court uses Railway Express II to illustrate how the focus on formal language rather than economic reality had made the Spector rule problematic.
109716,107491,"United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co. (1967)",Overruled,We conclude that the per se rule stated in Schwinn must be overruled. In so holding we do not foreclose the possibility that particular applications of vertical restrictions might justify per se prohibition under Northern Pac. R. Co.,"The Court explicitly overruled Schwinn's per se rule against vertical restrictions, finding it was not justified under the demanding standards of Northern Pacific and lacked sufficient economic justification."
109716,336461,"Gte Sylvania Incorporated v. Continental T v. Inc., a Corporation",Mentioned,"On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed by a divided vote. 537 F. 2d 980 (1976).","The decision is simply referenced as the procedural history of the case, with no substantive treatment of its reasoning or holdings."
109716,105646,Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States,Mentioned,"As the Court explained in Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S. 1, 5 (1958), 'there are certain agreements or practices which because of their pernicious effect on competition and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable and therefore illegal without elaborate inquiry as to the precise harm they have caused or the business excuse for their use.'","The Court cites Northern Pacific's standard for determining per se rules but does not criticize, distinguish, or otherwise negatively treat the decision."
109716,1458770,"United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co. (1965)",Mentioned,The District Court rejected the price-fixing allegation because of a failure of proof and held that Schwinn's limitation of retail bicycle sales to franchised retailers was permissible under § 1.,The Court merely describes the District Court's findings as historical background without any substantive treatment of the decision.
109499,104222,New York v. United States (1946),Distinguished,"Mr. Chief Justice Stone, speaking for four Members of an eight-Member Court in rejecting the proposition that Congress could impose taxes on the States so long as it did so in a nondiscriminatory manner, observed: 'A State may, like a private individual, own real property and receive income. But... we could hardly say that a general non-discriminatory real estate tax... could be constitutionally applied to the State's capitol...'","The Acting Decision uses New York v. United States to distinguish between permissible and impermissible federal regulation of states, drawing parallels to support its position on state sovereignty."
109499,109259,Fry v. United States (1975),Distinguished,We think our holding today quite consistent with Fry. The enactment at issue there was occasioned by an extremely serious problem which endangered the well-being of all the component parts of our federal system and which only collective action by the National Government might forestall.,"The Acting Decision distinguishes Fry by emphasizing its emergency nature and limited scope, contrasting it with the broader FLSA amendments at issue."
109499,107734,Maryland v. Wirtz (1968),Overruled,We are therefore persuaded that Wirtz must be overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Wirtz, rejecting its reasoning regarding Congress's commerce power over state employment decisions."
109499,102593,United States v. California (1936),Criticized,"We think the dicta from United States v. California, simply wrong.",The Acting Decision explicitly criticizes and rejects the reasoning from United States v. California regarding federal power over states.
109499,103442,United States v. Darby (1941),Mentioned,"This Court unanimously upheld the Act as a valid exercise of congressional authority under the commerce power in United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941)",The Acting Decision merely references Darby as historical context for upholding the original FLSA.
109499,85412,Gibbons v. Ogden (1824),Mentioned,"That authority is, in the words of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1 (1824), 'the power to regulate; that is, to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.'",The Acting Decision simply cites Gibbons to define Congress's commerce power without criticism or distinction.
109499,104231,Case v. Bowles (1946),Distinguished,"It also seems appropriate to note that Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92 (1946), has not been overruled... Indeed that decision... has no direct application to the questions we consider today at all.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Case v. Bowles as inapplicable to the current case, noting it dealt with war powers rather than commerce powers."
109499,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt (1938),Mentioned,The State is not merely a factor in the 'shifting economic arrangements' of the private sector of the economy,The Acting Decision references Helvering only in passing to contrast states' role from private sector entities.
109499,97448,Coyle v. Smith (1911),Mentioned,"In Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911), the Court gave this example of such an attribute",The Acting Decision cites Coyle as an example of state sovereignty without criticizing or distinguishing it.
109499,87985,Lane County v. Oregon (1869),Mentioned,"Both the States and the United States existed before the Constitution... But in many articles of the Constitution the necessary existence of the States, and, within their proper spheres, the independent authority of the States, is distinctly recognized.",The Acting Decision cites Lane County to support its discussion of state sovereignty without criticism or distinction.
109499,106821,Parden v. Terminal Railway (1964),Distinguished,"For the same reasons, despite Mr. Justice Brennan's claims to the contrary, the holdings in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553 (1957), are likewise unimpaired by our decision today.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Parden as dealing with different types of state activities than those at issue in the current case.
109499,108763,Employees v. Department of Public Health (1973),Mentioned,The Court recognized that the Economic Stabilization Act was 'an emergency measure to counter severe inflation that threatened the national economy.',The Acting Decision references Employees only in passing without significant discussion or analysis.
109450,108848,Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations,Distinguished,"Also, there is no claim that the transactions proposed in the forbidden advertisements are themselves illegal in any way. Cf. Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S. 376 (1973)","The Court distinguishes the present case from Pittsburgh Press by noting that while Pittsburgh Press involved illegal discriminatory job advertisements, the current case involves advertising for legal transactions."
109450,109271,Bigelow v. Virginia,Mentioned,"Last Term, in Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809 (1975), the notion of unprotected 'commercial speech' all but passed from the scene.",The Court cites Bigelow as precedent that began dismantling the concept of commercial speech being unprotected by the First Amendment.
109450,106761,New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,Mentioned,"It is clear, for example, that speech does not lose its First Amendment protection because money is spent to project it, as in a paid advertisement of one form or another. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U. S. 1, 35-59 (1976); Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n, 413 U. S., at 384; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S., at 266.",The Court cites New York Times as supporting precedent for the principle that paid advertisements receive First Amendment protection.
109450,2239749,Patterson Drug Company v. Kingery,Distinguished,"The District Court seized on the identity of the plaintiff-appellees as consumers as a feature distinguishing the present case from Patterson Drug Co. v. Kingery, supra.",The Court distinguishes Patterson by noting that the current case involves consumers rather than pharmacists as plaintiffs.
109450,103347,Thornhill v. Alabama,Mentioned,"Purely factual matter of public interest may claim protection. Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S., at 822; Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 102 (1940).",The Court cites Thornhill as supporting precedent for protecting purely factual matter of public interest under the First Amendment.
109450,2098134,"Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. v. State Board of Pharmacy",Mentioned,"The three-judge District Court declared the quoted portion of the statute 'void and of no effect,' Jurisdictional Statement, App. 1, and enjoined the defendant-appellants, the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy and the individual members of that Board, from enforcing it. 373 F. Supp. 683 (ED Va. 1974).",The Court mentions this as the lower court decision being reviewed in the current case.
109450,103654,Valentine v. Chrestensen,Criticized,Today the Court ends the anomalous situation created by Chrestensen and holds that a communication which does no more than propose a commercial transaction is not 'wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment.',The Court criticizes and effectively overrules Valentine's holding that commercial speech is unprotected by the First Amendment.
109450,105285,Williamson v. Lee Optical,Distinguished,"The District Court recognized that this Court had upheld — against federal constitutional challenges other than on First Amendment grounds — state restrictions on the advertisement of prices for optometrists' services, Head v. New Mexico Board, 374 U. S. 424 (1963), for eyeglass frames, Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483 (1955)",The Court distinguishes Williamson by noting it involved constitutional challenges other than First Amendment grounds.
109450,107970,National Labor Relations Board v. Gissel Packing Co.,Mentioned,"The interests of the contestants in a labor dispute are primarily economic, but it has long been settled that both the employee and the employer are protected by the First Amendment when they express themselves on the merits of the dispute in order to influence its outcome. See, e. g., NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S. 575, 617-618 (1969)",The Court cites Gissel as supporting precedent for extending First Amendment protection to economic speech in labor disputes.
109450,8985546,"Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove",Mentioned,"See Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (1971) (Douglas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).",The Court mentions this case in reference to the importance of commercial information in a free enterprise system.
109835,109344,Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages,Distinguished,"We do not reach the question of the applicability of the Michelin approach when a State directly taxes imports or exports in transit. [...] As in Michelin, decided less than three years ago, we prefer to defer decision until a case with pertinent facts is presented.","The court distinguishes Michelin by noting that it involved goods no longer in transit, whereas the present case involves taxation of activities while goods are in transit, thus requiring different analysis."
109835,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady",Mentioned,"Consistent with Complete Auto, then, we hold that the Washington business and occupation tax does not violate the Commerce Clause by taxing the interstate commerce activity of stevedoring.","The court applies Complete Auto's framework to validate the Washington tax, using it as supporting precedent without criticism or distinction."
109835,104388,Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co.,Overruled,"To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n and Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co. stand to the contrary, each is overruled.",The court explicitly overrules Carter & Weekes as inconsistent with its new analysis of state taxation of stevedoring activities.
109835,104859,Canton Railroad v. Rogan,Mentioned,"In Canton R. Co. v. Rogan, 340 U. S. 511 (1951), the Court upheld a gross-receipts tax on a steam railroad operating exclusively within the Port of Baltimore.",The court uses Canton as supportive precedent to demonstrate how similar transportation services related to imports/exports have been treated in past cases.
109835,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,Mentioned,"As was recognized in Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue, 303 U. S. 250 (1938), interstate commerce must bear its fair share of the state tax burden.",The court cites Western Live Stock as supporting precedent for the principle that interstate commerce must pay its fair share of state taxes.
109835,102857,Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Commission,Overruled,"To the extent that Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n and Joseph v.

109580,86317,Pollard's Lessee v. HAGAN,Distinguished,"Pollard's Lessee held that under the equal-footing doctrine new States, upon their admission to the Union, acquire title to the lands underlying navigable waters within their boundaries... The rule laid down in Pollard's Lessee has been followed in an unbroken line of cases which make it clear that the title thus acquired by the State is absolute so far as any federal principle of land titles is concerned.","While the Court affirms Pollard's basic holding about state ownership of navigable waters, it distinguishes its application to conclude that once title vests in the state, federal common law no longer governs subsequent changes to the riverbed."
109580,108897,Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona,Overruled,Our analysis today leads us to conclude that our decision to apply federal common law in Bonelli was incorrect... The expressions in Bonelli suggesting a more expansive role for the equal-footing doctrine are contrary to the line of cases following Pollard's Lessee.,The Court explicitly overrules Bonelli's application of federal common law to determine ownership of riverbed lands after state admission to the Union.
109580,93804,Shively v. Bowlby,Mentioned,"And in Shively v. Bowlby, 152 U. S. 1 (1894), the Court recounted in extenso the many cases which had followed the doctrine of Pollard's Lessee.","The Court references Shively as supporting precedent for its historical analysis, without criticizing or substantially modifying its holdings."
109580,102485,"Borax Consolidated, Ltd. v. Los Angeles",Limited,"This same principle would require that determination of the initial boundary between a riverbed, which the State acquired under the equal-footing doctrine, and riparian fast lands likewise be decided as a matter of federal law rather than state law. But that determination is solely for the purpose of fixing the boundaries of the riverbed acquired by the State at the time of its admission to the Union; thereafter the role of the equal-footing doctrine is ended.","The Court limits Borax's application of federal law to only the initial boundary determination at statehood, not subsequent changes."
109580,89473,Barney v. Keokuk,Mentioned,"Barney v. Keokuk, 94 U. S. 324 (1877), involved an ejectment action by the plaintiff against the city involving certain land along the banks of the Mississippi River.","The Court references Barney as historical precedent supporting states' ability to determine riparian ownership rules, without substantially modifying its holdings."
109580,89097,County of St. Clair v. Lovingston,Distinguished,"It is in this descriptive sense that the term is used in the two principal quotations relied upon in the dissenting opinion, New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662, 717 (1836), and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 68 (1874).",The Court distinguishes Lovingston's use of 'common law' as merely descriptive rather than mandating federal common law application.
109580,107555,Hughes v. Washington,Questioned,"Although the Court rejects the reasoning on which Hughes is based, it refrains from formally overruling Hughes on the ground that that case was not relied on in Bonelli and not cited by the Oregon courts below.","While not formally overruling Hughes, the Court questions its reasoning and suggests it may be overruled in a future case."
109580,96443,Joy v. City of St. Louis,Mentioned,"Here, however, we are not dealing with substantive property law as such, but rather with an issue substantially related to the constitutional sovereignty of the States.",The Court references Joy as part of its historical analysis without substantially modifying or criticizing its holdings.
109580,86113,Wilcox v. Jackson,Mentioned,"As long ago as 1839, the Court said: 'We hold the true principle to be this, that whenever the question in any Court, state or federal, is, whether a title to land which had once been the property of the United States has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws of the United States.'","The Court cites Wilcox as historical precedent supporting its analysis, without substantially modifying its holdings."
109895,109631,United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.,Mentioned,"The Court, quoting language in Ball, supra, at 671, stated: 'Perhaps the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence has been that [a] verdict of acquittal . . . could not be reviewed, on error or otherwise, without putting [a defendant] twice in jeopardy, and thereby violating the Constitution.'","The Acting Decision cites Martin Linen Supply Co. to reinforce established double jeopardy principles, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
109895,109688,Lee v. United States,Overruled,"This principle was reaffirmed only last Term in Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, 30 (1977): 'Where a midtrial dismissal is granted on the ground, correct or not, that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged, . . . further prosecution is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.' But the Court today overrules the principle recognized in Jenkins and Lee.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the principle established in Lee regarding double jeopardy bars following midtrial dismissals.
109895,109200,United States v. Wilson,Mentioned,"In our first encounter with the new statute, we concluded that 'Congress intended to remove all statutory barriers to Government appeals and to allow appeals whenever the Constitution would permit.'","The Acting Decision references Wilson to explain historical development of government appeals in criminal cases, without criticizing or modifying its holding."
109895,109201,United States v. Jenkins,Overruled,"We have therefore decided to overrule Jenkins, and thus to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in this case.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Jenkins and its approach to double jeopardy in cases of midtrial dismissals.
109895,105594,Green v. United States,Mentioned,"The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense.","The Acting Decision cites Green to explain the historical purpose of double jeopardy protection, without questioning or modifying its principles."
109895,94515,United States v. Ball,Mentioned,"And, in the very first case presenting the issues, United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896), the Court established principles that have been adhered to ever since.","The Acting Decision references Ball as establishing enduring principles of double jeopardy law, without criticizing or modifying its holding."
109895,109773,Arizona v. Washington,Mentioned,"Most recently in Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 (1978), we reviewed this Court's attempts to give content to the term 'manifest necessity.'","The Acting Decision cites Arizona v. Washington to explain the development of mistrial doctrine, without criticizing or modifying its principles."
109895,96129,Kepner v. United States,Mentioned,"That case arose out of a criminal prosecution in the Philippine Islands, to which the principles of the Double Jeopardy Clause had been expressly made applicable by Act of Congress.","The Acting Decision references Kepner to provide historical context for double jeopardy principles, without questioning or modifying its holding."
109895,109204,Serfass v. United States,Mentioned,"Yet, though our assessment of the history and meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause in Wilson, Jenkins, and Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377 (1975), occurred only three Terms ago...","The Acting Decision references Serfass as part of the historical development of double jeopardy doctrine, without criticizing or modifying its principles."
109895,108233,United States v. Jorn,Mentioned,Society's 'willingness to limit the Government to a single criminal proceeding to vindicate its very vital interest in enforcement of criminal laws' bespeaks society's recognition of the gross unfairness of requiring the accused to undergo the strain and agony of more than one trial for any single offense.,"The Acting Decision cites Jorn to explain the policy behind double jeopardy protection, without questioning or modifying its principles."
109895,106359,Fong Foo v. United States,Mentioned,"More than 50 years later, in Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141 (1962), this Court reviewed the issuance of a writ of mandamus by the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit instructing a District Court to vacate certain judgments of acquittal.","The Acting Decision references Fong Foo as part of the historical development of double jeopardy doctrine, without criticizing or modifying its holding."
110063,94405,Geer v. Connecticut,Overruled,"We hold that time has revealed the error of the early resolution reached in that case, and accordingly Geer is today overruled.","The Court explicitly overrules Geer, rejecting its analysis of state ownership of wildlife and its impact on Commerce Clause jurisprudence."
110063,100325,Lacoste v. Department of Conservation of Louisiana,Distinguished,"Nevertheless, Lacoste expressly declined to uphold the tax 'by virtue of the power of the State to prohibit, and therefore to condition, the removal of wild game from the State.'",The Court distinguishes Lacoste by noting it upheld state regulation on different grounds than those relied on in Geer.
110063,101328,Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel,Mentioned,Foster-Fountain Packing struck down the statute as economic protectionism abhorrent to the Commerce Clause.,The Court cites Foster-Fountain Packing as historical precedent showing the evolution away from Geer's ownership theory.
110063,104652,"H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond",Mentioned,"Today's decision makes clear, however, that States may promote this legitimate purpose only in ways consistent with the basic principle that 'our economic unit is the Nation,'",The Court cites Hood & Sons to support its reasoning about national economic unity under the Commerce Clause.
110063,97421,West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.,Mentioned,"The erosion of Geer began only 15 years after it was decided... West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911)",The Court references West as an early case that began eroding the Geer doctrine.
110063,108085,"Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.",Mentioned,"Today's principle is that stated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U. S. 137, 142 (1970)",The Court cites Pike as establishing the current test for analyzing state regulations under the Commerce Clause.
110063,109662,"Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc.",Mentioned,"Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc., 431 U. S. 265 (1977), dispelled any doubts on that score.",The Court cites Douglas as further support for the rejection of the state ownership theory of wildlife.

Montana Fish & Game Comm'n, 436 U. S. 371, 386 (1978). Today, the Court overrules that decision.",The Court distinguishes its recent Baldwin decision to explain its change in position regarding Geer.
110063,109916,City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey,Mentioned,This formulation was employed only last Term to strike down New Jersey's attempt to 'conserve' the natural resource of landfill areas within the State,The Court cites Philadelphia as recent precedent applying the Pike test to state conservation measures.
110063,104563,Toomer v. Witsell,Mentioned,Foster-Fountain Packing's implicit shift away from Geer's formalistic 'ownership' analysis became explicit in Toomer v. Witsell,The Court references Toomer as part of the historical progression away from Geer's ownership theory.
110212,105789,Hawkins v. United States,Overruled,"Our consideration of the foundations for the privilege and its history satisfy us that 'reason and experience' no longer justify so sweeping a rule as that found acceptable by the Court in Hawkins. Accordingly, we conclude that the existing rule should be modified","The Court explicitly overrules Hawkins by modifying the spousal privilege rule to vest only in the witness-spouse, rather than allowing the defendant-spouse to prevent testimony."
110212,102164,Funk v. United States,Distinguished,"Funk, however, left undisturbed the rule that either spouse could prevent the other from giving adverse testimony. Id., at 373.","The Court distinguishes Funk by noting that while it abolished spousal disqualification, it did not address the separate issue of spousal privilege that is at issue in this case."
110212,106048,Wyatt v. United States,Mentioned,The decision in Wyatt recognized an exception to Hawkins for cases in which one spouse commits a crime against the other.,The Court merely references Wyatt as historical context for explaining exceptions to the spousal privilege rule.
110212,102181,Wolfle v. United States,Mentioned,The Federal Rules of Evidence acknowledge the authority of the federal courts to continue the evolutionary development of testimonial privileges in federal criminal trials 'governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted ... in the light of reason and experience.' Fed. Rule Evid. 501. Cf. Wolfle v. United States,The Court simply cites Wolfle as support for the principle of courts' authority to develop evidentiary rules.
110212,86090,Stein v. Bowman,Criticized,"It was applied by this Court in Stein v. Bowman... Indeed, it was not until 1933, in Funk v. United States, that this Court abolished the testimonial disqualification in the federal courts",The Court criticizes Stein as representing an outdated rule based on medieval doctrines that has since been abandoned.
110212,104845,Blau v. United States,Mentioned,"Those confidences are privileged under the independent rule protecting confidential marital communications. Blau v. United States, 340 U. S. 332 (1951)","The Court merely references Blau to acknowledge the separate privilege for confidential marital communications, which is not at issue in this case."
110325,106022,Jones v. United States,Overruled,"The automatic standing rule of Jones v. United States, supra, is therefore overruled.","The Court explicitly overrules Jones's automatic standing rule, finding that its original foundations have eroded and no alternative principles exist to support its retention."
110325,107636,Simmons v. United States,Distinguished,"The 'dilemma' identified in Jones, that a defendant charged with a possessory offense might only be able to establish his standing to challenge a search and seizure by giving self-incriminating testimony admissible as evidence of his guilt, was eliminated by our decision in Simmons v. United States","The Court distinguishes Simmons as providing broader but different protections than Jones, noting that while it eliminates one concern, it doesn't fully resolve all issues related to testimony at suppression hearings."
110325,108760,Brown v. United States,Mentioned,"As we stated in Brown v. United States, 411 U. S., at 228, '[t]he self-incrimination dilemma, so central to the Jones decision, can no longer occur under the prevailing interpretation of the Constitution [in Simmons].'",The Court cites Brown to support its analysis but does not significantly engage with or modify Brown's holdings.
110325,107872,Alderman v. United States,Mentioned,We are unwilling to tolerate the exclusion of probative evidence under such circumstances since we adhere to the view of Alderman that the values of the Fourth Amendment are preserved by a rule which limits the availability of the exclusionary rule to defendants who have been subjected to a violation of their Fourth Amendment rights.,The Court references Alderman to support its reasoning but does not significantly analyze or modify Alderman's holdings.
110799,2226827,State Ex Rel. Douglas v. Sporhase,Reversed,The reciprocity requirement of Neb. Rev. Stat. §46-613.01 (1978) violates the Commerce Clause. We leave to the state courts the question whether the invalid portion is severable. The judgment of the Nebraska Supreme Court is reversed,"The Supreme Court reversed the Nebraska Supreme Court's decision, finding that the reciprocity requirement in the state's water regulation statute was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause."
110799,1818257,"City of Altus, Oklahoma v. Carr",Distinguished,That result is not necessarily inconsistent with the Nebraska Supreme Court's holding in this case. For Texas law differs significantly from Nebraska law regarding the rights of a surface owner to ground water that he has withdrawn.,The Court distinguished City of Altus from the present case based on the different property rights regimes for groundwater in Texas versus Nebraska.
110799,96834,Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter,Criticized,"City of Altus, however, is inconsistent with Hudson County. For in the latter case the Court found Geer v. Connecticut, supra, to be controlling on the Commerce Clause issue.","The Court criticized Hudson County's reliance on the public ownership theory from Geer, which has since been overruled."
110799,97421,West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.,Mentioned,"The city relied upon West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., 221 U. S. 229 (1911), which invalidated an Oklahoma statute that prevented the interstate transfer of natural gas produced within the State","The Court merely referenced West as precedent relied upon in City of Altus, without expressing approval or criticism of its reasoning."
110799,94405,Geer v. Connecticut,Overruled,"In expressly overruling Geer three years ago, this Court traced the demise of the public ownership theory and definitively recast it as 'but a fiction expressive in legal shorthand of the importance to its people that a State have power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of an important resource.'","The Court explicitly states that Geer was overruled, rejecting its public ownership theory as merely a legal fiction."
110719,110119,Arkansas v. Sanders,Overruled,Sanders is therefore effectively overruled. And the Court unambiguously overrules 'the disposition' of Robbins,"The Court explicitly rejects Sanders' holding that warrantless searches of containers in automobiles require separate warrant protection, replacing it with a new rule allowing warrantless searches of containers found during legitimate automobile searches."
110719,100567,Carroll v. United States,Mentioned,"In Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, the Court held that a warrantless search of an automobile stopped by police officers who had probable cause to believe the vehicle contained contraband was not unreasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.",The Court relies on Carroll as established precedent and builds upon its reasoning to extend the automobile exception to containers found within vehicles.
110719,109714,United States v. Chadwick,Distinguished,"The Court suggests that probable cause to search only a container does not justify a warrantless search of an automobile in which it is placed, absent reason to believe that the contents could be secreted elsewhere in the vehicle.",The Court distinguishes Chadwick by explaining that it involved probable cause specific to a container rather than the automobile itself.
110719,110558,Robbins v. California,Overruled,"And the Court unambiguously overrules 'the disposition' of Robbins, ante, at 824, though it gingerly avoids stating that it is overruling the case itself.",The Court explicitly rejects Robbins' holding that required warrants for searching closed containers found during automobile searches.
110719,108184,Chambers v. Maroney,Mentioned,"As this Court reaffirmed in Chambers, 399 U. S., at 50, '[n]either Carroll, supra, nor other cases in this Court require or suggest that in every conceivable circumstance the search of an auto even with probable cause may be made without the extra protection for privacy that a warrant affords.'",The Court cites Chambers as supporting precedent while developing its new rule about container searches in automobiles.
110719,392944,"United States v. Albert Ross, Jr.",Mentioned,"The en banc Court of Appeals stated that '[biased on the tip the police received, Ross's car was properly stopped and searched, and the pouch and bag were properly seized.'",The Court references the lower court decision as background for the current case without expressing approval or disapproval of its reasoning.
110719,108377,Coolidge v. New Hampshire,Distinguished,"Indeed, the Court's reasoning might have justified the search of the entire car in Coolidge despite the fact that the car was not 'mobile' at all.","The Court distinguishes Coolidge by noting its different circumstances regarding the mobility of the vehicle, which was a key factor in the automobile exception."
110563,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady",Mentioned,"Under that test, a state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it 'is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to services provided by the State.'","The Acting Decision uses Complete Auto Transit as the foundational framework for analyzing state tax validity under the Commerce Clause, without criticizing or limiting its application."
110563,109835,Department of Revenue v. Ass'n of Washington Stevedoring Companies,Mentioned,This Court has acknowledged that 'a State has a significant interest in exacting from interstate commerce its fair share of the cost of state government.',"The Acting Decision cites Washington Stevedoring to support its analysis of state taxation powers, without modifying or criticizing its principles."
110563,877181,Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State,Mentioned,The Montana Supreme Court held that the coal severance tax is 'imposed for the general support of the government.',The Acting Decision references the lower court's holding as background information without any negative treatment.
110563,104253,Nippert v. City of Richmond,Distinguished,"When a tax is assessed in proportion to a taxpayer's activities or presence in a State, the taxpayer is shouldering its fair share of supporting the State's provision of 'police and fire protection, the benefit of a trained work force, and the advantages of a civilized society.'",The Acting Decision distinguishes Nippert by explaining how the current tax differs from the problematic tax in Nippert by being proportional to in-state activities.
110563,110488,Maryland v. Louisiana,Mentioned,"See Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 754 (1981)",The Acting Decision cites Maryland v. Louisiana as supporting precedent without any negative treatment.
110563,102972,Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue,Mentioned,'[I]t was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business.',The Acting Decision uses Western Live Stock as supporting authority for its analysis of permissible state taxation.
110563,106846,General Motors Corp. v. Washington,Mentioned,"As we explained in General Motors Corp. v. Washington, supra, at 440-441: '[T]he validity of the tax rests upon whether the State is exacting a constitutionally fair demand for that aspect of interstate commerce to which it bears a special relation.'",The Acting Decision relies on General Motors to support its analysis of fair state taxation without any negative treatment.
110563,103186,"Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc.",Distinguished,"Consequently, in reviewing appellants' contentions, we put to one side those cases in which the Court reviewed challenges to 'user' fees or 'taxes' that were designed and defended as a specific charge imposed by the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportation or other facilities and services.",The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes Clark as dealing with a different type of tax (user fees) than the general revenue tax at issue.
110563,100063,Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co.,Overruled,We therefore hold that a state severance tax is not immunized from Commerce Clause scrutiny by a claim that the tax is imposed on goods prior to their entry into the stream of interstate commerce. Any contrary statements in Heisler and its progeny are disapproved.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Heisler's approach to analyzing state severance taxes under the Commerce Clause.
110563,105195,Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert,Distinguished,"Correspondingly, when the measure of a tax bears no relationship to the taxpayers' presence or activities in a State, a court may properly conclude under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test that the State is imposing an undue burden on interstate commerce. See Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U. S., at 427; cf. Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert",The Acting Decision distinguishes Michigan-Wisconsin by using it as a contrasting example of an impermissible tax that bears no relationship to in-state activities.
110563,102777,Ingels v. Morf,Distinguished,"Consequently, in reviewing appellants' contentions, we put to one side those cases in which the Court reviewed challenges to 'user' fees or 'taxes' that were designed and defended as a specific charge imposed by the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportation or other facilities and services. See, e. g., Evansville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972); Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc., 306 U. S. 583 (1939); Ingels v. Morf, 300 U. S. 290 (1937)",The Acting Decision distinguishes Ingels as dealing with user fees rather than the general revenue tax at issue in the current case.
111218,104463,United States v. Yellow Cab Co.,Overruled,"To the extent that prior decisions of this Court are to the contrary, they are disapproved and overruled.","The Court explicitly overrules Yellow Cab's holding that a parent and wholly owned subsidiary can conspire under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, finding this doctrine inconsistent with the economic reality of parent-subsidiary relationships."
111218,104915,Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States,Overruled,"Later cases invoking the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine do little more than cite Yellow Cab or Kiefer-Stewart, and in none of the cases was the doctrine necessary to the result reached.","The Court explicitly rejects Timken's support for the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, stating it was unnecessary to the result and overruling it along with other similar precedents."
111218,104839,"Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc.",Overruled,"With only a citation to Yellow Cab and no further analysis, the Court stated that the 'suggestion runs counter to our past decisions that common ownership and control does not liberate corporations from the impact of the antitrust laws'","The Court explicitly criticizes and overrules Kiefer-Stewart's holding regarding intra-enterprise conspiracy, finding it relied on Yellow Cab without proper analysis."
111218,107732,"Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp.",Limited,"The Court did suggest that, because the defendants 'availed themselves of the privilege of doing business through separate corporations, the fact of common ownership could not save them from any of the obligations that the law imposes on separate entities.' But the Court noted immediately thereafter that '[i]n any event' each plaintiff could 'clearly' charge a combination between itself and the defendants or between the defendants and other franchise dealers.",The Court limits Perma Life's precedential value by noting its intra-enterprise conspiracy language was merely an alternative holding unnecessary to the result.
111218,102041,"Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States",Distinguished,"As we shall see, infra, at 771-774, it is the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine itself that 'makes but an artificial distinction' at the expense of substance.",The Court distinguishes Appalachian Coals by noting that its language about artificial distinctions actually supports rejecting the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine.
111218,104037,United States v. Crescent Amusement Co.,Limited,"This suggests that both Crescent Amusement and Yellow Cab, which cited the very page on which this passage appears, stand for a narrow rule based on the original illegality of the affiliation.",The Court limits Crescent Amusement's scope by interpreting it as applying only to cases where the initial corporate affiliation was itself illegal.
111218,1292673,United States v. American Tobacco Co.,Mentioned,"In Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 221 U. S. 1 (1911), and United States v. American Tobacco Co., 221 U. S. 106 (1911), the trust or holding company device brought together previously independent firms to lessen competition and achieve monopoly power.",The Court merely references American Tobacco as a historical example without critiquing or relying on its reasoning.
111218,106009,"United States v. Parke, Davis & Co.",Mentioned,We have already noted that Congress left this 'gap' for eminently sound reasons.,"The Court mentions Parke Davis only as part of a broader discussion about Congressional intent, without substantively analyzing or relying on its holdings."
111218,409686,Independence Tube Corporation v. Copperweld Corporation,Reversed,"Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.",The Court explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals' decision that had found a parent and wholly owned subsidiary capable of conspiring under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
111103,102987,Helvering v. Mitchell,Mentioned,"As the Court noted in Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391 (1938), the difference in degree of the burden of proof in criminal and civil cases precludes application of the doctrine of res judicata","The Acting Decision cites Helvering extensively as supporting precedent for its analysis of the distinction between civil and criminal proceedings, without criticizing or modifying its holdings."
111103,110331,United States v. Ward,Mentioned,"As the Court noted in United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980): 'Our inquiry in this regard has traditionally proceeded on two levels...'","The Acting Decision uses Ward's two-level test as an analytical framework for determining whether a proceeding is civil or criminal, citing it approvingly."
111103,106534,Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,Mentioned,"In Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), we set forth a list of considerations that has proved helpful in the past in making such determinations.","The Acting Decision references Mendoza-Martinez for its established factors in determining whether a sanction is civil or criminal, using it as supporting authority."
111103,407595,"United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms, National Rifle Association of America, Amicus Curiae",Reversed,"The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is accordingly reversed, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the lower court's ruling.
111103,108643,One Lot Emerald Cut Stones and One Ring v. United States,Mentioned,"Most recently, in One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States, 409 U. S. 232 (1972) (per curiam), the Court held that a civil action for forfeiture of a ring and stones was not barred by the owner's prior acquittal",The Acting Decision cites One Lot Emerald Cut Stones as supporting precedent for its conclusion that civil forfeiture is not barred by criminal acquittal.
111103,106087,Flemming v. Nestor,Mentioned,Mulcahey has failed to establish by the 'clearest proof' that Congress has provided a sanction so punitive as to 'transfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty.',The Acting Decision cites Flemming's 'clearest proof' standard in its analysis of civil versus criminal sanctions.
111103,8178595,Coffey v. United States,Overruled,"To the extent that Coffey v. United States suggests otherwise, it is hereby disapproved.",The Acting Decision explicitly disapproves and overrules Coffey's precedent regarding the preclusive effect of criminal acquittals on civil forfeiture proceedings.
111404,91894,Ex Parte Bain,Overruled,"To avoid further confusion, we now explicitly reject that proposition. Rejecting this aspect of Bain is hardly a radical step, however, given that in the years since Bain this Court has largely ignored this element of the case.","The Court explicitly rejects Bain's proposition that dropping unnecessary allegations from an indictment constitutes an unconstitutional amendment, while preserving its broader holding about impermissible additions to indictments."
111404,105978,Stirone v. United States,Distinguished,"Stirone was thus wholly unlike the cases discussed in Part II, supra, and unlike respondent's case, all of which involve trial evidence that narrowed the indictment's charges without adding any new offenses.","The Court distinguishes Stirone from the present case because Stirone involved broadening the indictment with new offenses, while the present case involves narrowing the indictment."
111404,423986,United States v. James Rual Miller,Reversed,The judgment of the Court of Appeals is accordingly reversed.,"The Court explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals' decision in Miller, finding that narrowing the indictment did not violate Miller's Fifth Amendment rights."
111404,102436,Berger v. United States,Mentioned,"See also Berger v. United States, 295 U. S. 78, 83 (1935)","The Court cites Berger as supporting precedent regarding variance between indictment and proof, without significant discussion or modification of its holding."
111404,106407,Russell v. United States,Mentioned,"See also Russell v. United States, 369 U. S., at 770 (citing Bain for the 'settled rule in the federal courts that an indictment may not be amended except by resubmission to the grand jury, unless the change is merely a matter of form')","The Court references Russell as supporting precedent for the general principle about grand jury indictments, without significantly analyzing or modifying its holding."
111404,103976,United States v. Ballard,Mentioned,"That our holding today is fully consistent with prior legal understanding is apparent from an examination of the state of the law, as seen by Chief Justice Stone, more than 40 years ago","The Court cites Ballard's dissenting opinion to demonstrate historical consistency with its current ruling, without significantly analyzing the case itself."
111404,100951,Salinger v. United States,Mentioned,"In Salinger v. United States, supra, for example, the Court was presented with facts quite similar to the instant case","The Court uses Salinger as supporting precedent for its decision, citing its similar facts and consistent holding without modifying or criticizing it."
111948,107953,O'Callahan v. Parker,Overruled,"We hold that it does not, and overrule our earlier decision in O'Callahan v. Parker, 395 U. S. 258 (1969).",The Court explicitly overrules O'Callahan's requirement that court-martial jurisdiction depends on 'service connection' of the offense.
111948,105326,United States Ex Rel. Toth v. Quarles,Distinguished,"Whatever doubts there might be about the extent of Congress' power under Clause 14 to make rules for the 'Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,' that power surely embraces the authority to regulate the conduct of persons who are actually members of the Armed Services.","The Court distinguishes Toth, which dealt with ex-servicemen, from the current case involving active service members."
111948,8982256,"Relford v. Commandant, US Disciplinary Barracks",Criticized,"The service connection approach, even as elucidated in Relford, has proved confusing and difficult for military courts to apply.",The Court criticizes the Relford decision's service connection test as being impractical and difficult to implement.
111948,105525,Reid v. Covert,Mentioned,"In an unbroken line of decisions from 1866 to 1960, this Court interpreted the Constitution as conditioning the proper exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over an offense on one factor: the military status of the accused.",The Court cites Reid as part of historical precedent without criticizing or distinguishing it.
111948,105981,Kinsella v. United States Ex Rel. Singleton,Mentioned,"The test for jurisdiction ... is one of status, namely, whether the accused in the court-martial proceeding is a person who can be regarded as falling within the term 'land and naval Forces.'",The Court references Kinsella to support its historical analysis of the status test without negative treatment.
111948,89821,Coleman v. Tennessee,Mentioned,Implicit in the military status test was the principle that determinations concerning the scope of court-martial jurisdiction over offenses committed by servicemen was a matter reserved for Congress.,The Court cites Coleman as supporting precedent for Congress's authority over military jurisdiction without criticism or distinction.
111940,87371,"Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON, GOVERNOR, &C.",Overruled,Kentucky v. Dennison is the product of another time. The conception of the relation between the States and the Federal Government there announced is fundamentally incompatible with more than a century of constitutional development... We conclude that it may stand no longer.,"The Court explicitly overrules Dennison's holding that federal courts cannot compel state officials to perform extradition duties, finding it incompatible with modern constitutional principles."
111940,109961,Michigan v. Doran,Mentioned,"The language of the Clause is 'clear and explicit.' Michigan v. Doran, 439 U. S. 282, 286 (1978).",The Court cites Doran to support its interpretation of the Extradition Clause's mandatory nature.
111940,105312,Brown v. Board of Education (1955),Mentioned,"It would be superfluous to restate all the occasions on which this Court has imposed upon state officials a duty to obey the requirements of the Constitution, or compelled the performance of such duties; it may suffice to refer to Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294 (1955)",The Court cites Brown as an example of federal courts' power to compel state officials to perform constitutional duties.
111940,105221,Brown v. Board of Education (1954),Mentioned,"Long continuation of decisional law or administrative practice incompatible with the requirements of the Constitution cannot overcome our responsibility to enforce those requirements. See, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954)",The Court cites Brown to support the principle that longstanding practices cannot justify continued constitutional violations.
111940,105766,Cooper v. Aaron,Mentioned,"it may suffice to refer to Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294 (1955), and Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 (1958)",The Court cites Cooper as another example of federal courts compelling state officials to perform constitutional duties.
111940,96519,Appleyard v. Massachusetts,Mentioned,"see Biddinger v. Commissioner of Police, 245 U. S. 128, 132-133 (1917); Appleyard v. Massachusetts, 203 U. S. 222, 227 (1906)",The Court cites Appleyard to support the purposes of the Extradition Clause.
111940,99021,Biddinger v. Commissioner of Police of City of New York,Mentioned,"see Biddinger v. Commissioner of Police, 245 U. S. 128, 132-133 (1917)",The Court cites Biddinger to support the purposes of the Extradition Clause.
111940,110322,Maine v. Thiboutot,Mentioned,"See Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1 (1980)",The Court cites Thiboutot to support Puerto Rico's right to enforce federal statutory duties in federal courts.
111940,109490,"Examining Bd. of Engineers, Architects and Surveyors v. Flores De Otero",Mentioned,"for the intention of that legislation was 'to accord to Puerto Rico the degree of autonomy and independence normally associated with States of the Union.' Examining Board of Engineers, Architects and Surveyors v. Flores de Otero, 426 U. S. 572, 594 (1976)",The Court cites Flores de Otero to explain Puerto Rico's status and rights under federal law.
111940,96819,Ex Parte Young,Mentioned,"It has long been a settled principle that federal courts may enjoin unconstitutional action by state officials. See Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 155-156 (1908)",The Court cites Young to support federal courts' authority to enjoin unconstitutional state action.
111940,96915,New York Ex Rel. Kopel v. Bingham,Mentioned,"It was decided long ago that Puerto Rico, as a Territory of the United States, could invoke the Act to reclaim fugitives from its justice, see New York ex rel. Kopel v. Bingham, 211 U. S. 468 (1909)",The Court cites Bingham to establish Puerto Rico's historical right to invoke the Extradition Act.
111940,107705,Green v. County School Board of New Kent County,Mentioned,"See, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); Green v. New Kent County School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968)",The Court cites Green as another example showing that longstanding unconstitutional practices cannot be justified by their duration.
111940,89308,Board of Liquidation v. McComb,Mentioned,"Within 15 years of the decision in Dennison it was said that 'when a plain official duty, requiring no exercise of discretion, is to be performed, and performance is refused, any person who will sustain personal injury by such refusal may have a mandamus to compel its performance'",The Court cites McComb to show early recognition of federal courts' power to compel state officials to perform ministerial duties.
111940,110718,Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Mississippi,Mentioned,"The fundamental premise of the holding in Dennison — 'that the States and the Federal Government in all circumstances must be viewed as coequal sovereigns — is not representative of the law today.' FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 761 (1982)",The Court cites FERC to support its rejection of Dennison's view of state-federal relationships.
112276,1098406,Ex Parte Smith (1988),Reversed,"The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Alabama Supreme Court's ruling in Ex Parte Smith that had applied the Pearce presumption of vindictiveness to cases involving guilty pleas.
112276,107978,North Carolina v. Pearce,Limited,"While the Pearce opinion appeared on its face to announce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent cases have made clear that its presumption of vindictiveness 'do[es] not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial.'",The Acting Decision explicitly limits the scope of Pearce by holding that its presumption of vindictiveness does not apply when the first sentence was based on a guilty plea.
112276,108569,Colten v. Kentucky,Mentioned,"In Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104 (1972), for example, we refused to apply the presumption when the increased sentence was imposed by the second court in a two-tiered system",The Acting Decision cites Colten as supporting precedent to demonstrate previous limitations on the Pearce presumption.
112276,111602,Texas v. McCullough,Mentioned,"As we explained in Texas v. McCullough, 'the evil the [Pearce] Court sought to prevent' was not the imposition of 'enlarged sentences after a new trial' but 'vindictiveness of a sentencing judge.'",The Acting Decision uses McCullough to support its interpretation of the purpose behind the Pearce presumption.
112276,110748,United States v. Goodwin,Mentioned,"Such circumstances are those in which there is a 'reasonable likelihood,' United States v. Goodwin, supra, at 373, that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.",The Acting Decision cites Goodwin to establish the standard for when the presumption of vindictiveness should apply.
112040,111308,Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority,Distinguished,"Garcia holds that the limits are structural, not substantive— i. e., that States must find their protection from congressional regulation through the national political process, not through judicially defined spheres of unregulable state activity.","The Court distinguishes Garcia's principles about structural limits while analyzing whether TEFRA violates the Tenth Amendment, using it as a contrasting framework rather than directly applying it."
112040,104222,New York v. United States,Mentioned,"Two Justices reasoned that any nondiscriminatory tax on a State was constitutional, even if directly collected from the State. See id., at 582-584 (Frankfurter, J., joined by Rutledge, J.).","The Court references New York v. United States to explain historical development of tax immunity doctrine, without criticizing or substantially relying on its holding."
112040,103172,Graves v. New York Ex Rel. O'Keefe,Limited,"In Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 (1939), the Court announced: 'The theory . . . that a tax on income is legally or economically a tax on its source, is no longer tenable.'",The Court uses Graves to limit the scope of intergovernmental tax immunity by rejecting the theory that taxing income is equivalent to taxing its source.
112040,103047,Helvering v. Gerhardt,Mentioned,"Prior to that the Court had already confined Collector v. Day to its facts in Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405 (1938), which upheld the constitutionality of a federal tax on the salaries of state employees involved in state construction projects.",The Court cites Helvering as historical precedent without substantially analyzing or modifying its holding.
112040,110718,Federal Energy Regulatory Commission v. Mississippi,Distinguished,"The Court in FERC first distinguished National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), noting that the statute in National League of Cities presented questions concerning 'the extent to which state sovereignty shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations,' whereas the statute in FERC 'attempts to use state regulatory machinery to advance federal goals.'",The Court distinguishes FERC's analysis of state regulatory machinery from the present case which involves general federal regulations.
112040,101762,Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States,Overruled,"The commonality of the rationale underlying all these immunities for government contracts was highlighted by Indian Motocycle, 283 U. S. 570 (1931)... The rationale underlying Pollock and the general immunity for government contract income has been thoroughly repudiated by modern intergovernmental immunity case law.",The Court explicitly states that the rationale of Indian Motocycle has been repudiated by modern case law.
112040,94174,Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.,Overruled,We thus confirm that subsequent case law has overruled the holding in Pollock that state bond interest is immune from a nondiscriminatory federal tax.,The Court explicitly overrules Pollock's holding regarding immunity of state bond interest from federal taxation.
112301,111683,Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority,Mentioned,"Brown-Forman, however, holds unequivocally that to the extent that an affirmation statute has the practical effect of regulating out-of-state liquor prices, it cannot stand under the Commerce Clause irrespective of the Twenty-first Amendment.","The Acting Decision relies on Brown-Forman as controlling precedent to establish the constitutional framework for analyzing price-affirmation statutes, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
112301,107217,"Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter",Overruled,"In the interest of removing any lingering uncertainty about the constitutional validity of affirmation statutes and of avoiding further litigation on the subject of liquor-price affirmation, we recognize today what was all but determined in Brown-Forman: to the extent that Seagram holds that retrospective affirmation statutes do not facially violate the Commerce Clause, it is no longer good law.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Seagram's holding regarding retrospective affirmation statutes, stating it is no longer good law."
112301,102402,"Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.",Mentioned,"Writing for the Court, Justice Cardozo pronounced that the Commerce Clause does not permit a State 'to establish a wage scale or a scale of prices for use in other states, and to bar the sale of the products . . . unless the scale has been observed.'",The Acting Decision cites Baldwin as supportive precedent for its analysis without criticizing or distinguishing it.
112301,110758,Edgar v. Mite Corp.,Mentioned,"The Brown-Forman Court cited a third extraterritorial decision, Edgar v. MITE Corp., 457 U. S. 624 (1982), which, though not discussed at length there, significantly illuminates the contours of the constitutional prohibition on extraterritorial legislation.",The Acting Decision uses Edgar as supporting precedent to explain the constitutional framework regarding extraterritorial legislation.
112301,507765,In Re the Beer Institute,Mentioned,"First, and foremost, the court held that the Connecticut statute's 'purposeful interaction with border-state regulatory schemes' means that shippers cannot, as a practical matter, set prices based on market conditions in a border State without factoring in the effects of those prices on its future Connecticut pricing options.",The Acting Decision references the Beer Institute case to describe the lower court's reasoning without criticizing or distinguishing it.
112301,2370562,United States Brewers Ass'n v. Healy,Mentioned,"On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court upheld the statute as modified by the legislature and construed in the Department of Liquor Control's declaratory ruling.",The Acting Decision simply describes the procedural history and lower court's ruling without criticizing or distinguishing it.
112471,94866,Thompson v. Utah,Overruled,"To the extent that Thompson v. Utah rested on the Ex Post Facto Clause and not the Sixth Amendment, we overrule it.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Thompson's ex post facto holding, stating that the right to jury trial is not related to the definition of crimes, defenses, or punishments which is the concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause."
112471,100734,Beazell v. Ohio,Mentioned,The Beazell formulation is faithful to our best knowledge of the original understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause: Legislatures may not retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.,The Acting Decision positively references and relies on Beazell's framework as the correct interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.
112471,90760,Kring v. Missouri,Overruled,"The holding in Kring can only be justified if the Ex Post Facto Clause is thought to include not merely the Calder categories, but any change which 'alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.' We think such a reading of the Clause departs from the meaning of the Clause as it was understood at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, and is not supported by later cases. We accordingly overrule Kring.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Kring, stating that its interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause was unjustified and departed from the original understanding of the Constitution."
112471,1787505,Bogany v. State,Mentioned,"In Bogany, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a jury verdict which included a punishment unauthorized by law was void at its inception and had to be set aside.",The Acting Decision merely references Bogany to explain the background of the case and the prior state of Texas law.
112471,98427,Malloy v. South Carolina,Mentioned,"But the constitutional provision was intended to secure substantial personal rights against arbitrary and oppressive legislation, see Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 183","The Acting Decision cites Malloy only as part of explaining the historical interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, without criticizing or substantially engaging with its holding."
112258,109016,Procunier v. Martinez,Overruled,"To the extent that Martinez itself suggests such a distinction, we today overrule that case; the Court accomplished much of this step when it decided Turner.","The Court explicitly overrules Martinez's standard of review for incoming prison communications, limiting Martinez only to regulations concerning outgoing correspondence."
112258,111904,Turner v. Safley,Mentioned,"We now hold that the District Court correctly anticipated that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the regulations are 'reasonably related to legitimate penological interests,' Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987)",The Court adopts and applies Turner's reasonableness standard as the controlling test for reviewing prison regulations affecting incoming publications.
112258,109718,"Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc.",Mentioned,The Court's decision to apply a reasonableness standard in these cases rather than Martinez' less deferential approach stemmed from its concern that language in Martinez might be too readily understood as establishing a standard of 'strict' or 'heightened' scrutiny,"The Court cites Jones as part of the evolution of prison regulation standards, showing the shift from Martinez's approach to a more deferential reasonableness standard."
112258,109079,Pell v. Procunier,Mentioned,"Many categories of noninmates seek access to prisons. Access is essential to lawyers and legal assistants representing prisoner clients, see Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396 (1974), to journalists seeking information about prison conditions, see Pell v. Procunier, supra","The Court references Pell as precedent regarding prison access rights, using it to illustrate the various categories of non-inmates seeking prison access."
112258,492021,Abbott v. Meese,Reversed,"We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals on the issue of facial validity, but we agree with that court's remand of the case to the District Court for a determination of the validity of the regulations as applied to each of the 46 publications.",The Court explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals' decision regarding the facial validity of the regulations while affirming the remand order.
112258,110075,Bell v. Wolfish,Mentioned,"It is equally certain that '[p]rison walls do not form a barrier separating prison inmates from the protections of the Constitution,' Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S., at 84, nor do they bar free citizens from exercising their own constitutional rights by reaching out to those on the 'inside,' id., at 94-99; Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U. S. 520 (1979)","The Court cites Bell v. Wolfish as supporting precedent for the principle that constitutional protections extend into prisons, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
109252,88869,The Pennsylvania,Criticized,"And the potential unfairness of the division is magnified by the application of the rule of The Pennsylvania, 19 Wall. 125, whereby a ship's relatively minor statutory violation will require her to bear half the collision damage unless she can satisfy the heavy burden of showing 'not merely that her fault might not have been one of the causes, or that it probably was not, but that it could not have been.'",The Acting Decision criticizes The Pennsylvania rule as magnifying the unfairness of divided damages by imposing a heavy burden on ships with minor violations.
109252,108166,"Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc.",Mentioned,"See also Moragne v. States Marine Lines, 398 U. S. 375, 405 n. 17",The Acting Decision cites Moragne as supporting precedent for the Court's authority to fashion controlling rules of admiralty law.
109252,1473714,Oriental Trading & Transport Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp.,Mentioned,"And Judge Hand had all but invited this Court to overturn the rule when, in an earlier opinion for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, he stated that 'we have no power to divest ourselves of this vestigial relic; we can only go so far as to close our eyes to doubtful delinquencies.'",The Acting Decision cites Oriental Trading to show historical criticism of the divided damages rule.
109252,92846,The Max Morris,Distinguished,"The divided damages rule has been said to be justified by the difficulty of determining comparative degrees of negligence when both parties are concededly guilty of contributing fault. The Max Morris, 137 U. S. 1, 12. Although there is some force in this argument, it cannot justify an equal division of damages in every case of collision based on mutual fault.",The Acting Decision distinguishes The Max Morris by explaining why its justification for divided damages is not persuasive in all cases.
109252,105170,"Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn",Mentioned,"See, e. g., Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U. S. 406, 409",The Acting Decision cites Pope & Talbot as an example of successful application of comparative negligence in admiralty law.
109252,106640,Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co.,Mentioned,"But the Judiciary has traditionally taken the lead in formulating flexible and fair remedies in the law maritime, and 'Congress has largely left to this Court the responsibility for fashioning the controlling rules of admiralty law.'

109252,88790,The Sapphire,Mentioned,"The operation of the rule was described in The Sapphire, 18 Wall. 51, 56",The Acting Decision cites The Sapphire to explain the historical operation of the divided damages rule.
109252,90646,The North Star,Mentioned,"Similarly, in The North Star, 106 U. S. 17, 22, the rule was thus stated",The Acting Decision cites The North Star as another historical example explaining the divided damages rule.

109252,107344,"Berenyi v. District Director, Immigration & Naturalization Service",Mentioned,"See Berenyi v. Immigration Director, 385 U. S. 630, 635",The Acting Decision cites Berenyi as additional support for the 'two-court rule.'
109252,106562,Weyerhaeuser Steamship Co. v. United States,Mentioned,"The Court has acknowledged the continued existence of the divided damages rule in at least two recent cases. See Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. United States, 372 U. S. 597, 603",The Acting Decision cites Weyerhaeuser as recent precedent acknowledging the divided damages rule.
109252,104954,Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Ceiling & Refitting Corp.,Mentioned,"See Weyerhaeuser S. S. Co. v. United States, 372 U. S. 597, 603; Halcyon Lines v.

S. 140, to reconsider the divided damages rule, but did not reach the issue",The Acting Decision mentions Union Oil as a previous attempt to reconsider the divided damages rule.

109252,86919,The Schooner Catharine v. Dickinson,Overruled,The rule has been repeatedly criticized by experienced federal judges who have correctly pointed out that the result it works has too often been precisely the opposite of what the Court sought to achieve in The Schooner Catharine — the 'just and equitable' allocation of damages.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules The Schooner Catharine's divided damages rule, replacing it with a proportional fault system."
112608,110719,United States v. Ross,Limited,We held in Ross that 'the scope of the warrantless search authorized by [the automobile] exception is no broader and no narrower than a magistrate could legitimately authorize by warrant.',"The Acting Decision limits Ross by clarifying that it only applies to cases where police have probable cause to search an entire vehicle, not when probable cause is specific to a container within the vehicle."
112608,109714,United States v. Chadwick,Overruled,We conclude that it is better to adopt one clear-cut rule to govern automobile searches and eliminate the warrant requirement for closed containers set forth in Sanders.,The Acting Decision explicitly overrules the Chadwick-Sanders rule requiring warrants for container searches in vehicles.
112608,110119,Arkansas v. Sanders,Overruled,"Thus, we recognize in Ross that Chadwick and Sanders had not created a special rule for container searches, but rather had merely applied the cardinal principle that warrantless searches are per se unreasonable unless justified by an exception to the general rule.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Sanders' requirement of warrants for container searches in vehicles.
112608,111305,United States v. Johns,Distinguished,"In the case in which the police had probable cause to search two vehicles, United States v. Johns, 469 U. S. 478 (1985), we rejected the respondent's reliance on Chadwick with a straightforward explanation of why that case, unlike Ross, did not involve an exception to the warrant requirement.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Johns as involving probable cause to search entire vehicles rather than specific containers.
112608,100567,Carroll v. United States,Mentioned,"In Carroll, this Court established an exception to the warrant requirement for moving vehicles",The Acting Decision merely references Carroll as establishing the automobile exception to the warrant requirement.
112608,104504,Johnson v. United States,Mentioned,"In his opinion for the Court in Johnson v. United States, id., at 13-14, Justice Jackson explained: 'The point of the Fourth Amendment...is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence.'",The Acting Decision cites Johnson to explain the historical basis for the warrant requirement but does not modify or criticize it.
112608,108184,Chambers v. Maroney,Mentioned,"The Court refined the exigency requirement in Chambers v. Maroney, 399 U. S. 42 (1970), when it held that the existence of exigent circumstances was to be determined at the time the automobile is seized.",The Acting Decision references Chambers to explain the development of automobile search doctrine but does not modify or criticize it.
112608,110979,United States v. Place,Distinguished,"In United States v. Place, 462 U. S. 696 (1983), we held that, although reasonable suspicion justifies the temporary detention of an airline passenger's luggage, the seizure in that particular case was unreasonable because of the prolonged delay in ascertaining the existence of probable cause.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Place as involving luggage detention at airports rather than automobile searches.
112608,110558,Robbins v. California,Mentioned,"The holding in Belton was supportable under a straightforward application of the automobile exception. See Robbins v. California, 453 U. S. 420, 449-453 (1981)",The Acting Decision merely references Robbins in discussing the application of the automobile exception but does not modify or criticize it.
112609,1573917,"Exxon Corp. v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc. (1989)",Mentioned,"The District Court noted that '[a] prerequisite to the existence of a maritime lien based on a breach of contract is that the subject matter of the contract must fall within the admiralty jurisdiction.' 707 F. Supp. 155, 158 (SDNY 1989).","The Acting Decision simply references the lower court's decision to provide background context, without criticizing or modifying its holdings."
112609,88300,Insurance Co. v. Dunham,Mentioned,"In Insurance Co. v. Dunham, 11 Wall. 1 (1871), the Court explained that, in determining whether a contract falls within admiralty, 'the true criterion is the nature and subject-matter of the contract, as whether it was a maritime contract, having reference to maritime service or maritime transactions.'","The Acting Decision cites Dunham positively as establishing the principle for determining admiralty jurisdiction, but does not significantly modify or alter its precedential value."
112609,105375,Archawski v. Hanioti,Mentioned,"In Archawski, supra, the Court held that an action cognizable as assumpsit would no longer be automatically excluded from admiralty.","The Acting Decision references Archawski to demonstrate how previous legal principles have evolved, but does not modify or criticize its holding."
112609,86949,Minturn v. Maynard,Overruled,We conclude that Minturn is incompatible with current principles of admiralty jurisdiction over contracts and therefore should be overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Minturn, finding its theoretical foundations no longer valid and its per se rule excluding agency contracts from admiralty jurisdiction incompatible with current legal principles."
112728,112640,Coleman v. Thompson,Mentioned,"Again addressing the issue of state procedural default in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U. S. 722 (1991), we described Fay as based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules","The Acting Decision cites Coleman as support for applying the cause-and-prejudice standard, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
112728,106544,Townsend v. Sain,Overruled,"Because the holding of Townsend v. Sain that Fay v. Noia's deliberate bypass standard is applicable in a case like this had not been reversed, it is quite understandable that the Court of Appeals applied that standard in this case. However, in light of more recent decisions of this Court, Townsend's holding in this respect must be overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Townsend's holding regarding the deliberate bypass standard.
112728,112573,McCleskey v. Zant,Mentioned,"In McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467 (1991), we held that the same standard used to excuse state procedural defaults should be applied in habeas corpus cases where abuse of the writ is claimed by the government.",The Acting Decision cites McCleskey as supportive precedent for applying consistent standards in habeas cases.
112728,105074,Brown v. Allen,Distinguished,This was necessary because Brown was inconsistent with the holding of Townsend regarding habeas petitioners who failed to adequately develop federal claims in state-court proceedings.,The Acting Decision distinguishes Brown by noting its inconsistency with Townsend's approach to developing federal claims.
112728,109717,Wainwright v. Sykes,Mentioned,"In Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72 (1977), we rejected the application of Fay's standard of 'knowing waiver' or 'deliberate bypass' to excuse a petitioner's failure to comply with a state contemporaneous-objection rule",The Acting Decision cites Wainwright as supportive precedent for rejecting the deliberate bypass standard.
112728,111727,Murray v. Carrier,Mentioned,"We noted in Murray, a procedural default case, that objective factors external to the defense may impede counsel's efforts to comply",The Acting Decision cites Murray to explain what constitutes cause under the cause-and-prejudice standard.
112728,556624,Jose Tamayo-Reyes v. J.C. Keeney,Reversed,"We reverse. Because the holding of Townsend v. Sain that Fay v. Noia's deliberate bypass standard is applicable in a case like this had not been reversed, it is quite understandable that the Court of Appeals applied that standard in this case.",The Acting Decision explicitly reverses the Court of Appeals' decision in this case.
112728,111235,Reed v. Ross,Mentioned,"We have consistently reaffirmed that the 'cause-and-prejudice' standard embodies the correct accommodation between the competing concerns implicated in a federal court's habeas power. Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S. 1, 11 (1984)",The Acting Decision cites Reed as supporting precedent for the cause-and-prejudice standard.
112728,109439,Francis v. Henderson,Mentioned,"In Francis v. Henderson, 425 U. S. 536 (1976), we acknowledged a federal court's power to entertain an application for habeas even where the claim has been procedurally waived in state proceedings",The Acting Decision cites Francis as precedent for applying the cause-and-prejudice standard in procedural default cases.
112739,109615,"Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady (1977)",Distinguished,"Complete Auto rejected Freeman and Spector's formal distinction between 'direct' and 'indirect' taxes on interstate commerce because that formalism allowed the validity of statutes to hinge on 'legal terminology,' 'draftsmanship and phraseology.' Bellas Hess did not rely on any such labeling of taxes and therefore did not automatically fall with Freeman and its progeny.","The Court distinguishes Complete Auto by explaining that while it rejected certain formalistic distinctions, its holding did not invalidate the physical presence rule from Bellas Hess which was based on different reasoning."
112739,1591860,State Ex Rel. Heitkamp v. Quill Corp. (1991),Reversed,"Having granted certiorari, 502 U.S. 808, we must either reverse the State Supreme Court or overrule Bellas Hess. While we agree with much of the state court's reasoning, we take the former course.",The Court explicitly reverses the North Dakota Supreme Court's decision that had declined to follow Bellas Hess.
112739,107425,"National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue (1967)",Limited,"Thus, to the extent that our decisions have indicated that the Due Process Clause requires physical presence in a State for the imposition of duty to collect a use tax, we overrule those holdings as superseded by developments in the law of due process... [However] the Commerce Clause holding of Bellas Hess should not be overruled.","The Court partially overrules Bellas Hess's due process holding while retaining its Commerce Clause holding, thus limiting its precedential scope."
112739,109630,National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization (1977),Distinguished,"In National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U.S. 551, 559 (1977), we affirmed the continuing vitality of Bellas Hess' 'sharp distinction between mail-order sellers with [a physical presence in the taxing] State and those who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business.'","The Court distinguishes National Geographic by noting it involved a company with physical presence in the state, unlike the pure mail-order scenario in this case."
112739,110563,Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana (1981),Mentioned,"See also Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U.S. 609, 626 (1981)","The case is merely cited as part of a string citation discussing the nexus requirement, without any significant analysis or treatment."
112739,112066,"D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara (1988)",Distinguished,"In D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U.S. 24, 33 (1988), for example, we distinguished Bellas Hess on the basis of the company's 'significant economic presence in Louisiana, its many connections with the State, and the direct benefits it receives from Louisiana in conducting its business.'","The Court notes how D.H. Holmes involved different facts with significant in-state presence, unlike the present case."
112739,105829,Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota (1959),Mentioned,"By the time the Court decided Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U.S. 450 (1959), Justice Rutledge was no longer on the Court, but his view of the nexus requirement as grounded in the Due Process Clause was decisively adopted.","The case is cited as historical context for the development of nexus doctrine, without significant analysis of its holding."
112739,110927,Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Public Service Commission (1983),Distinguished,"Notwithstanding the benefits of bright-line tests, we have, in some situations, decided to replace such tests with more contextual balancing inquiries. For example, in Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 461 U.S. 375 (1983), we reconsidered a bright-line test set forth in Public Util. Comm'n of R. I. v. Attleboro Steam & Electric Co.",The Court distinguishes Arkansas Electric by explaining why the reasons for abandoning the bright-line test in that case don't apply to the present situation.
117931,105287,United States v. Bramblett,Overruled,Bramblett is hereby overruled. We hold that a federal court is neither a 'department' nor an 'agency' within the meaning of § 1001.,"The Court explicitly overrules Bramblett, finding its interpretation of §1001 was erroneous and created unacceptable consequences that could only be avoided through irrational limitations."
117931,112296,Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,Mentioned,"Stare decisis has special force when legislators or citizens 'have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response.'",The Court cites Patterson to explain the doctrine of stare decisis and when it may be appropriate to overrule precedent.
117931,258536,Morgan v. United States,Mentioned,"First suggested over 30 years ago in Morgan v. United States, 309 F. 2d 234 (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), this doctrine limits the extent to which § 1001 reaches conduct occurring in the federal courts.","The Court discusses Morgan as historically significant for first suggesting the judicial function exception, but does not criticize or endorse its reasoning."
117931,276778,United States v. Erhardt,Mentioned,"Relying on Morgan, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a conviction several years later 'because § 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents as evidence in a criminal proceeding.'","The Court cites Erhardt as an example of how courts have applied the judicial function exception, without evaluating its correctness."
117931,109680,Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois,Mentioned,"Respect for precedent is strongest 'in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation.'",The Court cites Illinois Brick to acknowledge the importance of stare decisis in statutory interpretation cases.
117931,101894,Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.,Mentioned,"'Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.'","The Court cites Justice Brandeis' dissent in Burnet to explain the importance of stare decisis, particularly in statutory interpretation cases."
117958,101414,Sinclair v. United States,Overruled,"But the reasoning of Sinclair has already been repudiated in a number of respects... Whatever support it gave to the validity of those decisions was obiter dicta, and may properly be disregarded.",The Acting Decision explicitly rejects and overrules Sinclair's reasoning and holding that materiality is a question of law for the judge rather than a question for the jury.
117958,112848,United States v. Olano,Mentioned,"As to the latter, in United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993), the Court noted the limitations on 'plain error' review by the courts of appeals under Rule 52(b).","The Acting Decision merely references Olano to discuss the standards for plain error review, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
117958,673512,United States v. Michael E. Gaudin,Mentioned,"The Court today has no occasion to review the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the constitutional error here 'cannot be harmless.' 28 F. 3d, at 951.",The Acting Decision simply references the lower court's ruling without any significant discussion or treatment.
117958,112868,Sullivan v. Louisiana,Mentioned,"As a result, '[t]he prosecution bears the burden of proving all elements of the offense charged and must persuade the factfinder beyond a reasonable doubt of the facts necessary to establish each of those elements.' Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 277-278 (1993)","The Acting Decision cites Sullivan supportively to establish basic principles about burden of proof, without any negative treatment."
117958,109698,Patterson v. New York,Mentioned,"Within broad constitutional bounds, legislatures have flexibility in defining the elements of a criminal offense. See Patterson v. New York, 432 U.S. 197, 210 (1977).","The Acting Decision cites Patterson to support a general principle about legislative authority, without any criticism or distinction."
117958,94082,Sparf v. United States,Distinguished,"Sparf, supra, the case on which the Government relies, had nothing to do with the issue before us here. The question there was whether the jury could be deprived of the power to determine, not only historical facts, not only mixed questions of fact and law, but pure questions of law in a criminal case.",The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes Sparf as dealing with a different issue than the one at hand.
117958,112052,Kungys v. United States,Distinguished,"But as we have observed, the characterization of a mixed question of law and fact for one purpose does not govern its characterization for all purposes. It is hard to imagine questions more diverse than, on the one hand, whether an appellate court must remand to a district court for a determination of materiality in a denaturalization proceeding (Kungys) and, on the other hand, whether the Constitution requires the finding of the element of materiality in a criminal prosecution to be made by the jury.",The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes Kungys as dealing with a fundamentally different context and purpose than the current case.
112906,92534,Nielsen (1889),Distinguished,"Justice Souter has apparently been led astray by his misinterpretation of the word 'incidents' in the following passage of Nielsen... What it obviously means, however, is element.","The Acting Decision distinguishes Nielsen by arguing that its use of 'incidents' referred to elements of crimes rather than conduct, rejecting the broader interpretation advocated by the dissent."
112906,112432,Grady v. Corbin,Overruled,"We have concluded, however, that Grady must be overruled. Unlike Blockburger analysis, whose definition of what prevents two crimes from being the 'same offence,' U.S. Const., Amdt. 5, has deep historical roots and has been accepted in numerous precedents of this Court, Grady lacks constitutional roots.","The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Grady, finding it lacks historical foundation and contradicts established double jeopardy precedents."
112906,109695,Brown v. Ohio,Distinguished,"There is, for example, no other way to read the following passage in Illinois v. Vitale, quoted by Justice Souter: '[In Harris] we treated a killing in the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense, and the robbery as a species of lesser-included offense.'",The Acting Decision distinguishes Brown by characterizing it as merely applying the lesser-included offense doctrine rather than establishing a broader double jeopardy principle.
112906,96689,Grafton v. United States,Distinguished,"Since military status was not an element of Grafton's charged offense, it is not true that our analysis would produce a result contrary to the opinion in Grafton.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Grafton by explaining that its holding was based on different factual circumstances regarding the elements of the charged offenses.
112906,109736,Harris v. Oklahoma,Limited,"The Court has even gone so far as to say that Harris simply applies the common proposition, entirely in accord with Blockburger, that prosecution for a greater offense (cohabitation, defined to require proof of adultery) bars prosecution for a lesser included offense (adultery).",The Acting Decision limits Harris by interpreting it as merely applying the traditional Blockburger test for lesser included offenses rather than establishing a broader principle.
112906,110307,Illinois v. Vitale,Distinguished,"Despite his bold assertion to the contrary, Vitale unquestionably reads Harris as merely an application of the double jeopardy bar to lesser and greater included offenses.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Vitale by rejecting interpretations that it supported a broader same-conduct test beyond the Blockburger analysis.
112906,111893,Young v. United States Ex Rel. Vuitton Et Fils S. A.,Mentioned,"We explained in Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U. S. 787 (1987): 'The fact that we have come to regard criminal contempt as a crime in the ordinary sense, does not mean that any prosecution of contempt must now be considered an execution of the criminal law.'",The Acting Decision merely references Young to provide background on the nature of contempt proceedings.
112906,97395,Gavieres v. United States,Mentioned,"In both Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S., at 343, and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), the Court upheld subsequent prosecutions after concluding that the Blockburger test (and only the Blockburger test) was satisfied.",The Acting Decision cites Gavieres as historical support for applying only the Blockburger test in successive prosecution cases.
112906,96480,Burton v. United States,Mentioned,"In both Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S., at 343, and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), the Court upheld subsequent prosecutions after concluding that the Blockburger test (and only the Blockburger test) was satisfied.",The Acting Decision cites Burton as historical support for applying only the Blockburger test in successive prosecution cases.
112906,107686,Bloom v. Illinois,Mentioned,"We have held that constitutional protections for criminal defendants other than the double jeopardy provision apply in nonsummary criminal contempt prosecutions just as they do in other criminal prosecutions. See, e.g., Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 194, 201 (1968).",The Acting Decision references Bloom to establish that constitutional protections apply to nonsummary criminal contempt proceedings.
112906,105594,Green v. United States,Mentioned,"The Double Jeopardy Clause prevents the government from 'mak[ing] repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity.' Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187 (1957).",The Acting Decision cites Green to explain the general purposes and protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause.
117947,110338,Fullilove v. Klutznick,Limited,"Of course, it follows that to the extent (if any) that Fullilove held federal racial classifications to be subject to a less rigorous standard, it is no longer controlling. But we need not decide today whether the program upheld in Fullilove would survive strict scrutiny as our more recent cases have defined it.",The Acting Decision explicitly limits Fullilove's precedential value by rejecting its less rigorous standard for federal racial classifications and requiring strict scrutiny instead.
117947,112176,City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co.,Mentioned,"With Croson, the Court finally agreed that the Fourteenth Amendment requires strict scrutiny of all race-based action by state and local governments.","The Acting Decision references Croson to establish historical context and build upon its precedent, without criticizing or limiting it."
117947,112484,"Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. Federal Communications Commission",Overruled,"To the extent that Metro Broadcasting is inconsistent with that holding, it is overruled.",The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Metro Broadcasting's holding that federal racial classifications need only satisfy intermediate scrutiny.
117947,111669,Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education,Mentioned,"In Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U. S. 267 (1986), the Court considered a Fourteenth Amendment challenge to another form of remedial racial classification.","The Acting Decision cites Wygant as part of the historical development of equal protection doctrine, without modifying or criticizing it."
117947,109930,Regents of the University of California v. Bakke,Mentioned,"Bakke did not produce an opinion for the Court, but Justice Powell's opinion announcing the Court's judgment rejected the argument.","The Acting Decision references Bakke to trace the development of equal protection doctrine, without modifying or criticizing its holdings."
117947,103875,Hirabayashi v. United States,Mentioned,"It follows from that principle that all governmental action based on race — a group classification long recognized as 'in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited,' Hirabayashi, 320 U. S., at 100","The Acting Decision cites Hirabayashi to support its reasoning about racial classifications, without criticizing or modifying its precedential value."
117947,105222,Bolling v. Sharpe,Mentioned,"In Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497 (1954), the Court for the first time explicitly questioned the existence of any difference between the obligations of the Federal Government and the States to avoid racial classifications.","The Acting Decision references Bolling as historical precedent supporting its analysis, without modifying or criticizing it."
117947,1879640,"Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner",Reversed,"The District Court granted the Government's motion for summary judgment. Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner, 790 F. Supp. 240 (1992).",The Acting Decision reverses the lower court's grant of summary judgment by vacating the judgment and remanding for further proceedings.
117947,109469,Washington v. Davis,Mentioned,"We note, incidentally, that this case concerns only classifications based explicitly on race, and presents none of the additional difficulties posed by laws that, although facially race neutral, result in racially disproportionate impact and are motivated by a racially discriminatory purpose. See generally Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252 (1977); Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229 (1976).",The Acting Decision merely references Washington v. Davis to distinguish it from the present case.
117947,104040,Korematsu v. United States,Criticized,Korematsu demonstrates vividly that even 'the most rigid scrutiny' can sometimes fail to detect an illegitimate racial classification,The Acting Decision criticizes Korematsu as an example of how even strict scrutiny can fail to prevent discriminatory racial classifications.
117947,111827,United States v. Paradise,Mentioned,"As recently as 1987, for example, every Justice of this Court agreed that the Alabama Department of Public Safety's 'pervasive, systematic, and obstinate discriminatory conduct' justified a narrowly tailored race-based remedy.","The Acting Decision cites Paradise as an example of when race-based remedies may be appropriate, without modifying or criticizing its holding."
118149,107615,Albrecht v. Herald Co.,Overruled,"We conclude that Albrecht should be overruled... After reconsidering Albrecht's rationale and the substantial criticism the decision has received, however, we conclude that there is insufficient economic justification for per se invalidation of vertical maximum price fixing.","The Court explicitly overrules Albrecht, finding its theoretical underpinnings weak and its economic justifications insufficient for maintaining a per se rule against vertical maximum price fixing."
118149,109716,Continental T. v. Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.,Mentioned,"Nine years later, in Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 438 U. S. 36 (1977), the Court overruled Schwinn, thereby rejecting application of a per se rule in the context of vertical nonprice restrictions.","The Court references GTE Sylvania as precedent for overturning previous per se rules in antitrust cases, using it to support its current analysis."
118149,725024,"Barkat U. Khan and Khan & Associates, Inc. v. State Oil Company",Mentioned,"As Chief Judge Posner wrote for the Court of Appeals in this case: 'As for maximum resale price fixing, unless the supplier is a monopsonist he cannot squeeze his dealers' margins below a competitive level'","The Court cites the lower court's opinion to discuss the economic reasoning behind its current decision, without criticizing or modifying it."
118149,112425,Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co.,Mentioned,"Most recently, in ARCO, 495 U. S. 328 (1990), although Albrecht's continuing validity was not squarely before the Court, some disfavor with that decision was signaled by our statement that we would 'assume, arguendo, that Albrecht correctly held that vertical, maximum price fixing is subject to the per se rule.'",The Court references ARCO to show the historical development of its skepticism toward Albrecht's per se rule.
118149,110747,Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society,Mentioned,We noted in Maricopa County that vertical restraints are generally more defensible than horizontal restraints.,"The Court cites Maricopa County to support its analysis of vertical restraints, without questioning or modifying its precedential value."
118149,107491,"United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co.",Mentioned,"In Schwinn, the Court acknowledged that some vertical restrictions, such as the conferral of territorial rights or franchises, could have procompetitive benefits by allowing smaller enterprises to compete","The Court references Schwinn to provide historical context for the development of vertical restraint doctrine, without criticizing or modifying it."
118155,112259,United States v. Halper,Overruled,Our opinion in United States v. Halper marked the first time we applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to a sanction without first determining that it was criminal in nature... We believe that Halper's deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered.,The Court explicitly disavows Halper's method of analysis and overrules its approach to determining whether a civil penalty constitutes punishment for double jeopardy purposes.
118155,106534,Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez,Mentioned,"In making this latter determination, the factors listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 168-169 (1963), provide useful guideposts",The Court positively references and relies on the Kennedy factors as the proper framework for analyzing whether a civil remedy constitutes criminal punishment.
118155,1087946,Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch,Distinguished,"In Kurth Ranch, we held that the presence of a deterrent purpose is not dispositive of the double jeopardy question. 511 U. S., at 781. Rather, we applied a Kennedy-like test","The Court distinguishes Kurth Ranch by explaining that it used a different analytical approach than Halper, one more aligned with the Kennedy factors."
118155,110331,United States v. Ward,Mentioned,"We hold that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is not a bar to the later criminal prosecution because the administrative proceedings were civil, not criminal. Our reasons for so holding in large part... reaffirm the previously established rule exemplified in United States v. Ward",The Court positively cites Ward as establishing the proper framework for analyzing civil versus criminal penalties.
118155,118052,United States v. Ursery,Mentioned,"Similarly, in Ursery, we rejected the notion that civil in rem forfeitures violate the Double Jeopardy Clause",The Court cites Ursery as supporting precedent for its analysis of civil versus criminal penalties.
118155,102987,Helvering v. Mitchell,Mentioned,"The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense, Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938)",The Court cites Helvering approvingly as establishing foundational double jeopardy principles.
118155,106087,Flemming v. Nestor,Mentioned,"While petitioners have been prohibited from further participating in the banking industry, this is 'certainly nothing approaching the infamous punishment' of imprisonment.' Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960)",The Court cites Flemming to support its analysis of what constitutes punishment under double jeopardy analysis.
118155,112906,United States v. Dixon,Mentioned,"This fact is insufficient to render the money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, 518 U. S., at 292, particularly in the double jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704 (1993)",The Court cites Dixon as supporting precedent in its double jeopardy analysis.
118133,112887,Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District,Distinguished,"In Zobrest, however, we did not expressly or implicitly rely upon the basis Justice Souter now advances for distinguishing Ball and Aguilar. If we had thought that signers had no 'opportunity to inject religious content' into their translations, we would have had no reason to consult the record for evidence of inaccurate translations.","The Court distinguishes Zobrest's reasoning from Justice Souter's interpretation, explaining that Zobrest's holding was based on broader principles rather than the narrow distinction of a sign-language interpreter's role."
118133,111506,Aguilar v. Felton,Overruled,"Our conclusion is that Aguilar is not consistent with our subsequent Establishment Clause decisions and further conclude that, on the facts presented here, petitioners are entitled under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) to relief from the operation of the District Court's prospective injunction.","The Court explicitly overrules Aguilar, finding it inconsistent with subsequent Establishment Clause jurisprudence and no longer good law."
118133,111561,Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind,Distinguished,"In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), we held that the Establishment Clause did not bar a State from issuing a vocational tuition grant to a blind person who wished to use the grant to attend a Christian college and become a pastor, missionary, or youth director.","The Court uses Witters to distinguish between direct and indirect aid to religious institutions, showing how neutral aid programs can be constitutional."
118133,111505,School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball,Overruled,"Accordingly, we must acknowledge that Aguilar, as well as the portion of Ball addressing Grand Rapids' Shared Time program, are no longer good law.","The Court explicitly overrules portions of Ball that dealt with the Shared Time program, finding them inconsistent with current Establishment Clause jurisprudence."
118133,108380,Lemon v. Kurtzman,Distinguished,"To be sure, the general principles we use to evaluate whether government aid violates the Establishment Clause have not changed since Aguilar was decided... What has changed since we decided Ball and Aguilar is our understanding of the criteria used to assess whether aid to religion has an impermissible effect.",The Court distinguishes Lemon's basic framework while modifying how its principles are applied in practice.
118133,438842,"Felton v. Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed.",Mentioned,"Certainly, no evidence has ever shown that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students. National Coalition for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Harris, 489 F. Supp. 1248, 1262, 1267 (SDNY 1980); Felton v. Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed., 739 F. 2d, at 53",The Court merely references Felton as part of the procedural history and factual background of the case.
118133,117870,Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet,Distinguished,"We also agree with respondents that the statements made by five Justices in Kiryas Joel do not, in themselves, furnish a basis for concluding that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has changed.",The Court distinguishes Kiryas Joel by explaining that individual Justice's statements about overruling Aguilar did not constitute an actual change in law.
118133,109251,Meek v. Pittenger,Criticized,"First, we have abandoned the presumption erected in Meek and Ball that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion.",The Court criticizes and rejects Meek's presumption about public employees in religious schools.
118133,112679,Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail,Distinguished,"In Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail, supra, at 384, we held that it is appropriate to grant a Rule 60(b)(5) motion when the party seeking relief from an injunction or consent decree can show 'a significant change either in factual conditions or in law.'",The Court distinguishes Rufo's standard for Rule 60(b)(5) relief while applying it to the current case.
118133,117967,Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of University of Virginia,Mentioned,"Aguilar has in any event been undermined by subsequent Establishment Clause decisions, including Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993), and Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995)",The Court merely mentions Rosenberger as one of several cases that contributed to undermining Aguilar.
118133,112138,Bowen v. Kendrick,Distinguished,"For example, we continue to ask whether the government acted with the purpose of advancing or inhibiting religion, and the nature of that inquiry has remained largely unchanged. See Witters, 474 U. S., at 485-486; Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 602-604 (1988)",The Court distinguishes Bowen to show how certain aspects of Establishment Clause analysis remain unchanged while others have evolved.
118428,99610,Evans v. Gore,Overruled,"We now overrule Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before enactment of the tax.","The Court explicitly overrules Evans, adopting instead Justice Holmes' dissenting view that nondiscriminatory taxes do not violate the Compensation Clause, and finding that Evans' reasoning cannot be reconciled with subsequent jurisprudence."
118428,103214,O'MALLEY v. Woodrough,Distinguished,"Taken together, these four characteristics reveal a law that is very different from the 'non-discriminatory' tax that O'Malley upheld.","The Court distinguishes O'Malley by explaining that while O'Malley permitted nondiscriminatory taxes on judges, the Social Security tax at issue here was discriminatory unlike the tax in O'Malley."
118428,110365,United States v. Will,Distinguished,"The Will Year One example, however, shows only that, in the circumstances, and unlike the case before us, the later salary increase was related to the earlier salary diminishment.","The Court distinguishes Will by explaining that unlike the present case, the salary increase in Will was directly related to offsetting the earlier diminishment in judicial compensation."
118428,702629,Hatter v. United States,Mentioned,"The Court of Appeals reversed, ordering summary judgment for the judges as to liability. 64 F. 3d 647 (1995).",The case is merely referenced as part of the procedural history without any substantive discussion of its precedential value.
118230,104079,House v. Mayo,Overruled,"Today's opinion permits review where Congress, with unmistakable clarity, has denied it. To reach this result, the Court ignores the obvious intent of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), Pub. L. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214, distorts the meaning of our own jurisdictional statute, 28 U. S. C. § 1254 (1), and overrules a 53-year-old precedent, House v. Mayo, 324 U. S. 42 (1945) (per curiam).",The Court explicitly overrules House v. Mayo's holding that the Court lacks statutory certiorari jurisdiction over denials of certificates of appealability.
118230,103707,Ex Parte Quirin,Distinguished,"Quirin held that a petition for habeas corpus constituted the institution of a suit, and that it was not necessary for the writ to issue for the matter to be considered a case or controversy. 317 U. S., at 24. [...] Petitioner's request for §2255 relief is analogous to a petition for habeas corpus, but his request for a COA is of a wholly different nature.","The Court distinguishes Quirin by explaining that while a habeas petition constitutes a case, a COA request is merely a procedural requirement and not a separate case."
118230,112643,Payne v. Tennessee,Mentioned,"Stare decisis is 'the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles, fosters reliance on judicial decisions, and contributes to the actual and perceived integrity of the judicial process.' Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U. S. 808, 827 (1991).","The Court cites Payne simply to explain the general principle of stare decisis, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
118230,111885,Gray v. Mississippi,Criticized,"Gray, however, did not deny stare decisis effect to an opinion rendered without full briefing and argument — it accorded stare decisis effect. Id., at 666-667. What the Court relies upon is the mere dictum, rendered in the course of this opinion (and dictum in a footnote, at that)","The dissent criticizes the majority's reliance on Gray, arguing that it misinterprets Gray's holding and improperly relies on mere dictum from a footnote."
118317,118011,Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida,Distinguished,"While specifying that Congress cannot, in the exercise of its Article I powers, 'abrogate unilaterally the States' immunity from suit,' 517 U. S., at 59, it left open the scope of the term 'unilaterally' by referring to Parden, without criticism, as standing for the 'unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that the States may waive their sovereign immunity.'","The Acting Decision distinguishes Seminole Tribe by noting that while it prohibited unilateral abrogation of state immunity, it left open the possibility of state waiver of immunity, showing these are separate concepts."
118317,108763,Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health,Distinguished,"The Court in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U.S. 279 (1973), for example, discussed whether Congress had, or had not, 'lift[ed]' sovereign immunity, not whether it could, or could not, have done so.",The Acting Decision distinguishes Employees as dealing with a different issue (whether Congress had lifted immunity) rather than whether Congress had the power to do so.
118317,106821,Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama State Docks Department,Overruled,Whatever may remain of our decision in Parden is expressly overruled.,"The Acting Decision explicitly overrules Parden, rejecting its doctrine of constructive waiver of state sovereign immunity."
118317,111949,Welch v. Texas Department of Highways & Public Transportation,Mentioned,"'We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.'","The Acting Decision merely references Welch to show its treatment of earlier precedent, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
118317,111503,Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,Mentioned,"Later case law, suggesting that a waiver may be found in a State's acceptance of a federal grant, see Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 247 (1985), supports Parden's conclusion.","The Acting Decision simply references Atascadero as an example of case law dealing with state waiver of immunity, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
118317,112291,Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.,Mentioned,"'All congressional creations of private rights of action attach recovery to the defendant's commission of some act, or possession of some status, in a field where Congress has authority to regulate conduct.'","The Acting Decision cites Union Gas merely to illustrate a point about congressional regulation, without criticizing or distinguishing it."
118317,110880,"White v. Massachusetts Council of Construction Employers, Inc.",Distinguished,"The 'market participant' cases from our dormant Commerce Clause jurisprudence, relied upon by the United States, are inapposite.",The Acting Decision explicitly distinguishes White and other market participant cases as inapplicable to sovereign immunity analysis.
118317,105513,California v. Taylor,Mentioned,"Cf. California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553, 566 (1957)",The Acting Decision merely references Taylor in a citation without substantive discussion or criticism.
118317,109520,Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,Mentioned,"First, Congress may authorize such a suit in the exercise of its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment — an Amendment enacted after the Eleventh Amendment and specifically designed to alter the federal-state balance. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445 (1976).","The Acting Decision cites Fitzpatrick simply to acknowledge established precedent about Congress's Fourteenth Amendment powers, without criticism or distinction."
118273,111516,Oregon Department of Fish & Wildlife v. Klamath Indian Tribe,Distinguished,"The State argues that any 1837 Treaty rights, or to usufructuary rights more generally, the second sentence of Article 1 nevertheless abrogates those rights. But to determine whether this language abrogates Chippewa Treaty rights, we look beyond the written words to the larger context that frames the Treaty, including 'the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties.'","The Acting Decision distinguishes Klamath by explaining that unlike in Klamath, the historical context and treaty negotiations in this case do not support treaty rights abrogation."
118273,96304,United States v. Winans,Mentioned,"We interpret Indian treaties to give effect to the terms as the Indians themselves would have understood them. See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 675-676 (1979); United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 380-381 (1905).",The Acting Decision cites Winans as supporting precedent for the principle of interpreting treaties as the Indians would have understood them.

Howard,Limited,"events since 1961 show that Congress has refused to extend the benefits of Monroe to school boards and has attempted to allow awards of attorney's fees against local governments even though Monroe, City of Kenosha v. Bruno, and Aldinger v. Howard, 427 U.S. 1 (1976), have made the joinder of such governments impossible.",The Court limits Aldinger's effect by noting that Congress has acted contrary to its holding regarding municipal liability.
