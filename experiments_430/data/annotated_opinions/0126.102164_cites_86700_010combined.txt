**Combined Opinion**
 The petitioner was twice tried and convicted in a federal district court upon an indictment for conspiracy to Violate the prohibition law. His conviction on the first trial was reversed by the circuit court of appeals upon a ground not material here.  46 F. (2d) 417.  Upon the second trial, as upon the first, defendant called his wife to testify in his behalf.  At both trials she was excluded upon the ground of incompetency.  The circuit court of appeals sustained this ruling upon the first appeal, and also upon the appeal which followed the second trial. 66 F. (2d) 70.  We granted certiorari, limited to the question as to what law is applicable to the determination of the competency of the wife of the petitioner as a' witness.  Both the petitioner and the government, in presenting the case here, put their chief reliance on prior decisions of this court. The government relies on United States v. Reid, <citedDecision>12 How. 361</citedDecision> ; Logan v. United States, 144 U.S. 263 ; Hendrix v. United States, 219 U.S. 79 ; and Jin Fuey Moy *374 v. United States, 254 U.S. 189 .  Petitioner contends that these cases, if not directly contrary to the decisions in Benson v. United States, 146 U.S. 325 , and Rosen v. United States, 245 U.S. 467 , are so in principle.  We shall first briefly review these cases, with the exception of the Hendrix case and the Jin Fuey Moy case, which we leave for consideration until a later point in this opinion.  In the <citedDecision>Reid</citedDecision> case, two persona had been jointly indicted for a murder committed upon the high seas.  They were tried separately, and it was held that one of them was not a competent witness in behalf of the other who' was first tried.  The trial was had in Virginia; and by a statute of that state passed in 1849, if applicable in a federal court, the evidence would have been competent.  Section 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 declares that the laws of the several states, except where the Constitution, treaties or statutes of the United States otherwise provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the .  United States in cases where they apply; but the court said that this referred only to civil cases and did not apply in the trial of criminal offenses against the United States.  It was conceded that there was no act of Congress prescribing in express words the rule by which the federal courts would be governed in the admission of testimony in criminal cases. “ But,” the court said (p. 363), “ we think ft may be found with sufficient certainty, not indeed in direct terms, but by necessary implication, in the acts of 1789 and 1790, establishing the courts of the United States, and providing' for the punishment of certain offences.” .  The court pointed out that the Judiciary Act regulated certain proceedings to be had prior, to impaneling the jury, but contained no express provision concerning the mode of conducting the trial after the jury was sworn, and prescribed no rule in respect of the testimony to be taken.

 The indictment was for an offense committed in Texas and there tried.  The decision was based not upon any statute of the United States, but upon the ground that the subject “ is governed by the common law, which, as has been’ seen, was the law of Texas ... at the time of the admission of Texas into the Union as a State;” (p. 303.) We next consider the two cases upon which petitioner relies.  In the Benson case two persons were jointly indicted for murder.  On motion of the government th$re was a severance, and' Benson was first tried.  His codefendant was called as a witness on behalf of the government.  The <citedDecision>Reid</citedDecision> case had been cited as practically de *376 cisive of the question.  But the court; after pointing out what it conceived to be distinguishing features in that case, said (p. 335), “We do not feél ourselves, therefore, precluded by that case from examining this question in the light of general authority and sound reason.” The allegéd incompetency of the codefendant was rested upon two reasons, first, that he was interested, and second, that he was a party to the record, the basis for the exclusion at common law being fear of perjury.  “Nor,” the court said, “were those named the'only grounds of exclusion from the witness stand; conviction of crime; want of religious belief, and other matters were held sufficient., Indeed, the theory of the common law was to.admit to the witness stand only those presumably honest, appreciating the sanctity of .an oath, unaffected .as a party by the result, and free from any of the temptations of interest.  The courts were afraid to triist the intelligence of jurors.  But the last fifty years have wrought a great change in these respects, and to-day the tendency is to enlarge- the domain of competency and to subrqit to, the jury for their consideration as to the credibility of the witness those matters which heretofore were ruled sufficient to justify his exclusion.  This change has been wrought partially by legislation and.  partially by judicial construction.” Attention then is called ,to the fact that Congress in 1864 had enacted'that no witness, should be excluded from ' testifying in any civil action, with certain exceptions, because he was a party to or interested in the issue tried; and that in 1878 (c. 37, 20 Stat. 30 ) Congress made the defendant in any criminal case a competent witness at his own request.

 .  If interest and being party to the record do not exclude a defendant on trial from the witness stand, upon what reasoning can a .codefendant not on trial, be adjudged incompetent?  ” That case was decided December 5, 1892.  Twenty-five years later this court had before it for consideration the case of Rosen v. United States, supra. Rosen had been tried and convicted in a federal district court for conspiracy.  A person jointly indicted with Rosen, who had been convicted upon his plea of guilty, was called as 'a witness by the government and allowed to testify over Rosen’s objection.  This court sustained the- competency of the witness.  After saying that while the decision in the <citedDecision>Reid</citedDecision> case had not been specifically overruled, its authority was seriously shaken by the decisions in both the Logan and Benson cases, the court proceeded to dispose of the question, as it had been disposed of'in the Benson case, “ in the light of general authority and sound reason.” “ In the almost twenty [twenty-five] years,” the court said [pp. 471, 472], “ which have elapsed since the decision of the Benson Case, the disposition of courts and of legislative bodies to remove disabilities from witnesses has continued, as that decision shows it had been going forward before, under dominance of the conviction of our time that the truth is more likely to be arrived at by hearing the testimony of all persons of competent understanding who may seem to have knowledge of the facts involved in a case, leaving the credit and weight of such testimony to be determined by the jury or by the court, rather than by rejecting witnesses as incompetent, with *378 the result that this principle has come to be widely, almost universally, accepted in this country and in Great Britain.  “ Since the decision in the Benson Case we have significant evidence of the trend of congressional opinion upon this subject in the removal of the disability of witnesses convicted of perjury, Rev. Stats., § 5392, by the enactment of the Federal Criminal Code in 1909 with this provision omitted and § 5392 repealed.  This is significant, because the disability to testify, of persons convicted of perjury, survived in some jurisdictions much longer than many of the other common-law disabilities, for the reason that the offense concerns directly the giving of testimony in a court of justice, and conviction of it was accepted as showing a greater disregard for the truth than it was thought should be implied from a conviction of other crime.  “ Satisfied as we are that the legislation and the very great weight of judicial authority which have developed in support of this modem rule, especially ás applied to the competency of witnesses convicted of crime, proceed upon sound, principle, we conclude that the dead hand of the common-law rule of 1789 should no longer be applied to such cases as we have here, and that the ruling of the lower courts on this first claim of error should be approved.” It is well to pause at this point to state a little more concisely what was held in these cases. It will be noted, in the- first place, that the decision in the <citedDecision>Reid</citedDecision> case was not based upon any express statutory .provision.  The court found from what the congressional legislation omitted to say, as well as from what it actually said, that in establishing the federal courts in 1789 some definite rule in respect of the testimony to be taken in criminal cases must have been in the mind of Congress; and the rule which the court thought was in the mind of that body was that of the common law as it existed in the thirteen original *379 states in 1789.  The Logan case in part rejected that view and held that the controlling rule was that of the common law in force at the time of the admission of the state in which the particular trial was had.  Taking the two cases together, it is plain enough that the ultimate doctrine announced is that in the taking of testimony in criminal cases, the federal courts are bound by the rules of the common law as they existed at a definitely specified time in the respective states, unless Congress has otherwise provided.  With the conclusion that the controlling rule is that of the common law, the Benson case and the Rosen case do not conflict; but both cases reject the notion, which the two earlier ones seem to accept, that the courts, in the face of greatly changed conditions, are still chained to the ancient formulae and are powerless to declare and enforce modifications deemed to have been wrought in the common law itself by force of these changed conditions.  Thüs, as we have seen, the court in the Benson case pointed to the tendency during the preceding years to enlarge the domain of competency, significantly saying that the changes had been wrought not only by legislation but also “ partially by judicial construction ”; and that it was the spirit (not the letter, be it observed) of this legislation which had controlled the decisions of the courts and' steadily removed the merely technical barriers in respect of incompetency, until generally no one was excluded from giving testimony, except under certain peculiar conditions which are set forth.  It seems difficult to escape the conclusion that the specific ground upon which the court there rested its determination as to the competency of a codefendant was that, since the defendant had been rendered competent, the competency of .the codefendant followed as a natural consequence.
