**Dissenting Opinion**
Seagoing vessels have always been taxable at the domicile of the owner. Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, 222 U. S. 63; Morgan v. Parham, 16 Wall. 471; Hays v. Pacific. Mail S. S. Co., 17 How. 596. This same rule has been applied to vessels, engaged in commerce between the different states. Transportation Co. v. Wheeling, 99 U. S. 273; St. Louis v. Ferry Co., <targetCase>11 Wall. 423</targetCase>. The only exception to the rule until today was that where vessels had acquired a situs for taxation in some other state, that other state might tax them. Old Dominion S. S. Co. v. Virginia, 198 U. S. 299 In Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky, 202 U. S. 409, 421, this Court said: “The general rule has long been settled as. to yessels plying between the ports of different States, engaged in the coastwise trade, that the domicil óf the owner is the situs of a vessel for the purpose of taxation, wholly irrespective of the place of enrollment, subject, however, to the exceptiQn that where a vessel. *386 engaged in interstate commerce has acquired an actual situs in a State other than the. place of the domicil of the owner, it may there-be taxed because within the jurisdiction of the taxing authority.” In the case at hand, the vessels had not acquired a situs for taxation in any other state. They were at large in the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, touching ports therein from time to time, There was no showing as to how much timé any of the vessels spent in any state.
