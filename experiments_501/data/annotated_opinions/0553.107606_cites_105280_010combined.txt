**Combined Opinion**
Mr. Justice Harlan delivered the opinion of the Court. Petitioner was convicted in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut under two indictments which charged violations of the federal wagering tax statutes.  The first indictment averred that petitioner and others conspired to evade payment of the annual occupational tax imposed by 26 U. S. C. § 4411 .  The second indictment included two counts: the first *41 alleged a willful failure to pay the occupational tax, and the second a willful failure to register, as required by 26 U. S. C. § 4412 , before engaging in the business of accepting wagers.  After verdict, petitioner unsuccessfully sought to arrest judgment, in part on the basis that the statutory obligations to register and to pay the occupational tax violated his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, 352 F. 2d 848 , on the authority of United States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22 , and Lewis v. United States, <citedDecision>348 U. S. 419</citedDecision> .  We granted certiorari to re-examine the constitutionality under the Fifth Amendment of the pertinent provisions of the wagering tax statutes, and more particularly to consider whether Kahriger and <citedDecision>Lewis</citedDecision> still have vitality.  1 383 U. S. 942 .  For reasons which follow, we have *42 concluded that these provisions may not be employed to punish criminally those persons who have defended a failure to comply with their requirements with a proper assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination.  The judgment below is accordingly reversed.  I.  The provisions in issue here are part of an interrelated statutory system for taxing wagers.  The system is broadly as follows.
**Combined Opinion**
 The Court in Sullivan was evidently concerned, first, that the claim before it was an unwarranted extension of the scope of the privilege, and, second, that to accept a claim of privilege not asserted at the time the return was due would “make the taxpayer rather than a tribunal the final arbiter of the merits of the claim.” Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70, 79 .  Neither reason suffices to prevent this petitioner’s assertion of the privilege.  The first is, as we have indicated, inapplicable, and we find the second unpersuasive in this situation.  Every element of these requirements would have served to incriminate petitioner; to have required him to present his claim to Treasury officers would have obliged him “to prove guilt to avoid admitting it.” United States v. Kahriger, supra, at 34 (concurring opinion).  In these circumstances, we cannot conclude that his failure *51 to assert the privilege to Treasury officials at the moment the tax payments were due irretrievably abandoned his constitutional protection.  Petitioner is under sentence for violation of statutory requirements which he consistently asserted at and after trial to be unconstitutional; no more can here be required.  The Court held in <citedDecision>Lewis</citedDecision> that the registration and occupational tax requirements do not infringe the constitutional privilege because they do not compel self-incrimination, but merely impose on the gambler the initial choice of whether he wishes, at the cost of his constitutional privilege, to commence wagering activities.  The Court reasoned that even if the required disclosures might prove incriminating, the gambler need not register or pay the occupational tax if only he elects to cease, or never to begin, gambling.  There is, the Court said, “no constitutional right to gamble.” <citedDecision>348 U. S., at 423</citedDecision> .  We find this reasoning no longer persuasive.  The question is not whether petitioner holds a “right” to violate state law, but whether, having done so, he may be compelled to give evidence against himself.  The constitutional privilege was intended to shield the guilty and imprudent as well as the innocent and foresigh ted; if such an inference of antecedent choice were alone enough to abrogate the privilege’s protection, it would be excluded from the situations in which it has historically been guaranteed, and withheld from those who most require it.  Such inferences, bottomed on what must ordinarily be a fiction, have precisely the infirmities which the Court has found in other circumstances in which implied or uninformed waivers of the privilege have been said to have occurred.  See, e. g., Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U. S. 506 .  Compare Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U. S. 458 ; and Glasser v. United States, 315 U. S. 60 .  To give credence to such “waivers” without the most deliberate examination of the circumstances surrounding them *52 would ultimately license widespread erosion of the privilege through “ingeniously drawn legislation/’ Morgan, The Privilege against Self-Incrimination, 34 Minn. L. Rev. 1 , 37.  We cannot agree that the constitutional privilege is meaningfully waived merely because those “inherently suspect of criminal activities” have been commanded either to cease wagering or to provide information incriminating to themselves, and have ultimately elected to do neither.  The Court held in both Kahriger and <citedDecision>Lewis</citedDecision> that the registration and occupational tax requirements are entirely prospective in their application, and that the constitutional privilege, since it offers protection only as to past and present acts, is accordingly unavailable.  This reasoning appears to us twice deficient: first, it overlooks the hazards here of incrimination as to past or present acts; and second, it is hinged upon an excessively narrow view of the scope of the constitutional privilege.  Substantial hazards of incrimination as to past or present acts plainly may stem from the requirements to register and to pay the occupational tax. See generally McKee, The Fifth Amendment and the Federal Gambling Tax, 5 Duke B. J. 86.  In the first place, satisfaction of those requirements increases the likelihood that any past or present gambling offenses will be discovered and successfully prosecuted.  It both centers attention upon the registrant as a gambler, and compels “injurious disclosure [s]” 11 which may provide or assist in the collection of evidence admissible in a prosecution for past or present offenses.  These offenses need not include actual gambling; they might involve only the custody or transportation of gambling paraphernalia, or other preparations for future gambling.  Further, the acquisition of a federal gambling tax stamp, *53 requiring as it does the declaration of a present intent to commence gambling activities, obliges even a prospective gambler to accuse himself of conspiracy to violate either state gambling prohibitions, or federal laws forbidding the use of interstate facilities for gambling purposes.  See, e. g., Acklen v. State, 196 Tenn. 314 , 267 S. W. 2d 101 .  There is a second, and more fundamental, deficiency in the reasoning of Kahriger and <citedDecision>Lewis</citedDecision> .  Its linchpin is plainly the premise that the privilege is entirely inapplicable to prospective acts; for this the Court in Kahriger could vouch as authority only a generalization at 8 Wig-more, Evidence § 2259c (3d ed. 1940).  12 We see no warrant for so rigorous a constraint upon the constitutional privilege.  History, to be sure, offers no ready illustrations of the privilege’s application to prospective acts, but the occasions on which such claims might appropriately have been made must necessarily have been very infrequent.  We are, in any event, bid to view the constitutional commands as “organic living institutions,” whose significance is “vital not formal.” Gompers v. United States, 233 U. S. 604, 610 .  The central standard for the privilege’s application has been whether the claimant is confronted by substantial and “real,” and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination.  Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367, 374 ; Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 600 .
**Combined Opinion**
 We conclude that it is not mere time to which the law must look, but the substantiality of the risks of incrimination.  The hazards of incrimination created by §§4411 and 4412 as to future acts are not trifling or imaginary.  Prospective registrants can reasonably expect that registration and payment of the occupational tax will significantly enhance the likelihood of their prosecution for future acts, and that it will readily provide evidence which will facilitate their convictions.  Indeed, they can reasonably fear that registration, and acquisition of a wagering tax stamp, may serve as decisive evidence that they have in fact subsequently violated state gambling prohibitions.  Compare Ala. Code, Tit. 14, §§ 302 (8)-(10) (1958); Ga. Code Ann. § 26-6413 (Supp. 1967).  Insubstantial claims of the privilege as to entirely prospective acts may certainly be asserted, but such claims are not here, and they need only be considered when a litigant has the temerity to pursue them.  We conclude that nothing in the Court’s opinions in Kahriger and <citedDecision>Lewis</citedDecision> now suffices to preclude petitioner’s assertion of the constitutional privilege as a defense to the indictments under which he was convicted.  To this extent Kahriger and <citedDecision>Lewis</citedDecision> are overruled.  *55 IY. We must next consider the relevance in this situation of the “required records” doctrine, Shapiro v. United States, 335 U. S. 1 .  It is necessary first to summarize briefly the circumstances in Shapiro .  Petitioner, a wholesaler of fruit and produce, was obliged by a regulation issued under the authority of the Emergency Price Control Act to keep and “preserve for examination” various records “of the same kind as he has customarily kept....” Maximum Price Regulation 426, § 14, 8 Fed. Reg. 9546 , 9548-9549 (1943).  He was subsequently directed by an administrative subpoena to produce certain of these records before attorneys of the Office of Price Administration.  Petitioner complied, but asserted his constitutional privilege.  In a prosecution for violations of the Price Control Act, petitioner urged that the records had facilitated the collection of evidence against him, and claimed immunity from prosecution under § 202 (g) of the Act, 56 Stat. 30 .
**Combined Opinion**
[For dissenting opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Warren, see post, p. 77.] 1 Certiorari was originally granted in Costello v. United States, 383 U. S. 942 , to consider these issues.  Upon Costello’s death, certiorari was granted in the present ease.  385 U. S. 1000 .  Mar-chetti and Costello, with others, were convicted at the same trial of identical offenses, arising from the same series of transactions.  Certiorari both here and in Costello was limited to the following questions: “Do not the federal wagering tax statutes here involved violate the petitioner’s privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment?  Should not this Court, especially in view of its recent decision in Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 382 U. S. 70 (1965), overrule United States v. Kahriger, 345 U. S. 22 (1953), and Lewis v. United States, <citedDecision>348 U. S. 419</citedDecision> (1955)?” After argument, the case was restored to the calendar, and set for reargument at the 1967 Term. 388 U. S. 903 .  Counsel were asked to argue, in addition to the original questions, the following: “(1) What relevance, if any, has the required records doctrine, Shapiro v. United States, 335 U. S. 1 , to the validity under the Fifth Amendment of the registration and special occupational tax requirements of 26 U. S. C. §§4411 , 4412?  (2) Can an obligation to pay the special occupational tax required by 26 U. S. C. § 4411 be satisfied without filing the registration statement provided for by 26 U. S. C. §4412 ?” 2 A July 1963 revision of Form 11-C modified the form of certain of its questions.  The record does not indicate which version of the return was available to petitioner at the time of the omissions for which he was convicted.  The minor verbal variations between the two do not affect the result which we reach today.  3 The Treasury Regulations provide that a stamp, evidencing payment of the occupational tax, may not be issued unless the taxpayer both submits Form 11-C and tenders the full amount of the tax. 26 CFR §44.4901-1 (c).  Accordingly, the Revenue Service has refused to accept the $50 tax unless it is accompanied by the completed registration form; and it has consistently been upheld in that practice.
