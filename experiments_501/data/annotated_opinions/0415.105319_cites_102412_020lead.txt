 Id., at 501.  A State that legislates concerning them is exercising traditional powers of sovereignty.  Cf. Watson v. Employers Liability Corp., 348 U. S. 66, 73 .  Arkansas therefore has a legitimate interest in opening her courts to suits of this nature, even though in this case Carroll’s injury may have cast no burden on her or on her institutions.  This is not a case like Hughes v. Fetter, 341 U. S. 609 , where the State of the forum seeks to exclude from its courts actions arising under a foreign statute.  In that case, we held that Wisconsin could not refuse to entertain a wrongful death action under an Illinois statute for an injury occurring in Illinois, since we found no sufficient policy considerations to warrant such refusal.  And see Broderick v. Rosner, <citedDecision>294 U. S. 629</citedDecision> .  The present case is a much weaker one for application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  Arkansas, the State of the forum, is not adopting any policy of hostility to the public Acts of Missouri.  It is choosing to apply its own rule of law to give affirmative relief for an action arising within its borders.  Missouri can make her Compensation Act exclusive, if she chooses, and enforce it as she pleases within her borders.  Once that policy is extended into other States, different considerations come into play.  Arkansas can adopt Missouri’s policy if she likes.
