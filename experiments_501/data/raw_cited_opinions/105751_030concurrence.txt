<judges id="AK-5">with whom Mr. Justice Black agrees,</judges>
<p id="A3E">concurring.</p>
<p id="b580-8">While I substantially agree with the opinion of the Court, I will state my reasons more fully and more explicitly.</p>
<p id="b580-9">I. The State by the device of the loyalty oath places the burden of proving loyalty on the citizen. That pro<page-number citation-index="1" label="533">*533</page-number>cedural device goes against the grain of our constitutional system, for every man is presumed innocent until guilt is established. This technique is an ancient one that was denounced in an early period of our history.</p>
<p id="b581-5">Alexander Hamilton, writing in 1784 under the name Phocion, said:</p>
<blockquote id="b581-6">“. . . let it be supposed that instead of the mode of indictment and trial by jury, the Legislature was to declare, that every citizen who did not swear he had never adhered to the King of Great Britain, should incur all the penalties which our treason laws prescribe. Would this not be ... a direct infringement of the Constitution? ... it is substituting a new and arbitrary mode of prosecution to • that ancient and highly esteemed one, recognized by the laws and the Constitution of the State, — I mean the trial by jury.” 4 The Works of Alexander Hamilton (Fed. ed. 1904) 269-270.</blockquote>
<p id="b581-7">Hamilton compared that hypothetical law to an actual one passed by New York on March 27, 1778, whereby a person who had served the King of England in enumerated ways was declared “to be utterly disabled disqualified and incapacitated to vote either by ballot or <em>viva voce </em>at any election” in New York. N. Y. Laws 1777-1784, 35. An oath was required<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in enforcement of that law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b582-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="534">*534</page-number>Hamilton called this “a subversion of one great principle of social security: to wit, that every man shall be presumed innocent until he is proved guilty.” 4 The Works of Alexander Hamilton (Fed. ed. 1904) 269. He went on to say “This was to invert the order of things; and, instead of obliging the State to prove the guilt in order to inflict the penalty, it was to oblige the citizen to establish his own innocence to avoid the penalty. It was to excite scruples in the honest and conscientious, and to hold out a bribe to perjury.” <em>Ibid.</em></p>
<p id="b583-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="535">*535</page-number>If the aim is to apprehend those who have lifted a hand against the Government, the procedure is unconstitutional.</p>
<p id="b583-4">If one conspires to overthrow the Government, he commits a crime. To make him swear he is innocent to avoid the consequences of a law is to put on him the burden of proving his innocence. That method does not square with our standards of procedural due process, as the opinion of the Court points out.</p>
<p id="b583-5">The Court in <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>4 Wall. 277, 328, denounced another expurgatory oath that had some of the vices of the present one.</p>
<blockquote id="b583-6">“The clauses in question subvert the presumptions of innocence, and alter the rules of evidence, which heretofore, under the universally recognized principles of the common law, have been supposed to be fundamental and- unchangeable. They assume that the parties are guilty; they call upon the parties to establish their innocence; and they declare that such innocence can be shown only in one way — by an inquisition, in the form of an expurgatory oath, into the consciences of the parties.”</blockquote>
<p id="b583-7">II. If the aim of the law is not to apprehend criminals but to penalize advocacy, it likewise must fall. Since the time that Alexander Hamilton wrote concerning these oaths, the Bill of Rights was adopted; and then much later came the Fourteenth Amendment. As a result of the latter a rather broad range of liberties was newly guaranteed to the citizen against state action. Included were those contained in the First Amendment — the right to speak freely, the right to believe what one chooses, the right of conscience. <em>Stromberg </em>v. <em>California, </em>283 U. S. 359; <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>319 U. S. 105; <em>Staub </em>v. <em>City of Baxley, </em>355 U. S. 313. Today what one thinks or believes, what one utters and says have the full protection <page-number citation-index="1" label="536">*536</page-number>of the First Amendment. It is only his actions that government may examine and penalize. When we allow government to probe his beliefs and withhold from him some of the privileges of citizenship because of what he thinks, we do indeed “invert the order of things,” to use Hamilton’s phrase. All public officials — state and federal — must take an oath to support the Constitution by the express command of Article VI of the Constitution. And see <em>Gerende </em>v. <em>Election Board, </em>341 U. S. 56. But otherwise the domains of conscience and belief have been set aside and protected from government intrusion. <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Barnette, </em>319 U. S. 624. What a man thinks is of no concern to government. “The First Amendment gives freedom of mind the same security as freedom of conscience.” <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>323 U. S. 516, 531. Advocacy and belief go hand in hand. For there can be no true freedom of mind if thoughts are secure only when they are pent up.</p>
<p id="b584-6">In <em>Murdock </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, supra, </em>we stated, “Plainly a community may not suppress, or the state tax, the dissemination of views because they are unpopular, annoying or distasteful.” 319 U. S., at 116. If the Government may not impose a tax upon the expression of ideas in order to discourage them, it may not achieve the same end by reducing the individual who expresses his views to second-class citizenship by withholding tax benefits granted others. When government denies a tax exemption because of the citizen’s belief, it penalizes that belief. That is different only in form, not substance, from the “taxes on knowledge” which have had a notorious history in the English-speaking world. See <em>Grosjean </em>v. <em>American Press Co., </em>297 U. S. 233, 246-247.</p>
<p id="b584-7">We deal here with a type of advocacy which, to say the least, lies close to the “constitutional danger zone.” <em>Yates </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U. S. 298, 319. Advocacy which is in no way brigaded with action should always be pro<page-number citation-index="1" label="537">*537</page-number>tected by the First Amendment. That protection should extend even to the ideas we despise. As Mr. Justice Holmes wrote in dissent in <em>Gitlow </em>v. <em>New York, </em>268 U. S. 652, 673, “If in the long run the beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted by the dozninant forces of the community, the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way.” It is time for government — state or federal — to become concerned with the citizen's advocacy when his ideas and beliefs move into the realm of action.</p>
<p id="b585-4">The California oath is not related to unlawful action. To get the tax exemption the taxpayer must swear he “does not advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of California by force or violence or other unlawful means nor advocate the support of a foreign government against the United States in event of hostilities.” <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Court construes the opinion of the California Supreme Court as applying the same test of illegal advocacy as was sustained against constitutional challenge in <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U. S. 494. That case held that advocacy of the overthrow of government by force and violence was not enough, that incitement to action, as well as clear and present danger, were also essential ingredients. <em>Id., </em>at 512, 509-510. As <em>Yates </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>makes clear, there is still a clear constitutional line between advocacy of abstract doctrine and advocacy of action. The California Supreme Court said, to be sure, that the oath in question “is concerned” with that kind of advocacy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But it nowhere says that oath is limited to that kind of advocacy. It seemed to think that advocacy was itself action for it said, “What one may merely believe is not prohibited. <page-number citation-index="1" label="538">*538</page-number>It is only advocates of the subversive doctrines who are affected. Advocacy constitutes action and the instigation of action, not mere belief or opinion.” <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b586-6">However the California opinion may be read, these judgments should fall. If the construction of the oath is the one I prefer, then the Supreme Court of California has obliterated the line between advocacy of abstract doctrine and advocacy of action. If the California oath has been limited by judicial construction to the type of advocacy condemned in <em>Dennis, </em>it still should fall. My disagreement with that decision has not abated. No conspiracy to overthrow the Government was involved. Speech and speech alone was the offense. I repeat that thought and speech go hand in hand. There is no real freedom of thought if ideas must be suppressed. There can be no freedom of the mind unless ideas can be uttered.</p>
<p id="b586-7">I know of no power that enables any government under our Constitution to become the monitor of thought, as this statute would have it become.</p>

<p id="b581-8"> The oath was prescribed by the Council in charge of the Southern District of New York. The Council, authorized by the Act of October 23, 1779, was composed of the Governor, President of the Senate, Chancellor, Supreme Court judges, Senators, Assemblymen, Secretary of State, Attorney General, and County Court judges. The Council was to assume authority “whenever the enemy shall abandon or be dispossessed of the same, and until the legislature can be convened,” N. Y. Laws 1777-1784, 192. The Council governed from November 25, 1783, to February 5, 1784. See Barck, <page-number citation-index="1" label="534">*534</page-number>New York City 1776-1783 (1931), 220-221. Among the powers of the Council was control of elections.</p>
<p id="b582-5">The election oath prescribed by the Council read as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b582-6">“I.do solemnbq without any mental Reservation or Equivocation whatsoever, swear and declare, and call God to witness (or if of the People called Quakers, affirm) that I renounce and abjure all Allegiance to the King of Great-Britain; and that I will bear true Faith and Allegiance to the State of New-York, as a Free and Independent State, and that I will in all Things, to the best of my Knowledge and Ability, do my Duty as a good and faithful Subject of the said State ought to do. So help me God.” Independent Gazette, Dec. 13, 1783.</blockquote>
<p id="b582-8">The Council further provided:</p>
<blockquote id="b582-9">“That if any Person presenting himself to give his Vote, shall be suspected of, or charged with having committed any of the Offences above specified, it shall be Lawful for the Inspectors, or Superintendents (as the Case may be) to inquire into and determine the Fact whereof such Person shall be suspected, or wherewith he shall be charged, as the Cause of Disqualification, on the Oath of one or more Witnesses, or on the Oath of the Party so suspected or charged, at their Discretion; and if such Fact shall, in the Judgement of the Inspectors or Superintendents, be established, it shall be lawful for them, and they are hereby required, to reject the Vote of such Person at such Election.” Independent Gazette, Dec. 13, 1783.</blockquote>
