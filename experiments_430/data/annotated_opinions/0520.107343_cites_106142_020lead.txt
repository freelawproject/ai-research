 The result must be to stifle “that free play of the spirit which all teachers ought especially to cultivate and practice .  .  .  .” 10 That probability is enhanced by the provisions requiring an *602 annual review of every teacher to determine whether any utterance or act of his, inside the classroom or out, came within the sanctions of the laws.  For a memorandum warns employees that under the statutes “subversive” activities may take the form of “[t]he writing of articles, the distribution of pamphlets, the endorsement of speeches made or articles written or acts performed by others,” and reminds them “that it is a primary duty of the school authorities in each school district to take positive action to eliminate from the school system any teacher in whose case there is evidence that he is guilty of subversive activity.  School authorities are under obligation to proceed immediately and conclusively in every such case.” There can be no doubt of the legitimacy of New York’s interest in protecting its education system from subversion.  But “even though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose cannot be pursued by means that'broadly” stiHe fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved.” Shelton v. Tucker, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 479, 488</citedDecision> .  The principle is not inapplicable because the legislation is aimed at keeping subversives out of the teaching ranks. In De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U. S. 353, 365 , the Court said: “The greater the importance of safeguarding the community from incitements to the overthrow of our institutions by force and violence, the more imperative is the need to preserve inviolate the constitutional rights of free speech, free press and free assembly in order to maintain the opportunity for free political discussion, to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes, if desired, may be obtained by peaceful means.  Therein lies the security of the Republic, the very foundation of constitutional government.” *603 Our Nation is deeply committed to safeguarding academic freedom, which is of transcendent value to all of us and not merely to the teachers concerned.  That freedom is therefore a special concern of the First Amendment, which does not tolerate laws that cast a pall of orthodoxy over the classroom.  “The vigilant protection of constitutional freedoms is nowhere more vital than in the community of American schools.” <citedDecision>Shelton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Tucker, supra, at 487</citedDecision> .  The classroom is peculiarly the “marketplace of ideas.” The Nation’s future depends upon leaders trained through wide exposure to that robust exchange of ideas which discovers truth “out of a multitude of tongues, [rather] than through any kind of authoritative selection.” United States v. Associated Press, 52 F. Supp. 362, 372 .  In Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U. S. 234, 250 , we said: “The essentiality of freedom in the community of American universities is almost self-evident.  No one should underestimate the vital role in a democracy that is played by those who guide and train our youth.  To impose any strait jacket upon the intellectual leaders in our colleges and universities would imperil the future of our Nation.  No field of education is so thoroughly comprehended by man that new discoveries cannot yet be made.  Particularly is that true in the social sciences, where few, if any, principles are accepted as absolutes.

 That premise was that public employment, including academic employment, may be conditioned upon the surrender of constitutional rights which could not be abridged by direct government action.  Teachers, the Court said in Adler , “may work for the school system upon the reasonable terms laid down by the proper authorities of New York. If they do not choose to work on such terms, they are at liberty to retain their beliefs and associations and go elsewhere.” 342 U. S., at 492 .  The Court also stated that a teacher denied employment because of membership in a listed organization “is not thereby denied the right of free speech and assembly.  Hir freedom of choice between membership in the organization and employment in the school system might be limited, but not his freedom of speech or assembly, except in the remote sense that limitation is inherent in every choice.” Id., at 493 .  However, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit correctly said in an earlier stage of this case, “... the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless *606 'of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.” Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 345 F. 2d 236, 239 .  Indeed, that theory was expressly rejected in a series of decisions following Adler .  See Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 ; Slochower v. Board of Education, 350 U. S. 551 ; Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, supra; Baggett v. Bullitt, supra; Shelton v. <citedDecision>Tucker, supra;</citedDecision> Speiser v. Randall, supra; see also Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232 ; Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 .  In Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 404 , we said: “It is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of.  or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege.” We proceed then to the question of the validity of the provisions of subdivision 1 (c) of § 105 and subdivision 2 of § 3022, barring employment to members of listed organizations.  Here again constitutional doctrine has developed since Adler .  Mere knowing membership without a specific intent to further the unlawful aims of an organization is not a constitutionally adequate basis for exclusion from such positions as those held by appellants.  In Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11 , we said, “Those who join an organization but do not share its unlawful purposes and who do not participate in its unlawful activities surely pose no threat, either as citizens or as public employees.” Id., at 17 .  We there struck down a statutorily required oath binding the state employee not to become a member of the Communist Party with knowledge of its unlawful purpose, on threat of discharge and perjury prosecution if the oath were violated.

 .” The Feinberg Certificate was even more explicit: “Anyone who is a *609 member of the Communist Party or of any organization that advocates the violent overthrow of the Government of the United States or of the State of New York or any political subdivision thereof cannot be employed by the State University.” (Emphasis supplied.) This official administrative interpretation is supported by the legislative preamble to the Feinberg Law, § 1, in which the legislature concludes as a result of its findings that “it is essential that the laws prohibiting persons who are members of subversive groups, such as the communist party and its affiliated organizations, from obtaining or retaining employment in the public schools, be rigorously enforced.” (Emphasis supplied.) Thus § 105, subd. 1 (c), and § 3022, subd. 2, suffer from impermissible “overbreadth.” Elfbrandt v. Russell, supra, at 19 ; Aptheker v. Secretary of State, supra; N. A. A. C. P. v. Button, supra; Saia v. New York, 334 U. S. 558 ; Schneider v. State, 308 U. S. 147 ; Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U. S. 444 ; cf. Hague v. C. I.  O., 307 U. S. 496, 515-516 ; see generally Dombrowski v. Pfister, 380 U. S. 479, 486 .  They seek to bar employment both for association which legitimately may be proscribed and for association which may not be proscribed consistently with First Amendment rights.  Where statutes have an over-broad sweep, just as where they are vague, “the hazard of loss or substantial impairment of those precious rights may be critical,” Dombrowski v. Pfister, supra, at 486 , since those covered by the statute are bound to limit their behavior to that which is unquestionably safe.  As we said in <citedDecision>Shelton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Tucker, supra, at 488</citedDecision> , “The breadth of legislative abridgment must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose.” We therefore hold that Civil Service Law § 105, subd. 1 (c), and Education Law § 3022, subd. 2, are invalid insofar as they proscribe mere knowing membership *610 without any showing of specific intent to further the unlawful aims of the Communist Party of the United States or of the State of New York. The judgment of the District Court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Reversed and remanded.  APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COURT. Civil Service Law. § 105.  Subversive activities; disqualification 1.  Ineligibility of persons advocating overthrow of government by force or unlawful means.  No person shall be appointed to any office or position in the service of the state or of any civil division thereof, nor shall any person employed in any such office or position be continued in such employment, nor shall any person be employed in the public service as superintendent, principal or teacher in a public school or academy or in a state college or any other state educational institution who: (a) by word of mouth or writing wilfully and deliberately advocates, advises or teaches the doctrine that the government of the United States or of any state or of any political subdivision thereof should be overthrown or overturned by force, violence or any unlawful means; or (b) prints, publishes, edits, issues or sells any book, paper, document or written or printed matter in any form containing or advocating, advising or teaching the doctrine that the government of the United States or of any state or of any political subdivision thereof should be overthrown by force, violence or any unlawful means, and who advocates, advises, teaches, or embraces the duty, necessity or propriety of adopting the doctrine contained therein; or *611 (c) organizes or helps to organize or becomes a member of any society or group of persons which teaches or advocates that the government of the United States or of any state or of any political subdivision thereof shall be overthrown by force or violence, or by any unlawful means.  For the purposes of this section, membership in the communist party of the United States of America or the communist party of the state of New York shall constitute prima facie evidence of disqualification for appointment to or retention in any office or position in the service of the state or of any city or civil division thereof.
