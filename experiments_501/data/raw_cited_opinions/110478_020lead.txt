<p id="Akk">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b595-5">The respondent is an inmate at the Nebraska Penal and Correctional Complex who ordered by mail certain hobby materials valued at $23.50. The hobby materials were lost and respondent brought suit under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 to recover their value. At first blush one might well inquire why respondent brought an action in federal court to recover damages of such a small amount for negligent loss of property, but because 28 U. S. C. § 1343, the predicate for the jurisdiction of the United States District Court, contains no minimum dollar limitation, he was authorized by Congress to bring his action under that section if he met its requirements and if he stated a claim for relief under 42 U. S. C. § 1983. Respondent claimed that his property was negligently lost by prison officials in violation of his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. More specifically, he claimed that he had been deprived of property without due process of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b595-6">The United States District Court for the District of Nebraska entered summary judgment for respondent, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit af<page-number citation-index="1" label="530">*530</page-number>firmed in a <em>per curiam </em>order. 620 F. 2d 307 (1980). We granted certiorari. 449 U. S. 917 (1980).</p>
<p id="b596-5">I</p>
<p id="b596-6">The facts underlying this dispute are not seriously contested. Respondent paid for the hobby materials he ordered with two drafts drawn on his inmate account by prison officials. The packages arrived at the complex and were signed for by two employees who worked in the prison hobby center. One of the employees was a civilian and the other was an inmate. Respondent was in segregation at the time and was not permitted to have the hobby materials. Normal prison procedures for the handling of mail packages is that upon arrival they are either delivered to the prisoner who signs a receipt for the package or the prisoner is notified to pick up the package and to sign a receipt. No inmate other than the one to whom the package is addressed is supposed to sign for a package. After being released from segregation, respondent contacted several prison officials regarding the whereabouts of his packages. The officials were never able to locate the packages or to determine what caused their disappearance.</p>
<p id="b596-7">In 1976, respondent commenced this action against the petitioners, the Warden and Hobby Manager of the prison, in the District Court seeking to recover the value of the hobby materials which he claimed had been lost as a result of the petitioners’ negligence. Respondent alleged that petitioners’ conduct deprived him of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Respondent chose to proceed in the United States District Court under 28 U. S. C. § 1343 and 42 U. S. C. § 1983, even though the State of Nebraska had a tort claims procedure which provided a remedy to persons who suffered tortious losses at the hands of the State.</p>
<p id="b596-8">On October 25, 1978, the District Court granted respond<page-number citation-index="1" label="531">*531</page-number>ent’s motion for summary judgment. The District Court ruled that negligent actions by state officials can be a basis for an action, under 42 U. S. C. § 1983; petitioners were not immune from damages actions of this kind; and the deprivation of the hobby kit “implicate [d] due process rights.” The District Court explained:</p>
<blockquote id="b597-5">“This is not a situation where prison officials confiscated contraband. The negligence of the officials in failing to follow their own policies concerning the distribution of mail resulted in a loss of personal property for [respondent], which loss should not go without redress.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 9.</blockquote>
<p id="b597-6">II</p>
<p id="b597-7">In the best of all possible worlds, the District Court’s above-quoted statement that respondent’s loss should not go without redress would be an admirable provision to be contained in a code which governed the administration of justice in a civil-law jurisdiction. For better or for worse, however, our traditions arise from the common law of case-by-case reasoning and the establishment of precedent. In 49 of the 50 States the common-law system, as modified by statute, constitutional amendment, or judicial decision governs. Coexisting with the 50 States which make it up, and supreme over them to the extent of its authority under Art. IV of the Constitution, is the National Government. At an early period in the history of this Nation, it was held that there was no federal common law of crimes, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hudson &amp; Goodwin, </em>7 Cranch 32 (1812), and since <em>Erie R. Co. </em>v. <em>Tompkins, </em>304 U. S. 64 (1938), there has been no general common law applicable in federal courts merely by reason of diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction. Therefore, in order properly to decide this case we must deal not simply with a single, general principle, however just- that principle may be in the abstract, but with the complex interplay of the Consti<page-number citation-index="1" label="532">*532</page-number>tution, statutes, and the facts which form the basis for this litigation.</p>
<p id="b598-5">Because federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, we must first look to the Act of Congress which confers jurisdiction over claims such as respondent’s on a United States district court. Such enactment is found in 28 U. S. C. § 1343, which provides in pertinent part:</p>
<blockquote id="b598-6">“The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by any person:</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b598-7">“(3) To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States.”</blockquote>
<p id="b598-8">The statute conferring jurisdiction is in turn closely related to 42 U. S. C. § 1983, under which respondent brought this action. Section 1983 provided in the year in question :</p>
<blockquote id="b598-9">“Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.”</blockquote>
<p id="b598-10">While we have twice granted certiorari in cases to decide whether mere negligence will support a claim for relief under § 1983, see <em>Procunier </em>v. <em>Navarette, </em>434 U. S. 555 (1978), and <em>Baker </em>v. <em>McGollan, </em>443 U. S. 137 (1979), we have in each of those cases found it unnecessary to decide the issue. In <em>Procunier, supra, </em>we held that regardless of whether the <page-number citation-index="1" label="533">*533</page-number>§ 1983 complaint framed in terms of negligence stated a claim for relief, the defendants would clearly have been entitled to qualified immunity and therefore not liable for damages. In <em>Baker, supra, </em>we held that no deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States had occurred, and therefore it was unnecessary to decide whether mere negligence on the part of the actor would have rendered him liable had there been such a deprivation. These two decisions, however, have not aided the various Courts of Appeals and District Courts in their struggle to determine the correct manner in which to analyze claims such as the present one which allege facts that are commonly thought to state a claim for a common-law tort normally dealt with by state courts, but instead are couched in terms of a constitutional deprivation and relief is sought under § 1983. The diversity in approaches is legion. See, <em>e. g., Williams </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>624 F. 2d 695 (CA5 1980); <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Mitchell, </em>604 F. 2d 485 (CA7 1979); <em>Fulton Market Cold Storage Co. </em>v. <em>Cullerton, </em>582 F. 2d 1071 (CA7 1978); <em>O’Grady </em>v. <em>Montpelier, </em>573 F. 2d 747 (CA2 1978) ; <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>517 F. 2d 1311 (CA7 1975), modified en banc, 545 F. 2d 565 (1976); <em>Hampton </em>v. <em>Holmesburg Prison Officials, </em>546 F. 2d 1077 (CA3 1976); <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>528 F. 2d 132 (CA2 1975); <em>Diamond </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>523 F. 2d 1201 (CA5 1975); <em>Kimbrough </em>v. <em>O’Neil, </em>523 F. 2d 1057 (CA7 1975); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Estelle, </em>519 F. 2d 1136 (CA5 1975); <em>Pitts </em>v. <em>Griffin, </em>518 F. 2d 72 (CA8 1975); <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Bodner, </em>489 F. 2d 280 (CA3 1973); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Glick, </em>481 F. 2d 1028 (CA2 1973); <em>McCray </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>456 F. 2d 1 (CA4 1972); <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Carlson, </em>144 U. S. App. D. C. 388, 447 F. 2d 358 (1971); <em>Madison </em>v. <em>Manter, </em>441 F. 2d 537 (CA1 1971); <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>426 F. 2d 277 (CA8 1970); <em>Whirl </em>v. <em>Kern, </em>407 F. 2d 781 (CA5 1968); and <em>Striker </em>v. <em>Pancher, </em>317 F. 2d 780 (CA6 1963). We, therefore, once more put our shoulder to the wheel hoping to be of greater assistance to <page-number citation-index="1" label="534">*534</page-number>courts confronting such a fact situation than it appears we have been in the past.</p>
<p id="b600-5">Nothing in the language of § 1983 or its legislative history-limits the statute solely to intentional deprivations of constitutional rights. In <em>Baker </em>v. <em>McCollan, supra, </em>we sug-guested that simply because a wrong was negligently as opposed to intentionally committed did not foreclose the possibility that' such action could be brought under § 1983. We explained:</p>
<blockquote id="b600-6">“[T]he question whether an allegation of simple negligence is sufficient to state a cause of action under § 1983 is more elusive than it appears at first blush. It may well not be susceptible of a uniform answer across the entire spectrum of conceivable constitutional violations which might be the subject of a § 1983 action.” 443 U. S., at 139-140.</blockquote>
<p id="b600-7">Section 1983, unlike its criminal counterpart, 18 U. S. C. § 242, has never been found by this Court to contain a state-of-mind requirement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court recognized as much in <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, </em>365 U. S. 167 (1961), when we explained after extensively reviewing the legislative history of § 1983, that</p>
<blockquote id="AgX">“[i]t is abundantly clear that one reason the legislation was passed was to afford a federal right in federal courts because, by reason of prejudice, passion, neglect, intolerance or otherwise, state laws might not be enforced and the claims of citizens to the enjoyment of rights, privileges and immunities guaranteed by the Fourteenth <page-number citation-index="1" label="535">*535</page-number>Amendment might be denied by the state agencies.” <em>Id., </em>at 180.</blockquote>
<p id="b601-5">In distinguishing the criminal counterpart which had earlier been at issue in <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U. S. 91 (1945), the <em>Monroe </em>Court stated:</p>
<blockquote id="b601-6">“In the <em>Screws </em>case we dealt with a statute that imposed criminal penalities for acts 'willfully’ done. We construed that word in its setting to mean the doing of an act with 'a specific intent to deprive a person of a federal right.’ 325 U. S., at 103. We do not think that gloss should be put on [§ 1983] which we have here. The word 'willfully’ does not appear in [§ 1983]. Moreover, [§ 1983] provides a civil remedy, while in the <em>Screws </em>case we dealt with a criminal law challenged on the grounds of vagueness. [Section 1983] should be read against the background of tort liability that makes a man responsible for the natural consequences of his actions.” 365 U. S., at 187.</blockquote>
<p id="b601-7">Both <em>Baker </em>v. <em>McCollan </em>and <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape </em>suggest that § 1983 affords a “civil remedy” for deprivations of federally protected rights caused by persons acting under color of state law without any express requirement of a particular state of mind. Accordingly, in any § 1983 action the initial inquiry must focus on whether the two essential elements to a § 1983 action are present: (1) whether the conduct complained of was committed by a person acting under color of state law; and (2) whether this conduct deprived a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.</p>
<p id="b601-8">Ill</p>
<p id="b601-9">Since this Court’s decision in <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, supra, </em>it can no longer be questioned that the alleged conduct by the petitioners in this case satisfies the “under color of state law” requirement. Petitioners were, after all, state employees in <page-number citation-index="1" label="536">*536</page-number>positions of considerable authority. They do not seriously contend otherwise. Our inquiry, therefore, must turn to the second requirement — whether respondent has been deprived of any right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.</p>
<p id="b602-5">The only deprivation respondent alleges in his complaint is that “his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States were violated. That he was deprived of his property and Due Process of Law.” App. 8. As such, respondent’s claims differ from the claims which were before us in <em>Monroe </em>v. <em>Pape, supra, </em>which involved violations of the Fourth Amendment, and the claims presented in <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>Gamble, </em>429 U. S. 97 (1976), which involved alleged violations of the Eighth Amendment. Both of these Amendments have been held applicable to the States by virtue of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Mapp </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>367 U. S. 643 (1961); <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>California, </em>370 U. S. 660 (1962). Respondent here refers to no other right, privilege, or immunity secured by the Constitution or federal laws other than the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment <em>simpliciter. </em>The pertinent text of the Fourteenth Amendment provides:</p>
<blockquote id="b602-6">“Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; <em>nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; </em>nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>
<p id="b602-7">Unquestionably, respondent’s claim satisfies three prerequisites of a valid due process claim: the petitioners acted under color of state law; the hobby kit falls within the definition of property; and the alleged loss, even though negli<page-number citation-index="1" label="537">*537</page-number>gently caused, amounted to a deprivation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Standing alone, however, these three elements do not establish a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Nothing in that Amendment protects against all deprivations of life, liberty, or property by the State. The Fourteenth Amendment protects only against deprivations “without due process of law.” <em>Baker </em>v. <em>McCollan, </em>443 U. S., at 145. Our inquiry therefore must focus on whether the respondent has suffered a deprivation of property without due process of law. In particular, we must decide whether the tort remedies which the State of Nebraska provides as a means of redress for property deprivations satisfy the requirements of procedural due process.</p>
<p id="b603-5">This Court has never directly addressed the question of what process is due a person when an employee of a State negligently takes his property. In some cases this Court has held that due process requires a predeprivation hearing before the State interferes with any liberty or property interest enjoyed by its citizens. In most of these cases, however, the deprivation of property was pursuant to some established state procedure and “process” could be offered before any actual deprivation took place. For example, in <em>Mullane </em>v. <page-number citation-index="1" label="538">*538</page-number><em>Central Hanover Trust Co., </em>339 U. S. 306 (1950), the Court struck down on due process grounds a New York statute that allowed a trust company, when it sought a judicial settlement of its trust accounts, to give notice by publication to all beneficiaries even if the whereabouts of the beneficiaries were known. The Court held that personal notice in such situations was required and stated that “when notice is a person’s due, process which is a mere gesture is not due process.” <em>Id., </em>at 315. More recently, in <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Burson, </em>402 U. S. 535 (1971), we reviewed a state statute which provided for the taking of the driver’s license and registration of an uninsured motorist who had been involved in an accident. We recognized that a driver’s license is often involved in the livelihood of a person and as such could not be summarily taken without a prior hearing. In <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>407 U. S. 67 (1972), we struck dawn the Florida prejudgment replevin statute which allowed secured creditors to obtain writs in <em>ex parte </em>proceedings. We held that due process required a prior hearing before the State authorized its agents to seize property in a debtor’s possession. See also <em>Boddie </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>401 U. S. 371 (1971); <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U. S. 254 (1970) ; and <em>Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Finance Corp., </em>395 U. S. 337 (1969). In all these cases, deprivations of property were authorized by an established state procedure and due process was held to require predeprivation notice and hearing in order to serve as a check on the possibility that a wrongful deprivation would occur.</p>
<p id="b604-5">We have, however, recognized that postdeprivation remedies made available by the State can satisfy the Due Process Clause. In such cases, the normal predeprivation notice and opportunity to be heard is pretermitted if the State provides a postdeprivation remedy. In <em>North American Cold Storage Co. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>211 U. S. 306 (1908), we upheld the right of a State to seize and destroy unwholesome food without a preseizure hearing. The possibility of erroneous destruction of property was outweighed by the fact that the public health <page-number citation-index="1" label="539">*539</page-number>emergency justified immediate action and the owner of the property could recover his damages in an action at law after the incident. In <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Mytinger &amp; Casselberry, Inc., </em>339 U. S. 594 (1950), we upheld under the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause the summary seizure and destruction of drugs without a preseizure hearing. Similarly, in <em>Fahey </em>v. <em>Mallonee, </em>332 U. S. 245 (1947), we recognized that the protection of the public interest against economic harm can justify the immediate seizure of property without a prior hearing when substantial questions are raised about the competence of a bank's management. In <em>Bowles </em>v. <em>Willingham, </em>321 U. S. 503 (1944), we upheld in the face of a due process challenge the authority of the Administrator of the Office of Price Administration to issue rent control orders without providing a hearing to landlords before the order or regulation fixing rents became effective. See also <em>Corn Exchange Bank </em>v. <em>Coler, </em>280 U. S. 218 (1930); <em>McKay </em>v. <em>McInnes, </em>279 U. S. 820 <em>(1929); Coffin Brothers &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>277 U. S. 29 (1928); and <em>Ownbey </em>v. <em>Morgan, </em>256 U. S. 94 (1921). These cases recognize that either the necessity of quick action by the State or the impracticality of providing any meaningful predeprivation process, when coupled with the availability of some meaningful means by which to assess the propriety of the State's action at some time after the initial taking, can satisfy the requirements of procedural due process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As we stated in <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>W. T. Grant Co., </em>416 U. S. 600 (1974):</p>
<blockquote id="b605-5">“Petitioner asserts that his right to a hearing before his possession is in any way disturbed is nonetheless <page-number citation-index="1" label="540">*540</page-number>mandated by a long line of cases in this Court, culminating in <em>Sniadach </em>v. <em>Family Finance Corip., </em>395 U. S. 337 (1969), and <em>Fuentes </em>v. <em>Shevin, </em>407 U. S. 67 (1972). The <em>pre-jSniadach </em>cases are said by petitioner to hold that <em>‘the </em>opportunity to be heard must precede any actual deprivation of private property.’ Their import, however, is not so clear as petitioner would have it: they merely stand for the proposition that a hearing must be had before one is finally deprived of his property and do not deal at all with the need for a pretermination hearing where a full and immediate post-termination hearing is provided. The usual rule has been ‘[w]here only property rights are involved, mere postponement of the judicial enquiry is not a denial of due process, if the opportunity given for ultimate judicial determination of liability is adequate.’ <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>283 U. S. 589, 596-597 (1931).” <em>Id., </em>at 611 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>
<p id="b606-5">Our past cases mandate that some kind of hearing is required at some time before a State finally deprives a person of his property interests. The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard and it is an “opportunity which must be granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.” <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manso, </em>380 U. S. 545, 552 (1965). However, as many of the above cases recognize, we have rejected the proposition that “at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner” <em>always </em>requires the State to provide a hearing prior to the initial deprivation of property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This rejection is based in part bn the impractica<page-number citation-index="1" label="541">*541</page-number>bility in some cases of providing any preseizure hearing under a state-authorized procedure, and the assumption that at some time a full and meaningful hearing will be available.</p>
<p id="b607-5">The justifications which we have found sufficient to uphold takings of property without any predeprivation process are applicable to a situation such as the present one involving a tortious loss of a prisoner’s property as a result of a random and unauthorized act by a state employee. In such a case, the loss is not a result of some established state procedure and the State cannot predict precisely when the loss will occur. It is difficult to conceive of how the State could provide a meaningful hearing before the deprivation takes place. The loss of property, although attributable to the State as action under “color of law,” is in almost all cases beyond the control of the State. Indeed, in most cases it is not only impracticable, but impossible, to provide a meaningful hearing before the deprivation. That does not mean, of course, that the State can take property without providing a meaningful postdeprivation hearing. The prior cases which have excused the prior-hearing requirement have rested in part on the availability of some meaningful opportunity subsequent to the initial taking for a determination of rights and liabilities.</p>
<p id="b607-6">A case remarkably similar to the present one is <em>Bonner </em>v. <em>Coughlin, </em>517 F. 2d 1311 (CA7 1975), modified en banc, 545 F. 2d 565 (1976), cert. denied, 435 U. S. 932 (1978). There, a prisoner alleged that prison officials “made it possible by leaving the door of Plaintiff’s cell open, for others without authority to remove Plaintiff’s trial transcript from the cell.” 517 F. 2d, at 1318. The question presented was whether negligence may support a recovery under § 1983. Then Judge Stevens, writing for a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, recognized that the question that had to be <page-number citation-index="1" label="542">*542</page-number>decided was “whether it can be said that the deprivation was 'without due process of law.’ ” <em>Ibid. </em>He concluded:</p>
<blockquote id="b608-5">“It seems to us that there is an important difference between a challenge to an established state procedure ^as lacking in due process and a property damage claim arising out of the misconduct of state officers. In the former situation the facts satisfy the most literal reading of the Fourteenth Amendment’s prohibition against ‘State’ deprivations of property; in the latter situation, however, even though there is action ‘under color of’ state law sufficient to bring the amendment into play, the state action is not necessarily complete. For in a case such as this the law of Illinois provides, in substance, that the plaintiff is entitled to be made whole for any loss of property occasioned by the unauthorized conduct of the prison guards. We may reasonably conclude, therefore, that the existence of an adequate state remedy to redress property damage inflicted by state officers avoids the conclusion that there has been any constitutional deprivation of property without due process of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.” <em>Id., </em>at 1319.</blockquote>
<p id="b608-6">We believe that the analysis recited above in <em>Bonner </em>is the proper manner in which to approach a case such as this. This analysis is also quite consistent with the approach taken by this Court in <em>Ingraham </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>430 U. S. 651 (1977), where the Court was confronted with the claim that corporal punishment in public schools violated due process. Arguably, the facts presented to the Court in <em>Ingraham </em>were more egregious than those presented here inasmuch as the Court was faced with both an intentional act (as opposed to negligent conduct) and a deprivation of liberty. However, we reasoned:</p>
<blockquote id="b608-7">“ ‘At some point the benefit of an additional safeguard to the individual affected . . . and to society in terms of <page-number citation-index="1" label="543">*543</page-number>increased assurance that the action is just, may be outweighed by the cost.’ <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>424 U. S., at 348. We think that point has been reached in this case. In view of the low incidence of abuse, the openness of our schools, <em>and the common-law safeguards that already exist, </em>the risk of error that may result in violation of a schoolchild’s substantive rights can only be regarded as minimal. Imposing additional administrative safeguards as a constitutional requirement might reduce that risk marginally, but would also entail a significant intrusion into an area of primary educational responsibility.” <em>Id., </em>at 682. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>
<p id="b609-5">IV</p>
<p id="b609-6">Application of the principles recited above to this case leads us to conclude the respondent has not alleged a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Although he has been deprived of property under color of state law, the deprivation did not occur as a result of some established state procedure. Indeed, the deprivation occurred as a result of the unauthorized failure of agents of the State to follow established state procedure. There is no contention that the procedures themselves are inadequate nor is there any contention that it was practicable for the State to provide a predeprivation hearing. Moreover, the State of Nebraska has provided respondent with the means by which he can receive redress for the deprivation. The State provides a remedy to persons who believe they have suffered a tortious loss at the hands of the State. See Neb. Rev. Stat. §81-8,209 <em>et seq. </em>(1976). Through this tort claims procedure the State hears and pays claims of prisoners housed in its penal institutions. This procedure was in existence at the time of the loss here in question but respondent did not use it. It is argued that the State does not adequately protect the respondent’s interests because it provides only for an action against the State as opposed to its individual employees, <page-number citation-index="1" label="544">*544</page-number>it contains no provisions for punitive damages, and there is no right to a trial by jury. Although the state remedies may not provide the respondent with all the relief which may have been available if he could have proceeded under § 1983, that does not mean that the state remedies are not adequate to satisfy the requirements of due process. The remedies provided could have fully compensated the respondent for the property loss he suffered, and we hold that they are sufficient to satisfy the requirements of due process.</p>
<p id="b610-4">Our decision today is fully consistent with our prior cases. To accept respondent’s argument that the conduct of the state officials in this case constituted a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment would almost necessarily result in turning every alleged injury which may have been inflicted by a state official acting under “color of law” into a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment cognizable under § 1983. It is hard to perceive any logical stopping place to such a line of reasoning. Presumably, under this rationale any party who is involved in nothing more than an automobile accident with a state official could allege a constitutional violation under § 1983. Such reasoning “would make of the Fourteenth Amendment a font of tort law to be superimposed upon whatever systems may already be administered by the States.” <em>Paul </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>424 U. S. 693, 701 (1976). We do not think that the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment intended the Amendment to play such a role in our society.</p>

<p id="b595-10"> As we explained in <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U. S. 564 (1972), property interests “are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law — rules or understandings that secure certain benefits and that support claims of entitlement to those benefits.” <em>Id., </em>at 577. It is not contended that under Nebraska law respondent does not enjoy a property interest in the hobby materials here in question.</p>

<p id="b600-8"> Title 18 U. S. C. §242 provides in pertinent part:</p>
<blockquote id="b600-9">“Whoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom, <em>willfully </em>subjects any inhabitant of any State, Territory, or District to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States . . . shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and if death results shall be subject to imprisonment for any term of years or for life.” (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p id="b603-6"> Petitioners argue-that even if a negligent deprivation of respondent’s property occurred, there is no evidence in the record of negligence on their part. There is merit to petitioners’ arguments. Petitioners were not personally involved in the handling of the packages and respondent’s basic allegation appears to be that subordinates of petitioners violated established procedures which, if properly followed, would have ensured the proper delivery of respondent’s packages. In the past, this Court has refused to accept § 1983 actions premised on theories of <em>respondeat superior. Monell </em>v. <em>New York City Dept. of Social Services, </em>436 U. S. 658 (1978); <em>Rizzo </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>423 U. S. 362 (1976). On the other hand, there is no indication in the record that the petitioners ever raised in the District Court the argument that the loss of property was not caused by their negligence. Certainly, the District Court did not consider this an open question. In such a context, and with little or no factual development at the trial level, we can only accept for purposes of this opinion the District Court’s assumption that petitioners were negligent and that this negligence contributed to respondent’s loss.</p>

<blockquote id="b605-7">“While these cases indicate that the particular interests involved might not have demanded a hearing immediately, they also reaffirm the principle that property may not be taken without a hearing at some time.” <em>Id., </em>at 179 (concurring in part and dissenting in part).</blockquote>

In only one case, <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>397 U. S., at 266-271, has the Court held that a hearing closely approximating a judicial trial is necessary.
