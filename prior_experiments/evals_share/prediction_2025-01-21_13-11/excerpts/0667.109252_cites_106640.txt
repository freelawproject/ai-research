Case of interest: Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co. (1963)
-----------------------
ce in the personal injury area teaches that a rule of fairness in court will produce fair out-of-court settlements.[13] But even if this argument were more persuasive than it is, it could hardly be accepted. For, at bottom, it asks us to continue the operation of an archaic rule because its facile application out of court yields quick, though inequitable, settlements, and relieves the courts of some litigation.

"[T]here is no reason why the Supreme Court cannot at this late date `confess error' and adopt the proportional fault doctrine without Congressional action. The resolution to follow the divided damages rule, taken 120 years ago, rested not on overwhelming authority but on judgments of fact and of fairness which may have been tenable then but are hardly so today. No `vested rights,' in theory or fact, have intervened. The regard for
