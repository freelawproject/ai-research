. as a means of securing the judicial decision of any question which, even if determined in the prisoner's favor, could *66 not have resulted in his immediate release." McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S., at 137-138. To the extent that the Court thought that the absence of eighteenth century English precedent demonstrated that McNally was not entitled to habeas corpus relief, the Court's reliance seems to have been misplaced. In light of the fact that English judges had no power to impose cumulative punishment in felony cases, [19] and apparently did not assume such power in misdemeanor cases until 1769, [20] it is not at all surprising that research failed to uncover a pre-1789 common-law analogy for McNally's petition for relief. In any event, the development of the writ of habeas corpus did not end in 1789. What we said of the writ in a similar context in Jones v. Cunningham, <targetCase>371 U.S. 236</targetCase> (1963), is equally applicable here. "[The writ] is not now and never has been a static, narrow, formalistic remedy; its scope has grown to achieve its grand purposethe protection of individuals against erosion of their right to be free from wrongful restraints upon their liberty." Id., at 243. Of course the excursion in McNally into history to determine that the writ of habeas corpus issued only to adjudicate entitlement to "immediate release" was not unnecessary. Though McNally held only that the petitioner did not meet the custody requirements of the statute, see Walker v. Wainwright, 390 U.S. 335 (1968), that holding rested in part on the premise that physical discharge from custody is the only relief available in a habeas corpus proceeding. But the statute does not deny the federal courts power to fashion appropriate relief other than immediate release. Since 1874, the habeas *67 corpus statute has directed the courts to determine the facts and dispose of the case summarily, "as law and justice require." Rev. Stat. § 761 (1874), superseded by 28 U.S. C . § 2243. Consistently with this command, this Court has held that a prisoner whose first-sentence parole was revoked upon a second conviction could challenge the second conviction in a habeas corpus proceeding though he would not be released if he prevailed, Ex parte Hull, 312 U.S. 546 (1941); that a person who was paroled after he filed his habeas corpus petition could still obtain relief from the restraints imposed by the parole conditions, <targetCase>Jones</targetCase> v. Cunningham, supra ; and that a prisoner could attack the first of two consecutive sentences in a federal habeas corpus proceeding even though he would still be confined under the second sentence if he succeeded, Walker v. Wainwright, supra . See also United States v. Pridgeon, 153 U.S. 48 , 63-64 (1894). Thus, to the extent that McNally relied on the notion that immediate physical release was the only remedy under the federal writ of habeas corpus, it finds no support in the statute and has been rejected by this Court in subsequent decisions. We overrule McNally and hold that a prisoner serving consecutive sentences is "in custody" under any one of them for purposes of § 2241 (c) (3). [21] This interpretation is consistent with the statutory language and with the purpose of the writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts. Affirmed. NOTES [1] Rowe's initial plea of double jeopardy had been overruled by the trial court.

4th Cir. 1967); Martin v. Virginia, 349 F.2d 781 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1965). In McNally, the Court rejected the prisoner's argument that he was entitled to habeas corpus relief because he would be eligible for parole if the challenged sentence were invalidated. 293 U.S. , at 134 , 140. In Williams and Martin, the Court of Appeals concluded that this Court's decision in Jones v. Cunningham, <targetCase>371 U.S. 236</targetCase> (1963), represented a departure from this narrow reading of the habeas corpus statute. [7] E. g., Darnel's Case ["Five Knights' Case"] 3 How. St. Tr. 1-59 (K. B. 1627); Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 (1866). The proceedings in Darnel's Case are summarized in D. Meador, Habeas Corpus and Magna Carta 13-16 (1966).
