14520382-54691255-58734503,"TRANSFER ORDER: This case involves an automobile accident among Plaintiff and Defendants that occurred on a stretch of Interstate 95 located in Darien, Connecticut. (See Complaint, (Doc. 1), 1, 9.) Defendant Willacy is a resident of Pennsylvania, Defendant Lepsis is a resident of Connecticut, and Defendant CRST Expedited, Inc. which owned the truck being driven by Defendant Willacy is an Iowa corporation. (Id. 2-3, 5-7.) The federal venue statute states that a civil action may be brought in: (1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the state in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to such action. 28 U.S.C. ������������������ 1391(b). Thus, the Complaint fails to make a prima facie showing that venue in this District is proper. The Plaintiff's residence is not a sufficient basis for venue. See generally Rankel v. Kabateck, No. 12-CV-216, 2013 WL 7161687 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2013). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ������������������ 1406(a), a case in which venue is improper may be transferred to the proper venue, if such transfer would be in the interests of justice. Having consulted with Plaintiff's counsel, the Court finds that the interests of justice would be served by transferring this action to the District of Connecticut, seemingly the only District in which venue would be proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ������������������ 1391(b)(2). Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ������������������ 1406(a), this action is hereby TRANSFERRED sua sponte to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. SO ORDERED.

The parties have represented that, despite their best efforts, the necessary security clearances of defense counsel will not be completed prior to the end of January 2016. In order to allow time for the parties to review discovery and file any pretrial motions, the parties have agreed to jury selection on May 11, 2016, with trial to begin immediately thereafter.In light of the need for defense counsel to obtain the clearances necessary to view the materials at issue in this case, the Court finds that the failure to grant a continuance would deny counsel the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the exercise of due diligence. In addition, because this case involves issues arising under the Classified Information Procedures Act (CIPA), 18 U.S.C. App. III, the Court finds that this case is sufficiently unusual and complex due to the nature of the prosecution that it is unreasonable to expect adequate preparation for pretrial proceedings, or for trial itself, within the time limits established under the Speedy Trial Act and that the ends of justice are served by allowing for the requested continuance here. Therefore, the Court finds that the ends of justice served by continuing the trial until May 11, 2016, outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial. Accordingly, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ������������������ 3161(h)(7), the Court finds that the time between December 16, 2015, and the jury selection date of May 11, 2016, is properly excludable and is hereby excluded.

As discussed on the record during today's in-court status conference, jury selection is scheduled for November 4, 2015 at 8:45am in Courtroom Two, 450 Main Street, Hartford. Parties shall file a Joint Status Report by September 25, 2015, which shall contain all the information indicated by the Court at today's status conference. Pretrial motions are due October 15, 2015, with any responses due October 22, 2015. A telephonic status conference will be held October 7, 2015, at 4:00pm. Chambers will email counsel with call-in instructions. Pretrial conference will be held on October 28, 2015 at 9:00am. The Court finds that the end of justice served by continuing the trial to November 4, 2015 outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial, considering that failure to grant the continuance would deny counsel for the defendant the reasonable time necessary for effective preparation, taking into account the exercise of due diligence, in particular because certain material discovery will not be produced to defense counsel until the security clearance process is completed. The Court continues the jury selection until November 4, 2015, and excludes the time from September 3, 2015, through November 4, 2015 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3161(h)(7)(B)(iv).

In an email exchange with the Chambers of the undersigned, counsel for the parties made several requests about today's deadline for submissions under the Court's earlier order to show cause. (ECF No. 39 .) First, Defendants' co-counsel asked that the Court set a specific time deadline today for the parties to submit the attorney declarations ordered in ECF No. 39 . Responding, Plaintiff's counsel asked that the Court extend Plaintiff's deadline for filing of her declaration to Monday, May 20.Having reviewed the parties' requests, the Court ORDERS as follows: Plaintiff's request is DENIED. The Court directs the parties to adhere to the Court's deadline of filing declarations of counsel today responding to the enumerated requests stated in the Court's order to show cause. (ECF No. 39 .)The Court provided the parties ample time to investigate and determine if any representations to the Court needed to be withdrawn. However, the Court will change one facet of its order. Because the parties should not need to view each others' submissions to respond to the items enumerated in the Court's order to show cause, the Court directs that the parties' submissions be made by email and directs them not to file their submissions on the public docket. The Court will file the declarations on the docket on Monday, May 20, 2024. Because the parties have not agreed on a set time for filing of their declarations, the Court DENIES Defendants' request in that regard.The Court will allow the parties to respond to each others' submissions, as Plaintiff has requested informally, by no later than May 31, 2024. The Court will then take this matter under advisement and issue such further orders and directives as appropriate. Failure to comply with this text order, and the Court's order to show cause, may result in sanctions, including a report and recommendation of sanctions by the undersigned to the Hon. Elizabeth A.

P. 12(b)(6), arguing that the complaint in this matter fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted. Without expressing any view as to the merits of Defendants' motion, the Court will afford Plaintiff an opportunity to file an amended complaint curing the alleged defects in accordance with Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B). If Plaintiff timely files an amended complaint, the Court will deny the pending motion to dismiss without prejudice as moot. If Plaintiff does not file an amended complaint, Plaintiff must file a response to the motion to dismiss. Plaintiff must file either an amended complaint or a response to the motion to dismiss on or before October 18, 2023. In the event Plaintiff files a response to the motion to dismiss, replies are due on or before October 25, 2023. If additional briefing is filed with respect to the motion to dismiss, the Court will review the papers and determine if oral argument is necessary and, if so, will inform the parties of the date and time. Otherwise, the matter will be deemed submitted and decided on the papers. The parties are encouraged to consider the provisions of 28 U.S.C. ������������������ 636(c) governing consent to either partial or complete disposition of the case by the assigned magistrate judge. In particular, the parties may consent to have just the pending motion to dismiss resolved by the assigned magistrate judge, in which case the motion will likely be resolved sooner than if it is handled by the undersigned.
