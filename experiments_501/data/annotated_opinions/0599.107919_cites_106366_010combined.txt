**Combined Opinion**
 Today, in contrast, 93.4% of the State's registered voters reside in the 49 most populous counties, and only 6.6% are resident in the remaining 53 counties.  The constitutional argument, however, remains the same.  Five members of the Court held in MacDougall that a State has "the power to assure a proper diffusion of political initiative as between its thinly populated counties and those having concentrated masses, in view of the fact that the latter have practical opportunities for exerting *817 their political weight at the polls not available to the former." 335 U. S., at 284 .  Three members of the Court dissented on the ground that the nominating procedure violated the Equal Protection Clause.  One member of the Court voted not to exercise this Court's jurisdiction in equity to resolve the dispute.  While the majority cited Colegrove v. Green, 328 U. S. 549 , as their authority for denying relief and while a few who took part in Colegrove put this type of question in the "political" as distinguished from the "justiciable" category, 328 U. S., at 552 , that matter was authoritatively resolved in Baker v. Carr, <citedDecision>369 U. S. 186, 202</citedDecision> .  When a State makes classifications of voters which favor residents of some counties over residents of other counties, a justiciable controversy is presented.  <citedDecision>369 U. S., at 198-204</citedDecision> .  When we struck down the Georgia county-unit system in statewide primary elections, we said: "How then can one person be given twice or ten times the voting power of another person in a statewide election merely because he lives in a rural area or because he lives in the smallest rural county?  Once the geographical unit for which a representative is to be chosen is designated, all who participate in the election are to have an equal voteÂ—whatever their race, whatever their sex, whatever their occupation, whatever their income, and wherever their home may be in that geographical unit.  This is required by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment." Gray v. Sanders, 372 U. S. 368, 379 .  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 , held that a State in an apportionment of state representatives and senators among districts and counties could not deprive voters in *818 the more populous counties of their proportionate share of representatives and senators.  "The right to vote freely for the candidate of one's choice is of the essence of a democratic society, and any restrictions on that right strike at the heart of representative government.
