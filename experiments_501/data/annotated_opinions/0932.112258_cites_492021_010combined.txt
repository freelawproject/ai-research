 [1] For 15 years, respondents, a class of inmates and certain publishers, have claimed that these regulations violate their First Amendment rights under the standard of review enunciated in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396 (1974).  [2] They mount a facial challenge to the regulations as well as a challenge to the regulations as applied to 46 specific publications excluded by the Bureau.  After a 10-day bench trial, the District Court refrained from adopting the Martinez standard.  Instead, it favored an approach more deferential to the judgment of prison authorities and upheld the regulations without addressing the propriety of the 46 specific exclusions.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a, 43a-47a.  The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, utilized the Martinez standard, found the regulations wanting, *404 and remanded the case to the District Court for an individualized determination of the constitutionality of the 46 exclusions.  Abbott v. Meese, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d 1166</citedDecision> (1987).  Petitioners, officials of the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Prisons, sought certiorari.  We granted the writ in order to determine the appropriate standard of review.  Meese v. Abbott, 485 U. S. 1020 (1988).  We now hold that the District Court correctly anticipated that the proper inquiry in this case is whether the regulations are "reasonably related to legitimate penological interests," Turner v. Safley, 482 U. S. 78, 89 (1987), and we conclude that under this standard the regulations are facially valid.  We therefore disagree with the Court of Appeals on the issue of facial validity, but we agree with that court's remand of the case to the District Court for a determination of the validity of the regulations as applied to each of the 46 publications.  II We are concerned primarily with the regulations set forth at 28 CFR §§ 540.70 and 540.71 (1988), first promulgated in 1979.

482 U. S., at 90-91.  We agree with the District Court that these regulations, on their face, are not an "exaggerated response" to the problem at hand: no obvious, easy alternative has been established.  Regarding the all-or-nothing rule, we analyze respondents' proposed alternatives to that rule as alternative means of accommodating respondents' asserted rights.  The District Court discussed the evidence and found, on the basis of testimony in the record, that petitioners' fear that tearing out the *419 rejected portions and admitting the rest of the publication would create more discontent than the current practice was "reasonably founded." App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  The Court of Appeals did not contest the District Court's factual finding as such, but ruled that upholding a practice merely because it is based upon "reasonably founded" fears is improper under Martinez : the Court of Appeals held that this finding "conflicts with the holding of Martinez that prison administrators have the burden of showing that a restrictive practice is `generally necessary.' " 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 194, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d, at 1174</citedDecision> .  As we here do not apply the Martinez standard, we reject the Court of Appeals' sole ground for questioning the District Court's findings in this respect.  In our view, when prison officials are able to demonstrate that they have rejected a less restrictive alternative because of reasonably founded fears that it will lead to greater harm, they succeed in demonstrating that the alternative they in fact selected was not an "exaggerated response" under Turner .  Furthermore, the administrative inconvenience of this proposed alternative is also a factor to be considered and adds additional support to the District Court's conclusion that petitioners were not obligated to adopt it.  See Wolfish, 441 U. S., at 549 .  V In sum, we hold that Turner 's reasonableness standard is to be applied to the regulations at issue in this case, and that those regulations are facially valid under that standard.  We agree with the remand for an examination of the validity of the regulations as applied to any of the 46 publications introduced at trial as to which there remains a live controversy.  See 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 196, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d, at 1176</citedDecision> .  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  *420 JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.  An article in Labyrinth, a magazine published by the Committee for Prisoner Humanity & Justice, began as follows: "In January 1975, William Lowe, a black prisoner at the United States Penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana died of asthma.  .  .

 This casual discarding of " `the secure foundation' " of considered precedent ill serves the orderly development of the law. See Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 190-191 (1976) (STEVENS, J., concurring) (quoting B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921)).  II In lieu of Martinez' s rationale, which properly takes into consideration the effects that prison regulations have on the First Amendment rights of nonprisoners, the Court applies a manipulable "reasonableness" standard to a set of regulations that too easily may be interpreted to authorize arbitrary rejections of literature addressed to inmates.  As I pointed out in my partial dissent in Turner , an "open-ended `reasonableness' standard makes it much too easy to uphold restrictions on prisoners' First Amendment rights on the basis of administrative concerns and speculation about possible security risks rather than on the basis of evidence that the restrictions *428 are needed to further an important governmental interest." 482 U. S., at 101, n. 1.  To be sure, courts must give prison administrators some berth to combat the "Herculean obstacles" blocking their efforts to maintain security and prevent escapes or other criminal conduct, see Martinez, 416 U. S., at 404 , and I do not object to those regulations clearly targeted at such interests.  [11] Nevertheless, I agree with the Court of Appeals that provisions allowing prison officials to reject a publication if they find its contents are "detrimental" to "security, good order, or discipline" or "might facilitate criminal activity" are impermissibly ambiguous.  See Abbott v. Meese, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 193, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d 1166, 1173</citedDecision> (1987).  The term "detrimental" invites so many interpretations that it scarcely checks administrators' actions.  Similarly, "might facilitate"  in contrast with "encourage" or "advocate"  so attenuates the causal connection between expression and proscribed conduct that the warden has virtually free rein to censor incoming publications.  Despite this vagueness, the Court accepts petitioners' assertion that they need "broad discretion" to prevent internal disorder, and thus holds that all the regulations are facially valid.  See ante, at 416.  This premature leap of faith creates a presumption that rejections pursuant to these regulations are "reasonable"  a presumption that makes likely far less judicial protection of publishers' rights than I believe the First Amendment requires.  As was JUSTICE BLACKMUN in *429 Block v. Rutherford, 468 U. S. 576, 593 (1984) (concurring in judgment), I am concerned that the Court today too readily "substitute[s] the rhetoric of judicial deference for meaningful scrutiny of constitutional claims in the prison setting."

 III If a prison official deems part of a publication's content  even just one page of a book  to present an intolerable security risk, the Bureau's regulations authorize the official to return the entire issue to the publisher.  See 28 CFR § 540.71 (e) (1988).  In their challenge to this all-or-nothing rule, respondents argue that First Amendment interests easily could be accommodated if administrators omitted the objectionable material and forwarded the rest of the publication to the inmate.  The District Court, however, found that "defendants' fears" that "such censorship would create more discontent than the current practice" were "reasonably founded." App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a.  To the contrary, the Court of Appeals applied the Martinez standard and held that "rejection of the balance is not `generally necessary' to protect the legitimate governmental interest involved in the portion properly rejected." 263 U. S. App. D. C., at 193-194, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d, at 1173-1174</citedDecision> .  In this Court petitioners argue that on remand the Court of Appeals should conduct "a detailed analysis of the evidence in this case" to determine if the all-or-nothing rule is "reasonable." Brief for Petitioners 31.  "The validity of that policy," they continue, "will depend, among other things, on the security and administrative justifications for that policy, the availability of alternative courses of action, and the costs and risks associated with employing those alternatives." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> It is remarkable that after 16 years of litigation petitioners have failed to develop an argument that tells us anything about the assumed security or administrative justification for this rule.  Even more remarkable is the Court's conclusion that since it does not apply the Martinez standard, it need not examine the appropriateness of the District Court's finding *432 that the rule was reasonable.  See ante, at 419.  A review of the record reveals that the Court thus defers to "findings" of a security threat that even prison officials admitted to be nonexistent.  There is no evidence that delivery of only part of a publication would endanger prison security.  [17] Rather, the primary *433 justification advanced for the all-or-nothing rule was administrative convenience.  See App. 41, 68.

 In 1978, three publishers.  The Prisoners' Union, Weekly Guardian Associates, and The Revolutionary Socialist League, were added as party plaintiffs.  The suit also challenged several prison practices, largely concerning inmate correspondence, that are not at issue here.  Individual claims for damages were severed in 1979.  A bench trial on the claims for injunctive relief took place in 1981, and a memorandum opinion and accompanying order were issued by the District Court in September 1984.  The Court of Appeals predicated its jurisdiction on 28 U. S. C. § 1292 (a)(1) on the ground that the order of the District Court denied respondents injunctive relief.  Abbott v. Meese, 263 U. S. App. D. C. 186, 187-188, <citedDecision>824 F. 2d 1166, 1167-1168</citedDecision> (1987).  [3]  When the complaint was filed in 1973, the Bureau had not yet issued regulations dealing with management of federal inmates.  See 43 Fed. Reg. 30574 (1978) (proposed rulemaking); 44 Fed. Reg. 38254 (1979) (final rules).  References herein to regulations are to those presently in effect.  They are identical to the version considered by the District Court and the Court of Appeals.  The current version differs in some respects from the 1979 version, but those differences are not material to our present inquiry.  [4]  The term "publication" is defined as "a book (for example, novel, instructional manual), or a single issue of a magazine or newspaper, plus such other materials addressed to a specific inmate as advertising brochures, flyers, and catalogues."

[7]  Under the Administrative Remedy Procedure, a prisoner who has been unable informally to resolve his difficulty may file a formal written complaint.  28 CFR § 542.13 (b) (1988).  If the inmate believes he would be adversely affected if the complaint became known at the prison, he may file the complaint with the Regional Director of the Bureau.  § 542.13(c).  The warden or Regional Director is to respond within 15 or 30 days, respectively.  § 542.14.
