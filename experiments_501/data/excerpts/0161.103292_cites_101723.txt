 1 They *110 were heard in succession and may be decided together.  In each case the Commissioner of Internal Revenue' included the trust property in the decedent’s gross estate.  In Nos. 110, 111 and 112 his determination was reversed by the Board of Tax Appeals, 34 B. T. A. 575, and the Board was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, 102 F. 2d 1 .  In No. 183, the taxpayer paid under protest, successfully sued for recovery in the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and his judgment was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 103 F. 2d 834 .  In No. 399, the Commissioner was in part successful before the Board of Tax Appeals, 36 B. T. A. 669, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the Board, 104 F. 2d 1011 .  Neither here nor below does the issue turn on the un-glossed text of § 302 (c).  In its enforcement, Treasury and courts alike encounter three recent decisions of this Court, Klein v. United States, <citedDecision>283 U. S. 231</citedDecision> , Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., 296 U. S. 39 , and Becker v. St. Louis Trust Co., Ibid. 48.  Because of the difficulties which lower courts have found in applying the distinctions made by these cases and the seeming disharmony .of their results, when judged-by the controlling .purposes of the estate tax law, we brought the cases here.  All involve dispositions of property by way of trust in which the settlement provides for return or reversion of the corpus J;o the donor upon a contingency terminable at his death?  Whether the transfer made by the decedent in his lifetime is “intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death” by reason of that which he retained, is the crux of the problem.  We must put to one side questions that arise under sections of the estate tax law other than § 302 (c) — sections, that is, relating to transfers taking place at death.  Section 302 (c) deals with *111 property not technically passing at death but with interests theretofore created.  The taxable event is a transfer inter vivos.  But the measure of the tax is the value of the transferred property at the time when death brings it into enjoyment.  We turn to the cases which beget the difficulties.  In <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> v. United <citedDecision>States, supra,</citedDecision> decided in 1931, the decedent during his lifetime had conveyed land to his wife for her lifetime, “and if she shall die prior to the decease of said grantor then and in that event she shall by virtue hereof take no greater or other estate in said lands and the reversion in fee in and to the same shall in that event remain vested in said grantor, .  .  .” The instrument further provided, “Upon condition and in the event that said grantee shall survive the said grantor, then and in that case only the said grantee shall by virtue of this conveyance take, have, and hold the said lands in fee simple, .  .  .” The taxpayer contended that the decedent had reserved a mere “possibility of reverter” and that such a “remote interest,” 2 extinguishable upon the grantor’s death, was not sufficient to bring the conveyance within the reckoning of the taxable estate.  This Court held otherwise.  It rejected formal distinctions pertaining to the law of real property as irrelevant criteria in this field of taxation.  “Nothing is to be gained,” it was said, “by multiplying words in respect of the various niceties of the art of conveyancing or the law of contingent and vested remainders.  It is perfectly plain that ‘'the death of the grantor was the indispensable and intended event which brought the larger estate into being for the grantee and effected its transmission from the dead to the living, thus satisfying the terms of the taxing act and justifying the tax imposed.” <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>United States, supra, at 234</citedDecision> .  *112 The inescapable rationale of this decision, rendered by a unanimous Court, was that the statute taxes, not merely those interests which are deemed to pass at death according to refined technicalities of the law of property.  It also taxes inter vivos transfers that are too much akin to testamentary dispositions not to be subjected to the same excise.  By bringing into the gross estate at his death that which the.  settlor gave contingently upon it, this Court fastened on the vital factor.  It refused to subordinate the plain purposes of a modern fiscal measure to^the wholly unrelated origins of the recondite learning of ancient property law. Surely the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> decision was not intended to encourage the belief that a change merely in the phrasing of a grant would serve to create a judicially cognizable difference in the scope of § 302 (c), although the grantor retained in himself the possibility of regaining the transferred property upon precisely the same contingency.  The teaching of the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> case is exactly the opposite.  3 In 1935 the St. Louis Trust cases came here.  A rational application of the principles of the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> case to the situations now before us calls for scrutiny of the particulars in the St. Louis cases in order to extract their relation to the doctrine of the earlier decision.  In Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., supra, the decedent had conveyed property in trust, the income of which was to be paid to his daughter during her life, but at her death “If the grantor still be living, the Trustee shall forthwith .  .  .  transfer, pay, and deliver the entire estate to the grantor, to be his absolutely.” But “If the grantor be then not living” then the income, was to be *113 devoted to the settlor s wife if she were living, and upon the death of both daughter and wife, if he were not living, the trust property was to go to the daughter’s children, or if she left none, to the grantor’s next of kin.  In Becker v. St. Loyds Trust Co., supra, the decedent had declared himself trustee of property with the income to be accumulated or, at his discretion, to be paid over to his daughter during her life. The instrument fur-' ther provided that “If the said beneficiary should die before my death, then this trust estate shall thereupon revert to me and become mine immediately and absolutely, or ... if I should die before her death, then this property shall thereupon become hers immediately and absolutely .  .  On the authority of the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> case the Commissioner had included in the taxable estates the gifts to which, in the St. Louis Trust cases, the grantor’s death had given definitive measure.  If the wife- had predeceased the set-tlor in the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> case, he would have been repossessed of his property.  His wife’s interests were freed from this contingency by the husband’s prior death, and because of the effect of his death this Court swept the gift into the gross estate.  So in Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., the grantor would have become repossessed of the granted corpus had his daughter predeceased him.  But he predeceased her and by that event her interest ripened to full dominion.  The same analysis applies to the Becker case. In all three situations the result and effect were the same.  The event which gave to the beneficiaries a dominion over property which they did not have prior to the donor’s death was an act of nature outside the grantor’s “control, design or volition.” 296 U. S. 39, 43 .  But it was no more and no less “fortuitous,” so. far as the grantor’s “control, design or volition” was concerned, in the St. *114 Louis Trust cases than it was in the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> case. In none of the three cases did the dominion over property which finally came to the beneficiary fall by virtue of the grantor’s will, except by his provision that his own death should establish such final and complete dominion.  And yet a mere difference in phrasing- the circumstance by which identic interests in property were brought into being — varying forms of words in the creation of the same worldly interests — was found sufficient to exclude the St. Louis Trust settlements from the application of the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> doctrine.  Four members of the Court saw no difference.  They relied on the governing principle of § 302 (c) that Congress meant to include in the gross estate inter vivos gifts “which may be resorted to, as a substitute for a will, in making dispositions of property operative at death.” 296 U. S. at 46 .  To effectuate this purpose practical considerations applicable to taxation and not the “niceties of the art of conveyancing” were their touchstone.  “Having in mind,” said the dissenters, “the purpose of the statute and the breadth of its language it would seem to be of no consequence what particular conveyancers’ device — what particular string — the decedent selected to hold in suspense the ultimate disposition of his property until the .moment of his death.  In determining whether a taxable transfer becomes complete, only at death we look to substance, not to form .  .  .  However we label the device it is .  but a means by which the gift, is rendered incomplete until the donor’s death.” 296 U. S. at 47 .  For the majority in the St. Louis Trust Company cases, these practicalities had less significance than the formal categories of property law. The grantor’s death, the majority said, in Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co., “simply put an end to what, at best, wás a mere possibility óf a reverter by extinguishing it — that is to say, by converting what was merely possible into an utter impossibility.” 296 U. S. *115 39, 43 .  This was precisely the mode of argument which had been rejected in <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> v. United <citedDecision>States, supra.</citedDecision> We are now asked to accept all three decisions as constituting a .coherent body of law, and to apply their distinctions to the trusts before us.  In Nos. 110, 111 and 112 (Helvering v. Hallock) the decedent in 1919 created a trust under a separation agreement, giving 'the income to his wife for life, with this further provision: “If and when Anne Lamson Hallock shall die then and in such event .  .  .  the within trust shall terminate and said Trustee shall .  .  .

 And yet the nature of that interest under Connecticut law and the scope of the Connecticut court’s adjudication of that interest were made the subject' of lively controversy be *118 fore us.  The importation of these distinctions and controversies from the law of property into the administration of the estate tax precludes a fair and workable tax system.  Essentially the same interests, judged from the point of view of wealth, will be taxable or not, depending upon elusive and subtle casuistries which may have their historic justification but possess no relevance for tax purposes.  5 These unwitty diversities of the law of property derive from medieval concepts as to the necessity of a continuous seisin.  6 Distinctions which originated under a feudal economy when land dominated social relations are peculiarly irrelevant in the application of tax measures now so largely directed toward intangible wealth.  Our real problem, therefore, is to determine whether we are to adhere to a harmonizing principle in the construction of § 302 (c), or whether we are to multiply gossamer distinctions between the present cases and the three earlier ones.  Freed from the distinctions, introduced by the St. Louis Trust cases, the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> case furnishes such a harmonizing principle.  Does, then, the doctrine of stare decisis compel us to accept the distinc *119 tions made in the St. Louis Trust cases as starting points for still finer distinctions spun out of the tenuosities of surviving feudal law?  We think not.  We think the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> case rejected the presupposition of such distinctions for the fiscal judgments which § 302 (c) demands.  We recognize that stare deciJs embodies an important social policy.  It represents an element of continuity in law, and is rooted in the psychologic need to satisfy reasonable expectations.  But stare decisis is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.  Nor have we in the St. Louis Trust cases rules of decision around which, by the accretion of time and the response of affairs, substantial interests have established themselves.  No such conjunction of circumstances requires perpetuation of what we must regard as the deviations of the St. Louis Trust decisions from the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> doctrine.  We have not before us interests created or maintained in reliance on those cases. We do not mean to imply that the inevitably empiric process of construing tax legislation should give rise to an estoppel against the responsible exercise of the judicial process.  But it is a fact that in all the cases before us the settlements were made and the settlors died before the St. Louis Trust decisions.  Nor does want of specific Congressional repudiations of the St. Louis Trust cases serve as an implied instruction by Congress to us not to reconsider, in the light of new experience, whether those decisions, in conjunction with the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> case, make for dissonance of doctrine.  It would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from reexamining its own doctrines.  To explain the cause of *120 non-action by Congress when Congress itself sheds no light is to venture into speculative unrealities.  7 Congress may not have had its attention directed to an undesirable decision; and there is no indication that as to the St. Louis Trust cases it had, even by any bill that found its way into a committee pigeon-hole.  Congress may not have had its attention so directed for any number of reasons that may have moved the Treasury to stay its hand. But certainly such inaction by the Treasury can hardly operate as a controlling administrative practice, through *121 acquiescence, tantamount to an estoppel barring reexamination by this Court of distinctions which it had drawn.  8 Various considerations of parliamentary tactics and strategy might be suggested as reasons for the inaction of the Treasury and of Congress, but they would only be sufficient to indicate that we walk on quicksand when we try to find in the absence of corrective legislation a controlling legal principle.  This Court, unlike the House of Lords, 9 has from the beginning rejected a doctrine of disability at self-correction.  Whatever else may be said about want of Congressional action to modify by legislation the result in the St. Louis Trust cases, it will hardly be urged that the rea *122 son was Congressional approval of those distinctions between the St. Louis Trust and the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> cases to which four members of this Court could not give assent.  By imputing to Congress a hypothetical recognition of coherence between the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> and the St. Louis Trust cases, we cannot evade our own responsibility for reconsidering in the light of further experience, the validity of distinctions which this Court has itself created.  Our problem then is not that of rejecting a settled statutory construction.  The real problem is whether a principle shall prevail over its later misapplications.  Surely we are not bound by reason or by the considerations that underlie stare decisis to persevere in distinctions taken in the application of a statute which, on further examination, appear consonant neither with the purposes of the statute nor with this Court’s own conception of it.  We therefore reject as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> doctrine — untenable because they drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept and to which we adhere.  In Nos. 110, 111, 112 and 183, the judgments are Reversed.  In No. 399, the judgment is Affirmed., c. 27, 44 Stat. 9 , as amended by § 803 of the Revenue Act of 1932, c. 209, 47 Stat. 169 , 279: “The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated— “(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death, or of which he has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, under which he has retained 'for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or for any period which does not in fact end before his death (1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, the property, or (2) the right, either alone or in conjunction with any person, to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom; except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money’s worth.  Any transfer- of a material part of his property in' the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to his death without such consideration, shall, unless shown to the con--' trary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title.” Petitioner’s Brief, <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> v. United States, pp. 11-13 Some indication of the influence of <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> v. United States upon the lower courts may be found in Sargent v. White, 50 F. 2d 410 and Union Trust Co. v. United States, 54 F. 2d 152 , cert. denied, 286 U. S. 547 .  Cf. Commissioner v. Schwarz, 74 F. 2d 712 .

The Chief Justice concurs in the result upon the ground that each of these cases is controlled by our decision in Klein v. United States, <citedDecision>283 U. S. 231</citedDecision> .

*123 Mr. Justice Roberts, dissenting.  There is certainly a distinction in fact between the transaction considered in Klein v. United States, <citedDecision>283 U. S. 231</citedDecision> , and those under review in Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., 296 U. S. 39 , and Becker v. St. Louis Uniont Trust Co., 296 U. S. 48 .  The courts, the Board of Tax Appeals, and the Treasury have found no difficulty in observing the distinction in specific cases. I believe it is one of substance, not merely of terminology, and not dependent on the niceties of conveyancing or recondite doctrines of ancient property law. But if I am wrong in this, I still think the judgments in Nos. 110-112, and 183 should be affirmed and that in 399 should be reversed.  The rule of interpretation adopted in the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases should now be followed for two reasons: First, that rule was indicated by decisions of this court as the one applicable in the circumstances here disclosed, as early as 1927; was progressively developed and applied by the Board of Tax Appeals, the lower federal courts, and this court, up to the decision of McCormick v. Burnet, 283 U. S. 784 , in 1931; and has since been followed by those tribunals in not less than fifty cases. It ought not to be set aside after such a history.  Secondly.  The rule was not contrary to any treasury regulation; was, indeed, in accord with such regulations as there were on the subject; .was subsequently embodied in a specific regulation, and, with this background, Congress has three times reenacted the law without amending § 302 (c) in respect of the matter here in issue.  The settled doctrine, that reenactment of a statute so construed, without alteration, renders such construction a part of the statute itself, should not be ignored but observed.  *124 1.

 If A makes a present irrevocable transfer in trust, conditioned that he shall receive the income for life and, at his death, the principal shall go to B, B is at once legally *126 invested with the principal.  A’s life .estate ceases at his death.  Nothing then passes.  There is no tax imposed by the statute because there is no transfer any more than there would be in the case of a similar life estate given A by his grandmother.  (This is May v. Heiner, 281 U. S. 238 .) If, on the other hand, A creates an estate for years or for life in B, retaining the remaining beneficial interest .in the property for himself, and, whether by the terms of the grant, or by the terms of A’s will, or under the intestate law, that remainder passes to someone else at his death, such passage renders the transfer taxable.  (This is <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> v. United <citedDecision>States, supra.)</citedDecision> If what A does is to transfer his property irrevocably, with provision that it shall be.  enjoyed successively by various persons for life and then go absolutely to a named person, but that if he, A, shall outlive that person, the property shall come back to him, and A dies in the lifetime of the person in question, A has merely" lost the chance that the beneficial ownership of the property may revert to him.  That chance cannot pass under his will or under the intestate laws.  As there is no transfer which can become effective at his death by the shifting of any interest from him, no tax is imposed, (This is McCormick v. Burnet, supra, and Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Company, supra.) 2.  These governing principles were indicated as early as 1927 4 and were thereafter developed, in application to specific cases, in a consistent line of authorities.  In May v. Heiner, supra, it was held that a transfer in trust under which the income was payable to.  the trans-feror’s husband for his life and, after his death, to the transferor during her life, with remainder to her children, was not subject to tax as a'transfer intended to; take effect *127 in possession or enjoyment at or after death.

 This court said (p. 243): “.  .  .  At the death of Mrs. May no interest in the property held under the trust deed, passed from her to the living; title thereto had been definitely fixed by the trust deed.  The interest therein which she possessed .immediately prior to her death was obliterated by that event.” [Italics supplied.] It will be noted that this is the equivalent of the Treasury’s statement, supra, that such an interest lapses at death'.  That decision is indistinguishable in principle from the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases and the instant cases; and what was there said serves to distinguish the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> case. McCormick v. Burnet followed May v. Heiner .  The court there held that neither a reservation by the grantor of a life estate with remainders over, nor a provision for a reverter in case all the beneficiaries should die in the lifetime of the grantor, made the gifts transfers intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the grantor’s death.  In the Circuit Court of Appeals the Commissioner urged that the provision for payment of the trust estate to the settlor in case she survived all the beneficiaries rendered the transfer taxable.  That court dealt at length with the point and sustained his view.  ( 43 F. 2d 277, 279 .) The Commissioner made the same contention in this court, but it was overruled upon the authority of May v. Heiner .  Then came the two St. Louis Union Trust Company cases, decided upon the authority of May v. Heiner and McCormick v. Burnet .
