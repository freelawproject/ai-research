 The doctrine has been given general application, e. g., United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard Steamship Co., 284 U. S. 474 (Shipping Board); Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp., 303 U. S. 41 (National Labor Relations Board).  Compare, also, Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line Co., 211 U. S. 210 ; Anniston Mfg. Co. v. Davis, 301 U. S. 337 .  23 In Manufacturers Railway Co. v. United States, 246 U. S. 457 , the Court treated as reviewable the action of the Commission in failing to require an absorption of switching charges or a requested joint rate but held not reviewable refusal to fix divisions.. In part this may have been on the theory that the issue of the divisions was not properly before the Commission.  See 246 U. S. at 482-483 .  In United States v. New River Co., 265 U. S. 533 , the Court held reviewable the action of the full Commission’ dismissing a complaint by a shipper against certain car practices held invalid by one division of the Commission.  Standard Oil Co. v. United States, 283 U. S. 235 , held not reviewable the action of the Commission refusing to grant reparations, but the main basis of the decision was not the “negative order” doctrine but the statutory scheme dealing with reparations.  In Alton R. Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>287 U. S. 229</citedDecision> , the Court held reviewable the action of the Commission refusing to interfere with divisions set by a railroad in violation of a previous agreement, the Court stating that the action of the Commission validated divisions which were previously invalid.  See <citedDecision>287 U. S. at 236-237</citedDecision> .  24 The only test which can be derived from the cases in notes 11-13, 23, supra, is that an order is “affirmative” if it has the legal effect *141 of changing the status quo, permitting what was previously not’ allowed or compelling what was previously not required.  But on this test the order in the Lehigh Valley case was “affirmative.” The decision in the New River Coal Co. case could hardly be hung on such a gossamer thread as this test, since there the only change in the status quo resulting from an order considered “affirmative” was that the order of'the full Commission held unobjectionable a car practice which was the subject of complaint.  A division of the Commission in the same proceeding had stated that the practice was invalid and should be abandoned and it was abandoned- After the full Commission found the practice not invalid and dismissed the complaint, the practice was adopted again.  25 See Alton R. Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>287 U. S. 229, 235</citedDecision> .  26 This becomes clear on analysis of the precise problem presented in the Procter & Gamble case. It was a dispute between shippers who owned private cars and those who did not as to the distribution of the cars owned by the carriers.  The Commission was called upon to resolve that economic conflict by virtue of its authority to prevent practices which unfairly discriminated against one group at the expense of the other.  - Its final decision was based on a comprehensive policy concerning the place of.  private cars in our transportation system.  Had the prior practice of the carriers been inconsistent with this policy, and the order of the Commission compelled a change, the private car shippers would admittedly have been entitled to test the validity of the Commission ruling in the courts, subject, of course, to the canons of administrative finality.  It seems capricious that the fact that the Commission’s order authorizing the preservation of the status gwojfhould block any review at all. The force of this reasoning is emphasized when it is realized what Small factors may determine whether the status quo has' been changed, e. g., a difference of views within the Commission, as in the New River Coal Co. case, supra, note 24.
