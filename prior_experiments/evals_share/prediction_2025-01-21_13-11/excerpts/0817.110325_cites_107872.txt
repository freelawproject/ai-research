Case of interest: Alderman v. United States (1969)
-----------------------
us of Jones, and we granted certiorari in order to resolve the controversy.[2] 444 U.S. 989 (1979).

II
As early as 1907, this Court took the position that remedies for violations of constitutional rights would only be afforded to a person who "belongs to the class for whose sake the constitutional protection is given." Hatch v. Reardon, 204 U.S. 152, 160. The exclusionary rule is one form of remedy afforded for Fourth Amendment violations, and the Court in Jones v. United States held that the Hatch v. Reardon principle properly limited its availability. The Court reasoned that ordinarily "it is entirely proper to require of one who seeks to challenge the legality of a search as the basis for suppressing relevant evidence that he . . . establish, that he himself was the victim of an invasion of privacy." 362 U.S., at 261. Subsequent attempts to vicariously assert violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of others have been repeatedly rejected by this Court. Alderman v. United States, <caseOfInterest>394 U.S. 165</caseOfInterest>, 174 (1969); Brown v. United States, 411 U. S. *87 223, 230 (1973). Most recently, in Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128 (1978), we held that "it is proper to permit only defendants whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated to benefit from the [exclusionary] rule's protections." Id., at 134.
Even though the Court in Jones recognized that the exclusionary rule should only be available to protect defendants who have been the victims of an illegal search or seizure, the Court thought it necessary to establish an exception. In cases where possession of the seized evidence was an essential element of the offense charged, the Court held that the defendant was not obligated to establish that his own Fourth Amendment rights had been violated, but only that the search and seizure of the evidence was unconstitutional.[3] Upon such a showing, the exclusionary rule would be available to prevent the admission of the evidence against the defendant.
The Court found that the prosecution of such p

ed and the property seized." 439 U.S., at 136. (Emphasis added.)
[6]  Legal possession of the seized good may be sufficient in some circumstances to entitle a defendant to seek the return of the seized property if the seizure, as opposed to the search, was illegal. See, e. g., United States v. Lisk, 522 F.2d 228 (CA7 1975) (Stevens, J.), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1078 (1976), although in that case the property was ultimately found not to have been illegally seized. We need not explore this issue since respondents did not challenge the constitutionality of the seizure of the evidence.
[7]  The respondents argue that the prosecutor's access to the suppression testimony will unfairly provide the prosecutor with information advantageous to the preparation of his case and trial strategy. This argument, however, is surely applicable equally to possessory and nonpossessory offenses. This Court has clearly declined to expand the Jones rule to other classes of offenses, Alderman v. United States, <caseOfInterest>394 U.S. 165 </caseOfInterest>(1969); Brown v. United States, 411 U.S. 223 (1973), and thus respondents' rationale cannot support the retention of a special rule of automatic standing here.
[8]  A number of courts considering the question have held that such testimony is admissible as evidence of impeachment. Gray v. State, 43 Md. App. 238, 403 A.2d 853 (1979); People v. Douglas, 66 Cal. App. 3d 998, 136 Cal. Rptr. 358 (1977); People v. Sturgis, 58 Ill. 2d 211, 317 N.E.2d 545 (1974). See also Woody v. United States, 126 U. S. App. D. C. 353, 354-355, 379 F.2d 130, 131-132 (Burger, J.), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 961 (1967).
