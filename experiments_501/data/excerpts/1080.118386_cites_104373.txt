 Helms v. Picard, 151 F. 3d 347, 371 (1998).  It thought such an approach required not only by the lack of coherence but also by Agostini’s admonition to lower courts to abide by any applicable holding of this Court even though that holding might seem inconsistent with our subsequent decisions, see Agostini, 521 U. S., at 237 .  The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that Agostini , by recognizing our rejection of the rule that “all government aid that directly assists the *807 educational function of religious schools is invalid,” id., at 225 , had rejected a premise of Meek , hut that court nevertheless concluded that Agostini had neither directly overruled Meek and Wolman nor rejected their distinction between textbooks and other in-kind aid.  The Fifth Circuit therefore concluded that Meek and Wolman controlled, and thus it held Chapter 2 unconstitutional.  We granted certiorari.  527 U. S. 1002 (1999).  II The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment dictates that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” In the over 50 years since Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, <citedDecision>330 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1947), we have consistently struggled to apply these simple words in the context of governmental aid to religious schools.  4 As we admitted in Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672 (1971), “candor compels the acknowledgment that we can only dimly perceive the boundaries of permissible government activity in this sensitive area.” Id., at 678 (plurality opinion); see Lemon, 403 U. S., at 671 (White, J., concurring in judgment).  In Agostini , however, we brought some clarity to our ease law, by overruling two anomalous precedents (one in whole, the other in part) and by consolidating some of our previously disparate considerations under a revised test.  Whereas in Lemon we had considered whether a statute (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or (3) creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion, see 403 U. S., at 612-613, in Agostini we modified Lemon for purposes of evaluating aid to schools and examined only the first and second factors, see 521 U. S., at 222-223 .  We acknowledged *808 that our cases discussing excessive entanglement had applied many of the same considerations as had our cases discussing primary effect, and we therefore recast Lemon’s entanglement inquiry as simply one criterion relevant to determining a statute’s effect.  Agostini, supra, at 232-233 .  We also acknowledged that our eases had pared somewhat the factors that could justify a finding of excessive entanglement.

 For to say that a program does not create an incentive to choose religious schools is to say that the private choice is truly “independent,” Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 .  See Agostini, supra, at 232 (holding that Title I did not create any impermissible incentive, because its services were “available to all children who meet the Act’s eligibility requirements, no matter what their religious beliefs or where they go to school”); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (discussing, in successive sentences, neutrality, private choice, and financial incentives, respectively); Witters, supra, at 488 (similar).  When such an incentive does exist, there is a greater risk that one could attribute to the government any indoctrination by the religious schools.  See Zobrest, supra, at 10 .  We hasten to add, what should be obvious from the rule itself, that simply because an aid program offers private schools, and thus religious schools, a benefit that they did not previously receive does not mean that the program, by reducing the cost of securing a religious education, creates, under Agostini’s second criterion, an “incentive” for parents to choose such an education for their children.  For any aid will have some such effect.  See Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 ; Everson, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 17</citedDecision> ; see also Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 .  B Respondents inexplicably make no effort to address Chapter 2 under the Agostini test.  Instead, dismissing Agostini as factually distinguishable, they offer two rules that they contend should govern our determination of whether Chapter 2 has the effect of advancing religion.  They argue first, and chiefly, that “direct, nonineidental” aid to the primary educational mission of religious schools is always impermissible.  Second, they argue that provision to religious schools of aid that is divertible to religious use is similarly impermis *815 sible.  7 Respondents’ arguments are inconsistent with our more recent ease law, in particular Agostini and Zobrest , and we therefore reject them.  1 Although some of our earlier eases, particularly Ball, 473 U. S., at 393-394 , did emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect aid, the purpose of this distinction was *816 merely to prevent “subsidization” of religion, see id., at 394 .

 See 487 U. S., at 636, 647, 648 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  Although we left it open on remand for the District Court to reaffirm its prior finding, we took pains to emphasize the narrowness of the “pervasively sectarian” category, see id., at 620-621 (opinion of the Court), and two *827 Members of the majority questioned whether this category was “well-founded,” id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring).  Then, in Zobrest and Agostini , we upheld aid programs to children who attended schools that were not only pervasively sectarian but also were primary and secondary.  Zobrest , in turning away a challenge based on the pervasively sectarian nature of Salpointe Catholic High School, emphasized the presence of private choice and the absence of government-provided sectarian content.  509 U. S., at 13 .  Agostini , in explaining why the aid program was constitutional, did not bother to mention that pervasively sectarian schools were at issue, 13 see 521 U. S., at 226-235 , a fact that was not lost on the dissent, see id., at 249 (opinion of Souter, J.).  In disregarding the nature of the school, Zobrest and Agostini were merely returning to the approach of <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> and Allen, in which the Court upheld aid programs to students at pervasively sectarian schools.  See post, at 875, 885-886 (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting this fact regarding Everson); Allen, 392 U. S., at 251-252 (Black, J., dissenting); id., at 262-264, 269-270 , n. (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Second, the religious nature of a recipient should not matter to the constitutional analysis, so long as the recipient adequately furthers the government’s secular purpose.  See supra, at 810.  If a program offers permissible aid to the religious (including the pervasively sectarian), the areligious, and the irreligious, it is a mystery which view of religion the government has established, and thus a mystery what the constitutional violation would be.  The pervasively sectarian recipient has not received any special favor, and it is most bizarre that the Court would, as the dissent seemingly does, reserve special hostility for those who take their religion seriously, who think that their religion should affect the whole *828 of their lives, or who make the mistake of being effective in transmitting their views to children.  Third, the inquiry into the recipient’s religious views required by a focus on whether a school is pervasively sectarian is not only unnecessary but also offensive.

 19 To the extent that Meek and Wolman conflict with this holding, we overrule them.  Our conclusion regarding Meek and Wolman should come as no surprise.  The Court as early as Wolman itself left no doubt that Meek and Allen were irreconcilable, see 433 U. S., at 251, n. 18 , and we have repeatedly reaffirmed Allen since then, see, e. g., Agostini, supra, at 231 .  (In fact, Meek , in *836 discussing the materials-and-equipment program, did not even cite Allen.  See Meek, 421 U. S., at 368-366 .) Less than three years after Wolman , we explained that Meek did not, despite appearances, hold that “all loans of secular instructional material and equipment inescapably have the effect of direct advancement of religion.” Regan, 444 U. S., at 661-662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Then, in Mueller , we conceded that the aid at issue in Meek and Wolman did “resembl[e], in many respects,” the aid that we had upheld in <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> and Allen.  463 U. S., at 393 , and n. 3; see id., at 402, n. 10 ; see also id., at 415 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (viewing Allen as incompatible with Meek and Wolman , and the distinction between textbooks and other instructional materials as “simply untenable”).  Most recently, Agostini , in rejecting Ball's assumption that “all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid,” Agostini, supra, at 225 , necessarily rejected a large portion (perhaps all, see Ball, 473 U. S., at 395 ) of the reasoning of Meek and Wolman in invalidating the lending of materials and equipment, for Ball borrowed that assumption from those cases. See 521 U. S., at 220-221 (Shared Time program at issue in Ball was “surely invalid ... [g]iven the holdings in Meek and Wolman” regarding instructional materials and equipment).  Today we simply acknowledge what has long been evident and was evident to the Ninth and Fifth Circuits and to the District Court. The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed.  It is so ordered.  Chapter 2 is now technically Subchapter VI of Chapter 70 of 20 U. S. C., where it was codified by the Improving America’s Schools Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-382, 108 Stat. 3707.  For convenience, we will use the term "Chapter 2,” as the lower courts did.  Prior to 1994, Chapter 2 was codified at 20 U. S. C. §§2911-2976 (1988 ed.).  Congress in 1988 amended the section governing the sorts of materials and equipment available under Chapter 2.  Compare 20 U. S. C. § 3832 (1)(B) (1982 ed.) with § 7351(b)(2) (1994 ed.).  The record in this case dosed in 1989, and the effect of the amendment is not at issue.  Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, <citedDecision>330 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1947) (upholding reimbursement to párente for costs of busing their children to public or private school).  Cases prior to <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> discussed the issue only indirectly, see, e. g., Vidal v. Philadelphia, 2 How. 127, 198-200 (1844); Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U. S. 50, 81 (1908), or evaluated aid to schools under other provisions of the Constitution, see Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370, 374-375 (1930).  Justice O’Connor acknowledges that “neutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs,” one that our recent eases have “emphasized .  .  .  repeatedly.” Post, at 838 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The majority opinion also noted that only a small portion of the overall aid under the State’s program would go to religious education, see Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , but it appears that five Members of the Court thought this point irrelevant.  See id., at 491, n. 8 (Powell, J., joined by Burger, C. J., and Rehnquist, J., concurring) (citing Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 401 (1983), to assert that validity of program “does not depend on the fact that petitioner appeal’s to be the only handicapped student who has sought to use his assistance to pursue religious training”); 474 U. S., at 490 (White, J., concurring) (agreeing with “most of Justice Powell’s concurring opinion with respect to the relevance of Mueller,” but not specifying further); id., at 493 (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (agreeing with Justice Powell’s reliance on Mueller and explaining that the program did not have an impermissible effect, because it was neutral and involved private choice, and thus “[n]o reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts before us an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief”).

 Post, at 910.  The coordinator of the Jefferson Parish LEA ordered the books recalled sometime in the summer or early fall of 1985, and it appears that the schools had complied with the recall order by the second week of December 1985.  App. 162a, 80a-81a.  Respondents filed suit in early December.  This self-correction is a key distinction between this instance of providing improper content and the evidence of actual diversion.  See n. 17, supra. Indeed, as petitioners observe, to require exclusion of religious schools from such a program would raise serious questions under the Free Exercise Clause.  See, e. g., Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U. S. 520,532 (1993) (“At a minimum, the protections of the Free Exercise Clause pertain if the law at issue discriminates against some or all religious beliefs”); Everson, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 16</citedDecision> ; cf Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1996) (holding that Free Speech Clause bars exclusion of religious viewpoints from limited public forum).

 1, eludes elegant conceptualization simply because the prohibition applies to such distinct phenomena as state churches and aid to religious schools, and as applied to school aid has *870 prompted challenges to programs ranging from construction subsidies to hearing aids to textbook loans.  Any criteria, moreover, must not only define the margins of the establishment prohibition, but must respect the succeeding Clause of the First Amendment guaranteeing religion’s free exercise.  Ibid. It is no wonder that the complementary constitutional provisions and the inexhaustably various circumstances of their applicability have defied any simple test and have instead produced a combination of general rules often in tension at their edges.  If coherence is to be had, the Court has to keep in mind the principal objectives served by the Establishment Clause, and its application to school aid, and their recollection may help to explain the misunderstandings that underlie the majority’s result in this case. A At least three concerns have been expressed since the founding and run throughout our First Amendment jurisprudence.  First, compelling an individual to support religion violates the fundamental principle of freedom of conscience.  Madison’s and Jefferson’s now familiar words establish clearly that liberty of personal conviction requires freedom from coercion to support religion, 1 and this means that the government can compel no aid to fund it.  Madison put it simply: “[T]he same authority which can force a citizen to *871 contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment.” Memorial and Remonstrance ¶ 3, reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, <citedDecision>330 U. S. 1,64, 65-66</citedDecision> (1947).  Any tax to establish religion is antithetical to the command “that the minds of men always be wholly free.” <citedDecision>Id., at 12</citedDecision> (discussing Madison’s Memorial and Remonstrance); <citedDecision>id., at 13</citedDecision> (noting Jefferson’s belief that “compel[ling] a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical;.  .  .  even the forcing him to support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pastor, whose morals he would make his pattern” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. ofVa., 515 U. S. 819, 868-874 (1995) (Souter, J., dissenting).  Second, government aid corrupts religion.  See Engel v. Vitale, 370 U. S. 421, 431 (1962) (“[The Establishment Clause’s] first and most immediate purpose rested on the belief that a union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion”); <citedDecision>Everson, supra, at 53</citedDecision> (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  Madison argued that establishment of religion weakened the beliefs of adherents so favored, strengthened their opponents, and generated “pride and indolence in the Clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; [and] in both, superstition, bigotry and persecution.” Memorial and Remonstrance ¶7, quoted in Everson, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 67</citedDecision> .  “[Experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> In a variant of Madison’s concern, we have repeatedly noted that a government’s favor to a particular religion or sect threatens to taint it with “corrosive secularism.” Lee v. Weisman, 505 U. S. 577, 608 (1992) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board *872 of Ed. of School Dish No. 71, Champaign Cty., 333 U. S. 203, 228 (1948).  “[Government and religion have discrete interests which are mutually best served when each avoids too close a proximity to the other.  It is not only the nonbeliever who fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and controversies into the civil polity, but in as high degree it is the devout believer who fears the secularization of a creed which becomes too deeply involved with and dependent upon the government.” School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U. S. 203, 259 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring).  See also Rosenberger, supra, at 890-891 (Souter, J., dissenting).  Third, government establishment of religion is inextricably linked with conflict.  <citedDecision>Everson, supra, at 8-11</citedDecision> (relating colonists’ understanding of recent history of religious persecution in countries with established religion); Engel, supra, at 429 (discussing struggle among religions for government approval); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 623 (1971).  In our own history, the turmoil thus produced has led to a rejection of the idea that government should subsidize religious education, id., at 645-649 (opinion of Brennan, J.) (discussing history of rejection of support for religious schools); McCol-lum, supra, at 214-217 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.), a position that illustrates the Court’s understanding that any implicit endorsement of religion is unconstitutional, see County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U. S. 573, 592-594 (1989).  2 *873 B These concerns are reflected in the Court’s classic summation delivered in <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> v. Board of Education, swpra, its first opinion directly addressing standards governing aid to religious schools: 3 “The ‘establishment of religion’ clause of the First Amendment means at least this: Neither a state nor the Federal Government can set up a church.  Neither can pass laws which aid one religion, aid all religions, or prefer one religion over another.  Neither can force nor influence a person to go to or to remain away from church against his will or force him to profess a belief or disbelief in any religion.  No person can be punished for entertaining or professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance.  No tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion.  Neither a state nor the Federal Government can, openly or secretly, participate in the affairs of any religious organizations or groups and vice versa.  In the words of Jefferson, the clause against establishment of religion by law was intended to erect ‘a wall of separation between church and State.’” <citedDecision>330 U.S., at 15</citedDecision> -16 (quoting Reynolds v. United States, 98 U. S. 145, 164 (1879)).  The most directly pertinent doctrinal statements here are these: no government “can pass laws which aid one religion *874 [or] all religions .... No tax in any amount .  .  .  can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions .  .  .  whatever form they may adopt to teach .  .. religion.” <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 16</citedDecision> .  Thus, the principle of “no aid,” with which no one in <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> disagreed.  4 Immediately, however, there was the difficulty over what might amount to “aid” or “support.” The problem for the <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> Court was not merely the imprecision of the words, but the “other language of the [First Amendment that] commands that [government] eannot hamper its citizens in the free exercise of their own religion,” ibid., with the consequence that government must “be a neutral in its relations with groups of religious believers and non-believers,” <citedDecision>id., at 18</citedDecision> .  Since withholding some public benefits from religious groups could be said to “hamper” religious exercise indirectly, and extending other benefits said to aid it, an argument-proof formulation of the no-aid principle was impossible, and the Court wisely chose not to attempt any such thing.  Instead it gave definitive examples of public benefits provided pervasively throughout society that would be of some value to organized religion but not in a way or to a degree that could sensibly be described as giving it aid or violating the neutrality requirement: there was no Establishment Clause concern with “such general government services as ordinary police and fire protection, connections for sewage disposal, public highways and sidewalks.” <citedDecision>Id., at 17-18</citedDecision> .  These “benefits of public welfare legislation,” <citedDecision>id., at 16</citedDecision> , extended in modern times to virtually every member of the population and valuable to every person and association, were the paradigms of advantages that religious organiza *875 tions could enjoy consistently with the prohibition against aid, and that governments could extend without deserting their required position of neutrality.  But paradigms are not perfect fits very often, and government spending resists easy classification as between universal general service or subsidy of favoritism.  The 5-to-4 division of the <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> Court turned on the inevitable question whether reimbursing all parents for the cost of transporting their children to school was close enough to police protection to tolerate its indirect benefit in some degree to religious schools, with the majority in <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> thinking the reimbursement statute fell on the lawful side of the line. Although the state scheme reimbursed parents for transporting children to sectarian schools, among others, it gave “no money to the schools.  It [did] not support them.  Its legislation [did] no more than provide a general program to help parents get their children, regardless of their religion, safely and expeditiously to and from accredited schools.” <citedDecision>Id., at 18</citedDecision> .  The dissenters countered with factual analyses showing the limitation of the law’s benefits in fact to private school pupils who were Roman Catholics, <citedDecision>id., at 20</citedDecision> (Jackson, J., dissenting), and indicating the inseparability of transporting pupils to school from support for the religious instruction that was the school’s raison d’etre, id., at 45-46 (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> is usefully understood in the light of a successor case two decades later, Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968), in which the challenged government practice was lending textbooks to pupils of schools both public and private, including religious ones (as to which there was no evidence that they had previously supplied books to their classes and some evidence that they had not, id., at 244, n. 6 ).  By the time of Allen , the problem of classifying the state benefit, as between aid to religion and general public service consistent with government neutral *876 ity, had led to the formulation of a “test” that required secular, primary intent and effect as necessary conditions of any permissible scheme.  Id., at 243 .  Again the Court split, upholding the state law in issue, but with Everson’s majority author, Justice Black, now in dissent.  What is remarkable about Allen today, however, is not so much its division as its methodology, for the consistency in the way the Justices went about deciding the ease transcended their different conclusions.  Neither side rested on any facile application of the “test” or any simplistic reliance on the generality or even-handedness of the state law. Disagreement concentrated on the true intent inferrable behind the law, the feasibility of distinguishing in fact between religious and secular teaching in church schools, and the reality or sham of lending books to pupils instead of supplying books to schools.  The majority, to be sure, cited the provision for books to all schoolchildren, regardless of religion, 392 U. S., at 243 , just as the <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> majority had spoken of the transportation reimbursement as going to all, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 16</citedDecision> , in each case for the sake of analogy to the provision of police and fire services.  5 But the stress was on the practical significance of the actual benefits received by the schools.  As <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> had rested on the understanding that no money and no support went to the school, <citedDecision>id., at 18</citedDecision> , Allen emphasized that the savings to parents were devoid of any measurable effect in teaching religion, 392 U. S., at 243-244 .  Justice Harlan, concurring, summed up the approach with his observations that the required government “[neutrality is ... a coat of many colors,” and quoted Justice Goldberg’s conclusion, that there was “ 'no simple and clear measure’... by which this or any [religious school aid] case may readily be decided,” id., at 249 (quoting Schempp, 374 U. S., at 306 ).  *877 After <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> and Allen , the state of the law applying the Establishment Clause to public expenditures producing some benefit to religious schools was this: 1.  Government aid to religion is forbidden, and tax revenue may not be used to support a religious school or religious teaching.  2.  Government provision of such paradigms of universally general welfare benefits as police and fire protection does not count as aid to religion.  3.  Whether a law’s benefit is sufficiently close to universally general welfare paradigms to be classified with them, as distinct from religious aid, is a function of the purpose and effect of the challenged law in all its particularity.  The judgment is not reducible to the application of any formula.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Government must maintain neutrality as to religion, “neutrality” being a conclusory label for the required position of government as neither aiding religion nor impeding religious exercise by believers.  “Neutrality” was not the name of any test to identify permissible action, and in particular, was not synonymous with even-handedness in conferring benefit on the secular as well as the religious.  Today, the substantive principle of no aid to religious mission remains the governing understanding of the Establishment Clause as applied to public benefits inuring to religious schools.  The governing opinions on the subject in the 85 years since Allen have never challenged this principle.  The *878 eases have, however, recognized that in actual Establishment Clause litigation over school aid legislation, there is no pure aid to religion and no purely secular welfare benefit; the effects of the laws fall somewhere in between, with the judicial task being to make a realistic allocation between the two possibilities.  The Court’s decisions demonstrate its repeated attempts to isolate considerations relevant in classifying particular benefits as between those that do not discernibly support of threaten support of a school’s religious mission, and those that cross or threaten to cross the line into support for religion.  II A The most deceptively familiar of those considerations is “neutrality,” the presence or absence of which, in some sense, we have addressed from the moment of <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> itself.  I say “some sense,” for we have used the term in at least three ways in our cases, and an understanding of the term’s evolution will help to explain the concept as it is understood today, as well as the limits of its significance in .  Establishment Clause analysis.  “Neutrality’ has been employed as a term to describe the requisite state of government equipoise between the forbidden encouragement and discouragement of religion; to characterize a benefit or aid as secular; and to indicate evenhandedness in distributing it.  As already mentioned, the Court first referred to neutrality in <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> , simply stating that government is required “to be a neutral” among religions and between religion and nonreligion.  <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 18</citedDecision> .. Although “neutral” may have carried a hint of inaction when we indicated that the First Amendment “does not require the state to be [the] adversary” of religious believers, ibid., or to cut off general government services from religious organizations, <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> provided no explicit definition of the term or further indication of what the government was required to do or not do to be *879 “neutral” toward religion.  In practical terms, “neutral” in <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> was simply a term for government in its required median position between aiding and handicapping religion.  The second major ease on aid to religious schools, Allen , used “neutrality” to describe an adequate state of balance between government as ally and as adversary to religion, see 392 U. S., at 242 (discussing line between “state neutrality to religion and state support of religion”).  The term was not further defined, and a few subsequent school cases used “neutrality” simply to designate the required relationship to religion, without explaining how to attain it.  See, e. g., Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672, 677 (1971) (describing eases that “see[k] to define the boundaries of the neutral area between [the Religion Clauses] within which the legislature may legitimately act”); Roemer v. Board of Public Works of Md., 426 U. S. 736,747 (1976) (plurality opinion of Blackmun, J.) (“Neutrality is what is required.  The State must confine itself to secular objectives, and neither advance nor impede religious activity.  Of course, that principle is more easily stated than applied”); see also Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U. S. 756, 782 (1973) (describing “neutral posture” toward religion); Roemer, swpra, at 745-746 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (“The Court has enforced a scrupulous neutrality by the State, as among religions, and also as between religious and other activities”); cf. Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 254 (1977) (quoting Lemon and noting difficulty of religious teachers’ remaining “‘religiously neutral’ ”).  The Court began to employ “neutrality” in a sense different from equipoise, however, as it explicated the distinction between “religious” and “secular” benefits to religious schools, the latter being in some circumstances permissible.  See infra, at 884-899 (discussing considerations).  Even though both <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> and Allen had anticipated some such distinction, neither ease had used the term “neutral” in this way.  In <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> , Justice Black indicated that providing *880 police, fire, and similar government services to religious institutions was permissible, in part because they were “so separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function.” <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 18</citedDecision> .  Allen similarly focused on the fact that the textbooks lent out were “secular” and approved by secular authorities, 392 U. S., at 245 , and assumed that the secular textbooks and the secular elements of education they supported were not so intertwined with religious instruction as “in fact [to be] instrumental in the teaching of religion,” id., at 248 .  Such was the Court’s premise in Lemon for shifting the use of the word “neutral” from labeling the required position of the government to describing a benefit that was nonreligious.  We spoke of “[o]ur decisions from <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> to Allen [as] permitting] the States to provide church-related schools with secular, neutral, or nonideological services, facilities, or materials,” 403 U. S., at 616, and thereafter, we regularly used “neutral” in this second sense of “secular” or “nonreligious.” See, e. g., Tilton, supra, at 687-688 (characterizing subsidized teachers in Lemon as “not necessarily religiously neutral,” but buildings as “religiously neutral”); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 365-366 (1975) (describing instructional materials as “ ‘secular, nonideologi-eal and neutral’ ” and “wholly neutral”); id., at 372 (describing auxiliary services as “religiously neutral”); Roemer, supra, at 751 (opinion of Blaekmun, J.) (describing Tilton’s approved buildings as “neutral or nonideologieal in nature”); 426 U. S., at 754 (describing Meek’s speech and hearing services as “neutral and nonideologieal”); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dish, 509 U. S. 1, 10 (1993) (discussing translator as “neutral service”); Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 232 (1997) (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was “neutral and nonideologieal”); cf. Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 478 (1973) (noting that District Court approved testing cost reimbursement as payment for services that were “ ‘secular, neutral, or nonideologieal’ ” in character, citing Lemon, 403 U. S., at *881 616 ); Wolman, supra, at 242 (quoting Lemon, supra, at 616 (describing permitted services aid as “secular, neutral, or nonideologieal”)).  The shift from equipoise to secular was not, however, our last redefinition, for the Court again transformed the sense of “neutrality” in the 1980’s.  Reexamining and reinterpreting <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> and Allen , we began to use the word “neutral” to mean “evenhanded,” in the sense of allocating aid on some common basis to religious and secular recipients.  Again, neither <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> nor Allen explicitly used “neutral” in this manner, but just as the label for equipoise had lent itself to referring to the secular characteristic of what a government might provide, it was readily adaptable to referring to the generality of government services, as in Everson’s paradigms, to which permissible benefits were compared.  The increased attention to a notion of evenhanded distribution was evident in Nyquist , where the Court distinguished the program under consideration from the government services approved in Allen and <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> , in part because “the class of beneficiaries [in <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> and Allen] included all schoolchildren, those in public as well as those in private schools.” 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38.  Nyquist then reserved the question whether “some form of public assistance .  .  .  made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublie nature of the institution benefitted” would be permissible.  Id., at 783, n. 38 (citations omitted).  Subsequent eases continued the focus on the “generality^ of the approved government services as an important characteristic.  Meek , for example, characterized <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> and Allen as approving “a general program” to pay bus fares and to lend school books, respectively, 421 U. S., at 360 ; id., at 360, n. 8 (approving two similar “general program[s]” in New York and Pennsylvania), and Wolman upheld diagnostic services described as “ ‘general welfare services for children,’” 433 U.S., at 243 (quoting Meek, supra, at 371, n. 21 ).  *882 Justice Blaekmun, writing in Roemer , first called such a “general” or evenhanded program “neutral,” in speaking of “facial neutrality’ as a relevant consideration in determining whether there was an Establishment Clause violation.  “[RJeligious institutions need not be quarantined from public benefits that are neutrally available to all.” 426 U. S., at 746-747 ; see also id., at 746 (discussing buses in <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> and school books in Allen as examples of “neutrally available” aid).  In Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983), the Court adopted the redefinition of neutrality as evenhandedness, citing Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38 , and alluding to our discussion of equal access in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981).  The Court upheld a system of tax deductions for sectarian educational expenses, in part because such a “facially neutral law,” 463 U. S., at 401 , made the deduction available for “all parents, including those whose children attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools,” id., at 397 .  Subsequent cases carried the point forward.  See, e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487 (1986) (quoting Nyquist and characterizing program as making aid “available generally”); Zobrest, swpra, at 8-9 (discussing “government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion” and citing Mueller and Witters); Agos-tini, supra, at 231 (discussing aid allocated on the basis of “neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, .  .  .  made available to both religious and secular beneficiaries on a nondiscriminatory basis”); see also Rosen-berger, 515 U. S., at 839 (“[T]he guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse”).  In sum, “neutrality” originally entered this field of jurisprudence as a eonelusory term, a label for the required rela *883 tionship between the government and religion as a state of equipoise between government as ally and government as adversary.  Reexamining Everson’s paradigm cases to derive a prescriptive guideline, we first determined that "neutral” aid was secular, nonideologieal, or unrelated to religious education.  Our subsequent reexamination of <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> and Allen, beginning in Nyquist and culminating in Mueller and most recently in Agostini , recast neutrality as a concept of "evenhandedness.” There is, of course, good reason for considering the generality of aid and the evenhandedness of its distribution in making close calls between benefits that in purpose or effect support a school’s religious mission and those that do not.  This is just what <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> did.  Even when the disputed practice falls short of Everson’s paradigms, the breadth of evenhanded distribution is one pointer toward the law’s purpose, since on the face of it aid distributed generally and without a religious criterion is less likely to be meant to aid religion than a benefit going only to religious institutions or people.  And, depending on the breadth of distribution, looking to evenhandedness is a way of asking whether a benefit can reasonably be seen to aid religion in fact; we do not regard the postal system as aiding religion, even though parochial schools get mail.  Given the legitimacy of considering evenhandedness, then, there is no reason to avoid the term “neutrality” to refer to it.  But one crucial point must be borne in mind.  In the days when "neutral” was used in Everson’s sense of equipoise, neutrality was tantamount to constitutionality; the term was eonclusory, but when it applied it meant that the government’s position was constitutional under the Establishment Clause.  This is not so at all, however, under the most recent use of "neutrality” to refer to generality or evenhandedness of distribution.  This kind of neutrality is relevant in judging whether a benefit scheme so characterized should be seen as aiding a sectarian school’s religious *884 mission, but this neutrality is not alone sufficient to qualify the aid as constitutional.  It is to be considered only along with other characteristics of aid, its administration, its recipients, or its potential that have been emphasized over the years as indicators of just how religious the intent and effect of a given aid scheme really is.  See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 677-678 (opinion of Burger, C. J.) (acknowledging “no single constitutional caliper”); Meek, 421 U. S., at 358-359 (noting considerations as guidelines only and discussing them as a matter of degree); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 383 (1985) (quoting Meek), overruled in part by Agostini, 521 U. S., at 203 ; Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 720 (1994) (opinion of O’Connor, J.) (“Experience proves that the Establishment Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single test”); Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 847-849 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (discussing need for line-drawing); id., at 852 (noting lack of a single “Grand Unified Theory” for Establishment Clause and citing Kiryas Joel)', ef.  Agostini, supra, at 232-233 (examining a variety of factors).  Thus, the basic principle of establishment scrutiny of aid remains the principle as stated in <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> , that there may be no public aid to religion or support for the religious mission of any institution.  B The insufficiency of evenhandedness neutrality as a standalone criterion of constitutional intent or effect has been clear from the beginning of our interpretative efforts, for an obvious reason.  Evenhandedness in distributing a benefit approaches the equivalence of constitutionality in this area only when the term refers to such universality of distribution that it makes no sense to think of the benefit as going to any discrete group.  Conversely, when evenhandedness refers to distribution to limited groups within society, like groups of schools or schoolchildren, it does make sense to regard the benefit as aid to the recipients.  See, e. g., Everson, <citedDecision>330 U. S., *885at 16</citedDecision> (discussing aid that approaches the “verge” of forbidden territory); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 612 (“[W]e can only dimly perceive the lines of demarcation in this extraordinarily sensitive area of constitutional law”); Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 760-761 (noting the “most perplexing questions” presented in this area and acknowledging “‘entangling] precedents’”); Mueller, 463 U. S., at 393 (quoting Lemon); Witters, 474 U. S., at 485 (quoting Lemon).  Hence, if we looked no further than evenhandedness, and failed to ask what activities the aid might support, or in fact did support, religious schools could be blessed with government funding as massive as expenditures made for the benefit of their public school counterparts, and religious missions would thrive on public money.  This is why the consideration of less than universal neutrality has never been recognized as dispositive and has always been teamed with attention to other facts bearing on the substantive prohibition of support for a school’s religious objective.  At least three main lines of enquiry addressed particularly to school aid have emerged to complement evenhandedness neutrality.  First, we have noted that two types of aid recipients heighten Establishment Clause concern: pervasively religious schools and primary and secondary religious schools.  Second, we have identified two important characteristics of the method of distributing aid: directness or indirectness of distribution and distribution by genuinely independent choice.  Third, we have found relevance in at least five characteristics of the aid itself: its religious content; its cash form; its divertibility or actually diversion to religious support; its supplantation of traditional items of religious school expense; and its substantiality.  1 Two types of school aid recipients have raised special concern.  First, we have recognized the fact that the overriding religious mission of certain schools, those sometimes called *886 “pervasively sectarian,” is not confined to a discrete element of the curriculum, Everson, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 22-24</citedDecision> (Jackson, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>id., at 45-47</citedDecision> (Rutledge, J., dissenting), but permeates their teaching.  6 Walz v. Tax Comm’n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 671 (1970); Lemon, supra, at 636-637 (“A school which operates to commingle religion with other instruction plainly cannot completely secularize its instruction.  Parochial schools, in large measure, do not accept the assumption that secular subjects should be unrelated to religious teaching”); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 621-622 (1988) (discussing pervasively sectarian private schools).  Based on record evidence and long experience, we have concluded that religious teaching in such schools is at the core of the instructors’ individual and personal obligations, cf. Canon 803, §2, Text & Commentary 568 (“It is necessary that the formation and education given in a Catholic school be based upon the principles of Catholic doctrine; teachers are to be outstanding for their correct doctrine and integrity of life”), and that individual religious teachers will teach religiously.  7 Lemon, 403 U. S., at 615-620 ; id., at 635- *887 641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 ; Meek, 421 U. S., at 369-371 ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 249-250 (discussing nonseverability of religious and secular education); Ball, 473 U. S., at 399-400 (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by Agostini, 521 U. S., at 236 .  As religious teaching cannot be separated from secular education in such schools or by such teachers, we have concluded that direct government subsidies to such schools are prohibited because they will inevitably and impermissibly support religious indoctrination.  Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12 (discussing Meek and Ball).
**Dissenting Opinion**
 On the one hand, we have understood how the youth of the students in such schools makes them highly susceptible to religious indoctrination.  Lemon, supra, at 616 (“This process of inculcating religious doctrine is, of course, enhanced by the impressionable age of the pupils, in primary schools particularly”).  On the other, we have recognized that the religious element in the education offered in most sectarian primary and secondary schools is far more intertwined with the secular than in university teaching, where the natural and academic skepticism of most older students may separate the two, see Tilton, supra, at 686-689 ; Roermer, 426 U. S., at 750 .  Thus, government benefits accruing to these pervasively religious primary and secondary schools raise special dangers of diversion into support for the religious indoctrination of children and the involvement of government in religious training and practice.  *888 2 We have also evaluated the portent of support to an organization’s religious mission that may be inherent in the method by which aid is granted, finding pertinence in at least two characteristics of distribution.  First, we have asked whether aid is direct or indirect, observing distinctions between government schemes with individual beneficiaries and those whose beneficiaries in the first instance might be religious schools.  <citedDecision>Everson, supra, at 18</citedDecision> (bus fare supports parents and not schools); Allen, 392 U. S., 243 -244, and n. 6 (textbooks go to benefit children and parents, not schools); Lemon, supra, at 621 (invalidating direct aid to schools); Levitt, supra, at 480, 482 (invalidating direct testing aid to schools); Witters, 474 U. S., at 487-488 (evaluating whether aid was a direct subsidy to schools).  Direct aid obviously raises greater risks, although recent eases have discounted this risk factor, looking to other features of the distribution mechanism.  Agostini, supra, at 225-226 .  8 *889 Second, we have distinguished between indirect aid that reaches religious schools only incidentally as a result of numerous individual choices and aid that is in reality directed to religious schools by the government or in practical terms selected by religious schools themselves.  Mueller, 463 U. S., at 399 ; Witters, supra, at 488 ; Zobrest, supra, at 10 .  In these cases, we have declared the constitutionality of programs providing aid directly to parents or students as tax deductions or scholarship money, where such aid may pay for education at some sectarian institutions, Mueller, supra, at 399 ; Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , but only as the result of “genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients,” id., at 487 .  We distinguished this path of aid from the route in Ball and Wolman , where the opinions indicated that “[wjhere ... no meaningful distinction can be made between aid to the student and aid to the school, the concept of a loan to individuals is a transparent fiction.” 474 U. S., at 487, n. 4 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  9 3 In addition to the character of the school to which the benefit accrues, and its path from government to school, a number of features of the aid itself have figured in the elassifica- *890 tions we have made.  First, we have barred aid with actual religious content, which would obviously run afoul of the ban on the government’s participation in religion, Everson, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 16</citedDecision> ; Walz, 397 U. S., at 668 ; cf. Lemon, 403 U. S., at 617 (discussing variable ideological and religious character of religious teachers compared to fixed content of books).  In eases where we have permitted aid, we have regularly characterized it as “neutral” in the sense (noted supra, at 879-881) of being without religious content.  See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 688 (characterizing buildings as “religiously neutral”); Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 (describing translator as “neutral service”); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 232 (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was “neutral and nonideological”).  See also ante, at 820 (plurality opinion) (barring aid with religious content).  10 Second, we have long held government aid invalid when circumstances would allow its diversion to religious education.  The risk of diversion is obviously high when aid in the form of government funds makes its way into the coffers of religious organizations, and so from the start we have understood the Constitution to bar outright money grants of aid to religion.  11 See Everson, 830 U. S., at 16 (“[The State] *891 cannot consistently with the ‘establishment of religion’ clause of the First Amendment contribute tax-raised funds to the support of an institution which teaches the tenets and faith of any church”); id., at 18 (“The State contributes no money to the schools.  It does not support them”); Allen, 892 U. S., at 243-244 (“[N]o funds or books are furnished to parochial schools, and the financial benefit is to parents and children, not schools”); Walz, supra, at 675 (“Obviously a direct money subsidy would be a relationship pregnant with involvement and, as with most governmental grant programs, could encompass sustained and detailed administrative relationships for enforcement of statutory or administrative standards”); Lemon, supra, at 612 (identifying “three main evils” against which Establishment Clause was to protect as “sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity,” citing Walz); 403 U. S., at 621 (distinguishing direct financial aid program from <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> and Allen and noting problems with required future surveillance); Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 762, 774 (striking down “direct money grants” for maintaining buildings because there was no attempt to restrict payments to those expenditures related exclusively to secular purposes); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480, 482 (striking down “direct money grant” for testing expenses); 12 Hunt v. *892 McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 745, n. 7 (1973) (noting approved aid is “no expenditure of public funds, either by grant or loan”); Wolman, 433 U. S., at 239 , and n. 7 (noting that “statute does not authorize any payment to nonpublic school personnel for the costs of administering the tests”); Agostini, 521 U. S., at 228-229 (emphasizing that approved services are not “distributed ‘directly to the religious schools.’ ... No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a school-wide basis” (citations omitted)); Bowen, 487 U. S., at 614-615 ; Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 (noting that “we have recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions”); ef.  Lemon, 403 U. S., at 619-620 (noting that safeguards and accounting inspections required to prevent government funds from supporting religious education will cause impermissible entanglement); Roemer, 426 U. S., at 753-757 (approving segregated funds after finding recipients not pervasively religious); Ball, 473 U. S., at 392-393 (noting that “[w]ith but one exception, our subsequent eases have struck down attempts by States to make payments out of *893 public tax dollars directly to primary or secondary religious educational institutions”)?  overruled in part by Agostini, supra, at 236 ; Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 (“It is equally well-settled .  .. that the State may not grant aid to a religious school, whether cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct subsidy to the religious school” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); Rosenberger, supra, at 851-852 (O’CONNOR, J., concurring) (noting that student fee was not a tax).  Divertibility is not, of course, a characteristic of cash alone, and when examining provisions for ostensibly secular supplies we have considered their susceptibility to the service of religious ends.  13 In upholding a scheme to provide students with secular textbooks, we emphasized that “each book loaned must be approved by the public school authorities; only secular books may receive approval.” Allen, 392 U. S., at 244-245 ; see also Meek, 421 U. S., at 361-362 (opinion of Stewart, J.); Wolman, supra, at 237-238 .  By the same token, we could not sustain provisions for instructional materials adaptable to teaching a variety of subjects.  14 Meek, supra, at 363 ; Wolman, supra, at 249-250 .  While the textbooks had a known and fixed secular content not readily di~ *894 vertible to religious teaching purposes, the adaptable materials did not.  15 So, too, we explained the permissibility of busing on public routes to schools but not busing for field trips designed by religious authorities specifically because the latter trips were components of teaching in a pervasively religious school.  Compare Everson, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 17</citedDecision> (noting wholly separate and secular nature of public bus fare to schools), with Wolmcm, 433 U. S., at 254 (“The field trips are an integral part of the educational experience, and where the teacher works within and for a sectarian institution, an unacceptable risk of fostering of religion is an inevitable byproduct” (citation omitted)).  We likewise were able to uphold underwriting the expenses of standard state testing in religious schools while being forced to strike down aid for testing designed by the school officials, because the latter tests could be used to reinforce religious teaching.  Compare id., at 240 (“[T]he State provides both the schools and the school district with the means of ensuring that the minimum standards are met. The nonpublic school does not control the content of the test or its result.  This serves to prevent the use of the test as , part of religious teaching, and thus avoids that kind of direct aid to religion found present in Levitt”); Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646, 661-662 (1980) (same), with Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 (“We cannot ignore the substantial risk that these examinations, prepared by teachers under the authority of réligious institutions, will be drafted with an eye, unconsciously or otherwise, to inculcate students in the religious precepts of the sponsoring church”).  *895 With the same point in mind, we held that buildings constructed with government grants to universities with religious affiliation must be barred from religious use indefinitely to prevent the diversion of government funds to religious objectives.  Tilton, 403 U. S., at 683 (plurality opinion) (“If, at the end of 20 years, the building is, for example, converted into a chapel or otherwise used to promote religious interests, the original federal grant will in part have the effect of advancing religion.  To this extent the Act therefore trespasses on the Religion Clauses”); see also Hunt, 413 U. S., at 743-744 .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Divertibility was, again, the issue in an order remanding an as-applied challenge to a grant supporting counseling on teenage sexuality for findings that the aid had not been used to support religious education.  Bowen, 487 U. S., at 621 ; see also id., at 623 (O’Connor, J., concurring).  And the most recent example of attention to the significance of divertibility occurred in our explanation that public school teachers could be assigned to provide limited instruction in religious schools in Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-227 , a majority of the Court rejecting the factual assumption that public school teachers could be readily lured into providing religious instruction.  16 *896 Third, our cases have recognized the distinction, adopted by statute in the Chapter 2 legislation, between aid that merely supplements and aid that supplants expenditures for offerings at religious schools, the latter being barred.  Although we have never adopted the position that any benefit that flows to a religious school is impermissible because it frees up resources for the school to engage in religious indoctrination, Hunt, supra, at 743 , from our first decision holding it permissible to provide textbooks for religious schools we have repeatedly explained the unconstitutionality of aid that supplants an item of the school’s traditional expense.  See, e. g., Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370, 375 (1930) (noting that religious schools “are not the beneficiaries of these appropriations.  They obtain nothing from them, nor are they relieved of a single obligation because of them” (internal quotation marks omitted)); Everson, <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 18</citedDecision> (specifically noting that bus fare program did not support or fund religious schools); Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 (stating that “the financial benefit [of providing the textbooks] is to parents and children, not to schools” (footnote omitted)); id., *897 at 244, n. 6 (explicitly recognizing that “the record contains no evidence that any of the private schools in appellants’ districts previously provided textbooks for their students”); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 656 (opinion of Brennan, J.) (noting no aid to schools was involved in Allen).  We ignored this prohibition only once, in Regan, 444 U. S., at 646 ; see also ante, at 16, n. 7, where reimbursement for budgeted expenses of required testing was not struck down, but we then quickly returned to the rule as a guideline for permissible aid.  17 In Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12 , the Court specifically distinguished Meek and Ball by explaining that the invalid programs in those eases “relieved sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students.” In Agostini , the Court made a point of noting that the objects of the aid were “by law supplemental to the regular curricula” and, citing Zobrest , explained that the remedial education services did not relieve the religious schools of costs they would otherwise have borne.  521 U. S., at 228 (citing Zobrest, supra, at 12 ).  The Court explicitly stated that the *898 services in question did not “supplant the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already provided in New York City’s sectarian schools.” 521 U. S., at 229 .  Finally, we have recognized what is obvious (however imprecise), in holding “substantial” amounts of aid to be unconstitutional whether or not a plaintiff can show that it supplants a specific item of expense a religious school would have borne.  18 In Meek, 421 U. S., at 366 , we invalidated the loan of instructional materials to religious schools because “faced with the substantial amounts of direct support authorized by [the program], it would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania’s church-related elementary and secondary schools and then characterize [the program] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.” Id., at 365 .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 As a break with consistent doctrine the plurality’s new criterion is unequaled in the history of Establishment Clause interpretation.  Simple on its face, it appears to take even-handedness neutrality and in practical terms promote it to a single and sufficient test for the establishment constitutionality of school aid.  Even on its own terms, its errors are manifold, and attention to at least three of its mistaken assumptions will show the degree to which the plurality’s proposal would replace the principle of no aid with a formula for generous religious support.  First, the plurality treats an external observer’s attribution of religious support to the government as the sole impermissible effect of a government aid scheme.  See, e. g., ante, at 809 (“[N]o one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government”).  While perceived state endorsement of religion is undoubtedly a relevant concern under the Establishment Clause, see, e. g., Allegheny County, 492 U. S., at 592-594 ; see also Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd. v. Pinette, 515 U. S. 753, 772-774 (1995) (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in *901 judgment); id., at 786-787 (Souter, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), it is certainly not the only one.  <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> made this clear from the start: secret aid to religion by the government is also barred.  <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 16</citedDecision> .  State aid not attributed to the government would still violate a taxpayer’s liberty of conscience, threaten to corrupt religion, and generate disputes over aid.  In any event, since the same-terms feature of the scheme would, on the plurality’s view, rule out the attribution or perception of endorsement, adopting the plurality’s rule of facial evenhandedness would convert neutrality into a dispositive criterion of establishment constitutionality and eliminate the effects enquiry directed by Allen, Lemon, and other eases.  Under the plurality’s rule of neutrality, if a program met the first part of the Lemon enquiry, by declining to define a program’s recipients by religion, it would automatically satisfy the second, in supposedly having no impermissible effect of aiding religion.  19 Second, the plurality apparently assumes as a fact that equal amounts of aid to religious and nonreligious schools will have exclusively secular and equal effects, on both external perception and on incentives to attend different schools.  See ante, at 809-810, 813-814.  But there is no reason to believe that this will be the case; the effects of same-terms aid may not be confined to the secular sphere at all. This is the reason that we have long recognized that unrestricted aid to religious schools will support religious teaching in ad *902 dition to secular education, a fact that would be true no matter what the supposedly secular purpose of the law might be.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 The relevance of this consideration is simply a matter of common sense: where religious indoctrination pervades school activities of children and adolescents, it takes great care to be able to aid the school without supporting the doctrinal effort.  This is obvious.  The plurality nonetheless condemns any enquiry into the pervasiveness of doctrinal content as a remnant of anti-Catholie bigotry (as if evangelical Protestant schools and Orthodox Jewish yeshivas were never pervasively sectarian 29 ), and it equates a refusal to aid religious schools with hostility to religion (as if aid to religious teaching were not *913 opposed in this very case by at least one religious respondent 30 and numerous religious amici curiae 31 in a tradition claiming descent from Roger Williams).  My concern with these arguments goes not so much to their details 32 as it does to the fact that the plurality’s choice to employ imputations of bigotry and irreligión as terms in the Court’s debate makes one point clear: that in rejecting the principle of no aid to a school’s religious mission the plurality is attacking the most fundamental assumption underlying the Establishment Clause, that government can in fact operate with neutrality in its relation to religion.  I believe that it can, and so respectfully dissent.  Jefferson’s Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom provided “[t]hat no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever-” Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, in 5 The Founder’s Constitution 84 (R Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987); see also Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819, 870-872 (1995) (Souter, J., dissenting).  We have “previously recognized that the provisions of the First Amendment, in the drafting and adoption of which Madison and Jefferson played such leading roles, had the same objective and were intended to provide the same protection against governmental intrusion on religious liberty as the Virginia statute.” Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, <citedDecision>330 U. S. 1, 13</citedDecision> (1947).  The plurality mistakes my recognition of this fundamental concern.  Ante, at 825-826.  The Court may well have moved away from considering the political divisiveness threatened by particular instances of aid as a practical criterion for applying the Establishment Clause case by case, but we have never questioned its importance as a motivating concern behind the Establishment Clause, nor could we change history to find that sectarian conflict did not influence the Framers who wrote it.  The Court upheld payments by Indian tribes to apparently Koman Catholic schools in Quick Bear v. Leupp, 210 U. S. 50 (1908), suggesting in dicta that there was no Establishment Clause problem, but it did not squarely face the question.  Nor did the Court address a First Amendment challenge to a state program providing textbooks to children in Cochran v. Louisiana Bd. of Ed., 281 U. S. 370 (1930); it simply concluded that the program had an adequate public purpose.  The Court first squarely faced the issue in <citedDecision>Everson</citedDecision> .  While Everson’s dissenters parted company with the majority over the specific question of school buses, the Court stood as one behind the principle of no aid for religious teaching.  <citedDecision>330 U. S., at 15-16</citedDecision> ; <citedDecision>id., at 25-26</citedDecision> (Jackson, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>id., at 28-29, 31-32</citedDecision> (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  In fact, religious education in Roman Catholic schools is defined as part of required religious practice; aiding it is thus akin to aiding a church service.  See 1988 Code of Canon Law, Canon 798, reprinted in The Code of Canon Law: A Text and Commentary 566 (1985) (hereinafter Text & Commentary) (directing parents to entrust children to Roman Catholic schools or otherwise provide for Roman Catholic education); Canon 800, §2, Text & Commentary 567 (requiring the faithful to support establishment and maintenance of Roman Catholic schools); Canons 802, 804, Text & Commentary 567, 568 (requiring diocesan bishop to establish and regulate schools “imparting an education imbued with the Christian spirit”).  Although the Court no longer assumes that public school teachers assigned to religious schools for limited purposes will teach religiously, see Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 228-228 (1997), we have never abandoned the presumption that religious teachers will teach just that way.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 615-620 (1971); id., at 635-641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 480 (1973); Meek v. Pittenger, 421 U. S. 349, 369-371 (1975); Wol- *887 man v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 249-250 (1977); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 399-400 (1985) (O’Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by Agostini, supra, at 236 .  Cf. NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 504 (1979) (“The church-teacher relationship in a church-operated school differs from the employment relationship in a public or other nonreligious school”).  In Agostini , the Court indicated that “we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid,” 521 U. S., at 225 , and cited Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1998).
