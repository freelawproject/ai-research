**Concurrence Opinion**
See Rose v. Clark, 478 U. S. 570, 579 (1986). Accordingly, “the Court has applied harmless-error analysis to a wide range of errors and has recognized that most constitutional errors can be harmless.” Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S. 279, 306 (1991); cf. id., at 309-310 (listing examples of structural errors). In particular, the Court has subjected jury instructions plagued by constitutional error to harmless-error analysis. See, e. g., Yates v. Evatt, 500 U. S. 391, 402 (1991) (taint of an unconstitutional burden-shifting jury instruction subject to harmless-error analysis); Carella v. California, 491 U. S. 263, 266 (1989) (per curiam) (jury instruction containing an erroneous mandatory presumption subject to harmless-error analysis); Pope v. Illinois, 481 U. S. 497, 502-504 (1987) (jury instruction misstating an element of an offense subject to harmless-error analysis); Rose, supra, at 581-582 (jury instruction containing an erroneous rebuttable presumption subject to harmless-error analysis); but see Sullivan, 508 U. S., at 280-282 (erroneous burden of proof instruction not subject to harmless-error analysis). The Court today has no occasion to review the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the constitutional error here “cannot be harmless.” 28 F. 3d, at 951. As to the latter, in United States v. Olano, <targetCase>507 U. S. 725</targetCase>, 732 (1993), the Court noted the limitations on “plain error” review by the courts of appeals under Rule 52(b). “The first limitation on appellate authority under Rule 52(b) is that there indeed be an ‘error.’” <targetCase>Ibid.</targetCase> Second, “the error [must] be ‘plain.’” Id., at 734. Thus, “[a]t a minimum, a *527 court of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule 52(b) unless the error is clear under current law.” <targetCase>Ibid.</targetCase> Third, the plain error must “‘affec[t] substantial rights,’” ibid., i. e., “in most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial,” <targetCase>ibid.</targetCase> Finally, if these three prerequisites are met, the decision to correct forfeited error remains within the sound discretion of the court of appeals. A court of appeals, however, should not exercise that discretion unless the error “ ‘ “seriously affeet[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.” ’ ” Id., at 732. In affirming the Court of Appeals, the Court concludes that “it is fair to say that we cannot hold for respondent today while still adhering to the reasoning and the holding of [Sinclair v. United States, 279 U. S. 263 (1929)].” Ante, at 519-520. Before today, every Court of Appeals that has considered the issue, except for the Ninth Circuit, has held that the question of materiality is one of law. See 28 F. 3d, at 955 (Kozinski, J., dissenting) (collecting cases). Thus, it is certainly subject to dispute whether the error in this ease was “clear under current law.” Olano, supra, at 734. The Court, however, does not review the Court of Appeals’ determination that the failure to submit the issue of materiality to the jury constituted “plain error.” 28 F. 3d, at 952.
