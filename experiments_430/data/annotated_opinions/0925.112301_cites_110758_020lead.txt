 The maj ority rej ected as “Pollyannaish” the dissent’s suggestion that flexible application by the relevant administrative bodies would obviate the problem and noted that the proliferation of affirmation laws after Seagram had greatly multiplied the likelihood that distillers would be subject to blatantly inconsistent obligations.  10 The Court squarely rejected New York’s argument that the Twenty-first Amendment, which bans the importation or possession of intoxicating liquors into a State “in violation of the laws thereof,” saved the statute from invalidation under the Commerce Clause.  Although the Court acknowledged that the Amendment vested in New York considerable au- *336 tenance of a national economic union unfettered by state-imposed limitations on interstate commerce 12 and with the autonomy of the individual States within their respective spheres.  13 Taken together, our cases concerning the extraterritorial effects of state economic regulation stand at a minimum for the following propositions: First, the “Commerce Clause .  .  .  precludes the application of a state statute to commerce that takes place wholly outside of the State’s borders, whether or not the commerce has effects within the State,” Edgar v. MITE Corp., <citedDecision>457 U. S. 624, 642-643</citedDecision> (1982) (plurality opinion); see also Brown-Forman, 476 U. S., at 581-583 ; and, specifically, a State may not adopt legislation that has the practical effect of establishing “a scale of prices for use in other states,” Seelig, 294 U. S., at 528 .  Second, a statute that directly controls commerce occurring wholly outside the boundaries of a State exceeds the inherent limits of the enacting State’s authority and is invalid regardless of whether the statute’s extraterritorial reach was intended by the legislature.  The critical inquiry is whether the practical effect of the regulation is to control conduct beyond the boundaries of the State.  Brown-Forman, 476 U. S., at 579 .  Third, the practical effect of the statute must be evaluated not only by considering the consequences of the statute itself, but also by considering how the challenged statute may interact with the legitimate regulatory regimes of other States and what effect would arise if not one, but many or every, State adopted similar legislation.  Generally speaking, the *337 Commerce Clause protects against inconsistent legislation arising from the projection of one state regulatory regime into the jurisdiction of another State.  Cf. CTS Corp. v. Dynamics Corp. of America, 481 U. S. 69, 88-89 (1987).

 The affirmation statute did permit differentials in price based on differing state taxes and transportation costs.  Conn. Gen. Stat. § 30 -63c(b) (1989).  The statute also required out-of-state shippers to offer Connecticut wholesalers every package configuration for each brand of beer offered to wholesalers in the border States.  §30-63c(b), quoted in 532 F. Supp., at 1314, n. 4 .  As amended by 1984 Conn. Pub. Acts 332 , § 30-63b(b) provides: “At the time of posting of the bottle, can, keg or barrel and case price required by section 30-63, every holder of a manufacturer or out-of-state shipper’s permit, or the authorized representative of a manufacturer, shall file with the department of liquor control a written affirmation under oath by the manufacturer or out-of-state shipper of each brand of beer posted certifying that, at the time of posting, the bottle, can or case price, or price per keg, barrel or fractional unit thereof, to the wholesaler permittees is no higher than the lowest price at which each such item of beer is sold, offered for sale, shipped, transported or delivered by such manufacturer or out-of-state shipper to any wholesaler in any state bordering this state.” In addition, Connecticut regulations now provide for posting on the sixth day of each month. App. 157.  As added by 1984 Conn. Pub. Acts 332 , §30-63b(e) provides: “This section shall not prohibit a manufacturer or out-of-state shipper permittee or the authorized representative of a manufacturer from changing prices to any wholesaler in any other state of the United States or in the District of Columbia, or to any state or agency of a state which owns and operates retail liquor outlets at any time during the calendar month covered by such posting.” Conn. Gen. Stat. § 30 -63a(b) provides in relevant part: “No holder of any manufacturer or out-of-state shipper’s permit shall ship, transport or deliver within this state, or sell or offer for sale to a wholesaler permittee any brand of beer ... at a bottle, can or case price, or price per keg, barrel or fractional unit thereof, higher than the lowest price at which such item is then being sold or offered for sale or shipped, transported or delivered by such manufacturer or out-of-state shipper to any wholesaler in any state bordering this state.” Appellants are the Connecticut officials responsible for enforcing the affirmation statute, and the liquor-wholesalers trade association which entered the case as an intervenor.  The Brown-Forman Court cited a third extraterritorial decision, Edgar v. MITE Carp., <citedDecision>457 U. S. 624</citedDecision> (1982), which, though not discussed at length there, significantly illuminates the contours of the constitutional prohibition on extraterritorial legislation.  In MITE Corp., the Court struck down the Illinois Business Takeover Act, which required that a takeover offer for a target company having a specified connection to Illinois be registered with the Secretary of State and mandated that such an offer was not to become effective for 20 days, during which time the offer would be subject to administrative evaluation.  The statute empowered the Secretary of State to deny registration of the tender offer under certain conditions, such as inequity or fraud.  A plurality found the statute to be infirm under the Commerce Clause because it “directly regulates transactions which take place across state lines, even if wholly outside the State of Illinois.” <citedDecision>Id., at 641</citedDecision> .  The plurality observed that, if the target company had sufficient in-state contacts, the Illinois law, unless complied with, could prevent interstate-securities transactions in stock even if not a single one of the target company’s shareholders was a resident of Illinois.  Moreover, the plurality noted that if Illinois were free to enact such legislation, others States similarly were so empowered, “and interstate commerce in securities transactions generated by tender offers would be thoroughly stifled.” <citedDecision>Id., at 642</citedDecision> .  Under the Commerce Clause the projection of these extrater *334 ritorial ‘“practical effeet[s],’” regardless of the statute’s intention, “‘ex-ceedfed] the inherent limits of the State’s power.’ ” <citedDecision>Id., at 642-643</citedDecision> , quoting Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S. 186, 197 (1977).  At the time of our decision in Brown-Forman, 39 States, including New York, had adopted affirmation laws.  Of these, 18, known as “control” States, each purchased all liquor to be distributed and consumed within its borders.  These States subscribed to a standard sales contract that required distillers to guarantee that the price charged the State was no higher than the lowest price offered anywhere in the United States.  Twenty States had adopted statutes similar to the New York statute that was under challenge.  See 476 U. S., at 576 , and n. 1.  One Member of the Court concurred separately to advocate that Seagram then be overruled as a “relic of the past.” Id,., at 586.  The entire Constitution was “framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not division.” Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U. S. 511, 523 (1935).  The plurality in <citedDecision>Edgar</citedDecision> v. MITE Corp. noted: “The limits on a State’s power to enact substantive legislation are similar to the limits on the jurisdiction of state courts.  In either case, ‘any attempt “directly” to assert extraterritorial jurisdiction over persons or property would offend sister States and exceed the inherent limits of the State’s power.’ ” <citedDecision>457 U. S., at 643</citedDecision> , quoting Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U. S., at 197 .  As a general matter, the Court has adopted a two-tiered approach to analyzing state economic regulation under the Commerce Clause.  We summarized in Brown-Forman: “When a state statute directly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerce, or when its effect is to favor in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests, we have generally struck down the statute without further inquiry.  When, however, a statute has only indirect effects on interstate commerce and regulates evenhandedly, we have examined whether the State’s interest is legitimate and whether the burden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits.” 476 U. S., at 579 (citations omitted).  We further recognized in Broivn-Fomian that the critical consideration in determining whether the extraterritorial reach of a statute violates the Commerce Clause is the overall effect of the statute on both local and interstate commerce.  Ibid. Our distillation of principles from prior cases involving extraterritoriality is meant as nothing more than a restatement of those specific concerns that have shaped this inquiry.  Recent economic scholarship confirms: “[B]oth [prospective and retrospective] types of price affirmation burden interstate commerce because they both cause firms to consider jointly their demand and marginal cost curves in more than one state.
