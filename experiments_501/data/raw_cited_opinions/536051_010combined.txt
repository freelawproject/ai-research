      <p class="indent">Coleman's argument lacks a factual basis.  The Supreme Court complied with the "plain statement" rule that Harris made applicable to habeas corpus proceedings.  The Virginia Supreme Court's brief order shows precisely how the Court dealt with the petition for appeal.  The Court recites that it considered all of the papers filed by the parties.  The Court then granted the motion to dismiss, which was based on Coleman's failure to comply with Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:9(a), and dismissed the appeal.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a></p>

The Court held that, if authorized by state law, an appellate court can determine whether an aggravating factor has been proved and can impose the death penalty.  The appellate court can exercise such power even when the jury may not have found an aggravating <span class="citation" data-id="111558"><span class="antecedent_guess">factor.</span>  <a href="/opinion/111558/cabana-v-bullock/"><span class="volume">474</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> at <span class="page">384-88</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. at 695-98.    Under these circumstances a federal court should not confine its inquiry to the jury instructions.  "Rather, the court must examine the entire course of the state-court proceedings against the defendant in order to determine whether, at some point in the process, the requisite factual finding as to the defendant's culpability has been <span class="citation" data-id="111558"><span class="antecedent_guess">made."</span>    <a href="/opinion/111558/cabana-v-bullock/"><span class="volume">474</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> at <span class="page">387</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. at 697.    A federal court errs by "focusing exclusively on the jury and in ordering a new sentencing hearing without inquiring whether the necessary finding of [the aggravating factor] had been made by the trial court or by the state appellate <span class="citation" data-id="111558"><span class="antecedent_guess">court."</span>    <a href="/opinion/111558/cabana-v-bullock/"><span class="volume">474</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> at <span class="page">389</span></a></span>, 106 S.Ct. at 698.    Although Cabana dealt with a specific categorical aggravating factor, the principles the Court explained are applicable to the determination of other aggravating factors in crimes committed under circumstances quite different from those examined in Cabana.    See, e.g., Johnson v. Mississippi, <span class="citation" data-id="112096"><a href="/opinion/112096/johnson-v-mississippi/"><span class="volume">486</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">578</span></a></span>, <span class="citation" data-id="112096"><a href="/opinion/112096/johnson-v-mississippi/"><span class="volume">108</span> <span class="reporter">S.

      <p class="indent">Virginia law confers broad powers on the Supreme Court.  Va.Code Ann. Sec. 17-110.1 (1988).  Every sentence of death must be reviewed by the Court.  This review may be consolidated with an appeal, if one is taken.  In addition to errors "enumerated by appeal," the Court must consider other specific issues that address the fundamental fairness of the trial and sentence.<a class="footnote" href="#fn2" id="fn2_ref">2</a>   The statute vests in the Supreme Court extraordinary authority to commute the sentence of death to imprisonment for life.  It may affirm the sentence of death or remand for new sentencing proceedings.  In short, the only limitation on the Court's power is the authority to impose a death sentence when the trial court, with or without a jury, has imposed a lesser penalty.</p>
