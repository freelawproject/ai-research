 V With the foregoing considerations in mind, we now turn to the difficult stare decisis question that this case presents.  It is, of course, wise judicial policy to adhere to rules announced in earlier eases.  As Justice Cardozo reminded us: “The labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in every case, and one could not lay one’s own course of bricks on the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone before him.” B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921).  Adherence to precedent also serves an indispensable institutional role within the Federal Judiciary.  Stare decisis is “a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon ‘an arbitrary discretion.’” Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989) (quoting The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton)).  See also Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 854-855 (1992) (joint opinion of O’Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).  Respect for precedent is strongest “in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court’s interpretation *712 of its legislation.” Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, <citedDecision>431 U. S. 720, 736</citedDecision> (1977).  11 In this case, these considerations point in two conflicting directions.  On one hand, they counsel adherence to the construction of § 1001 adopted in Bramblett ; on the other, they argue in favor of retaining the body of law that has cut back on the breadth of Bramblett in Circuits from coast to coast.  It would be difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously.  For if the word “department” encompasses the Judiciary, as Bramblett stated, 348 U. S., at 509 , the judicial function exception cannot be squared with the text of the statute.  A court is a court — and is part of the Judicial Branch— whether it is functioning in a housekeeping or judicial capacity.  Conversely, Bramblett could not stand if we preserved the thrust of the judicial function exception — i.

 The trustee also alleged in a separate motion that petitioner had, despite requests, failed to turn over all the books and records relating to the bankruptcy estate.  Petitioner filed a response denying the allegation, and asserting that he had produced the requested documents at the behest of a previous trustee.  Petitioner was then indicted under 18 U. S. C. § 1001 , and a jury found that each of these responses was a lie.  Today, the majority jettisons a 40-year-old unanimous decision of this Court, United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503 (1955), under which petitioner’s conviction plainly would have been upheld.  It does so despite an admission that the Court’s reading of § 1001 in Bramblett was “not completely implausible,” ante, at 706.  In replacing Bramblett’s plausible, albeit arguably flawed, interpretation of the statute with its own “sound” reading, the Court disrespects the traditionally stringent adherence to stare decisis in statutory decisions.  Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, <citedDecision>431 U. S. 720, 736</citedDecision> (1977).  The two reasons offered by the plurality in Part V of the opinion and the justification offered by the concurring opinion fall far short of the institutional hurdle erected by our past practice against overruling a decision of this Court interpreting an Act of Congress.  The first reason is styled as an “intervening development in the law”; under it, decisions of Courts of Appeals that cannot be reconciled with our earlier precedent are treated as a basis for disavowing, not the aberrant Court of Appeals deci *719 sions, but, mirabile dictu our own decision!  This novel corollary to the principle of stare decisis subverts the very principle on which a hierarchical court system is built.  The second reason given is that there has been little or no reliance on our Bramblett decision; I believe that this ground is quite debatable, if not actually erroneous.  Today’s decision harkens to the important reason behind the doctrine of stare decisis, but does not heed it.  That doctrine is “a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon ‘an arbitrary discretion.’ ” Patterson, supra, at 172 , citing The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton).  Respect for precedent is strongest “in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court’s interpretation of its legislation.” Illinois Brick Co., supra, at 736.  Justice Brandéis’ dissenting opinion in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 (1932), made the point this way: “Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.  This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation.” Id., at 406 (citations omitted).  We have recognized a very limited exception to this principle for what had been called “intervening developments in the law.” But the cases exemplifying this principle, e. g., Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320 (1972); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477 (1989), have invariably made clear that the “intervening developments” were in the case law of this Court, not of the lower federal courts.  Indeed, in Illinois Brick Co., we refused to follow a line of lower court decisions *720 which had carved out an exception from one of our precedents.  <citedDecision>431 U. S., at 743-744</citedDecision> .  But today’s decision departs radically from the previously limited reliance on this exception.  The principle of stare decisis is designed to promote stability and certainty in the law. While most often invoked to justify a court's refusal to reconsider its own decisions, it applies a fortiori to enjoin lower courts to follow the decision of a higher court. This principle is so firmly established in our jurisprudence that no lower court would deliberately refuse to follow the decision of a higher court. But cases come in all shapes and varieties, and it is not always clear whether a precedent applies to a situation in which some of the facts are different from those in the decided case. Here lower courts must necessarily make judgments as to how far beyond its particular facts the higher court precedent extends.  If there is appeal as a matter of right from the lower court to the higher court, any decision by the lower court that is viewed as mistaken by the higher court will in the normal course of events be corrected in short order by reversal on appeal.  But in the present day federal court system, where review by this Court is almost entirely discretionary, a different regime prevails.  We receive nearly 7,000 petitions for certiorari every Term, and can grant only a tiny fraction of them.  A high degree of selectivity is thereby enjoined upon us in exercising our certiorari jurisdiction, and our Rule 10 embodies the standards by which we decide to grant review.
