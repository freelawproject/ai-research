 All Congress said in 1870 was that the 1866 law “is hereby re-enacted.” That is all Congress meant.  As we said in a somewhat different setting two Terms ago, “We think that history leaves no doubt that, if we are to give [the law] the scope that its origins dictate, we must accord it a sweep as broad as its language.” United States v. Price, 383 U. S. 787, 801 .  “We are not at liberty to seek ingenious analytical instruments,” ibid., to carve from § 1982 an exception for private conduct — even though its application to such conduct in the present context is without established precedent.  And, as the Attorney General of the United States said at the oral argument of this case, “The fact that the statute lay partially dormant for many years cannot be held to diminish its force today.” Y. The remaining question is whether Congress has power under the Constitution to do what § 1982 purports to do: to prohibit all racial discrimination, private and public, in the sale and rental of property.  Our starting point is the Thirteenth Amendment, for it was pursuant *438 to that constitutional provision that Congress originally enacted what is now § 1982.  The Amendment consists of two parts.  Section 1 states: “Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.” Section 2 provides: “Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.” As its text reveals, the Thirteenth Amendment “is not a mere prohibition of State laws establishing or upholding slavery, but an absolute declaration that slavery or involuntary servitude shall not exist in any part of the United States.” Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 20</citedDecision> .  It has never been doubted, therefore, “that the power vested in Congress to enforce the article by appropriate legislation,” ibid., includes the power to enact laws “direct and primary, operating upon the acts of individuals, whether sanctioned by State legislation or not.” <citedDecision>Id., at 23</citedDecision> .  74 Thus, the fact that § 1982 operates upon the unofficial acts of private individuals, whether or not sanctioned by state law, presents no constitutional problem.  If Congress has power under the Thirteenth Amendment to eradicate conditions that prevent Negroes from buying and renting property because of their race or color, then no federal statute calculated to achieve that objective *439 can be thought to exceed the constitutional power of Congress simply because it reaches beyond state action to regulate the conduct of private individuals.  The constitutional question in this case, therefore, comes to this: Does the authority of Congress to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment “by appropriate legislation” include the power to eliminate all racial barriers to the acquisition of real and personal property?  We think the answer to that question is plainly yes.  “By its own unaided force and effect,” the Thirteenth Amendment “abolished slavery, and established universal freedom.” Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 20</citedDecision> .  Whether or not the Amendment itself did any more than that— a question not involved in this case — it is at least clear that the Enabling Clause of that Amendment empowered Congress to do much more.  For that clause clothed “Congress with power to pass all laws necessary and proper for abolishing all badges and incidents of slavery in the United StatesIbid.  (Emphasis added.) Those who opposed passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 argued in effect that the Thirteenth Amendment merely authorized Congress to dissolve the legal bond by which the Negro slave was held to his master.  75 Yet many had earlier opposed the Thirteenth Amendment on the very ground that it would give Congress virtually unlimited power to enact laws for the protection of Negroes in every State.  76 And the majority leaders in Congress — who were, after all, the authors of the Thirteenth Amendment — had no doubt that its Enabling Clause contemplated the sort of positive legislation that *440 was embodied in the 1866 Civil Rights Act.

 ... I have no doubt that under this provision ... we may destroy all these discriminations in civil rights against the black man; and if we cannot, our constitutional amendment amounts to nothing.  It was for that purpose that the second clause of that amendment was adopted, which says that Congress shall have authority, by appropriate legislation, to carry into effect the article prohibiting slavery.  Who is to decide what that appropriate legislation is to be?  The Congress of the United States; and it is for Congress to adopt such appropriate legislation as it may think proper, so that it be a means to accomplish the end.” 77 Surely Senator Trumbull was right.  Surely Congress has the power under the Thirteenth Amendment rationally to determine what are the badges and the incidents of slavery, and the authority to translate that determination into effective legislation.  Nor can we say that the determination Congress has made is an irrational *441 one.  For this Court recognized long ago that, whatever else they may have encompassed, the badges and incidents of slavery — its “burdens and disabilities” — included restraints upon “those fundamental rights which are the essence of civil freedom, namely, the same right ... to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.” Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 22</citedDecision> .  78 Just as the Black Codes, enacted after the Civil *442 War to restrict the free exercise of those rights, were substitutes for the slave system, so the exclusion of Negroes from white communities became a substitute for the Black Codes.  And when racial discrimination herds men *443 into ghettos and makes their ability to buy property turn on the color of their skin, then it too is a relic of slavery.  Negro citizens, North and South, who saw in the Thirteenth Amendment a promise of freedom — freedom to “go and come at pleasure” 79 and to “buy and sell when they please” 80 — would be left with “a mere paper guarantee” 81 if Congress were powerless to assure that a dollar in the hands of a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar in the hands of a white man.  At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live.  If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth Amendment made a promise the Nation cannot keep.  Representative Wilson of Iowa was the floor manager in the House for the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

 332 U. S. 789 .  Compare Harmon v. Tyler, 273 U. S. 668 , invalidating a New Orleans ordinance which gave legal force to private discrimination by forbidding any Negro to establish a home in a white community, or any white person to establish a home in a Negro community, “except on the written consent of a majority of the persons of the opposite race inhabiting such community or portion of the City to be affected.” See Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1, 12 .  Two of this Court’s early opinions contain dicta to the general effect that § 1982 is limited to state action.  Virginia v. Rives, 100 U. S. 313, 317-318 ; Civil Rights Cases, 109 U. S. 3 , 16-17.  But all that Virginia v. Rives, supra, actually held was that § 641 of the Revised Statutes of 1874 (derived from § 3 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and currently embodied in 28 U. S. C. § 1443 (1)) did not authorize the removal of a state prosecution where the defendants, without pointing to any statute discriminating against Negroes, could only assert that a denial of their rights might take place and might go uncorrected at trial. 100 U. S., at 319-322 .  See Georgia v. Rachel, 384 U. S. 780, 797-804 .  And of course the Civil Rights <citedDecision>Cases, supra,</citedDecision> which invalidated §§ 1 and 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, 18 Stat. 335 , did not'involve the present statute at all. It is true that a dictum in Hurd v. Hodge, 334 U. S. 24, 31 , characterized Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U. S. 323 , as having “held” that “[t]he action toward which the provisions of the statute .  .  .  [are] directed is governmental action.” 334 U. S., at 31.  But no such statement appears in the Corrigan opinion, and a careful examination of Corrigan reveals that it cannot be read as authority for the proposition attributed to it in Hurd .  In Corrigan , suits had been brought to enjoin a threatened violation of certain restrictive covenants in the District of Columbia.  The courts of the District had granted relief, see 55 App. D. C. 30, 299 F. 899 , and the case reached this Court on appeal.

 .  .  local laws” were made subject to the criminal sanctions of § 2.  Ibid. Congress might have thought it appropriate to confine criminal punishment to state officials, oath-bound to support the supreme federal law, while allowing only civil remedies — or perhaps only preventive relief — against private violators.  Or Congress might have thought that States which did not authorize abridgment of the rights declared in § 1 would themselves punish all who interfered with those rights without official authority.  See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1758, 1785.  Cf. Civil Rights Cases, <citedDecision>109 U. S. 3, 19, 24-25</citedDecision> .  Whatever the reason, it was repeatedly stressed that the only violations “reached and punished” by the bill, see Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 1294 (emphasis added), would be those “done under color of State authority.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> It is observed in dissent, post, at 458, that Senator Trumbull told Senator Cowan that § 2 was directed not at “State officers especially, but [at] everybody who violates the law.” That remark, however, was nothing more than a reply to Senator Cowan’s charge that § 2 was “exceedingly objectionable” in singling out state judicial officers for punishment for the first time “in the history of civilized legislation.” Id., at 500.  See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., at 39, 474, 516-517, 602-603, 1123-1125, 1151-1153, 1160.  For the substance of the codes and their operation, see H. R. Exec. Doc. No. 118, 39th Cong., 1st Sess.; S. Exec. Doc. No. 6, 39th Cong., 2d Sess.; 1 W. Fleming, Documentary History of Reconstruction 273-312 (1906); E. McPherson, The Political History of the United States of America During the Period of Reconstruction 29-44 (1871); 2 S. Morison and H. Com-mager, The Growth of the American Republic 17-18 (1950 ed.); K. Stampp, The Era of Reconstruction 79-81 (1965).  See n. 31, supra. It is true, as the dissent emphasizes, post, at 460, that Senator Trumbull remarked at one point that the Act “could have no operation in Massachusetts, New York, Illinois, or most of the States of the Union/' whose laws did not themselves discriminate against Negroes.  Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1761.  But the Senator was simply observing that the Act would “in no manner [interfere] with the .  .

 Clyatt v. United States, 197 U. S. 207 .  See, e. g., Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 113, 318, 476, 499, 507, 576, 600-601.  See, e. g.. Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 1366, 2616, 2940-2941, 2962, 2986; Cong. Globe, 38th Cong., 2d Sess., 178-180, 182, 192, 195, 239, 241-242, 480-481, 529.  Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 322.  See also the remarks' of Senator Howard of Michigan.  Id., at 503.  The Court did conclude in the <citedDecision>Civil Rights Cases</citedDecision> that “the act of .  .  .  the owner of the inn, the public conveyance or place of amusement, refusing .  .  .  accommodation” cannot be “justly regarded as imposing any badge of slavery or servitude upon the applicant.” <citedDecision>109 U. S., at 24</citedDecision> .  “It would be running the slavery argument into the ground,” the Court thought, “to make it apply to every act of discrimination which a person may see fit to make as to the guests he will entertain, or as to the people he will take into his coach or cab or car, or admit to his concert or theatre, or deal with in other matters of intercourse or business.” <citedDecision>Id., at 24-25</citedDecision> .  Mr. Justice Harlan dissented, expressing the view that “such discrimination practised by corporations and individuals in the exercise of their public or quasi-public functions is a badge of servitude the imposition of which Congress may prevent under its power, by appropriate legislation, to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment.” <citedDecision>Id., at 43</citedDecision> .  Whatever the present validity of the position taken by the majority on that issue — a question rendered largely academic by Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 243 (see Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, 379 U. S. 241 ; Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294 ) — we note that the entire Court agreed upon at least one proposition: .The Thirteenth Amendment authorizes Congress not only to outlaw all forms of slavery and involuntary servitude but also to eradicate the last vestiges and incidents of a society half slave and half free, by securing to all citizens, of every race and color, “the same right to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to inherit, purchase, lease, sell and convey property, as is enjoyed by white citizens.” <citedDecision>109 U. S., at 22</citedDecision> .  Cf. <citedDecision>id., at 35</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  In Hodges v. United States, 203 U. S. 1 , a group of white men had terrorized several Negroes to prevent them from working in a *442 sawmill.  The terrorizes were convicted under 18 U. S. C. § 241 (then Revised Statutes § 5508) of conspiring to prevent the Negroes from exercising the right to contract for employment, a right secured by 42 U. S. C. § 1981 (then Revised Statutes § 1977, derived from § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, see n. 28, supra).  Section 1981 provides, in terms that closely parallel those of § 1982 (then Revised Statutes § 1978), that all persons in the United States “shall have the same right ... to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens ...” (Emphasis added.) This Court reversed the conviction.  The majority recognized that "one of the disabilities of slavery, one of the indicia of its existence, was a lack of power to make or perform contracts.” 203 U. S., at 17 .  And there was no doubt that the defendants had deprived their Negro victims, on racial grounds, of the opportunity to dispose of their labor by contract.

 Contra, United States v. Cruikshank, 25 Fed. Cas. 707, 712 (No. 14,897) (dictum of Mr. Justice Bradley, on circuit), aff’d, 92 U. S. 542 ; United States v. Morris, 125 F. 322, 324, 330-331 .  Mr. Justice Harlan, joined by Mr. Justice Day, dissented.  In their view, the interpretation the majority placed upon the Thirteenth Amendment was “entirely too narrow and .  .  .  hostile to the freedom established by the supreme law of the land.” 203 U. S., at 37 .  That interpretation went far, they thought, “towards neutralizing many declarations made as to the object of the recent Amendments of the Constitution, a common purpose of which, this court has said, was to secure to a people theretofore in servitude, the free enjoyment, without discrimination merely on account of their race, of the essential rights that appertain to American citizenship and to freedom.” Ibid. The conclusion of the majority in Hodges rested upon a concept of congressional power under the Thirteenth Amendment irrecon *443 cilable with the position taken by every member of this Court in the <citedDecision>Civil Rights Cases</citedDecision> and incompatible with the history and purpose of the Amendment itself.  Insofar as Hodges is inconsistent with our holding today, it is hereby overruled.  See text accompanying n. 48, supra. Ibid. See text accompanying n. 62, supra. Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 1118.  Ibid.
