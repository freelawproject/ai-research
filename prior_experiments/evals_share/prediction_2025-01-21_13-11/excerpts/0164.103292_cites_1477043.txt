Case of interest: Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Schwarz (1935)
-----------------------
oes not in fact end before his death (1) the possession or enjoyment of, or the right to the income from, the property, or (2) the right, either alone or in conjunction with any person, to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy the property or the income therefrom; except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth. Any transfer of a material part of his property in the nature of a final disposition or distribution thereof, made by the decedent within two years prior to his death without such consideration, shall, unless shown to the contrary, be deemed to have been made in contemplation of death within the meaning of this title."

[3]   Some indication of the influence of Klein v. United States upon the lower courts may be found in Sargent v. White, 50 F.2d 410 and Union Trust Co. v. United States, 54 F.2d 152, cert. denied, 286 U.S. 547. Cf. Commissioner v. Schwarz, <caseOfInterest>74 F.2d 712</caseOfInterest>.
[4]   See, for example, the attempts by the Board of Tax Appeals to deal with the peculiarities of New York law in the field of vested and contingent remainders. Elizabeth B. Wallace, 27 B.T.A. 902; Louis C. Raegner, Jr., 29 B.T.A. 1243. In both of these cases limitations which would probably have been "contingent" at "common law" were held to be "vested" under the New York statutory rule. Cf. Commissioner v. Schwarz, <caseOfInterest>74 F.2d 712</caseOfInterest>; Flora M. Bonney, 29 B.T.A. 45.
[5]   Cf. Lyeth v. Hoey, 305 U.S. 188, 194. See Paul, The Effect on Federal Taxation of Local Rules of Property in Selected Studies in Federal Taxation (2nd Series), pp. 23-28; Developments in the Law  Taxation, 47 Harv. L. Rev. 1209, 1238-41; Note, 49 Harv. L. Rev. 462.

Ed.), pp. 3-241; Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities (2nd Ed.), pp. 99-118; VII Holdsworth, History of English Law, 81 et seq.; 1 Simes, Future Interests, §§ 64-96. The confusion apt to be engendered by judicial forays into this field is well illustrated by the use of the term "possibility of reverter" by the majority in Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co. "A possibility of reverter" is traditionally defined as the interest remaining in a grantor who has conveyed a determinable fee. The definition has not been thought to have any relation to the reversionary interest of a grantor who has transferred either a vested or conti
