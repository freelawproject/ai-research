Me. Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court. Petitioner is presently serving a sentence in an Alabama prison.  He applied to the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky for a writ of federal habeas corpus, alleging denial of his constitutional right to a speedy trial, Smith v. Hooey, <citedDecision>393 U. S. 374</citedDecision> (1969), and praying that an order issue directing respondent to afford him an immediate trial on a then three-year-old Kentucky indictment.  We are to consider whether, as petitioner was not physically present within the territorial limits of the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, the provision of 28 U. S. C. § 2241 (a) that “[w]rits of habeas corpus may be granted by the .. .  district courts .  .  .  within their respective jurisdictions” (emphasis supplied), precluded the District Court from *486 entertaining petitioner's application.  The District Court held that the section did not bar its determination of the application.

 .  .” Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224, 225 (1970).  He attacks, rather, the validity of the *487 Kentucky indictment which underlies the detainer lodged against him by officials of that State.  In a pro se application for habeas corpus relief to the Federal District Court in the Western District of Kentucky, petitioner alleged that he had made repeated demands for a speedy trial on the Kentucky indictment, that he had been denied his right to a speedy trial, that further delay in trial would impair his ability to defend himself, and that the existence of the Kentucky indictment adversely affected his condition of confinement in Alabama by prejudicing his opportunity for parole.  In response to an order to show cause, respondent argued that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because the petitioner was not confined within the district.  Respondent added that “petitioner in the case at bar may challenge the legality of any of the adverse effects of any Kentucky detainer against him in Alabama by habeas corpus in the Alabama Federal District Court.” App. 6-7.  The District Court held, citing Smith v. Hooey, <citedDecision>393 U. S. 374</citedDecision> (1969), that Kentucky must “attempt to effect the return of a prisoner from a foreign jurisdiction for trial on pending state charges when such prisoner so demands .... Since it is the State of Kentucky which must take action, it follows that jurisdiction rests in this district which has jurisdiction over the necessary state officials.” App. 9.  Under the constraint of its earlier decision, 1 the Court of Appeals reversed but stated that it “reach [ed] this conclusion reluctantly” because of the possibility that the decision would “result in Braden’s inability to find a forum in which to assert his constitutional right to a speedy trial — a right which he is legally entitled to assert at this time under Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 *488 (1968).  This is a possibility because the rule in the Fifth Circuit, where [Braden] is incarcerated, appears to be that a district court in the state that has filed the detainer is the proper forum in which to file the petition.  See May v. Georgia, 409 F. 2d 203 (5th Cir.1969).  See also Rodgers v. Louisiana, 418 F. 2d 237 (5th Cir.1969).  Braden thus may find himself ensnared in what has aptly been termed ‘Catch 2254’ — unable to vindicate his constitutional rights in either of the only two states that could possibly afford a remedy.  See Tuttle, Catch 2254: Federal Jurisdiction and Interstate Detainers, 32 U. Pitt. L. Rev. 489 , 502-03 (1971).” 454 F. 2d, at 146-147 .

 Before turning to that question, we must make clear that petitioner is entitled to raise his speedy trial claim on federal habeas corpus at this time.  First, he is currently “in custody” within the meaning of the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U. S. C. §2241 (c)(3).  Prior to our decision in Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), the “prematurity doctrine” of McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934), would, of course, have barred his petition for relief.  3 But our decision in Peyton v. Rowe discarded the prematurity doctrine, which had permitted *489 a prisoner to attack on habeas corpus only his current confinement, and not confinement that would be imposed in the future, and opened the door to this action.  4 Second, petitioner has exhausted all available state remedies as a prelude to this action.  It is true, of course, that he has not yet been tried on the Kentucky indictment, and he can assert a speedy trial defense when, and if, he is finally brought to trial. It is also true, as our Brother Rehnquist points out in dissent, that federal habeas corpus does not lie, absent “special circumstances,” to adjudicate the merits of an affirmative defense to a state criminal charge prior to a judgment of conviction by a state court. Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 253 (1886).  Petitioner does not, however, seek at this time to litigate a federal defense to a criminal charge, but only *490 to demand enforcement of the Commonwealth’s affirmative constitutional obligation to bring him promptly to trial. Smith v. Hooey, <citedDecision>393 U. S. 374</citedDecision> (1969).  He has made repeated demands for trial to the courts of Kentucky, offering those courts an opportunity to consider on the merits his constitutional claim of the present denial of a speedy trial. Under these circumstances it is clear that he has exhausted all available state court remedies for consideration of that constitutional claim, even though Kentucky has not yet brought him to trial. .  The exhaustion doctrine is a judicially crafted instrument which reflects a careful balance between important interests of federalism and the need to preserve the writ of habeas corpus as a “swift and imperative remedy in all cases of illegal restraint or confinement.” Secretary of State for Home Affairs v. O’Brien, [1923] A. C. 603, 609 (H. L.).  It cannot be used as a blunderbuss to shatter the attempt at litigation of constitutional claims without regard to the purposes that underlie the doctrine and that called it into existence.  As applied in our earlier decisions, the doctrine “preserves the role of the state courts in the application and enforcement of federal law. Early federal intervention in state criminal proceedings would tend to remove federal questions from the state courts, isolate those courts from constitutional issues, and thereby remove their understanding of and hospitality to federally protected interests.  Second, [the doctrine] preserves orderly administration of state judicial business, preventing the interruption of state adjudication by federal habeas proceedings.  It is important that petitioners reach state appellate courts, which can develop and correct errors of state and federal law and most effectively supervise and *491 impose uniformity on trial courts.” Note, Developments in the Law — Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038 , 1094 (1970).  See Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204-206 (1950), and the case which overruled it, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 417-420 (1963).  See also Ex parte Royall, supra, at 251-252 ; Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S. 114 (1944); cf. Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971); Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 (1951).  The fundamental interests underlying the exhaustion doctrine have been fully satisfied in petitioner's situation.  He has already presented his federal constitutional claim of a present denial of a speedy trial to the courts of Kentucky.  The state courts rejected the claim, apparently on the ground that since he had once escaped from custody the Commonwealth should not be obligated to incur the risk of another escape by returning him for trial. Petitioner exhausted all available state court opportunities to establish his position that the prior escape did not obviate the Commonwealth’s duty under <citedDecision>Smith</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Hooey, supra.</citedDecision> Moreover, petitioner made no effort to abort a state proceeding or to disrupt the orderly functioning of state judicial processes.  He comes to federal court, not in an effort to forestall a state prosecution, but to enforce the Commonwealth’s obligation to provide him with a state court forum.  He delayed his application for federal relief until the state courts had conclusively determined that his prosecution was temporarily moribund.  Since petitioner began serving the second' of two 10-year Alabama sentences in March 1972, the revival of the prosecution may be delayed until as late as 1982.  A federal habeas corpus action at this time and under these circumstances *492 does not jeopardize any legitimate interest of federalism.  5 Respondent apparently shares that view since it specifically concedes that petitioner has exhausted all available state remedies, Tr. of Oral Arg. 41.  In the case before us, the Court of Appeals held — not surprisingly, in view of the considerations discussed above — that even though petitioner had chosen the wrong forum, his speedy trial claim was one “which he is legally entitled to assert at this time under Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968).” 454 F. 2d, at 146 .  And the District Court, which upheld on the merits petitioner's speedy *493 trial claim, necessarily adopted that view.  Indeed, the great majority of lower federal courts which have considered the question since <citedDecision>Smith</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Hooey, supra,</citedDecision> have reached this same, and indisputably correct, conclusion.  6 We emphasize that nothing we have said would permit the derailment of a pending state proceeding by an attempt to litigate constitutional defenses prematurely in federal court. The contention in dissent that our decision converts federal habeas corpus into “a pretrial-motion forum for state prisoners,” wholly misapprehends today’s holding.  III Accordingly, we turn to the determination of the forum in which the petition for habeas corpus should be brought.  In terms of traditional venue considerations, the District Court for the Western District of Kentucky is almost surely the most desirable forum for the adjudication of the claim.  7 It is in Kentucky, where all of the material events took place, that the records and witnesses perti *494 nent to petitioner’s claim are likely to be found. And that forum is presumably no less convenient for the respondent and the Commonwealth of Kentucky, than for the petitioner.  The expense and risk of transporting the petitioner to the Western District of Kentucky, should his presence at a hearing prove necessary, would in all likelihood be outweighed by the difficulties of transporting records and witnesses from Kentucky to the district where petitioner is confined.  8 Indeed, respondent makes clear that “on balance, it would appear simpler and less expensive for the State of Kentucky to litigate such questions [as those involved in this case] in one of its own Federal judicial districts.” Brief for Respondent 6.

 Since the petitioner’s absence from the Western District of Kentucky did not deprive the court of jurisdiction, and since the respondent was properly served in that district, see Strait v. Laird, 406 U. S. 341 (1972); Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U. S. 487 (1971), the court below erred in ordering the dismissal of the petition on jurisdictional grounds.  The judgment of the Court of *501 Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.  Reversed and remanded.  White v. Tennessee, 447 F. 2d 1354 (CA6 1971).  Compare United States ex rel. Meadows v. New York, 426 F. 2d 1176 (CA2 1970), and Word v. North Carolina, 406 F. 2d 352 (CA4 1969) (proper forum is in the demanding State), with United States ex rel. Van Scoten v. Pennsylvania, 404 F. 2d 767 (CA3 1968), Ashley v. Washington, 394 F. 2d 125 (CA9 1968), and Booker v. Arkansas, 380 F. 2d 240 (CA8 1967) (proper forum is in the State of confinement).  See generally Note, Developments in the Law — Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038 , 1087-1093 (1970).  In Smith v. Hooey, <citedDecision>393 U. S. 374</citedDecision> (1969), we considered a speedy trial claim similar to the one presented in the ease before us, and we held that a State which had lodged a detainer against a petitioner in another State must, on the prisoner’s demand, “make a diligent, good-faith effort” to bring the prisoner to trial. Id,., at 383.  But that ease arose on direct review of the denial of relief by the state court, and we had no occasion to consider whether the same or similar claims could have been raised on federal habeas corpus.  Yet it logically follows from Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), that the claims can be raised on collateral attack.  In this context, as opposed to the situation presented in Peyton , the “future custody” under attack will not be imposed by the same sovereign which holds the petitioner in his current confinement.  Nevertheless, the considerations which were held in Peyton to warrant a prompt resolution of the claim also apply with full force in this context.  391 U. S., at 63-64.  See United States ex rel. Meadows v. New York, supra, at 1179 .
