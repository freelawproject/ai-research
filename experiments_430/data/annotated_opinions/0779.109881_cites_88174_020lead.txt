 responsible for a riot in order to deter such crime, then we may pass the same remedies .  .  .”).  Id., at 751; see n. 17, supra. Globe 751 (emphasis added).  Compare this statement with Representative Poland’s remark upon which our holding in Monroe was based.  See supra, at 664.  See, e. g., Gelpcke v. Dubuque, 1 Wall. 175 (1864); Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535 (1867); Riggs v. Johnson County, 6 Wall. 166 (1868); Weber v. Lee County, 6 Wall. 210 (1868); Supervisors v. Rogers, 7 Wall. 175 (1869); Benbow v. Iowa City, 7 Wall. 313 (1869); Supervisors v. Durant, <citedDecision>9 Wall. 415</citedDecision> (1870).  See generally 6 C. Fairman, History of the Supreme Court of the United States: Reconstruction and Reunion, 186^1888, ohs.  17-18 (1971).  See Globe 751-752.  Others taking a view similar to Representative Blair’s included: Representative Willard, see id., at 791; Representative Poland, see id., at 794; Representative Burchard, see id., at 795; Representative Farnsworth, see id., at 799.  Representative Willard also took a somewhat different position: He thought that the Constitution would not allow the Federal *674 Government to dictate the manner in which a State fulfilled its obligation of protection.  That is, he thought it a matter of state discretion whether it delegated the peacekeeping power to a municipal or county corporation, to a sheriff, etc. He did not doubt, however, that the Federal Government could impose on the States the obligation imposed by the Sherman amendment, and presumably he would have enforced the amendment against a municipal corporation to which the peacekeeping obligation had been delegated.
