 The definition has not been thought to have any relation to the reversionary* interest of a grantor who has transferred either a vested or contingent remainder in fee.  See Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities (2nd Ed.), §§ 13-51.  We are not unmindful of amendments to the estate tax law to which other decisions of this Court gave rise.  Thus by § 805 of the Revenue Act of 1936, c. 690, 49 Stat. 1648 , Congress undid the construction which this Court gave the estate tax law in another connection by a decision rendered on the same day as were the St. Louis Trust cases. Cf. White v. Poor, 296 U. S. 98 .  This case arose under § 302 (d) and not § 302 (c).  But, in any event, the fact of Congressional action in dealing with one problem while silent on the different problems created by the St. Louis Trust cases, does not imply controlling acceptance by Congress of those cases. By the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, c. 454, 46 Stat. 1516 , Congress displaced the construction which this Court put upon § 302 (c) in those cases wherein it was held that the reservation by a decedent of a life estate in property conveyed inter vivos, did not constitute a sufficient postponement of the remainder to bring it into the grantor’s gross estate.  May v. Heiner, 281 U. S. 238 ; Burnet v. Northern Trust Co., 283 U. S. 782 ; Morsman v. Burnet, 283 U. S. 783 ; McCormick v. Burnet, <citedDecision>283 U. S. 784</citedDecision> .  The speculative arguments that may be drawn from ad hoc legislation affecting one set of decisions and the want of such legislation to modify another set of decisions dealing with a somewhat different though cognate problem are well illustrated by this remedial amendment.  For it may be urged with considerable plausibility that in 1931 Congress had in principle already rejected the general attitude underlying the St. Louis Trust cases, as illustrated by the fact that in those cases the majority, in part at least, relied upon the Congressionally discarded May v. Heiner doctrine.  Whatever may be the scope of the doctrine that re-énactment of a statute impliedly enacts a settled judicial construction placed upon the re-enacted statute, that doctrine has no relevance to the present *121 problem.  Since the decisions in the St. Louis Trust cases, Congress has not re-enacted § 302 (c).  The amendments that Congress made to other provisions of § 302 in connection with other situations than those now before the Court, were made without re-enacting § 302 (c).  Nor has Congress, under any rational canons of legislative significance, by its compilation of internal revenue laws to form the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, 53 Stat. 1 , impliedly enacted into law a particular decision which, in the light of later experience, is seen to create confusion and conflict in the application of a settled principle of internal revenue legislation.
