 I see no benefit in abandoning a clear rule to create chaos.  Ill Having abandoned the plain-statement rule with respect to a summary order, the majority must consider Coleman’s argument that the untimely filing of his notice of appeal was the result of attorney error of sufficient magnitude as to constitute cause for his procedural default.  In a sleight of logic that would be ironic if not for its tragic consequences, the majority concludes that a state prisoner pursuing state collateral relief must bear the risk of his attorney’s grave errors — even if the result of those errors is that the prisoner will be executed without having presented his federal claims to a federal court — because this attribution of risk represents the appropriate “allocation of costs.” Ante, at 754.  Whether unprofessional attorney conduct in a state postconviction proceeding should bar federal habeas review of a state prisoner’s *772 conviction and sentence of death is not a question of costs to be allocated most efficiently.  It is, rather, another circumstance where this Court must determine whether federal rights should yield to state interests.  In my view, the obligation of a federal habeas court to correct fundamental constitutional violations, particularly in capital cases, should not accede to the State’s “discretion to develop and implement programs to aid prisoners seeking to secure postconviction review.” Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S. 551, 559 (1987).  The majority first contends that this Court’s decision in Murray v. <citedDecision>Carrier, 477 U. S. 478</citedDecision> (1986), expressly resolves this issue.  Of course, that cannot be so, as the procedural default at issue in <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> occurred on direct review, not collateral attack, and this Court has no authority to resolve issues not before it.  Moreover, notwithstanding the majority’s protestations to the contrary, the language of <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> strongly suggests that the Court’s resolution of the issue would have been the same regardless of when the procedural default occurred.  The Court in <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> explained: “A State’s procedural rules serve vital purposes at trial, on appeal, and on state collateral attack.” <citedDecision>477 U. S., at 490</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  Rejecting Carrier’s argument that, with respect to the standard for cause, procedural defaults on appeal should be treated differently from those that occur during the trial, the Court stated that “the standard for cause should not vary depending on the timing of a procedural default or on the strength of an uncertain and difficult assessment of the relative magnitude of the benefits attributable to the state procedural rules that attach at each successive stage of the judicial process.” Id., at 491 (emphasis added).  The rule foreshadowed by this language, which the majority today evades, most faithfully adheres to a principled view of the role of federal habeas jurisdiction.  As noted above, federal courts forgo the exercise of their habeas jurisprudence over claims that are procedurally barred out of respect for the state interests served by those rules.  Recognition of *773 state procedural forfeitures discourages petitioners from attempting to avoid state proceedings and accommodates the State’s interest in finality.  No rule, however, can deter gross incompetence.  To permit a procedural default caused by attorney error egregious enough to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel to preclude federal habeas review of a state prisoner’s federal claims in no way serves the State’s interest in preserving the integrity of its rules and proceedings.

 Ante, at 755.  This Court has made clear that the Fourteenth Amendment obligates a State “‘to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly in the context of the State’s appellate process,’” Pennsylvania v. Finley, 481 U. S., at 556 , quoting Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U. S. 600, 616 (1974), and “require[s] that the state appellate system be ‘free from unreasoned distinctions,’” id,., at 612.  While the State may have wide latitude to structure its appellate process as it deems most effective, it cannot, consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment, structure it in such a way as to deny indigent defendants meaningful access.  Accordingly, if a State desires to remove from the process of direct appellate review a claim or category of claims, the Fourteenth Amendment binds the State to ensure that the defendant has effective assistance of counsel for the entirety of the procedure *774 where the removed claims may be raised.  Similarly, fundamental fairness dictates that the State, having removed certain claims from the process of direct review, bear the burden of ineffective assistance of counsel in the proceeding to which the claim has been removed.  Ultimately, the Court’s determination that ineffective assistance of counsel cannot constitute cause of a procedural default in a state postconviction proceeding is patently unfair.  In concluding that it was not inequitable to apply the cause and prejudice standard to procedural defaults that occur on appeal, the <citedDecision>Murray</citedDecision> Court took comfort in the “additional safeguard against miscarriages of justice in criminal cases”: the right to effective assistance of counsel.  <citedDecision>477 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> .  The Court reasoned: “The presence of such a safeguard may properly inform this Court’s judgment in determining ‘[w]hat standards should govern the exercise of the habeas court’s equitable discretion’ with respect to procedurally defaulted claims.” Ibid,., quoting Reed v. Ross, 468 U. S., at 9 .  “[Fundamental fairness is the central concern of the writ of habeas corpus.” Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, 697 (1984).  It is the quintessence of inequity that the Court today abandons that safeguard while continuing to embrace the cause and prejudice standard.  I dissent.
