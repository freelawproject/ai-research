**Dissenting Opinion**
 It certainly has never been a postulate of judicial power that mere altered disposition, or subsequent membership on the Court, is sufficient warrant for overturning a deliberately decided rule of Constitutional law. Thus, if the Court were bent on reconsidering Wolf, I think that there would soon have presented itself an appropriate opportunity in which we could have had the benefit of full briefing and argument.  In any event, at the very least, the present case should have been set down for reargument, in view' of the inadequate briefing and argument we have received on the Wolf point.  To all intents and purposes the Court’s present action amounts to a summary reversal of Wolf, without argument.  I am bound to say that what has been done is not likely to promote respect either for the Court’s adjudicatory process or for the stability of its decisions.  Having been unable, however, to persuade any of the majority to a different procedural course, I now turn to the merits of the present decision.  *678 II.  Essential to the majority’s argument against Wolf is the proposition that the rule of Weeks v. United States, <citedDecision>232 U. S. 383</citedDecision> , excluding in federal criminal trials the use of evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment, derives not from the “supervisory power” of this Court over the federal judicial system, but from Constitutional requirement.  This is so because no one, I suppose, would suggest that this Court possesses any general supervisory power over the state courts.  Although I entertain considerable doubt as to the soundness of this foundational proposition of the majority, cf. Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S., at 39-40 (concurring opinion), I shall assume, for present purposes, that the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule “is of constitutional origin.” At the heart of the majority’s opinion in this case is the following syllogism: (1) the rule excluding in federal criminal trials evidence which is the product of an illegal search and seizure is “part and parcel” of the Fourth Amendment; (2) Wolf held that the “privacy” assured against federal action by the Fourth Amendment is also protected against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment; and (3) it is therefore “logically and constitutionally necessary” that the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> exclusionary rule should also be enforced against the States.  10 This reasoning ultimately rests on the unsound premise that because Wolf carried into the States, as part of “the concept of ordered liberty” embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment, the principle of “privacy” underlying the Fourth Amendment (338 U. S., at 27), it must follow that whatever configurations of the Fourth Amendment have been developed in the particularizing federal precedents are likewise to be deemed a part of “ordered liberty,” *679 and as such are enforceable against the States.  For me, this does not follow at all. It cannot be too much emphasized that what was recognized in Wolf was not that the Fourth Amendment as such is enforceable against the States as a facet of due process, a view of the Fourteenth Amendment which, as Wolf itself pointed out (338 U. S., at 26), has long since been discredited, but the principle of privacy “which is at the core of the Fourth Amendment.” (Id., at 27.) It would not be proper to expect or impose any precise equivalence, either as regards the scope of the right or the means of its implementation, between the requirements of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.  For the Fourth, unlike what was said in Wolf of the Fourteenth, does not state a general principle only; it is a particular command, having its setting in a pre-exist-ing legal context on which both interpreting decisions and enabling statutes must at least build.  Thus, even in a case which presented simply the question of whether a particular search and seizure was constitutionally “unreasonable” — say in a tort action against state officers — we would not be true to the Fourteenth Amendment were we merely to stretch the general principle of individual privacy on a Procrustean bed of federal precedents under the Fourth Amendment.  But in this instance more than that is involved, for here we are reviewing not a determination that what the state police did was Constitutionally permissible (since the state court quite evidently assumed that it was not), but a determination that appellant was properly found guilty of conduct which, for present purposes, it is to be assumed the State could Constitutionally punish.  Since there is not the slightest suggestion that Ohio’s policy is “affirmatively to sanction .  .  .  police incursion into privacy” (338 U. S., at 28), compare Marcus v. Search Warrants, post, p. 717, what the Court is now doing is to impose *680 upon the States not only federal substantive standards of “search and seizure” but also the basic federal remedy for violation of those standards.  For I think it entirely clear that the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> exclusionary rule is but a remedy which, by penalizing past official misconduct, is aimed at deterring such conduct in the future.  I would not impose upon the States this federal exclusionary remedy.  The reasons given by the majority for now suddenly turning its back on Wolf seem to me notably unconvincing.  First, it is said that “the factual grounds upon which Wolf was based” have since changed, in that more States now follow the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> exclusionary rule than was so at the time Wolf was decided.  While that is true, a recent survey indicates that at present one-half of the States still adhere to the common-law non-exclusionary rule, and one, Maryland, retains the rule as to felonies.  Berman and Oberst, Admissibility of Evidence Obtained by an Unconstitutional Search and Seizure, 55 N. W. L. Rev. 525, 532-533.  But in any case surely all this is beside the point, as the majority itself indeed seems to recognize.  Our concern here, as it was in Wolf, is not with the desirability of that rule but only with the question whether the States are Constitutionally free to follow it or not as they may themselves determine, and the relevance of the disparity of views among the States on this point lies simply in the fact that the judgment involved is a debatable one.  Moreover, the very fact on which the majority relies, instead of lending support to what is now being done, points away from the need of replacing voluntary state action with federal compulsion.  The preservation of a proper balance between state and federal responsibility in the administration of criminal justice demands patience on the part of those who might like to see things move faster among the States in this respect.  Problems of criminal law enforcement vary *681 widely from State to State.  One State, in considering the totality of its legal picture, may conclude that the need for embracing the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule is pressing because other remedies are unavailable or inadequate to secure compliance with the substantive Constitutional principle involved.  Another, though equally solicitous of Constitutional rights, may choose to pursue one purpose at a time, allowing all evidence relevant to guilt to be brought into a criminal trial, and dealing with Constitutional infractions by other means.  Still another may consider the exclusionary rule too rough-and-ready a remedy, in that it reaches only unconstitutional intrusions which eventuate in criminal prosecution of the victims.  Further, a State after experimenting with the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule for a time may, because of unsatisfactory experience with it, decide to revert to a non-exclusionary rule.  And so on.  From the standpoint of Constitutional permissibility in pointing a State in one direction or another, I do not see at all why “time has set its face against” the considerations which led Mr. Justice Cardozo, then chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals, to reject for New York in People v. Defore, 242 N. Y. 13 , 150 N. E. 585 , the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> exclusionary rule.  For us the question remains, as it has always been, one of state power, not one of passing judgment on the wisdom of one state course or another.  In my view this Court should continue to forbear from fettering the States with an adamant rule which may embarrass them in coping with their own peculiar problems in criminal law enforcement.  Further, we are told that imposition of the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule on the States makes “very good sense,” in that it will promote recognition by state and federal officials of their “mutual obligation to respect the same fundamental criteria” in their approach to law enforcement, and will avoid “ ‘needless conflict between state and federal courts.’ ” Indeed the majority now finds an incongruity *682 in Wolfs discriminating perception between the demands of “ordered liberty” as respects the basic right of “privacy” and the means of securing it among the States.  That perception, resting both on a sensitive regard for our federal system and a sound recognition of this Court’s remoteness from particular state problems, is for me the strength of that decision.  An approach which regards the issue as one of achieving procedural symmetry or of serving administrative convenience surely disfigures the boundaries of this Court’s functions in relation to the state and federal courts.  Our role in promulgating the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule and its extensions in such cases as Rea, Elkins, and Rios 11 was quite a different one than it is here.  There, in implementing the Fourth Amendment, we occupied the position of a tribunal having the ultimate responsibility for developing the standards and procedures of judicial administration within' the judicial system over which it presides.  Here we review state procedures whose measure is to be taken not against the specific substantive commands of the Fourth Amendment but under the flexible contours of the Due Process Clause.  I do not believe that the Fourteenth Amendment empowers this Court to mould state remedies effectuating the right to freedom from “arbitrary intrusion by the police” to suit its own notions of how things should be done, as, for instance, the California Supreme Court did in People v. Cahan, 44 Cal. 2d 434 , 282 P. 2d 906 , with reference to procedures in the California courts or as this Court did in <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> for the lower federal courts.  A state conviction comes to us as the complete product of a sovereign judicial system.  Typically a case will have been tried in a trial court, tested in some final appel *683 late court, and will go no further.  In the comparatively rare instance when a conviction is reviewed by us on due process grounds we deal then with a finished product in the creation of which we are allowed no hand, and our task, far from being one of over-all supervision, is, speaking generally, restricted to a determination of whether the prosecution was Constitutionally fair.  The specifics of trial procedure, which in every mature legal system will vary greatly in detail, are within the sole competence of the States.  I do not see how it can be said that a trial becomes unfair simply because a State determines that evidence may be considered by the trier of fact, regardless of how it was obtained, if it is relevant to the one issue with which the trial is concerned, the guilt or innocence of the accused.  Of course, a court may use its procedures as an incidental means of pursuing other ends than the correct resolution of the controversies before it.  Such indeed is the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule, but if a State does not choose to use its courts in this way, I do not believe that this Court is empowered to impose this much-debated procedure on local courts, however efficacious we may consider the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> rule to be as a means of securing Constitutional rights.  Finally, it is said that the overruling of Wolf is supported by the established doctrine that the admission in evidence of an involuntary confession renders a state conviction Constitutionally invalid.  Since such a confession may often be entirely reliable, and therefore of the greatest relevance to the issue of the trial, the argument continues, this doctrine is ample warrant in precedent that the way evidence was obtained, and not just its relevance, is Constitutionally significant to the fairness of a trial. I believe this analogy is not a true one.  The “coerced confession” rule is certainly not a rule that any illegally obtained statements may not be used in evidence.  I would suppose* that a statement which is procured during *684 a period of illegal detention, McNabb v. United, States, 318 U. S. 332 , is, as much as unlawfully seized evidence, illegally obtained, but this Court has consistently refused to reverse state convictions resting on the use of such statements.  Indeed it would seem the Court laid at rest the very argument now made by the majority when in Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219 , a state-coerced confession case, it said (at 235): “It may be assumed [that the] treatment of the petitioner [by the police] .  .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 [has been] made the deluded instrument of his own conviction.” 2 Hawkins, Pleas of the Crown (8th ed., 1824), c. 46, § 34.  That this is a procedural right, and that its violation occurs at the time his improperly obtained statement is admitted at trial, is manifest.  For without this right all the careful safeguards erected around the giving of testimony, whether by an accused or any other witness, would become empty formalities in a procedure where the most compelling possible evidence of guilt, a confession, would have already been obtained at the unsupervised pleasure of the police.  This, and not the disciplining of the police, as with illegally seized evidence, is surely the true basis for excluding a statement of the accused which was unconstitutionally obtained.  In sum, I think the coerced confession analogy works strongly against what the Court does today.  In conclusion, it should be noted that the majority opinion in this case is in fact an opinion only for the judgment overruling Wolf, and not for the basic rationale by which four members of the majority have reached that result.  For my Brother Black is unwilling to subscribe to their view that the <citedDecision>Weeks</citedDecision> exclusionary rule derives from the Fourth Amendment itself (see ante, p. 661), but joins the majority opinion on the premise that its end result can be achieved by bringing the Fifth Amendment to the aid of the Fourth (see ante, pp. 662-665).  12 On that score I need only say that whatever the validity of *686 the “Fourth-Fifth Amendment” correlation which the Boyd case ( 116 U. S. 616 ) found, see 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), § 2184, we have only very recently again reiterated the long-established doctrine of this Court that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is not applicable to the States.  See Cohen v. Hurley, 366 U. S. 117 .  I regret that I find so unwise in principle and so inexpedient in policy a decision motivated by the high purpose of increasing respect for Constitutional rights.  But in the last analysis I think this Court can increase respect for the Constitution only if it rigidly respects the limitations which the Constitution places upon it, and respects as well the principles inherent in its own processes.  In the present case I think we exceed both, and that our voice becomes only a voice of power, not of reason.  The material parts of that law are quoted in note 1 of the Court’s opinion.
