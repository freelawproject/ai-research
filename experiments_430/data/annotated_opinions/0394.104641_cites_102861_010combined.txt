 And although Justices Brandéis, Stone, Roberts and Cardozo contended that the Gillespie decision could not stand consistently with the principles which had been reaffirmed in the Group No. 1 Oil case, a majority of one in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 , provided a corollary to the rule of the Gillespie case. This was done by holding that the Federal Government was barred from taxing the income of a lessee of state lands as the state was barred from taxing the income of the lessee of federal lands.  A parallel immunity from state occupational or privilege taxes was once accorded private contractors with, or agencies of, the Government, Williams v. Talladega, *359 226 U. S. 404 , notwithstanding the venerable rule that the property of such a contractor or agency is liable to state property taxation.  See the cases cited supra in note 18.  Decisions curtailing this immunity were presaged by Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514 .  It held subject to federal income taxation income received by a consulting engineer from a state for services in connection with temporary work.  Equally significant was Alward v. Johnson, 282 U. S. 509, 514 , which sustained a state tax measured by gross receipts on the property of a stage line engaged in carrying the mails.  31 Later this Court sustained a state tax on the gross receipts of a contractor with the Federal Government, James v. Dravo Contracting Co., <citedDecision>302 U. S. 134</citedDecision> ; Silas Mason Co. v. Tax Commission, 302 U. S. 186 ; a state tax on the net income of such a contractor, Atkinson v. Tax Commission, 303 U. S. 20 ; state sales and use taxes on purchases of materials used by a contractor in performing a cost-plus contract with the United States, Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U. S. 1 ; Curry v. United States, 314 U. S. 14 ; and a state severance tax imposed on a contractor who severed and purchased timber from lands owned by the United States, Wilson v. Cook, 327 U. S. 474 .  It was pointed out that “.  .  .  the Constitution, unaided by Congressional legislation, .  .  .

 28 The Oklahoma Supreme Court assumed for a time that the statutory difference was overlooked by this Court and that an opposite result would have been reached had the difference been noticed.  In re Skelton Lead & Zinc Co.’s Gross Production Tax, 1919, 81 Okla. 134 ; In re Protest of Bendelari, Agent, 82 Okla. 97 .  29 The Oklahoma Supreme Court capitulated in Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. McCurdy, 86 Okla. 148 .  30 See note 39 infra.  31 Cf. the contemporary case of Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216 , holding capital gain resulting from resale of municipal bonds taxable under the federal income tax law. 32 Cf. Burnet v. A. T. Jergins Trust, 288 U. S. 508, 516 , in which a city leased oil and gas land to a private trust, which was held liable for a federal income tax on its share of the receipts, the Court stating that “the doctrine of Gillespie v. Oklahoma is to be applied strictly and only in circumstances closely analogous to those which it disclosed.” 33 Citing Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 , which the opinion characterized as “a corollary” to the Gillespie case. 303 U. S. at 383.  The federal income tax in the Coronado case was levied upon the lessee of state school lands.  Cf. note 32 supra. 34 Among the cases which one or the other of respondents attempts to distinguish on the ground that the tax was imposed on an independent contractor rather than a “true Federal instrumentality” are: James v. Dravo Contracting Co., <citedDecision>302 U. S. 134</citedDecision> ; Buckstaff Co. v. McKinley, 308 U. S. 358 ; Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U. S. 1 ; and Wilson v. Cook, 327 U. S. 474 .  It is also contended that cases sustaining taxes on the property of a federal instrumentality, e. g., Railroad Co. v. Peniston, 18 Wall. 5 ; Alward v. Johnson, 282 U. S. 509 ; Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Board of Equalization, 288 U. S. 325 , are not inconsistent with the view they ask us to take.  Cf. Part I supra. 35 The incongruity of the doctrine respondents ask us to perpetuate is underscored by decisions subsequent to the Mountain Producers case withdrawing income tax immunity for state and federal official salaries.  Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405 ; Graves v. New York ex rel. O’Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 .  See generally, Powell, The Waning of Intergovernmental Tax Immunities, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 633 ; Powell, The Remnant of Intergovernmental Tax Immunities, 58 Harv. L. Rev. 757 .  36 Respondents merely assert hypothetically that imposition of the taxes might in some instances make the margin between successful and unsuccessful operation.  Leases approved by the Secretary of the Interior provided for the same rental and royalty payments both before and after the Mountain Producers decision.  25 C. F. R. § 189.16 .  And rental and royalty payments provided for by the *364 Department of the Interior are the same for lands allotted under the General Allotment Act as they are for lands of members of the Five Civilized Tribes, 25 C. F. R. §§ 183.24 , 189.16.  Production from the latter lands has been subject to Oklahoma’s gross production tax since 1928.  See note 42 infra.  The Government, in its brief amicus curiae, states that, because differences in the value of different tracts of land would be reflected in the bonuses which lessees are willing to pay, an exact comparison of bonuses is impossible.  37 See James v. Dravo Contracting Co., <citedDecision>302 U. S. 134, 160-161</citedDecision> ; Pittman v. Home Owners Corp., 308 U. S. 21, 32-33 ; Maricopa County v. Talley Bank, 318 U. S. 357, 361 ; Board of Commissioners *366 v. Seber, 318 U. S. 705, 715-719 ; Oklahoma Tax Commission v. United States, 319 U. S. 598, 606-607 ; Mayo v. United States, 319 U. S. 441, 446 ; Smith v.

S. 521 , held that this statute did not authorize the imposition of the state’s petroleum excise tax.
