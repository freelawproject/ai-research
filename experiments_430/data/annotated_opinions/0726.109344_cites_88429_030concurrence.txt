**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice White, concurring in the judgment.  Being of the view that the goods involved here had lost their character as imports and that subjecting them to ad valorem taxation was consistent with the Constitution as interpreted by prior cases, including Low v. Austin, <citedDecision>13 Wall. 29</citedDecision> (1872), I would affirm the judgment.  There is little reason and no necessity at this time to overrule <citedDecision>Low</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Austin</citedDecision> .  None of the parties has challenged that case here, and the issue of its overruling has not been briefed or argued.
