 See id., at 329-330; see also Pennhurst, 465 U. S., at 98 (“In short, the principle of sovereign immunity is a constitutional limitation on the federal judicial power established in Art. Ill”); Ex parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497 (“[T]he entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given .  .  .”).  It is true that we have not had occasion previously to apply established Eleventh Amendment principles to the question whether Congress has the power to abrogate state sovereign immunity (save in Union Gas).  But consideration of that question must proceed with fidelity to this century-old doctrine.  The dissent, to the contrary, disregards our case law in favor of a theory cobbled together from law review articles and its own version of historical events.  The dissent cites not a single decision since Hans (other than Union Gas) that supports its view of state sovereign immunity, instead relying upon the now-discredited decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall. 419</citedDecision> (1793).  See, e. g., post, at 152, n. 47.  Its undocumented and highly speculative extralegal explanation of *69 the decision in Hans is a disservice to the Court’s traditional method of adjudication.  See post, at 120-123.  The dissent mischaracterizes the Hans opinion.  That decision found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental “ ‘jurisprudence in all civilized nations.’” Hans, 134 U. S., at 17 , quoting Beers v. Arkansas, 20 How. 527, 529 (1858); see also The Federalist No. 81, p. 487 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton) (sovereign immunity “is the general sense and the general practice of mankind”).  The dissent’s proposition that the common law of England, where adopted by the States, was open to change by the Legislature is wholly unexceptionable and largely beside the point: that common law provided the substantive rules of law rather than jurisdiction.  Cf. Monaco, supra, at 323 (state sovereign immunity, like the requirement that there be a “justiciable” controversy, is a constitutionally grounded limit on federal jurisdiction).  It also is noteworthy that the principle of state sovereign immunity stands distinct from other principles of the common law in that only the former prompted a specific constitutional amendment.  Hans — with a much closer vantage point than the dissent — recognized that the decision in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> was contrary to the well-understood meaning of the Constitution.  The dissent’s conclusion that the decision in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> was “reasonable,” post, at 106, certainly would have struck the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment as quite odd: That decision created “such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted.” Monaco, supra, at 325 .  The dissent’s lengthy analysis of the text of the Eleventh Amendment is directed at a straw man — we long have recognized that blind reliance upon the text of the Eleventh Amendment is “ ‘to strain the Constitution and the law to a construction never imagined or dreamed of.’ ” Monaco, supra, at 326 , quoting Hans, supra, at 15 .  The text dealt in terms only with the problem presented by the decision in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> ; in light of the fact that the federal courts did not *70 have federal-question jurisdiction at the time the Amendment was passed (and would not have it until 1875), it seems unlikely that much thought was given to the prospect of federal-question jurisdiction over the States.  That same consideration causes the dissent’s criticism of the views of Marshall, Madison, and Hamilton to ring hollow.  The dissent cites statements made by those three influential Framers, the most natural reading of which would preclude all federal jurisdiction over an unconsenting State.  12 Struggling against this reading, however, the dissent finds significant the absence of any contention that sovereign immunity would affect the new federal-question jurisdiction.  Post, at 142-150.  But the lack of any statute vesting general federal-question jurisdiction in the federal courts until much later makes the dissent’s demand for greater specificity about a then-dormant jurisdiction overly exacting.  13 *71 In putting forward a new theory of state sovereign immunity, the dissent develops its own vision of the political system created by the Framers, concluding with the statement that “[t]he Framers’ principal objectives in rejecting English theories of unitary sovereignty... would have been impeded if a new concept of sovereign immunity had taken its place in federal-question cases, and would have been substantially thwarted if that new immunity had been held untouchable by any congressional effort to abrogate it.” 14 Post, at 157.

 Justice Stevens saw in that second Eleventh Amendment no bar to the exercise of congressional authority under the Commerce Clause in providing for suits on a federal question by individuals against a State, and I cap only say that after my own canvass of the matter I believe he was entirely correct in that view, for reasons given below.  His position, of course, was also the holding in Union Gas, which the Court now overrules and repudiates.  The fault I find with the majority today is not in its decision to reexamine Union Gas, for the Court in that case produced no majority for a single rationale supporting congressional authority.  Instead, I part company from the Court because I am convinced that its decision is fundamentally mistaken, and for that reason I respectfully dissent.  *101 f — 1 It is useful to separate three questions: (1) whether the States enjoyed sovereign immunity if sued in their own courts in the period prior to ratification of the National Constitution; (2) if so, whether after ratification the States were entitled to claim some such immunity when sued in a federal court exercising jurisdiction either because the suit was between a State and a nonstate litigant who was not its citizen, or because the issue in the case raised a federal question; and (3) whether any state sovereign immunity recognized in federal court may be abrogated by Congress.  The answer to the first question is not clear, although some of the Framers assumed that States did enjoy immunity in their own courts.  The second question was not debated at the time of ratification, except as to citizen-state diversity jurisdiction; 1 there was no unanimity, but in due course the Court in Chisholm v. <citedDecision>Georgia, 2 Dall. 419</citedDecision> (1793), answered that a state defendant enjoyed no such immunity.  As to federal-question jurisdiction, state sovereign immunity seems not to have been debated prior to ratification, the silence probably showing a general understanding at the time that the States would have no immunity in such cases. The adoption of the Eleventh Amendment soon changed the result in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , not by mentioning sovereign immunity, but by eliminating citizen-state diversity jurisdiction over cases with state defendants.  I will explain why the *102 Eleventh Amendment did not affect federal-question jurisdiction, a notion that needs to be understood for the light it casts on the soundness of Hans’s holding that States did enjoy sovereign immunity in federal-question suits.  The Hans Court erroneously assumed that a State could plead sovereign immunity against a noncitizen suing under federal-question jurisdiction, and for that reason held that a State must enjoy the same protection in a suit by one of its citizens.  The error of Hans’s reasoning is underscored by its clear inconsistency with the Founders’ hostility to the implicit reception of common-law doctrine as federal law, and with the Founders’ conception of sovereign power as divided between the States and the National Government for the sake of very practical objectives.  The Court’s answer today to the third question is likewise at odds with the Founders’ view that common law, when it was received into the new American legal system, was always subject to legislative amendment.  In ignoring the reasons for this pervasive understanding at the time of the ratification, and in holding that a nontextual common-law rule limits a clear grant of congressional power under Article I, the Court follows a course that has brought it to grief before in our history, and promises to do so again.  Beyond this third question that elicits today’s holding, there is one further issue.

 There was, on the contrary, a clear disagreement, which was left to fester during the ratification period, to be resolved only thereafter.  One other point, however, was also clear: the *106 debate addressed only the question whether ratification of the Constitution would, in diversity cases and without more, abrogate the state sovereign immunity or allow it to have some application.  We have no record that anyone argued for the third option mentioned above, that the Constitution would affirmatively guarantee state sovereign immunity against any congressional action to the contrary.  Nor would there have been any apparent justification for any such argument, since no clause in the proposed (and ratified) Constitution even so much as suggested such a position.  It may have been reasonable to contend (as we will see that Madison, Marshall, and Hamilton did) that Article III would not alter States’ pre-existing common-law immunity despite its unqualified grant of jurisdiction over diversity suits against States.  But then, as now, there was no textual support for contending that Article III or any other provision would “constitutionalize” state sovereign immunity, and no one uttered any such contention.  B The argument among the Framers and their friends about sovereign immunity in federal citizen-state diversity cases, in any event, was short lived and ended when this Court, in Chisholm v. <citedDecision>Georgia, 2 Dall. 419</citedDecision> (1793), chose between the constitutional alternatives of abrogation and recognition of the immunity enjoyed at common law. The 4-to-l majority adopted the reasonable (although not compelled) interpretation that the first of the two Citizen-State Diversity Clauses abrogated for purposes of federal jurisdiction any immunity the States might have enjoyed in their own courts, and Georgia was accordingly held subject to the judicial power in a common-law assumpsit action by a South Carolina citizen suing to collect a debt.  5 The case also settled, by implica *107 tion, any question there could possibly have been about recognizing state sovereign immunity in actions depending on the federal question (or “arising under”) head of jurisdiction *108 as well.  The constitutional text on federal-question jurisdiction, after all, was just as devoid of immunity language as it was on citizen-state diversity, and at the time of <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> any influence that general common-law immunity might have had as an interpretive force in construing constitutional language would presumably have been no greater when addressing the federal-question language of Article III than its Diversity Clauses.  See Sherry, The Eleventh Amendment and Stare Decisis: Overruling Hans v Louisiana, 57 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1260 , 1270 (1990).  Although Justice Iredell’s dissent in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> seems at times to reserve judgment on what I have called the third question, whether Congress could authorize suits against the States, <citedDecision>Chisholm, supra, at 434-435</citedDecision> , his argument is largely devoted to stating the position taken by several federalists that state sovereign immunity was cognizable under the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses, not that state immunity was somehow invisibly codified as an independent constitutional defense.  As Justice Stevens persuasively explains in greater detail, ante, at 78-81, Justice Iredell’s dissent focused on the construction of the Judiciary Act of 1789, not Article III. See also Orth, The Truth About Justice Ire-dell’s Dissent in Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), 73 N. C. L. Rev. 255 (1994).  This would have been an odd focus, had he believed that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to impose liability.  Instead, on Justice Iredell’s view, States sued in diversity retained the common-law sovereignty “where no special act of Legislation controuls it, to be in force in each State, as it existed in England, (unaltered by any statute) at the time of the first settlement of the country.” 2 Dall, at 435 (emphasis deleted).  While in at least some circumstances States might be held liable to “the authority of the United States,” <citedDecision>id., at 436</citedDecision> , any such liability *109 would depend upon “laws passed under the Constitution and in conformity to it,” <citedDecision>ibid.</citedDecision> 6 Finding no congressional action abrogating Georgia’s common-law immunity, Justice Iredell concluded that the State should not be liable to suit.  7 C The Eleventh Amendment, of course, repudiated <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> and clearly divested federal courts of some jurisdiction as to cases against state parties: “The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” There are two plausible readings of this provision’s text.  Under the first, it simply repeals the Citizen-State Diversity *110 Clauses of Article III for all cases in which the State appears as a defendant.  Under the second, it strips the federal courts of jurisdiction in any case in which a state defendant is sued by a citizen not its own, even if jurisdiction might otherwise rest on the existence of a federal question in the suit.  Neither reading of the Amendment, of course, furnishes authority for the Court’s view in today’s case, but we need to choose between the competing readings for the light that will be shed on the Hans doctrine and the legitimacy of inflating that doctrine to the point of constitutional immutability as the Court has chosen to do.  The history and structure of the Eleventh Amendment convincingly show that it reaches only to suits subject to federal jurisdiction exclusively under the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses.  8 In precisely tracking the language in Article III providing for citizen-state diversity jurisdiction, the text of the Amendment does, after all, suggest to common *111 sense that only the Diversity Clauses are being addressed.  If the Framers had meant the Amendment to bar federal-question suits as well, they could not only have made their intentions clearer very easily, but could simply have adopted the first post -Chisholm proposal, introduced in the House of Representatives by Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts on instructions from the Legislature of that Commonwealth.

 This Court affirmed the dismissal of the suit, despite the fact that the case fell within the federal court’s “arising under,” or federal-question, jurisdiction.  Justice Bradley’s opinion did not purport to hold that the terms either of Article III or of the Eleventh Amendment barred the suit, but that the ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity that had inspired adoption of the Eleventh Amendment applied to cases beyond the Amendment’s scope and otherwise within the federal-question jurisdiction.  Indeed, Bradley explicitly admitted that “[i]t is true, the amendment does so read [as to permit Hans’s suit], and if there were no other reason or ground for abating his suit, it might be maintainable.” Hans, 134 U. S., at 10 .  The Court elected, nonetheless, to recognize a broader immunity doctrine, despite the want of any textual manifestation, because of what the Court described as the anomaly that would have resulted otherwise: the Eleventh Amendment (according to the Court) would have barred a federal-question suit by a noncitizen, but the State would have been subject to federal jurisdiction at its own citizen’s behest.  Id., at 10-11 .  The State was accordingly held to be free to resist suit without its consent, which it might grant or withhold as it pleased.  Hans thus addressed the issue implicated (though not directly raised) in the preratification debate about the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses and implicitly settled by <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> : whether state sovereign immunity was cognizable by federal *119 courts on the exercise of federal-question jurisdiction.  According to Hans , and contrary to <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , it was.  But that is all that Hans held.  Because no federal legislation purporting to pierce state immunity was at issue, it cannot fairly be said that Hans held state sovereign immunity to have attained some constitutional status immunizing it from abrogation.  15 Taking Hans only as far as its holding, its vulnerability is apparent.  The Court rested its opinion on avoiding the supposed anomaly of recognizing jurisdiction to entertain a citizen’s federal-question suit, but not one brought by a non-citizen.  See Hans, supra, at 10-11 .  There was, however, no such anomaly at all. As already explained, federal-question eases are not touched by the Eleventh Amendment, which leaves a State open to federal-question suits by citizens and noncitizens alike.

 See id., at 530 (noting that because “none of these arguments about ‘joint jurisdictions’ and ‘coequal sovereignties’ convincingly refuted the Antifederalist doctrine of a supreme and indivisible sovereignty,” the Federalists could succeed only by emphasizing that the supreme power “‘resides in the PEOPLE, as the fountain of government’” (citing 1 Pennsylvania and the Federal Constitution, 1787-1788, p. 302 (J. McMaster & F. Stone eds. 1888) (quoting James Wilson)).  45 The People possessing this plenary bundle of specific powers *152 were free to parcel them out to different governments and different branches of the same government as they saw fit.  See F. McDonald, Novus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Origins of the Constitution 278 (1985).  As James Wilson emphasized, the location of ultimate sovereignty in the People meant that “[t]hey can distribute one portion of power to the more contracted circle called State governments; they can also furnish another proportion to the government of the United States.” 1 Pennsylvania and the Federal Constitution, 1787-1788, supra, at 302.  46 Under such a scheme, Alexander Hamilton explained, “[i]t does not follow .  .. that each of the portions of powers delegated to [the national or state government] is not sovereign with regard to its proper objects.” Hamilton, Opinion on the Constitutionality of an Act to Establish a Bank, in 8 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 98 (Syrett ed. 1965) (emphasis in original).  47 A necessary consequence of this view was that “the Government of the United States has sovereign power as to its declared purposes & trusts.” Ibid. Justice Iredell was to make the same observation in his <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> dissent, commenting that “[t]he United States are sovereign as to all the powers of Government actually surrendered: Each State in the Union is sovereign as to all the powers reserved.” 2 Dali., at 435.  And to the same point was Chief Justice Mar *153 shall’s description of the National and State Governments as “each sovereign, with respect to the objects committed to it, and neither sovereign with respect to the objects committed to the other.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 410 (1819).  Given this metamorphosis of the idea of sovereignty in the years leading up to 1789, the question whether the old immunity doctrine might have been received as something suitable for the new world of federal-question jurisdiction is a crucial one.  48 The answer is that sovereign immunity as it would have been known to the Framers before ratification thereafter became inapplicable as a matter of logic in a federal suit raising a federal question.  The old doctrine, after all, barred the involuntary subjection of a sovereign to the system of justice and law of which it was itself the font, since to do otherwise would have struck the common-law mind from the Middle Ages onward as both impractical and absurd.  See, e. g., Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, 353 (1907) (Holmes, J.) (“A sovereign is exempt from suit.. .  on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the.

 51 The Framers’ principal objectives in rejecting English theories of unitary sovereignty, moreover, would have been impeded if a new concept of sovereign immunity had taken its place in federal-question cases, and would have been substantially thwarted if that new immunity had been held to be untouchable by any congressional effort to abrogate it.  52 *158 Today’s majority discounts this concern.  Without citing a single source to the contrary, the Court dismisses the historical evidence regarding the Framers’ vision of the relationship between national and state sovereignty, and reassures us that “the Nation survived for nearly two centuries without the question of the existence of [the abrogation] power ever being presented to this Court.” Ante, at 71.  53 But we are concerned here not with the survival of the Nation but the opportunity of its citizens to enforce federal rights in a way that Congress provides.  The absence of any general federal-question statute for nearly a century following ratification of Article III (with a brief exception in 1800) hardly counts against the importance of that jurisdiction either in the Framers’ conception or in current reality; likewise, the fact that Congress has not often seen fit to use its power of abrogation (outside the Fourteenth Amendment context, at least) does not compel a conclusion that the power is not important to the federál scheme.  In the end, is it plausible *159 to contend that the plan of the convention was meant to leave the National Government without any way to render individuals capable of enforcing their federal rights directly against an intransigent State?  C The considerations expressed so far, based on text, <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , caution in common-law reception, and sovereignty theory, have pointed both to the mistakes inherent in Hans and, even more strongly, to the error of today’s holding.  Although for reasons of stare decisis I would not today disturb the century-old precedent, I surely would not extend its error by placing the common-law immunity it mistakenly recognized beyond the power of Congress to abrogate.  In doing just that, however, today’s decision declaring state sovereign immunity itself immune from abrogation in federal-question cases is open to a further set of objections peculiar to itself.  For today’s decision stands condemned alike by the Framers’ abhorrence of any notion that such common-law rules as might be received into the new legal systems would be beyond the legislative power to alter or repeal, and by its resonance with this Court’s previous essays in constitutionalizing common-law rules at the expense of legislative authority.  1 I have already pointed out how the views of the Framers reflected the caution of state constitutionalists and legislators over reception of common-law rules, a caution that the Framers exalted to the point of vigorous resistance to any idea that English common-law rules might be imported wholesale through the new Constitution.  The state politicians also took pains to guarantee that once a common-law rule had been received, it would always be subject to legislative alteration, and again the state experience was reflected in the Framers’ thought.  Indeed, the Framers’ very insist *160 ence that no common-law doctrine would be received by virtue of ratification was focused in their fear that elements of the common law might thereby have been placed beyond the power of Congress to alter by legislation.

 I have grouped the two as “Citizen-State Diversity Clauses” for ease in frequent repetition here.  The first of these notions rests on the ancient maxim that “the Eing can do no wrong.” See, e. g., 1W.  Blackstone, Commentaries *244.  Professor Jaffe has argued this expression “originally meant precisely the contrary to what it later came to mean,” that is, “ ‘it meant that the king must not, was not allowed, not entitled, to do wrong.’” Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 4 (quoting L. Ehrlich, Proceedings Against the Crown (1216-1377), p. 42, in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History (P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921), p. 42); see also 1 Blackstone, supra, at *246 (interpreting the maxim to mean that “the prerogative of the crown extends not to do any injury”).  In any event, it is clear that the idea of the sovereign, or any part of it, being above the law in this sense has not survived in American law. See, e. g., Langford v. United States, 101 U. S. 341, 342-343 (1880); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 415 (1979).  The text reads that “[t]he Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; — to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; — to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; — to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; — to Controversies between two or more States; — between a State and Citizens of another State; — between Citizens of different States, — between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.” The one statement I have found on the subject of States’ immunity in federal-question eases was an opinion that immunity would not be applicable in these cases: James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania ratification debate, stated that the federal-question clause would require States to make good on pre-Revolutionary debt owed to English merchants (the enforcement of which was promised in the Treaty of 1783) and thereby “show the world that we make the faith of treaties a constitutional part of the character of the United States; that we secure its performance no longer nominally, for the judges of the United States will be enabled to carry it into effect, let the legislatures of the different states do what they may.” 2 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 490 (2d ed. 1836) (Elliot’s Debates).  This lengthy discussion of the history of the Constitution’s ratification, the Court’s opinion in Chisholm v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall. 419</citedDecision> (1793), and the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment is necessary to explain why, in my view, the contentions in some of our earlier opinions that <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> ere- *107 ated a great “shock of surprise” misread the history.  See Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934).  The Court’s response to this historical analysis is simply to recite yet again Monaco’s erroneous assertion that <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> created “such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted,” 292 U. S., at 325 .  See ante, at 69.  This response is, with respect, no response at all. Monaco’s ipse dixit that <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> created a “shock of surprise” does not make it so. This Court’s opinions frequently make assertions of historical fact, but those assertions are not authoritative as to history in the same way that our interpretations of laws are authoritative as to them.  In Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U. S. 424, 434 (1902), which was, like Monaco, decided a century after the event it purported to recount, the Court baldly stated that “in September 1790, General Washington, on the advice of Mr. Adams, did refuse to permit British troops to march through the territory of the United States from Detroit to the Mississippi, apparently for the reason that the object of such movement was an attack on New Orleans and the Spanish possessions on the Mississippi.” Modern historians agree, however, that there was no such request, see J. Daly, The Use of History in the Decisions of the Supreme Court: 1900-1930, pp. 65-66 (1954); W. Manning, The Nootka Sound Controversy, in Annual Report of the American Historical Association, H. R. Doc. No. 429, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 415-423 (1905), and it would of course be absurd for this Court to treat the fact that Tucker asserted the existence of the request as proof that it actually occurred.  Cf. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 72-73 (1938) (“But it was the more recent research of a competent scholar, who examined the original document, which established that the construction given to [the Judiciary Act of 1789] by the Court was erroneous; and that the purpose of the section was merely to make certain that, in all matters except those in which some federal law is controlling, the federal courts exercising jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship cases would apply as their rules of decision the law of the State, unwritten as well as written”).  Moreover, in this case, there is ample evidence contradicting the “shock of surprise” thesis.  Contrary to Monaco’s suggestion, the Eleventh Amendment was not “at once proposed and adopted.” Congress was in session when <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> was decided, and a constitutional amendment in response was proposed two days later, but Congress never acted on it, and in fact it was not until two years after <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> was handed down that *108 an Amendment was ratified.  See Gibbons, The Eleventh Amendment and State Sovereign Immunity: A Reinterpretation, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1889 , 1926-1927 (1983).  See also <citedDecision>2 Dall., at 435</citedDecision> (“[I]t is certain that in regard to any common law principle which can influence the question before us no alteration has been made by any statute”); <citedDecision>id., at 437</citedDecision> (if “no new remedy be provided ... we have no other rule to govern us but the principles of the pre-existent laws, which must remain in force till superseded by others”); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 283 (1985) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  But see Justice Iredell’s dicta suggesting that the Constitution would not permit suits against a State.  <citedDecision>Chisholm, supra, at 449</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion); Atascadero, supra, at 283, n. 34 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  Of course, even if Justice Iredell had concluded that state sovereign immunity was not subject to abrogation, it would be inappropriate to assume (as it appears the Court does today, and Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), did as well) that the Eleventh Amendment (regardless of what it says) “constitutionalized” Justice Iredell’s dissent, or that it simply adopted the opposite of the holding in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> .  It is as odd to read the Eleventh Amendment’s rejection of <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> (which held that States may be sued in diversity) to say that States may not be sued on a federal question as it would be to read the Twenty-Sixth Amendment’s rejection of Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112 (1970) (which held that Congress could not require States to extend the suffrage to 18-year-olds) to permit Congress to require States to extend the suffrage to 12-year-olds.  The great weight of scholarly commentary agrees.  See, e. g., Jackson, The Supreme Court, the Eleventh Amendment, and State Sovereign Immunity, 98 Yale L. J. 1 (1988); Amar, Of Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L. J. 1425 (1987); Fletcher, A Historical Interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment: A Narrow Construction of an Affirmative Grant of Jurisdiction Rather than a Prohibition Against Jurisdiction, 35 Stan.  L. Rev. 1033 (1983); Gibbons, The Eleventh Amendment and State Sovereign Immunity: A Reinterpretation, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1889 (1983); Field, The Eleventh Amendment and Other Sovereign Immunity Doctrines: Congressional Imposition of Suit Upon the States, 126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1203 (1978).  While a minority has adopted the second view set out above, see, e. g., Marshall, Fighting the Words of the Eleventh Amendment, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1342 (1989); Massey, State Sovereignty and the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 61 (1989), and others have criticized the diversity theory, see, e. g., Marshall, The Diversity Theory of the Eleventh Amendment: A Critical Evaluation, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1372 (1989), I have discovered no commentator affirmatively advocating the position taken by the Court today.  As one scholar has observed, the literature is “remarkably consistent in its evaluation of the historical evidence and text of the amendment as not supporting a broad rule of constitutional immunity for states.” Jackson, supra, at 44, n. 179.  Vassall initiated a suit against Massachusetts, invoking the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Although the marshal for the district of Massachusetts served a subpoena on Governor John Hancock and Attor *112 ney General James Sullivan, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts did not appear by the original return date of August 1793, and the case was continued to the February 1794 Term. Massachusetts never did appear, and the case was “simply continued from term to term through 1796.” 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, at 369.

There are good reasons not to take many of these statements too seriously.  Some are plainly exaggerated; for example, the suggestion in Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), that “[a] state’s freedom from litigation was established as a constitutional right through the Eleventh Amendment” obviously ignores a State’s liability to suit by other States, see, e. g., South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286 (1904), and by the National Government, see, e. g., United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892).  See also Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 420, n. 19 (noting that “the Eleventh Amendment has not accorded the States absolute sovereign immunity in federal-court actions”).  Similarly, statements such as in Ex parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497 , that “the entire judicial *126 power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given” should not necessarily be taken as affirming that Article III itself incorporated a constitutional immunity doctrine.  How else to explain Justice Harlan’s concurring opinion in Hans , which stated, practically in the same breath, that “a suit directly against a State by one of its own citizens is not one to which the judicial power of the United States extends,” and that <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> “was based upon a sound interpretation of.  the Constitution as that instrument then was”?  134 U.

Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction §2.1, pp. 42-43 (2d ed. 1994).  Indeed, The Chief Justice could hardly have been clearer in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), where he explained that “[t]he Court’s decision in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), offers impressive authority for the principle that the States as such were regarded by the Framers of the Constitution as partaking of many attributes of sovereignty quite apart from the provisions of the Tenth Amendment.... Indeed, in Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 439 , The Chief Justice complained in dissent that the same statements upon which he relies today had been “dismiss[ed]... as dicta.” In Hoffman , one Member of the four Justice plurality expressly disavowed the plurality’s assumption that Congress could abrogate the States’ immunity by making its intent to do so clear.  See 492 U. S., at 105 (O’Connor, J., concurring).  The four dissenters, however, not only assumed that Congress had the power to abrogate but found that it had done so. See id,., at 106 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Likewise, in Welch , the four-Justice plurality was joined by four dissenters who insisted upon a congressional power of abrogation.  See 483 U. S., at 519 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  The Court seeks to disparage the common-law roots of the doctrine, and the consequences of those roots which I outline infra, at 132-142 and 159-164, by asserting that Hans “found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental ‘ “jurisprudence in all *131 civilized nations.’”” Ante, at 69 (quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 17 ).  The Hans Court, however, relied explicitly on the ground that a suit against the State by its own citizen was “not known ... at the common law” and was not among the departures from the common law recognized by the Constitution.  Id., at 15 .  Moreover, Hans explicitly adopted the reasoning of Justice Iredell’s dissent in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , see 134 U. S., at 18-19 , and that opinion could hardly have been clearer in relying exclusively on the common law. “The only principles of law .  .. which can affect this case,” Justice Iredell wrote, “[are] those that are derived from what is properly termed ‘the common law,’ a law which I presume is the ground-work of the laws in every State in the Union, and which I consider, so far as it is applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the country, and where no special act of Legislation eontrouls it, to be in force in each State, as it existed in England, (unaltered by any statute) at the time of the first settlement of the country.” <citedDecision>2 Dall., at 435</citedDecision> (emphasis deleted).  See also Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 288 (1973) (Marshall, J., concurring in result) (“Sovereign immunity is a common-law doctrine that long predates our Constitution and the Eleventh Amendment, although it has, of course, been carried forward in our jurisprudence”); R. Watkins, The State as a Party Litigant 51-52 (1927) (“It thus seems probable that the doctriné of state immunity was accepted rather as an existing fact by the people of the states, than adopted as a theory.

See, e. g., Hall, The Common Law: An Account of its Reception in the United States, 4 Vand. L. Rev. 791 , 796 (1951) (“Whether we emphasize the imitation by the colonists of the practices of English local courts or whether we say the early colonial judges were really applying their own common-sense ideas of justice, the fact remains that there was an incomplete acceptance in America of English legal principles, and this indigenous law which developed in America remained as a significant source of law after the Revolution”).

 See 3 Elliot’s Debates 573 (the Constitution would “render valid and effective existing claims” against the States).  See also 2 id., at 491 (James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania ratification debate: “When a citizen has a controversy with another state, there ought to be a tribunal where both parties may stand on a just and equal footing”).  Wilson, as I noted above, took a similar position in addressing the federal question, or arising under, clause, remarking that the effect of the clause would be to require States to honor pre-Revolutionary debt owed to English merchants, as had been promised in the Treaty of 1783.  See n. 4, supra. The Court accuses me of quoting this statement out of context, ante, at 70, n. 12, but the additional material included by the Court makes no difference.  I am conceding that Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall all agreed that Article III did not of its own force abrogate the States’ preexisting common-law immunity, at least with respect to diversity suits.  None of the statements offered by the Court, however, purports to deal with federal-question jurisdiction or with the question whether Congress, acting pursuant to its Article I powers, could create a cause of action against a State.  As I explain further below, the views of Madison and his *144 allies on this more difficult question can be divined, if at all, only by reference to the more extended discussions by Hamilton in The Federalist No. 32, and by Justice Iredell in his <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> dissent.  Both those discussions, I submit, tend to support a congressional power of abrogation.  See also Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 560-561 (1832) (“The Cherokee nation ... is a distinct community ... in which the laws of Georgia can have no force.  .  .  .

See Amar, 96 Yale L. J., at 1434-1435 (“The ultimate American answer [to the British notion that the sovereign was by definition above the law], in part, lay in a radical redefinition of governmental ‘sovereignty.’ Just as a corporation could be delegated limited sovereign privileges by the King-in-Parliament, so governments could be delegated limited powers to govern.  Within the limitations of their charters, governments could be sovereign, but that sovereignty could be bounded by the terms of the delegation itself” (footnote omitted)).  See, e. g., Amar, supra, at 1436 (“By thus relocating true sovereignty in the People themselves .. .  Americans domesticated government power and decisively repudiated British notions of ‘sovereign’ governmental omnipotence” (footnote omitted)).  That this repudiation extended to traditional principles of sovereign immunity is clear from Justice Wilson’s opinion in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , in which he blasted “the haughty notions of state independence, state sovereignty and state supremacy” as allowing “the state [to] assum[e] a supercilious pre-eminence above the people who have formed it.” 2 Dall., at 461.  See also Hobbes, supra, at 130 (“The sovereign of a Commonwealth, be it an assembly or one man, is not subject to the civil laws.  .  .  .

White, The Marshall Court and Cultural Change, 1815-1835, p. 130 (1991) (“[A]n assumption of the constitutional design was that if Congress exercised [its enumerated] powers through legislation, its laws would supersede any competing ones”).  The Court attempts to sidestep this history by distinguishing sovereign immunity as somehow different from other common-law principles.  Ante, at 69.  But see <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall., at 435</citedDecision> (Iredell, J., dissenting) (arguing that the common law of England should control the case “so far as it is applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the country, and where no special act of Legislation eontrouls it”).  The Court cannot find solace in any distinction between “substantive rules of law” and “ju *165 risdiction,” ante, at 69, however; it is abundantly clear that we have drawn both sorts of principles from the common law. See, e. g., Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 609 (1990) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (noting that American notion of personal jurisdiction is a “common-law principle” that predates the Fourteenth Amendment).  Nothing in the history, moreover, suggests that common-law rules were more immutable when they were jurisdictional rather than substantive in nature.  Nor is it true that “the principle of state sovereign immunity stands distinct from other principles of the common law in that only the former prompted a specific constitutional amendment.” Ante, at 69.  The Seventh Amendment, after all, was adopted to respond to Antifederalist concerns regarding the right to jury trial. See n. 34, supra. Indeed, that Amendment vividly illustrates the distinction between provisions intended to adopt the common law (the Amendment specifically mentions the “common law” and states that the common-law right “shall be preserved”) and those provisions, like the Eleventh Amendment, that may have been inspired by a common-law right but include no language of adoption or specific reference.  Finally, the Court’s recourse to a vague “jurisprudence in all civilized nations,” ante, at 69, rather than the common law of England is unavailing.  When the Constitution has received such general principles into our law, for example, in the Admiralty Clause’s adoption of the general “law of nations” or “law of the sea,” those principles have always been subject to change by congressional enactment.

 Justice Stevens saw in that second Eleventh Amendment no bar to the exercise of congressional authority under the Commerce Clause in providing for suits on a federal question by individuals against a State, and I cap only say that after my own canvass of the matter I believe he was entirely correct in that view, for reasons given below.  His position, of course, was also the holding in Union Gas, which the Court now overrules and repudiates.  The fault I find with the majority today is not in its decision to reexamine Union Gas, for the Court in that case produced no majority for a single rationale supporting congressional authority.  Instead, I part company from the Court because I am convinced that its decision is fundamentally mistaken, and for that reason I respectfully dissent.  *101 f — 1 It is useful to separate three questions: (1) whether the States enjoyed sovereign immunity if sued in their own courts in the period prior to ratification of the National Constitution; (2) if so, whether after ratification the States were entitled to claim some such immunity when sued in a federal court exercising jurisdiction either because the suit was between a State and a nonstate litigant who was not its citizen, or because the issue in the case raised a federal question; and (3) whether any state sovereign immunity recognized in federal court may be abrogated by Congress.  The answer to the first question is not clear, although some of the Framers assumed that States did enjoy immunity in their own courts.  The second question was not debated at the time of ratification, except as to citizen-state diversity jurisdiction; 1 there was no unanimity, but in due course the Court in Chisholm v. <citedDecision>Georgia, 2 Dall. 419</citedDecision> (1793), answered that a state defendant enjoyed no such immunity.  As to federal-question jurisdiction, state sovereign immunity seems not to have been debated prior to ratification, the silence probably showing a general understanding at the time that the States would have no immunity in such cases. The adoption of the Eleventh Amendment soon changed the result in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , not by mentioning sovereign immunity, but by eliminating citizen-state diversity jurisdiction over cases with state defendants.  I will explain why the *102 Eleventh Amendment did not affect federal-question jurisdiction, a notion that needs to be understood for the light it casts on the soundness of Hans’s holding that States did enjoy sovereign immunity in federal-question suits.  The Hans Court erroneously assumed that a State could plead sovereign immunity against a noncitizen suing under federal-question jurisdiction, and for that reason held that a State must enjoy the same protection in a suit by one of its citizens.  The error of Hans’s reasoning is underscored by its clear inconsistency with the Founders’ hostility to the implicit reception of common-law doctrine as federal law, and with the Founders’ conception of sovereign power as divided between the States and the National Government for the sake of very practical objectives.  The Court’s answer today to the third question is likewise at odds with the Founders’ view that common law, when it was received into the new American legal system, was always subject to legislative amendment.  In ignoring the reasons for this pervasive understanding at the time of the ratification, and in holding that a nontextual common-law rule limits a clear grant of congressional power under Article I, the Court follows a course that has brought it to grief before in our history, and promises to do so again.  Beyond this third question that elicits today’s holding, there is one further issue.

 There was, on the contrary, a clear disagreement, which was left to fester during the ratification period, to be resolved only thereafter.  One other point, however, was also clear: the *106 debate addressed only the question whether ratification of the Constitution would, in diversity cases and without more, abrogate the state sovereign immunity or allow it to have some application.  We have no record that anyone argued for the third option mentioned above, that the Constitution would affirmatively guarantee state sovereign immunity against any congressional action to the contrary.  Nor would there have been any apparent justification for any such argument, since no clause in the proposed (and ratified) Constitution even so much as suggested such a position.  It may have been reasonable to contend (as we will see that Madison, Marshall, and Hamilton did) that Article III would not alter States’ pre-existing common-law immunity despite its unqualified grant of jurisdiction over diversity suits against States.  But then, as now, there was no textual support for contending that Article III or any other provision would “constitutionalize” state sovereign immunity, and no one uttered any such contention.  B The argument among the Framers and their friends about sovereign immunity in federal citizen-state diversity cases, in any event, was short lived and ended when this Court, in Chisholm v. <citedDecision>Georgia, 2 Dall. 419</citedDecision> (1793), chose between the constitutional alternatives of abrogation and recognition of the immunity enjoyed at common law. The 4-to-l majority adopted the reasonable (although not compelled) interpretation that the first of the two Citizen-State Diversity Clauses abrogated for purposes of federal jurisdiction any immunity the States might have enjoyed in their own courts, and Georgia was accordingly held subject to the judicial power in a common-law assumpsit action by a South Carolina citizen suing to collect a debt.  5 The case also settled, by implica *107 tion, any question there could possibly have been about recognizing state sovereign immunity in actions depending on the federal question (or “arising under”) head of jurisdiction *108 as well.  The constitutional text on federal-question jurisdiction, after all, was just as devoid of immunity language as it was on citizen-state diversity, and at the time of <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> any influence that general common-law immunity might have had as an interpretive force in construing constitutional language would presumably have been no greater when addressing the federal-question language of Article III than its Diversity Clauses.  See Sherry, The Eleventh Amendment and Stare Decisis: Overruling Hans v Louisiana, 57 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1260 , 1270 (1990).  Although Justice Iredell’s dissent in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> seems at times to reserve judgment on what I have called the third question, whether Congress could authorize suits against the States, <citedDecision>Chisholm, supra, at 434-435</citedDecision> , his argument is largely devoted to stating the position taken by several federalists that state sovereign immunity was cognizable under the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses, not that state immunity was somehow invisibly codified as an independent constitutional defense.  As Justice Stevens persuasively explains in greater detail, ante, at 78-81, Justice Iredell’s dissent focused on the construction of the Judiciary Act of 1789, not Article III. See also Orth, The Truth About Justice Ire-dell’s Dissent in Chisholm v. Georgia (1793), 73 N. C. L. Rev. 255 (1994).  This would have been an odd focus, had he believed that Congress lacked the constitutional authority to impose liability.  Instead, on Justice Iredell’s view, States sued in diversity retained the common-law sovereignty “where no special act of Legislation controuls it, to be in force in each State, as it existed in England, (unaltered by any statute) at the time of the first settlement of the country.” 2 Dall, at 435 (emphasis deleted).  While in at least some circumstances States might be held liable to “the authority of the United States,” <citedDecision>id., at 436</citedDecision> , any such liability *109 would depend upon “laws passed under the Constitution and in conformity to it,” <citedDecision>ibid.</citedDecision> 6 Finding no congressional action abrogating Georgia’s common-law immunity, Justice Iredell concluded that the State should not be liable to suit.  7 C The Eleventh Amendment, of course, repudiated <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> and clearly divested federal courts of some jurisdiction as to cases against state parties: “The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State.” There are two plausible readings of this provision’s text.  Under the first, it simply repeals the Citizen-State Diversity *110 Clauses of Article III for all cases in which the State appears as a defendant.  Under the second, it strips the federal courts of jurisdiction in any case in which a state defendant is sued by a citizen not its own, even if jurisdiction might otherwise rest on the existence of a federal question in the suit.  Neither reading of the Amendment, of course, furnishes authority for the Court’s view in today’s case, but we need to choose between the competing readings for the light that will be shed on the Hans doctrine and the legitimacy of inflating that doctrine to the point of constitutional immutability as the Court has chosen to do.  The history and structure of the Eleventh Amendment convincingly show that it reaches only to suits subject to federal jurisdiction exclusively under the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses.  8 In precisely tracking the language in Article III providing for citizen-state diversity jurisdiction, the text of the Amendment does, after all, suggest to common *111 sense that only the Diversity Clauses are being addressed.  If the Framers had meant the Amendment to bar federal-question suits as well, they could not only have made their intentions clearer very easily, but could simply have adopted the first post -Chisholm proposal, introduced in the House of Representatives by Theodore Sedgwick of Massachusetts on instructions from the Legislature of that Commonwealth.

 This Court affirmed the dismissal of the suit, despite the fact that the case fell within the federal court’s “arising under,” or federal-question, jurisdiction.  Justice Bradley’s opinion did not purport to hold that the terms either of Article III or of the Eleventh Amendment barred the suit, but that the ancient doctrine of sovereign immunity that had inspired adoption of the Eleventh Amendment applied to cases beyond the Amendment’s scope and otherwise within the federal-question jurisdiction.  Indeed, Bradley explicitly admitted that “[i]t is true, the amendment does so read [as to permit Hans’s suit], and if there were no other reason or ground for abating his suit, it might be maintainable.” Hans, 134 U. S., at 10 .  The Court elected, nonetheless, to recognize a broader immunity doctrine, despite the want of any textual manifestation, because of what the Court described as the anomaly that would have resulted otherwise: the Eleventh Amendment (according to the Court) would have barred a federal-question suit by a noncitizen, but the State would have been subject to federal jurisdiction at its own citizen’s behest.  Id., at 10-11 .  The State was accordingly held to be free to resist suit without its consent, which it might grant or withhold as it pleased.  Hans thus addressed the issue implicated (though not directly raised) in the preratification debate about the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses and implicitly settled by <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> : whether state sovereign immunity was cognizable by federal *119 courts on the exercise of federal-question jurisdiction.  According to Hans , and contrary to <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , it was.  But that is all that Hans held.  Because no federal legislation purporting to pierce state immunity was at issue, it cannot fairly be said that Hans held state sovereign immunity to have attained some constitutional status immunizing it from abrogation.  15 Taking Hans only as far as its holding, its vulnerability is apparent.  The Court rested its opinion on avoiding the supposed anomaly of recognizing jurisdiction to entertain a citizen’s federal-question suit, but not one brought by a non-citizen.  See Hans, supra, at 10-11 .  There was, however, no such anomaly at all. As already explained, federal-question eases are not touched by the Eleventh Amendment, which leaves a State open to federal-question suits by citizens and noncitizens alike.

 See id., at 530 (noting that because “none of these arguments about ‘joint jurisdictions’ and ‘coequal sovereignties’ convincingly refuted the Antifederalist doctrine of a supreme and indivisible sovereignty,” the Federalists could succeed only by emphasizing that the supreme power “‘resides in the PEOPLE, as the fountain of government’” (citing 1 Pennsylvania and the Federal Constitution, 1787-1788, p. 302 (J. McMaster & F. Stone eds. 1888) (quoting James Wilson)).  45 The People possessing this plenary bundle of specific powers *152 were free to parcel them out to different governments and different branches of the same government as they saw fit.  See F. McDonald, Novus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Origins of the Constitution 278 (1985).  As James Wilson emphasized, the location of ultimate sovereignty in the People meant that “[t]hey can distribute one portion of power to the more contracted circle called State governments; they can also furnish another proportion to the government of the United States.” 1 Pennsylvania and the Federal Constitution, 1787-1788, supra, at 302.  46 Under such a scheme, Alexander Hamilton explained, “[i]t does not follow .  .. that each of the portions of powers delegated to [the national or state government] is not sovereign with regard to its proper objects.” Hamilton, Opinion on the Constitutionality of an Act to Establish a Bank, in 8 Papers of Alexander Hamilton 98 (Syrett ed. 1965) (emphasis in original).  47 A necessary consequence of this view was that “the Government of the United States has sovereign power as to its declared purposes & trusts.” Ibid. Justice Iredell was to make the same observation in his <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> dissent, commenting that “[t]he United States are sovereign as to all the powers of Government actually surrendered: Each State in the Union is sovereign as to all the powers reserved.” 2 Dali., at 435.  And to the same point was Chief Justice Mar *153 shall’s description of the National and State Governments as “each sovereign, with respect to the objects committed to it, and neither sovereign with respect to the objects committed to the other.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 410 (1819).  Given this metamorphosis of the idea of sovereignty in the years leading up to 1789, the question whether the old immunity doctrine might have been received as something suitable for the new world of federal-question jurisdiction is a crucial one.  48 The answer is that sovereign immunity as it would have been known to the Framers before ratification thereafter became inapplicable as a matter of logic in a federal suit raising a federal question.  The old doctrine, after all, barred the involuntary subjection of a sovereign to the system of justice and law of which it was itself the font, since to do otherwise would have struck the common-law mind from the Middle Ages onward as both impractical and absurd.  See, e. g., Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U. S. 349, 353 (1907) (Holmes, J.) (“A sovereign is exempt from suit.. .  on the logical and practical ground that there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the.

 51 The Framers’ principal objectives in rejecting English theories of unitary sovereignty, moreover, would have been impeded if a new concept of sovereign immunity had taken its place in federal-question cases, and would have been substantially thwarted if that new immunity had been held to be untouchable by any congressional effort to abrogate it.  52 *158 Today’s majority discounts this concern.  Without citing a single source to the contrary, the Court dismisses the historical evidence regarding the Framers’ vision of the relationship between national and state sovereignty, and reassures us that “the Nation survived for nearly two centuries without the question of the existence of [the abrogation] power ever being presented to this Court.” Ante, at 71.  53 But we are concerned here not with the survival of the Nation but the opportunity of its citizens to enforce federal rights in a way that Congress provides.  The absence of any general federal-question statute for nearly a century following ratification of Article III (with a brief exception in 1800) hardly counts against the importance of that jurisdiction either in the Framers’ conception or in current reality; likewise, the fact that Congress has not often seen fit to use its power of abrogation (outside the Fourteenth Amendment context, at least) does not compel a conclusion that the power is not important to the federál scheme.  In the end, is it plausible *159 to contend that the plan of the convention was meant to leave the National Government without any way to render individuals capable of enforcing their federal rights directly against an intransigent State?  C The considerations expressed so far, based on text, <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , caution in common-law reception, and sovereignty theory, have pointed both to the mistakes inherent in Hans and, even more strongly, to the error of today’s holding.  Although for reasons of stare decisis I would not today disturb the century-old precedent, I surely would not extend its error by placing the common-law immunity it mistakenly recognized beyond the power of Congress to abrogate.  In doing just that, however, today’s decision declaring state sovereign immunity itself immune from abrogation in federal-question cases is open to a further set of objections peculiar to itself.  For today’s decision stands condemned alike by the Framers’ abhorrence of any notion that such common-law rules as might be received into the new legal systems would be beyond the legislative power to alter or repeal, and by its resonance with this Court’s previous essays in constitutionalizing common-law rules at the expense of legislative authority.  1 I have already pointed out how the views of the Framers reflected the caution of state constitutionalists and legislators over reception of common-law rules, a caution that the Framers exalted to the point of vigorous resistance to any idea that English common-law rules might be imported wholesale through the new Constitution.  The state politicians also took pains to guarantee that once a common-law rule had been received, it would always be subject to legislative alteration, and again the state experience was reflected in the Framers’ thought.  Indeed, the Framers’ very insist *160 ence that no common-law doctrine would be received by virtue of ratification was focused in their fear that elements of the common law might thereby have been placed beyond the power of Congress to alter by legislation.

 I have grouped the two as “Citizen-State Diversity Clauses” for ease in frequent repetition here.  The first of these notions rests on the ancient maxim that “the Eing can do no wrong.” See, e. g., 1W.  Blackstone, Commentaries *244.  Professor Jaffe has argued this expression “originally meant precisely the contrary to what it later came to mean,” that is, “ ‘it meant that the king must not, was not allowed, not entitled, to do wrong.’” Jaffe, 77 Harv. L. Rev., at 4 (quoting L. Ehrlich, Proceedings Against the Crown (1216-1377), p. 42, in 6 Oxford Studies in Social and Legal History (P. Vinogradoff ed. 1921), p. 42); see also 1 Blackstone, supra, at *246 (interpreting the maxim to mean that “the prerogative of the crown extends not to do any injury”).  In any event, it is clear that the idea of the sovereign, or any part of it, being above the law in this sense has not survived in American law. See, e. g., Langford v. United States, 101 U. S. 341, 342-343 (1880); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 415 (1979).  The text reads that “[t]he Judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority; — to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls; — to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction; — to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party; — to Controversies between two or more States; — between a State and Citizens of another State; — between Citizens of different States, — between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.” The one statement I have found on the subject of States’ immunity in federal-question eases was an opinion that immunity would not be applicable in these cases: James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania ratification debate, stated that the federal-question clause would require States to make good on pre-Revolutionary debt owed to English merchants (the enforcement of which was promised in the Treaty of 1783) and thereby “show the world that we make the faith of treaties a constitutional part of the character of the United States; that we secure its performance no longer nominally, for the judges of the United States will be enabled to carry it into effect, let the legislatures of the different states do what they may.” 2 J. Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 490 (2d ed. 1836) (Elliot’s Debates).  This lengthy discussion of the history of the Constitution’s ratification, the Court’s opinion in Chisholm v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall. 419</citedDecision> (1793), and the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment is necessary to explain why, in my view, the contentions in some of our earlier opinions that <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> ere- *107 ated a great “shock of surprise” misread the history.  See Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934).  The Court’s response to this historical analysis is simply to recite yet again Monaco’s erroneous assertion that <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> created “such a shock of surprise that the Eleventh Amendment was at once proposed and adopted,” 292 U. S., at 325 .  See ante, at 69.  This response is, with respect, no response at all. Monaco’s ipse dixit that <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> created a “shock of surprise” does not make it so. This Court’s opinions frequently make assertions of historical fact, but those assertions are not authoritative as to history in the same way that our interpretations of laws are authoritative as to them.  In Tucker v. Alexandroff, 183 U. S. 424, 434 (1902), which was, like Monaco, decided a century after the event it purported to recount, the Court baldly stated that “in September 1790, General Washington, on the advice of Mr. Adams, did refuse to permit British troops to march through the territory of the United States from Detroit to the Mississippi, apparently for the reason that the object of such movement was an attack on New Orleans and the Spanish possessions on the Mississippi.” Modern historians agree, however, that there was no such request, see J. Daly, The Use of History in the Decisions of the Supreme Court: 1900-1930, pp. 65-66 (1954); W. Manning, The Nootka Sound Controversy, in Annual Report of the American Historical Association, H. R. Doc. No. 429, 58th Cong., 3d Sess., pp. 415-423 (1905), and it would of course be absurd for this Court to treat the fact that Tucker asserted the existence of the request as proof that it actually occurred.  Cf. Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 72-73 (1938) (“But it was the more recent research of a competent scholar, who examined the original document, which established that the construction given to [the Judiciary Act of 1789] by the Court was erroneous; and that the purpose of the section was merely to make certain that, in all matters except those in which some federal law is controlling, the federal courts exercising jurisdiction in diversity of citizenship cases would apply as their rules of decision the law of the State, unwritten as well as written”).  Moreover, in this case, there is ample evidence contradicting the “shock of surprise” thesis.  Contrary to Monaco’s suggestion, the Eleventh Amendment was not “at once proposed and adopted.” Congress was in session when <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> was decided, and a constitutional amendment in response was proposed two days later, but Congress never acted on it, and in fact it was not until two years after <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> was handed down that *108 an Amendment was ratified.  See Gibbons, The Eleventh Amendment and State Sovereign Immunity: A Reinterpretation, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1889 , 1926-1927 (1983).  See also <citedDecision>2 Dall., at 435</citedDecision> (“[I]t is certain that in regard to any common law principle which can influence the question before us no alteration has been made by any statute”); <citedDecision>id., at 437</citedDecision> (if “no new remedy be provided ... we have no other rule to govern us but the principles of the pre-existent laws, which must remain in force till superseded by others”); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 283 (1985) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  But see Justice Iredell’s dicta suggesting that the Constitution would not permit suits against a State.  <citedDecision>Chisholm, supra, at 449</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion); Atascadero, supra, at 283, n. 34 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  Of course, even if Justice Iredell had concluded that state sovereign immunity was not subject to abrogation, it would be inappropriate to assume (as it appears the Court does today, and Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), did as well) that the Eleventh Amendment (regardless of what it says) “constitutionalized” Justice Iredell’s dissent, or that it simply adopted the opposite of the holding in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> .  It is as odd to read the Eleventh Amendment’s rejection of <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> (which held that States may be sued in diversity) to say that States may not be sued on a federal question as it would be to read the Twenty-Sixth Amendment’s rejection of Oregon v. Mitchell, 400 U. S. 112 (1970) (which held that Congress could not require States to extend the suffrage to 18-year-olds) to permit Congress to require States to extend the suffrage to 12-year-olds.  The great weight of scholarly commentary agrees.  See, e. g., Jackson, The Supreme Court, the Eleventh Amendment, and State Sovereign Immunity, 98 Yale L. J. 1 (1988); Amar, Of Sovereignty and Federalism, 96 Yale L. J. 1425 (1987); Fletcher, A Historical Interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment: A Narrow Construction of an Affirmative Grant of Jurisdiction Rather than a Prohibition Against Jurisdiction, 35 Stan.  L. Rev. 1033 (1983); Gibbons, The Eleventh Amendment and State Sovereign Immunity: A Reinterpretation, 83 Colum. L. Rev. 1889 (1983); Field, The Eleventh Amendment and Other Sovereign Immunity Doctrines: Congressional Imposition of Suit Upon the States, 126 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1203 (1978).  While a minority has adopted the second view set out above, see, e. g., Marshall, Fighting the Words of the Eleventh Amendment, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1342 (1989); Massey, State Sovereignty and the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 61 (1989), and others have criticized the diversity theory, see, e. g., Marshall, The Diversity Theory of the Eleventh Amendment: A Critical Evaluation, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1372 (1989), I have discovered no commentator affirmatively advocating the position taken by the Court today.  As one scholar has observed, the literature is “remarkably consistent in its evaluation of the historical evidence and text of the amendment as not supporting a broad rule of constitutional immunity for states.” Jackson, supra, at 44, n. 179.  Vassall initiated a suit against Massachusetts, invoking the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Although the marshal for the district of Massachusetts served a subpoena on Governor John Hancock and Attor *112 ney General James Sullivan, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts did not appear by the original return date of August 1793, and the case was continued to the February 1794 Term. Massachusetts never did appear, and the case was “simply continued from term to term through 1796.” 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, at 369.

See also Union Gas, 491 U. S., at 31-32 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“What we said in Hans was, essentially, that the Eleventh Amendment was important not merely for what it said but for what it reflected: a consensus that the doctrine of sovereign immunity, for States as well as for the Federal Government, was part of the understood background against which the Constitution was adopted, and which its jurisdictional provisions did not mean to sweep away”); Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S., at 440 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (interpreting Monaco as *125 “reifying] on precepts underlying but not explicit in Art. Ill and the Eleventh Amendment”).  There are good reasons not to take many of these statements too seriously.  Some are plainly exaggerated; for example, the suggestion in Great Northern Life Ins. Co. v. Read, 322 U. S. 47, 51 (1944), that “[a] state’s freedom from litigation was established as a constitutional right through the Eleventh Amendment” obviously ignores a State’s liability to suit by other States, see, e. g., South Dakota v. North Carolina, 192 U. S. 286 (1904), and by the National Government, see, e. g., United States v. Texas, 143 U. S. 621 (1892).  See also Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 420, n. 19 (noting that “the Eleventh Amendment has not accorded the States absolute sovereign immunity in federal-court actions”).  Similarly, statements such as in Ex parte New York, 256 U. S., at 497 , that “the entire judicial *126 power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given” should not necessarily be taken as affirming that Article III itself incorporated a constitutional immunity doctrine.  How else to explain Justice Harlan’s concurring opinion in Hans , which stated, practically in the same breath, that “a suit directly against a State by one of its own citizens is not one to which the judicial power of the United States extends,” and that <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> “was based upon a sound interpretation of.  the Constitution as that instrument then was”?  134 U. S., at 21 .  See also Georgia Railroad & Banking Co. v. Redwine, supra, at 304 ; Fitts v. McGhee, supra, at 524-525 .  See also Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.

Chemerinsky, Federal Jurisdiction §2.1, pp. 42-43 (2d ed. 1994).  Indeed, The Chief Justice could hardly have been clearer in Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), where he explained that “[t]he Court’s decision in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), offers impressive authority for the principle that the States as such were regarded by the Framers of the Constitution as partaking of many attributes of sovereignty quite apart from the provisions of the Tenth Amendment.... Indeed, in Nevada v. Hall, supra, at 439 , The Chief Justice complained in dissent that the same statements upon which he relies today had been “dismiss[ed]... as dicta.” In Hoffman , one Member of the four Justice plurality expressly disavowed the plurality’s assumption that Congress could abrogate the States’ immunity by making its intent to do so clear.  See 492 U. S., at 105 (O’Connor, J., concurring).  The four dissenters, however, not only assumed that Congress had the power to abrogate but found that it had done so. See id,., at 106 (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Likewise, in Welch , the four-Justice plurality was joined by four dissenters who insisted upon a congressional power of abrogation.  See 483 U. S., at 519 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  The Court seeks to disparage the common-law roots of the doctrine, and the consequences of those roots which I outline infra, at 132-142 and 159-164, by asserting that Hans “found its roots not solely in the common law of England, but in the much more fundamental ‘ “jurisprudence in all *131 civilized nations.’”” Ante, at 69 (quoting Hans, 134 U. S., at 17 ).  The Hans Court, however, relied explicitly on the ground that a suit against the State by its own citizen was “not known ... at the common law” and was not among the departures from the common law recognized by the Constitution.  Id., at 15 .  Moreover, Hans explicitly adopted the reasoning of Justice Iredell’s dissent in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , see 134 U. S., at 18-19 , and that opinion could hardly have been clearer in relying exclusively on the common law. “The only principles of law .  .. which can affect this case,” Justice Iredell wrote, “[are] those that are derived from what is properly termed ‘the common law,’ a law which I presume is the ground-work of the laws in every State in the Union, and which I consider, so far as it is applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the country, and where no special act of Legislation eontrouls it, to be in force in each State, as it existed in England, (unaltered by any statute) at the time of the first settlement of the country.” <citedDecision>2 Dall., at 435</citedDecision> (emphasis deleted).  See also Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., 411 U. S. 279, 288 (1973) (Marshall, J., concurring in result) (“Sovereign immunity is a common-law doctrine that long predates our Constitution and the Eleventh Amendment, although it has, of course, been carried forward in our jurisprudence”); R. Watkins, The State as a Party Litigant 51-52 (1927) (“It thus seems probable that the doctriné of state immunity was accepted rather as an existing fact by the people of the states, than adopted as a theory.  It was a matter of universal practice, and was accepted from the mother country along with the rest of the common law of England applicable to our changed state and condition”).  See, e. g., Hall, The Common Law: An Account of its Reception in the United States, 4 Vand. L. Rev. 791 , 796 (1951) (“Whether we emphasize the imitation by the colonists of the practices of English local courts or whether we say the early colonial judges were really applying their own common-sense ideas of justice, the fact remains that there was an incomplete acceptance in America of English legal principles, and this indigenous law which developed in America remained as a significant source of law after the Revolution”).  See also Jones, The Common Law in the United States: English Themes and American Variations, in Political Separation and Legal Continuity 95-98 (H. Jones ed. 1976) (Jones) (acknowledging that a true common-law system had not yet developed in the early colonial period); Stoebuck, Reception of English Common Law in the American Colonies, 10 Wm. & Mary L.

 See 3 Elliot’s Debates 573 (the Constitution would “render valid and effective existing claims” against the States).  See also 2 id., at 491 (James Wilson, in the Pennsylvania ratification debate: “When a citizen has a controversy with another state, there ought to be a tribunal where both parties may stand on a just and equal footing”).  Wilson, as I noted above, took a similar position in addressing the federal question, or arising under, clause, remarking that the effect of the clause would be to require States to honor pre-Revolutionary debt owed to English merchants, as had been promised in the Treaty of 1783.  See n. 4, supra. The Court accuses me of quoting this statement out of context, ante, at 70, n. 12, but the additional material included by the Court makes no difference.  I am conceding that Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall all agreed that Article III did not of its own force abrogate the States’ preexisting common-law immunity, at least with respect to diversity suits.  None of the statements offered by the Court, however, purports to deal with federal-question jurisdiction or with the question whether Congress, acting pursuant to its Article I powers, could create a cause of action against a State.  As I explain further below, the views of Madison and his *144 allies on this more difficult question can be divined, if at all, only by reference to the more extended discussions by Hamilton in The Federalist No. 32, and by Justice Iredell in his <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> dissent.  Both those discussions, I submit, tend to support a congressional power of abrogation.  See also Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 560-561 (1832) (“The Cherokee nation ... is a distinct community ... in which the laws of Georgia can have no force.  .  .  .  The whole intercourse between the United States and this nation, is, by our Constitution and laws, vested in the government of the United States”).

See also U. S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton, 514 U. S. 779, 838 (1995) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (the Constitution “created a legal system unprecedented in form and design, establishing two orders of government, each with its own direct relationship, its own privity, its own set of mutual rights and obligations to the people who sustain it and are governed by it”).  See Amar, 96 Yale L. J., at 1434-1435 (“The ultimate American answer [to the British notion that the sovereign was by definition above the law], in part, lay in a radical redefinition of governmental ‘sovereignty.’ Just as a corporation could be delegated limited sovereign privileges by the King-in-Parliament, so governments could be delegated limited powers to govern.  Within the limitations of their charters, governments could be sovereign, but that sovereignty could be bounded by the terms of the delegation itself” (footnote omitted)).  See, e. g., Amar, supra, at 1436 (“By thus relocating true sovereignty in the People themselves .. .  Americans domesticated government power and decisively repudiated British notions of ‘sovereign’ governmental omnipotence” (footnote omitted)).  That this repudiation extended to traditional principles of sovereign immunity is clear from Justice Wilson’s opinion in <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> , in which he blasted “the haughty notions of state independence, state sovereignty and state supremacy” as allowing “the state [to] assum[e] a supercilious pre-eminence above the people who have formed it.” 2 Dall., at 461.  See also Hobbes, supra, at 130 (“The sovereign of a Commonwealth, be it an assembly or one man, is not subject to the civil laws.  .  .  .  For he is free that can be free when he will: nor is it possible for any person to be bound to himself, because he that can bind can release; and therefore he that is bound to himself only is not bound”); Bodin, supra, at 28-29 (“One may be subject to laws made by another, but it is impossible to bind oneself in any matter which is the subject of one’s own free exercise of *154 will. ... It follows of necessity that the king cannot be subject to his own laws”).  See also Wood 466 (“[OJnce men grasped, as they increasingly did in the middle [1780’s], that reform of the national government was the best means of remedying the evils caused by the state governments, then the revision of the Articles of Confederation assumed an impetus and an importance that it had not had a few years earlier”).

 .  .  [Laterally every article of the Federalist Constitution and every amendment in the Bill of Rights rests on the repudiation of the British view” (footnote omitted)).  See Wood 304, n. 75 (“To Jefferson in 1785 judicial discretion in the administration of justice was still the great evil and codification the great remedy”); G. White, The Marshall Court and Cultural Change, 1815-1835, p. 130 (1991) (“[A]n assumption of the constitutional design was that if Congress exercised [its enumerated] powers through legislation, its laws would supersede any competing ones”).  The Court attempts to sidestep this history by distinguishing sovereign immunity as somehow different from other common-law principles.  Ante, at 69.  But see <citedDecision>Chisholm</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>2 Dall., at 435</citedDecision> (Iredell, J., dissenting) (arguing that the common law of England should control the case “so far as it is applicable to the peculiar circumstances of the country, and where no special act of Legislation eontrouls it”).  The Court cannot find solace in any distinction between “substantive rules of law” and “ju *165 risdiction,” ante, at 69, however; it is abundantly clear that we have drawn both sorts of principles from the common law. See, e. g., Burnham v. Superior Court of Cal., County of Marin, 495 U. S. 604, 609 (1990) (plurality opinion of Scalia, J.) (noting that American notion of personal jurisdiction is a “common-law principle” that predates the Fourteenth Amendment).  Nothing in the history, moreover, suggests that common-law rules were more immutable when they were jurisdictional rather than substantive in nature.  Nor is it true that “the principle of state sovereign immunity stands distinct from other principles of the common law in that only the former prompted a specific constitutional amendment.” Ante, at 69.  The Seventh Amendment, after all, was adopted to respond to Antifederalist concerns regarding the right to jury trial. See n. 34, supra. Indeed, that Amendment vividly illustrates the distinction between provisions intended to adopt the common law (the Amendment specifically mentions the “common law” and states that the common-law right “shall be preserved”) and those provisions, like the Eleventh Amendment, that may have been inspired by a common-law right but include no language of adoption or specific reference.  Finally, the Court’s recourse to a vague “jurisprudence in all civilized nations,” ante, at 69, rather than the common law of England is unavailing.  When the Constitution has received such general principles into our law, for example, in the Admiralty Clause’s adoption of the general “law of nations” or “law of the sea,” those principles have always been subject to change by congressional enactment.
