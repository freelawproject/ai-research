In the latter case, decided in 1954, Mr. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority, said (at p. 134): “We think that the Wolf decision should not be overruled, for the reasons so persuasively stated therein.” Compare Schwartz v.

S. 458 , which relied on Schwartz .  Actually, only four members of the majority support this reasoning.  See pp. 685-686, infra.  Rea v. United States, 350 U. S. 214 ; Elkins v. United States, <citedDecision>364 U. S. 206</citedDecision> ; Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253 .  My Brother Stewart concurs in the Court’s judgment on grounds which have nothing to do with Wolf .
