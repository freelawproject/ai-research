 Like § 504, the legislation challenged in Hawker was both overinclusive and underinclusive.  Felons were not the only persons who might possess character defects making them unsuitable practitioners of medicine; and, as the Court expressly noted, not all felons would lack good moral character.  Nevertheless, the legislature was permitted to disqualify all members of the class, rather than being required to delegate to the courts the responsibility of determining the character of each individual based on all relevant facts, including the prior conviction.  The legislative findings that sustained the legislation attacked in Hawker were simply that a substantial number of felons would be likely to abuse the practice of medicine because of their bad character.  It is just such findings respecting the average propensities of a given class of persons to engage in particular conduct that the Court will not now permit under the Bill of Attainder Clause.  Though the Court makes no attempt to distinguish the Hawker-type laws it apparently would save them, see Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 96-97 (Warren, C. J., announcing judgment), and with them the provision of the statute now before the Court which disqualifies felons from holding union office.  3 *470 The Court apparently agrees that the Subversive Activities Control Act was not a bill of attainder with regard to the Communist Party because, as the Court pointed out in Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, <citedDecision>367 U. S. 1</citedDecision> , the finding that the Party was a Communist-action organization was not made by the legislature but was made administratively, after a trial-type hearing and subject to judicial review.  But this apparently does not settle whether the statute is a bill of attainder with respect to Party members; for under today’s approach, a finding about the Party and about some of its members does not cure the vice of overinclu-siveness.  The Subversive Activities Control Act attaches certain disqualifications to each Party member following the administrative-judicial finding that the Party is a Communist-action organization.  Among other things, each Party member is disqualified from holding union office, almost the same disqualification as is involved here.  Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950, § 5 (a)(1)(E), added by the Act of Aug. 24, 1954, § 6, 68 Stat. 777 , 50 U. S. C. § 784 (a)(1)(E) (1958 ed.).  I do not see how this and the other consequences attached to Party membership in that Act could survive examination under the principles announced today.  On the other hand, if the statutes involved in Hawker and Agnew are not bills of attainder, how can the Subversive Activities Control Act be an attainder with respect to members of the Communist Party?  In the <citedDecision>Communist Party</citedDecision> case, the Board found that the “[Party’s] principal leaders and a substantial number of its members are subject to and recognize the disciplinary power of the Soviet Union and its representatives.  This evidences domination and control over [the Party] by the Soviet Union, and a purpose to advance the objectives of the world Communist movement.” Modified Report of the Board, December 18, 1956, in Record in that case, *471 p. 2538.  That finding was expressly sustained by this Court. <citedDecision>367 U. S. 1, 57</citedDecision> .  Certainly, if Hawker and Agnew are to be followed at all, these nonlegislative findings establish a sufficient probability or likelihood with regard to Party members- — -a sufficient temptation to Party members who are also union officers — to permit the legislature to disqualify Party members from union office as it did in the Subversive Activities Control Act.  And if the disqualification of Party members in the Subversive Activities Control Act is not a bill of attainder, neither is § 504.  If it is § 504’s specific designation of the Communist Party and its members which concerns the Court — if the Court would have the same concern if the statute in Agnew had disqualified the members of a particular underwriting firm — it seems to me that at this point this vice is no vice at all; for the Congress has provided in another statute, the Subversive Activities Control Act, for an adjudication about Communist-action organizations, the nature of the Party has now been adjudicated and an adequate probability about the future conduct of its members established to justify the disqualification which Congress has imposed.  Compare Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232, 244 (absent findings respecting nature of Communist Party at time of bar applicant’s membership, membership in Party 15 years prior to application provides no rational ground for disqualification).  This, of course, is not the path the Court follows.  Section 504 is said to impose punishment on specific individuals because it has disqualified all Communist Party members without providing for a judicial determination as to each member that he will call a political strike.

 See Hearings before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, Communist Infiltration of Vital Industries and Current Communist Techniques in the Chicago, Illinois, Area, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), pp. 519, 576; Hearings before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, Communist Domination of Unions and Nationál Security, 82d Cong., 2d Sess. (1952), p. 54.  Moreover, the oath requirement created inequities both because the disqualification imposed was visited on the whole union membership and because the taking of an oath was exacted of all union leaders, many of whom resented the requirement.  See American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S., at 434-435 (Jackson, J., concurring and dissenting); S. Rep. No. 187, 86th Cong., 1st Sess. (1959), pp. 7, 9; 1 Leg. Hist. LMRDA 403, 405.  It was obviously reasonable for Congress to substitute | 504 for § 9 (h), and no punitive purpose may be inferred from such congressional action.  Nor can it be denied that i 504 is reasonably related to a permissible legislative objective.  In American Communications Assn. v. Douds, we held that “Congress could rationally find that the Communist Party is not like other political parties in its utilization of positions of union leadership as means by which to bring about strikes ...,” 339 U. S., at 391, and therefore Congress could rationally *478 infer that members of the Communist Party were likely to call political strikes.  See also Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board, <citedDecision>367 U. S. 1, 93-94, 112</citedDecision> .  In 1956 the Subversive Activities Control Board found, after a trial-type hearing, that the Party’s principal leaders and a substantial number of its members recognize the disciplinary power of the Soviet Union.  Without ques-.  tion the findings previously made by Congress and the Subversive Activities Control Board afforded a rational basis in 1959 for Congress to conclude that Communists were likely to call political strikes, and sufficiently more likely than others to do so that special measures could appropriately be enacted to deal with the particular threat posed.  In view of Congress’ demonstrated concern in preventing future conduct — political strikes- — -and the reasonableness of the means adopted to that end, I cannot conclude that § 504 had a punitive purpose or that it constitutes a bill of attainder.  I intimate no opinion on the issues that the Court does not reach.  An overbroadness challenge could also be made under the First Amendment on the ground that in § 504 Congress has too broadly and indiscriminately visited disabilities on a class defined in terms of associational ties.
