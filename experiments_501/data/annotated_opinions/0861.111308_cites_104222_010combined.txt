Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 172 .  Twenty-six years later, without any intervening change in the applicable legal standards, the Court simply rejected its earlier position and decided that the provision of a municipal water supply was immune from federal taxation as an essential governmental function, even though municipal waterworks long had been operated for profit by private industry.  Brush v. Commissioner, 300 U. S., at 370-373 .  At the same time that the Court was holding a municipal water supply to be immune from federal taxes, it had held that a state-run commuter rail system was not immune.  Helvering v. Powers, 293 U. S. 214 (1934).  Justice Black, in Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 427 (1938), was moved to observe: "An implied constitutional distinction which taxes income of an officer of a state-operated transportation system and exempts income of the manager of a municipal water works system manifests the uncertainty created by the `essential' and `non-essential' test" (concurring opinion).  It was this uncertainty and instability that led the Court shortly thereafter, in New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572</citedDecision> (1946), unanimously to conclude that the distinction between "governmental" and "proprietary" functions was "untenable" and must be abandoned.  See <citedDecision>id., at 583</citedDecision> (opinion of Frankfurter, J., joined by Rutledge, J.); <citedDecision>id., at 586</citedDecision> (Stone, C. J., concurring, joined by Reed, Murphy, and Burton, JJ.); <citedDecision>id., at 590-596</citedDecision> (Douglas, J., dissenting, joined by Black J.).  See also Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444, 457 , and n. 14 (1978) (plurality opinion); Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92, 101 (1946).  *543 Even during the heyday of the governmental/proprietary distinction in intergovernmental tax-immunity doctrine the Court never explained the constitutional basis for that distinction.  In South Carolina , it expressed its concern that unlimited state immunity from federal taxation would allow the States to undermine the Federal Government's tax base by expanding into previously private sectors of the economy.  See 199 U. S., at 454-455 .  [8] Although the need to reconcile state and federal interests obviously demanded that state immunity have some limiting principle, the Court did not try to justify the particular result it reached; it simply concluded that a "line [must] be drawn," id., at 456 , and proceeded to draw that line. The Court's elaborations in later cases, such as the assertion in Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 360, 369 (1934), that "[w]hen a state enters the market place seeking customers it divests itself of its quasi sovereignty pro tanto, " sound more of ipse dixit than reasoned explanation.  This inability to give principled content to the distinction between "governmental" and "proprietary," no less significantly than its unworkability, led the Court to abandon the distinction in <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> v. United States .  The distinction the Court discarded as unworkable in the field of tax immunity has proved no more fruitful in the field of regulatory immunity under the Commerce Clause.  Neither do any of the alternative standards that might be employed to distinguish between protected and unprotected governmental functions appear manageable.  We rejected the possibility of making immunity turn on a purely historical standard of "tradition" in Long Island, and properly so. The most obvious defect of a historical approach to state immunity is that it prevents a court from accommodating changes in the historical functions of States, changes that have resulted *544 in a number of once-private functions like education being assumed by the States and their subdivisions.  [9] At the same time, the only apparent virtue of a rigorous historical standard, namely, its promise of a reasonably objective measure for state immunity, is illusory.  Reliance on history as an organizing principle results in line-drawing of the most arbitrary sort; the genesis of state governmental functions stretches over a historical continuum from before the Revolution to the present, and courts would have to decide by fiat precisely how longstanding a pattern of state involvement had to be for federal regulatory authority to be defeated.  [10] *545 A nonhistorical standard for selecting immune governmental functions is likely to be just as unworkable as is a historical standard.

 Of course, we continue to recognize that the States occupy a special and specific position in our constitutional system and that the scope of Congress' authority under the Commerce Clause must reflect that position.  But the principal and basic limit on the federal commerce power is that inherent in all congressional action  the built-in restraints that our system provides through state participation in federal governmental action.  The political process ensures that laws that unduly burden the States will not be promulgated.  In the factual setting of these cases the internal safeguards of the political process have performed as intended.  These cases do not require us to identify or define what affirmative limits the constitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce Clause.  See Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911).  We note and accept Justice Frankfurter's observation in New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572, 583</citedDecision> (1946): "The process of Constitutional adjudication does not thrive on conjuring up horrible possibilities that never happen in the real world and devising doctrines sufficiently comprehensive in detail to cover the remotest contingency.  Nor need we go beyond what is required for a reasoned disposition of the kind of controversy now before the Court." Though the separate concurrence providing the fifth vote in National League of Cities was "not untroubled by certain possible implications" of the decision, 426 U. S., at 856 , the Court in that case attempted to articulate affirmative limits on the Commerce Clause power in terms of core governmental functions and fundamental attributes of state sovereignty.  But the model of democratic decisionmaking the *557A Court there identified underestimated, in our view, the solicitude of the national political process for the continued vitality of the States.  Attempts by other courts since then to draw guidance from this model have proved it both impracticable and doctrinally barren.  In sum, in National League of Cities the Court tried to repair what did not need repair.  We do not lightly overrule recent precedent.  [22] We have not hesitated, however, when it has become apparent that a prior decision has departed from a proper understanding of congressional power under the Commerce Clause.

 It is worth recalling the cited passage in McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819), that lies at the source of the recent expansion of the commerce power.  "Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution," Chief Justice Marshall said, "and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional" (emphasis added).  The spirit of the Tenth Amendment, of course, is that the States will retain their integrity in a system in which the laws of the United States are nevertheless supreme.  Fry v. United States, supra, at 547, n. 7.  It is not enough that the "end be legitimate"; the means to that end chosen by Congress must not contravene the spirit of the Constitution.  Thus many of this Court's decisions acknowledge that the means by which national power is exercised must take into account concerns for state autonomy.  See, e. g., Fry v. United States, supra, at 547, n. 7; New *586 York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572, 586-587</citedDecision> (1946) (Stone, C. J., concurring); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, at 37 ("Undoubtedly, the scope of this [commerce] power must be considered in the light of our dual system of government and may not be extended so as to embrace effects upon interstate commerce so indirect and remote that to embrace them, in view of our complex society, would effectually obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local and create a completely centralized government"); Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S. 453, 466-467 (1938).  See also Sandalow, Constitutional Interpretation, 79 Mich. L. Rev. 1033 , 1055 (1981) ("The question, always, is whether the exercise of power is consistent with the entire Constitution, a question that can be answered only by taking into account, so far as they are relevant, all of the values to which the Constitution  as interpreted over time  gives expression").  For example, Congress might rationally conclude that the location a State chooses for its capital may affect interstate commerce, but the Court has suggested that Congress would nevertheless be barred from dictating that location because such an exercise of a delegated power would undermine the state sovereignty inherent in the Tenth Amendment.  Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559, 565 (1911).  Similarly, Congress in the exercise of its taxing and spending powers can protect federal savings and loan associations, but if it chooses to do so by the means of converting quasi-public state savings and loan associations into federal associations, the Court has held that it contravenes the reserved powers of the States because the conversion is not a reasonably necessary exercise of power to reach the desired end.  Hopkins Federal Savings & Loan Assn. v. Cleary, 296 U. S. 315 (1935).  The operative language of these cases varies, but the underlying principle is consistent: state autonomy is a relevant factor in assessing the means by which Congress exercises its powers.  *587 This principle requires the Court to enforce affirmative limits on federal regulation of the States to complement the judicially crafted expansion of the interstate commerce power.  National League of Cities v. Usery represented an attempt to define such limits.  The Court today rejects National League of Cities and washes its hands of all efforts to protect the States.  In the process, the Court opines that unwarranted federal encroachments on state authority are and will remain " `horrible possibilities that never happen in the real world.' " Ante, at 556, quoting <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> v. United States, supra, at 583 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  There is ample reason to believe to the contrary.  The last two decades have seen an unprecedented growth of federal regulatory activity, as the majority itself acknowledges.  Ante, at 544-545, n. 10.  In 1954, one could still speak of a "burden of persuasion on those favoring national intervention" in asserting that "National action has .  .  .

 is not the performance of a governmental function," and that "[w]hen a state enters the market place seeking customers it divests itself of its quasi sovereignty pro tanto, and takes on the character of a trader, so far, at least, as the taxing power of the federal government is concerned." Id., at 369 .  In Powers , the Court upheld the application of the federal income tax to the income of trustees of a state-operated commuter railroad; the Court reiterated that "the State cannot withdraw sources of revenue from the federal taxing power by engaging in businesses which constitute a departure from usual governmental functions and to which, by reason of their nature, the federal taxing power would normally extend," regardless of the fact that the proprietary enterprises "are undertaken for what the State conceives to be the public benefit." 293 U. S., at 225 .  Accord, Allen v. Regents, 304 U. S. 439, 451-453 (1938).  [8]  That concern was especially weighty in South Carolina because liquor taxes, the object of the dispute in that case, then accounted for over one-fourth of the Federal Government's revenues.  See New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572, 598, n. 4</citedDecision> (1946) (dissenting opinion).  [9]  Indeed, the "traditional" nature of a particular governmental function can be a matter of historical nearsightedness; today's self-evidently "traditional" function is often yesterday's suspect innovation.  Thus, National League of Cities offered the provision of public parks and recreation as an example of a traditional governmental function.  426 U. S., at 851 .  A scant 80 years earlier, however, in Shoemaker v. United States, 147 U. S. 282 (1893), the Court pointed out that city commons originally had been provided not for recreation but for grazing domestic animals "in common," and that "[i]n the memory of men now living, a proposition to take private property [by eminent domain] for a public park .  .  .  would have been regarded as a novel exercise of legislative power." Id., at 297 .  [10]  For much the same reasons, the existence vel non of a tradition of federal involvement in a particular area does not provide an adequate standard for state immunity.  Most of the Federal Government's current regulatory activity originated less than 50 years ago with the New Deal, and a good portion of it has developed within the past two decades.  The recent vintage of this regulatory activity does not diminish the strength of the federal interest in applying regulatory standards to state activities, nor does it affect the strength of the States' interest in being free from federal supervision.  Although the Court's intergovernmental tax-immunity decisions ostensibly have subjected particular state activities to federal taxation because those activities "ha[ve] been traditionally within [federal taxing] power from the beginning," <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 588</citedDecision> (Stone, C. J., concurring, joined by Reed, Murphy, and Burton, JJ.), the Court has not in fact required federal taxes to have long historical records in order to be effective.  The income tax at issue in Powers, supra, took effect less than a decade before the tax years for which it was challenged, while the federal tax whose application was upheld in <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> v. United States took effect in 1932 and was rescinded less than two years later.  See Helvering v. Powers, 293 U. S., at 222 ; Rakestraw, The Reciprocal Rule of Governmental Tax Immunity  A Legal Myth, 11 Fed. Bar J. 3, 34, n. 116 (1950).  [11]  See, e. g., J.

 See Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975).  See also Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 282 (1981) (national surface mining standards necessary to insure competition among States does not undermine States' efforts to maintain adequate intrastate standards).  On the other hand, we have also assessed the injury done to the States if forced to comply with federal Commerce Clause enactments.  See National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 846-851 .  [6]  In addition, reliance on the Court's difficulties in the tax immunity field is misplaced.  Although the Court has abandoned the "governmental/proprietary" distinction in this field, see New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572</citedDecision> (1946), it has not taken the drastic approach of relying solely on the structure of the Federal Government to protect the States' immunity from taxation.  See Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444 (1978).  Thus, faced with an equally difficult problem of defining constitutional boundaries of federal action directly affecting the States, we did not adopt the view many would think naive, that the Federal Government itself will protect whatever rights the States may have.  [7]  Late in its opinion, the Court suggests that after all there may be some "affirmative limits the constitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce Clause." Ante, at 556.  The Court asserts that "[i]n the factual setting of these cases the internal safeguards of the political process have performed as intended." Ibid. The Court does not explain the basis for this judgment.
