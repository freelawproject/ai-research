 Prosecutors themselves claim that the admonishment of the right to remain silent without more “will benefit only the recidivist and the professional.” Brief for the National District Attorneys Association as amicus curiae, p. 14.  Even preliminary advice given to the accused by his own attorney can be swiftly overcome by the secret interrogation process.  Cf. Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478, 485, n. 5 .  Thus, the need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege comprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present during any questioning if the defendant so desires.  The presence of counsel at the interrogation may serve several significant subsidiary functions as well.  If the accused decides to talk to his interrogators, the assistance of counsel can mitigate the dangers of untrustworthiness.  With a lawyer present the likelihood that the police will practice coercion is reduced, and if coercion is nevertheless exercised the lawyer can testify to it in court. The presence of a lawyer can also help to guarantee that the accused gives a fully accurate statement to the police and that the statement is rightly reported by the prosecution at trial. See Crooker v. California, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 433, 443-448</citedDecision> (1958) (Douglas, J., dissenting).  An individual need not make a pre-interrogation request for a lawyer.  While such request affirmatively secures his right to have one, his failure to ask for a lawyer does not constitute a waiver.  No effective waiver of the right to counsel during interrogation can be recognized unless specifically made after the warnings we here delineate have been given.  The accused who does not know his rights and therefore does not make a request *471 may be the person who most needs counsel.  As the California Supreme Court has aptly put it: “Finally, we must recognize that the imposition of the requirement for the request would discriminate against the defendant who does not know his rights.  The defendant who does not ask for counsel is the very defendant who most needs counsel.

 Such a strict constitutional specific inserted at the nerve center of crime detection may well kill the patient.  3 *501 Since there is at this time a paucity of information and an almost total lack of empirical knowledge on the practical operation of requirements truly comparable to those announced by the majority, I would be more restrained lest we go too far too fast.  II.  Custodial interrogation has long been recognized as “undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement.” Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 515 (1963).  Recognition of this fact should put us on guard against the promulgation of doctrinaire rules.  Especially is this true where the Court finds that “the Constitution has prescribed” its holding and where the light of our past cases, from Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574 , (1884), down to Haynes v. Washington, supra, is to *502 the contrary.  Indeed, even in Escobedo the Court never hinted that an affirmative “waiver” was a prerequisite to questioning; that the burden of proof as to waiver was on the prosecution; that the presence of counsel— absent a waiver — during interrogation was required; that a waiver can be withdrawn at the will of the accused; that counsel must be furnished during an accusatory stage to those unable to pay; nor that admissions and exculpatory statements are “confessions.” To require all those things at one gulp should cause the Court to choke over more cases than Crooker v. California, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 433</citedDecision> (1958), and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 (1958), which it expressly overrules today.  The rule prior to today — as Mr. Justice Goldberg, the author of the Court’s opinion in Escobedo , stated it in Haynes v. Washington — depended upon “a totality of circumstances evidencing an involuntary .  .  .  admission of guilt.” 373 U. S., at 514 .  And he concluded: “Of course, detection and solution of crime is, at best, a difficult and arduous task requiring determination and persistence on the part of all responsible officers charged with the duty of law enforcement.  And, certainly, we do not mean to suggest that all interrogation of witnesses and suspects is impermissible.

 In the absence of warnings, the burden would be on the State to prove that counsel was knowingly and intelligently waived or that in the totality of the circumstances, including the failure to give the necessary warnings, the confession was clearly voluntary.  Rather than employing the arbitrary Fifth Amendment rule 4 which the Court lays down I would follow the more pliable dictates of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments which we are accustomed to administering and which we know from our cases are effective instruments in protecting persons in police custody.  In this way we would not be acting in the dark nor in one full sweep changing the traditional rules of custodial interrogation which this Court has for so long recognized as a justifiable and proper tool in balancing individual rights against the rights of society.  It will be soon enough to go further when we are able to appraise with somewhat better accuracy the effect of such a holding.  I would affirm the convictions in Miranda v. Arizona, No. 759; Vignera v. New York, No. 760; and Westover v. United States, No. 761.  In each of those cases I find from the circumstances no warrant for reversal.  In *504 <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> v. Stewart, No. 584, I would dismiss the writ of certiorari for want of a final judgment, 28 U. S. C. § 1257 (3) (1964 ed.); but if the merits are to be reached I would affirm on the ground that the State failed to fulfill its burden, in the absence of a showing that appropriate warnings were given, of proving a waiver or a totality of circumstances showing voluntariness.  Should there be a retrial, I would leave the State free to attempt to prove these elements.  Mr. Justice Harlan, whom Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice White join, dissenting.  I believe the decision of the Court represents poor constitutional law and entails harmful consequences for the country at large.  How serious these consequences may prove to be only time can tell.  But the basic flaws in the Court’s justification seem to me readily apparent now once all sides of the problem are considered.  I.

 The earliest confession cases in this Court emerged from federal prosecutions and were settled on a nonconstitutional basis, the Court adopting the common-law rule that the absence of inducements, promises, and threats made a confession voluntary and admissible.  Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574 ; Pierce v. United States, 160 U. S. 355 .  While a later case said the Fifth Amendment privilege controlled admissibility, this proposition was not itself developed in subsequent decisions.  2 The Court did, however, heighten the test of admissibility in federal trials to one of voluntariness “in fact,” Wan v. *507 United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14 (quoted, ante, p. 462), and then by and large left federal judges to apply the same standards the Court began to derive in a string of state court cases. This new line of decisions, testing admissibility by the Due Process Clause, began in 1936 with Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 , and must now embrace somewhat more than 30 full opinions of the Court. 3 While the voluntariness rubric was repeated in many instances, e. g., Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U. S. 596 , the Court never pinned it down to a single meaning but on the contrary infused it with a number of different values.  To travel quickly over the main themes, there was an initial emphasis on reliability, e. g., Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S. 547 , supplemented by concern over the legality and fairness of the police practices, e. g., Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 , in an “accusatorial” system of law enforcement, Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 54 , and eventually by close attention to the individual’s state of mind and capacity for effective choice, e. g., Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49 .  The outcome was a continuing re-evaluation on the facts of each case of how much pressure on the suspect was permissible.  4 *508 Among the criteria often taken into account were threats or imminent danger, e. g., Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560 , physical deprivations such as lack of sleep or food, e. g., Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433 , repeated or extended interrogation, e. g., Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227 , limits on access to counsel or friends, Crooker v. California, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 433</citedDecision> ; Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , length and illegality of detention under state law, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 , and individual weakness or incapacities, Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 .  Apart from direct physical coercion, however, no single default or fixed combination of defaults guaranteed exclusion, and synopses of the cases would serve little use because the overall gauge has been steadily changing, usually in the direction of restricting admissibility.  But to mark just what point had been reached before the Court jumped the rails in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 , it is worth capsulizing the then-recent case of Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 .  There, Haynes had been held some 16 or more hours in violation of state law before signing the disputed confession, had received no warnings of any kind, and despite requests had been refused access to his wife or to counsel, the police indicating that access would be allowed after a confession.  Emphasizing especially this last inducement and rejecting some contrary indicia of voluntariness, the Court in a 5-to-4 decision held the confession inadmissible.  There are several relevant lessons to be drawn from this constitutional history.  The first is that with over 25 years of precedent the Court has developed an elaborate, sophisticated, and sensitive approach to.

 It is “judicial” in its treatment of one case at a time, see Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 635 (concurring opinion of The Chief Justice), flexible in its ability to respond to the endless mutations of fact presented, and ever more familiar to the lower courts.  *509 Of course, strict certainty is not obtained in this developing process, but this is often so with constitutional principles, and disagreement is usually confined to that borderland of close cases where it matters least.  The second point is that in practice and from time to time in principle, the Court has given ample recognition to society’s interest in suspect questioning as an instrument of law enforcement.  Cases countenancing quite significant pressures can be cited without difficulty, 5 and the lower courts may often have been yet more tolerant.  Of course the limitations imposed today were rejected by necessary implication in case after case, the right to warnings having been explicitly rebuffed in this Court many years ago.  Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303 ; Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613 .  As recently as Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 515 , the Court openly acknowledged that questioning of witnesses and suspects “is undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement.” Accord, Crooker v. California, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 433, 441</citedDecision> .  Finally, the cases disclose that the language in many of the opinions overstates the actual course of decision.  It has been said, for example, that an admissible confession must be made by the suspect “in the unfettered exercise of his own will,” Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 8 , and that “a prisoner is not ‘to be made the deluded instrument of his own conviction,’ ” Culomhe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 581 (Frankfurter, J., announcing the Court’s judgment and an opinion).  Though often repeated, such principles are rarely observed in full measure.  Even the word “voluntary” may be deemed some *510 what misleading, especially when one considers many of the confessions that have been brought under its umbrella.  See, e. g., supra, n. 5.  The tendency to overstate may be laid in part to the flagrant facts often before the Court; but in any event one must recognize how it has tempered attitudes and lent some color of authority to the approach now taken by the Court. I turn now to the Court’s asserted reliance on the Fifth Amendment, an approach which I frankly regard as a trompb Voeil.

 .  .  .  And it is laid down *530 that it is not essential to the admissibility of a confession that it should appear that the person was warned that what he said would be used against him, but on the contrary, if the confession was voluntary, it is sufficient though it appear that he was not so warned.” Since Bram , the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation has been frequently reiterated.  Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303 , cited Wilson approvingly and held admissible as voluntary statements the accused’s testimony at a preliminary hearing even though he was not warned that what he said might be used against him.  Without any discussion of the presence or absence of warnings, presumably because such discussion was deemed unnecessary, numerous other cases have declared that “[t]he mere fact that a confession was made while in the custody of the police does not render it inadmissible,” McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, 346 ; accord, United States v. Mitchell, 322 U. S. 65 , despite its having been elicited by police examination, Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14 ; United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 39 .  Likewise, in Crooker v. California, <citedDecision>357 U. S. 433, 437</citedDecision> , the Court said that “the bare fact of police ‘detention and police examination in private of one in official state custody’ does not render involuntary a confession by the one so detained.” And finally, in Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , a confession obtained by police interrogation after arrest was held voluntary even though the authorities refused to permit the defendant to consult with his attorney.  See generally Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 587-602 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); 3 Wigmore, Evidence § 851, at 313 (3d ed. 1940); see also Joy, Admissibility of Confessions 38, 46 (1842).  Only a tiny minority of our judges who have dealt with the question, including today’s majority, have considered in-custody interrogation, without more, to be a violation of the Fifth Amendment.  And this Court, as *531 every member knows, has left standing literally thousands of criminal convictions that rested at least in part on confessions taken in the course of interrogation by the police after arrest.  II.  That the Court’s holding today is neither compelled nor even strongly suggested by the language of the Fifth Amendment, is at odds with American and English legal history, and involves a departure from a long line of precedent does not prove either that the Court has exceeded its powers or that the Court is wrong or unwise in its present reinterpretation of the Fifth Amendment.  It does, however, underscore the obvious — that the Court has not discovered or found the law in making today’s decision, nor has it derived it from some irrefutable sources; what it has done is to make new law and new public policy in much the same way that it has in the course of interpreting other great clauses of the Constitution.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 At the same time, the Court’s per se approach may not be justified on the ground that it provides a “bright line” permitting the authorities to judge in advance whether interrogation may safely be pursued without jeopardizing the admissibility of any information obtained as a consequence.  Nor can it be claimed that judicial time and effort, assuming that is a relevant consideration, *545 will be conserved because of the ease of application of the new rule.  Today’s decision leaves open such questions as whether the accused was in custody, whether his statements were spontaneous or the product of interrogation, whether the accused has effectively waived his rights, and whether nontestimonial evidence introduced at trial is the fruit of statements made during a prohibited interrogation, all of which are certain to prove productive of uncertainty during investigation and litigation during prosecution.  For all these reasons, if further restrictions on police interrogation are desirable at this time, a more flexible approach makes much more sense than the Court’s constitutional straitjacket which forecloses more discriminating treatment by legislative or rule-making pronouncements.  Applying the traditional standards to the cases before the Court, I would hold these confessions voluntary.  I would therefore affirm in Nos. 759, 760, and 761, and reverse in No. 584.  Of course the Court does not deny that it is departing from prior precedent; it expressly overrules <citedDecision>Crooker</citedDecision> and Cicenia, ante, at 479, n. 48, and it acknowledges that in the instant “cases we might not find the defendants’ statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms,” ante, at 457.  In fact, the type of sustained interrogation described by the Court appears to be the exception rather than the rule.  A survey of 399 cases in one city found that in almost half of the eases the interrogation lasted less than 30 minutes.  Barrett, Police Practices and the Law — From Arrest to Release or Charge, 50 Calif. L. Rev. 11 , 41-45 (1962).  Questioning tends to be confused and sporadic and is usually concentrated on confrontations with witnesses or new items of evidence, as these are obtained by officers conducting the investigation.  See generally LaFave, Arrest: The Decision to Take a Suspect into Custody 386 (1965); ALI, A Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, Commentary § 5.01, at 170, n. 4 (Tent.  Draft No. 1, 1966).

 [45]  Although this Court held in Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367 (1951), over strong dissent, that a witness before a grand jury may not in certain circumstances decide to answer some questions and then refuse to answer others, that decision has no application to the interrogation situation we deal with today.  No legislative or judicial fact-finding authority is involved here, nor is there a possibility that the individual might make self-serving statements of which he could make use at trial while refusing to answer incriminating statements.  [46]  The distinction and its significance has been aptly described in the opinion of a Scottish court: "In former times such questioning, if undertaken, would be conducted by police officers visiting the house or place of business of the suspect and there questioning him, probably in the presence of a relation or friend.  However convenient the modern practice may be, it must normally create a situation very unfavorable to the suspect." Chalmers v. H. M. Advocate, [1954] Sess. Cas. 66, 78 (J. C.).  [47]  See People v.

Marked bills from the bank robbed were found in Westover's car. Articles stolen from the victim as well as from several other robbery victims were found in Stewart's home at the outset of the investigation.  [52]  Dealing as we do here with constitutional standards in relation to statements made, the existence of independent corroborating evidence produced at trial is, of course, irrelevant to our decisions.

**Combined Opinion**
 Other examples are less stringent search and seizure rules and no automatic exclusion for violation of them, id., at 167-169 ; guilt based on majority jury verdicts, id., at 185 ; and pre-trial discovery of evidence on both sides, id., at 175 .  [22]  Of particular relevance is the ALI's drafting of a Model Code of Pre-Arraignment Procedure, now in its first tentative draft.  While the ABA and National Commission studies have wider scope, the former is lending its advice to the ALI project and the executive director of the latter is one of the reporters for the Model Code. [23]  See Brief for the United States in Westover , p. 45.  The N. Y. Times, June 3, 1966, p. 41 (late city ed.) reported that the Ford Foundation has awarded $1,100,000 for a five-year study of arrests and confessions in New York. [24]  The New York Assembly recently passed a bill to require certain warnings before an admissible confession is taken, though the rules are less strict than are the Court's.  N. Y. Times, May 24, 1966, p. 35 (late city ed.).  [25]  The Court waited 12 years after Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 , declared privacy against improper state intrusions to be constitutionally safeguarded before it concluded in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , that adequate state remedies had not been provided to protect this interest so the exclusionary rule was necessary.  [1]  Of course the Court does not deny that it is departing from prior precedent; it expressly overrules <citedDecision>Crooker</citedDecision> and Cicenia, ante, at 479, n. 48, and it acknowledges that in the instant "cases we might not find the defendants' statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms," ante, at 457.  [2]  In fact, the type of sustained interrogation described by the Court appears to be the exception rather than the rule.  A survey of 399 cases in one city found that in almost half of the cases the interrogation lasted less than 30 minutes.

Questioning tends to be confused and sporadic and is usually concentrated on confrontations with witnesses or new items of evidence, as these are obtained by officers conducting the investigation.
