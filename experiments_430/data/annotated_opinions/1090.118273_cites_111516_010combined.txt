**Combined Opinion**
 The Court of Appeals concluded that President Taylor did not have the authority to issue the removal order and that the invalid removal order was inseverable from the portion of the order purporting to abrogate Chippewa usufructuary rights.  Id., at 914-918.  Second, the Court of Appeals concluded that the 1855 Treaty did not extinguish the Mille Lacs Band's usufructuary privileges.  Id., at 919-921.  The court noted that the revocation of hunting and fishing rights was neither discussed during the Treaty negotiations nor mentioned in the Treaty itself.  Id., at 920.  The court also rejected the State's argument that this Court's decision in Oregon Dept. of Fish and *188 Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1985), required a different result.  124 F. 3d, at 921.  Third, the court rejected the State's argument that, under the "equal footing doctrine," Minnesota's entrance into the Union extinguished any Indian treaty rights.  Id., at 926-929.  Specifically, the Court of Appeals found no evidence of congressional intent in enacting the Minnesota statehood Act to abrogate Chippewa usufructuary rights, id., at 929, and it rejected the argument that Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U. S. 504 (1896), controlled the resolution of this issue, 124 F. 3d, at 926-927.  In sum, the Court of Appeals held that the Chippewa retained their usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty with respect to land located in the State of Minnesota.  This conclusion is consistent with the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit's earlier decision holding that the Chippewa retained those same rights with respect to the ceded land located in Wisconsin.
**Combined Opinion**
 The State proposes no explanation compelling or otherwisefor why the United States would have wanted to abrogate the Mille Lacs Band's hunting and fishing rights, while leaving intact the other Bands' rights to hunt and fish on the same territory.  *200 To summarize, the historical record provides no support for the theory that the second sentence of Article 1 was designed to abrogate the usufructuary privileges guaranteed under the 1837 Treaty, but it does support the theory that the Treaty, and Article 1 in particular, was designed to transfer Chippewa land to the United States.  At the very least, the historical record refutes the State's assertion that the 1855 Treaty "unambiguously" abrogated the 1837 hunting, fishing, and gathering privileges.  Given this plausible ambiguity, we cannot agree with the State that the 1855 Treaty abrogated Chippewa usufructuary rights.  We have held that Indian treaties are to be interpreted liberally in favor of the Indians, Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S., at 675-676 ; Choctaw Nation v. United States, 318 U. S., at 432 , and that any ambiguities are to be resolved in their favor, Winters v. United States, 207 U. S. 564, 576-577 (1908).  See also County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992).  To attack the conclusion that the 1855 Treaty does not abrogate the usufructuary rights guaranteed under the 1837 Treaty, the State relies primarily on our decision in Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1985).  Klamath required this Court to interpret two agreements.  In the first agreement, an 1864 Treaty between the United States and several Indian Tribes now collectively known as the Klamath Indian Tribe, the Indians conveyed their remaining lands to the United States, and a portion of this land was set aside as a reservation.  <citedDecision>Id., at 755</citedDecision> .  The 1864 Treaty provided that the Tribe had the "`exclusive right of taking fish in the streams and lakes, included in said reservation, and of gathering edible roots, seeds, and berries within its limits,' " but it provided for no offreservation usufructuary rights.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> (quoting Treaty of Oct. 14, 1864).  Due to a surveying error, the reservation excluded land that, under the terms of the Treaty, should *201 have been included within the reservation.  Thus, in 1901, the United States and the Tribe entered into a second agreement, in which the United States agreed to compensate the Tribe for those lands, and the Tribe agreed to "`cede, surrender, grant, and convey to the United States all their claim, right, title and interest in and to' " the lands erroneously excluded from the reservation.  <citedDecision>Id., at 760</citedDecision> .  The Tribe contended that the 1901 agreement had not abrogated its usufructuary rights under the 1864 Treaty with respect to those lands.  We rejected the Tribe's argument and held that it had in fact relinquished its usufructuary rights to the lands at issue.  We recognized that the 1864 Treaty had secured certain usufructuary rights to the Tribe, but we also recognized, based on an analysis of the specific terms of the Treaty, that the 1864 Treaty restricted those rights to the lands within the reservation.  <citedDecision>Id., at 766-767</citedDecision> .  Because the rights were characterized as "exclusive," this "foreclose[d] the possibility that they were intended to have existence outside of the reservation." <citedDecision>Id., at 767</citedDecision> .  In other words, "because the right to hunt and fish reserved in the 1864 Treaty was an exclusive right to be exercised within the reservation, that right could not consistently survive off the reservation" on the lands the Tribe had sold.  <citedDecision>Id., at 769-770</citedDecision> .  This understanding of the Tribe's usufructuary rights under the 1864 Treatythat those rights were exclusive, on-reservation rightsinformed our conclusion that the Klamath Tribe did not retain any usufructuary rights on the land that it ceded in the 1901 agreement, land that was not part of the reservation.  In addition, we noted that there was nothing in the historical record of the 1901 agreement that suggested that the parties intended to change the background understanding of the scope of the usufructuary rights.  <citedDecision>Id., at 772-773</citedDecision> .  Klamath does not control this case. First, the Chippewa's usufructuary rights under the 1837 Treaty existed independently of land ownership; they were neither tied to a *202 reservation nor exclusive.  In contrast to Klamath, there is no background understanding of the rights to suggest that they are extinguished when title to the land is extinguished.  Without this background understanding, there is no reason to believe that the Chippewa would have understood a cession of a particular tract of land to relinquish hunting and fishing privileges on another tract of land.  More importantly, however, the State's argument that similar language in two Treaties involving different parties has precisely the same meaning reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of basic principles of treaty construction.  Our holding in Klamath was not based solely on the bare language of the 1901 agreement.  Rather, to reach our conclusion about the meaning of that language, we examined the historical record and considered the context of the treaty negotiations to discern what the parties intended by their choice of words.

 U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  See, e. g., Missouri v. Holland, 252 U. S. 416 (1920); Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U. S. 529 (1976); United States v. Winans, 198 U. S., at 382-384 ; United States v. Forty-three Gallons of Whiskey, 93 U. S. 188 (1876).  See also Menominee Tribe v. United States, supra, at 411, n. 12.  Here, the 1837 Treaty gave the Chippewa the right to hunt, fish, and gather in the ceded territory free of territorial, and later state, regulation, a privilege that others did not enjoy.  Today, this freedom from state regulation curtails the State's ability to regulate hunting, fishing, and gathering by the Chippewa in the ceded lands.  But this Court's cases have also recognized that Indian treaty-based usufructuary rights do not guarantee the Indians "absolute freedom" from state regulation.  <citedDecision>Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife</citedDecision> v. Klamath *205 Tribe, <citedDecision>473 U. S., at 765, n. 16</citedDecision> .  We have repeatedly reaffirmed state authority to impose reasonable and necessary nondiscriminatory regulations on Indian hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in the interest of conservation.  See Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 391 U. S. 392, 398 (1968); Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S., at 682 ; Antoine v. Washington, supra, at 207-208.  This "conservation necessity" standard accommodates both the State's interest in management of its natural resources and the Chippewa's federally guaranteed treaty rights.  Thus, because treaty rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land within state boundaries.  [7] We do not understand Justice Thomas to disagree with this fundamental conclusion.  Race Horse rested on the premise that treaty rights are irreconcilable with state sovereignty.

 In Ward v. Race Horse, 163 U. S. 504 (1896), we held that a Treaty granting the Indians "the right to hunt on the unoccupied lands of the United States, so long as game may be found thereon, and so long as peace subsists among the whites and the Indians on the borders of the hunting districts," did not survive the admission of Wyoming to the Union since the treaty right was "temporary and precarious." Id., at 515 .  But the Court, in a feat of jurisprudential legerdemain, effectively overrules Race Horse sub silentio.  First, the Court notes that Congress may only abrogate Indian treaty rights if it clearly expresses its intent to do so. Next, it asserts that Indian hunting rights are not irreconcilable with state sovereignty, and determines that "because treaty rights are reconcilable with state sovereignty over natural resources, statehood by itself is insufficient to extinguish Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather on land within state boundaries." Ante, at 205.  And finally, the Court hints that Race Horse rested on an incorrect premisethat Indian rights were inconsistent with state sovereignty.  Without saying so, this jurisprudential bait-and-switch effectively overrules Race Horse , a case which we reaffirmed as recently as 1985 in Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1985).  Race Horse held merely that treaty rights which were only "temporary and precarious," as opposed to those which were "of such a nature as to imply their perpetuity," do not survive statehood.  [3] 163 U. S., *220 at 515.  Here, the hunting privileges were clearly, like those invalidated in Race Horse , temporary and precarious: The privilege was only guaranteed "during the pleasure of the President"; the legally enforceable annuity payments themselves were to terminate after 20 years; and the Indians were on actual notice that the President might end the rights in the future, App. 78 (1837 Journal of Treaty Negotiations).  Perhaps the strongest indication of the temporary nature of the treaty rights is presented unwittingly by the Court in its repeated (and correct) characterizations of the rights as "usufructuary." As noted supra, at 218, usufructuary rights are by definition "of limited duration." Black's Law Dictionary, supra, at 1544.

 Indeed, the Court retreats from its assertion that the 1837 Treaty gave the Chippewa an unlimited right to hunt, fish, and gather free from regulation when it states: "We have repeatedly reaffirmed state authority to impose reasonable and necessary nondiscriminatory regulations on Indian hunting, fishing, and gathering rights in the interest of conservation." Ante, at 205.  If the 1837 Treaty gives the Chippewa a right to be free from state regulation, why may Minnesota impose any regulations, reasonable and necessary or otherwise?  The Court's answer to that question is that our prior decisions have established that Indians never have "`absolute freedom,' " ante, at 204, from state regulation, no matter what a treaty might say; rather, Indians' hunting, fishing, and gathering activities are limited by those state regulations which are necessary for ensuring the conservation of natural resources.  To be sure, Indians do not have absolute freedom from state regulation of their off-reservation activities.  Indeed, the general rule is that the off-reservation activities of Indians are subject to a State's nondiscriminatory laws, absent express federal law to the contrary.  See, e. g., Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 753, 765, n. 16</citedDecision> (1985); New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe, 462 U. S. 324, 335, n. 18 (1983).  The majority, however, overlooks the fact that the scope of a State's regulatory authority depends upon the language of the treaty in question.  At a minimum, States may issue and enforce those regulations of Indians' off-reservation usufructuary activities that are necessary in the interest of conservation.  Our decisions suggest that state regulatory authority is so limited when, with *223 the treaty in question, the Indians reserved a right to fish, hunt, or gather on ceded lands.  But it is doubtful that the so-called "conservation necessity" standard applies in cases, such as this one, where Indians reserved no more than a privilege to hunt, fish, and gather.  The conservation necessity standard appears to have its origin in Tulee v. Washington, 315 U. S. 681 (1942).  In the 1859 Treaty with the Yakima Indians, the Yakima reserved "`the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory.'

 Post, at 215-216.  Presumably, The Chief Justice understands the 1837 Treaty to authorize the executive action in question.  In this context, however, any general presumption about the legality of executive action runs into the principle that treaty ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the Indians.  Winters v. United States, supra, at 576 577; see also County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992).  We do not think the general presumption relied upon by The Chief Justice carries the same weight when balanced against the counter presumption specific to Indian treaties.  [6]  See also, e. g., 1846 Treaty with the Winnebago, Art. IV, 9 Stat. 878 (Government agrees to pay Winnebago Indians $40,000 "for release of hunting privileges, on the lands adjacent to their present home"); 1837 Treaty with the Sacs and Foxes, Art. 2, 7 Stat. 543 (specifically ceding "all the right to locate, for hunting or other purposes, on the land ceded in the first article of the treaty of July 15th 1830").  [7]  The Chief Justice asserts that our criticism of Race Horse is inappropriate given our recent "reaffirm[ation]" of that case in Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe, <citedDecision>473 U. S. 753</citedDecision> (1985).  Post, at 219.  Although we cited Race Horse in Klamath, we did not in so doing reaffirm the equal footing doctrine as a bar to the continuation of Indian treatybased usufructuary rights.  Klamath did not involve the equal footing doctrine.  Rather, we cited Race Horse for the second part of its holding, discussed in the text, infra, at 206-208.  See <citedDecision>473 U. S., at 773, n. 23</citedDecision> .  In any event, the Race Horse Court's reliance on the equal footing doctrine to terminate Indian treaty rights rested on foundations that were rejected by this Court within nine years of that decision.  See United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371, 382-384 (1905).  [1]  The Court's assumption that "any general presumption about the legality of executive action runs into the principle that treaty ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the Indians," ante, at 194, n.5, illogically confuses the difference between executive authority and a principle of treaty construction.  The principle of Winters v. United States, 207 U. S. 564, 567-577 (1908), and County of Yakima v. Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation, 502 U. S. 251, 269 (1992), that ambiguities in treaties are to be resolved in favor of the Indians, is only relevant to determining the intent of the parties to a treaty (that is the United States and the Indian tribe), and stems from the idea that in determining the intent of the parties, Indian tribes should be given the benefit of the doubt as against the United States in cases of ambiguous treaty provisions because the United States was presumptively a more sophisticated bargainer.  See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 675-676 (1979).  But the determination of whether the President has power to enforce his revocation by removal is irrelevant to the intent of the parties to the treaty (the United States and the Chippewa in this case) and presents instead an issue of separation of powers (between the President and the Congress).
