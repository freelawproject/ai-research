**Combined Opinion**
 .  the case is one for the consideration of the Court of Appeals .  .  .  Price v. State, 224 Ga. 306, 307 , 161 S. E. 2d 825, 826 (1968).  The Georgia Court of Appeals then heard the appeal and affirmed the second conviction, rejecting petitioner’s argument, among others, that his retrial for murder constituted double jeopardy.  Price v. State, <citedDecision>118 Ga. App. 207</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>163 S. E. 2d 243</citedDecision> (1968).  The Court of Appeals held that in Brantley v. State, 132 Ga. 573 , 64 S. E. 676 (1909), aff’d, 217 U.. S. 284 (1910), the Georgia Supreme Court had decided this question adversely to petitioner.  The Court of Appeals then quoted from the Brantley case’s syllabus: “When a person has been indicted for murder and convicted of voluntary manslaughter, if he voluntarily seeks and obtains a new trial, he is subject to another trial generally for the offense charged in the indictment, and upon such trial he cannot successfully interpose a plea of former acquittal of the crime of murder, or former jeopardy in regard thereto.” <citedDecision>118 Ga. App., at 208</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>163 S. E. 2d, at 244</citedDecision> .  Petitioner sought a rehearing, contending, as he contends here, that Brantley was no longer controlling.  He relied on Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184 (1957), and *326 United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F., 2d 844 (C. A. 2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U. S. 913 (1966).  His contention was rejected.  In deciding that Brantley was still a binding precedent as to it, the Georgia Court of Appeals noted that the Georgia Supreme Court had transferred the case to it as involving the application of only “plain and unambiguous” constitutional provisions.  The petitioner’s motion was then denied.  Thereafter the Georgia Supreme Court denied certiorari, and petitioner sought review in this Court. We granted the writ, 395 U. S. 975 (1969), and now reverse.
