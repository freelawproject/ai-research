 It is important to keep the subject off balance, for example, by trading on his insecurity about himself or his surroundings.  The police then persuade, trick, or cajole him out of exercising his constitutional rights.  Even without employing brutality, the "third degree" or the specific stratagems described above, the very fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on individual liberty and trades on the weakness of individuals.  [24] *456 This fact may be illustrated simply by referring to three confession cases decided by this Court in the Term immediately preceding our Escobedo decision.  In Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963), the defendant was a 19-year-old heroin addict, described as a "near mental defective," id., at 307-310 .  The defendant in Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 (1963), was a woman who confessed to the arresting officer after being importuned to "cooperate" in order to prevent her children from being taken by relief authorities.  This Court as in those cases reversed the conviction of a defendant in Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503</citedDecision> (1963), whose persistent request during his interrogation was to phone his wife or attorney.  [25] In other settings, these individuals might have exercised their constitutional rights.  In the incommunicado police-dominated atmosphere, they succumbed.  In the cases before us today, given this background, we concern ourselves primarily with this interrogation atmosphere and the evils it can bring.  In No. 759, Miranda v. Arizona, the police arrested the defendant and took him to a special interrogation room where they secured a confession.  In No. 760, Vignera v. New York, the defendant made oral admissions to the police after interrogation in the afternoon, and then signed an inculpatory statement upon being questioned by an assistant district attorney later the same evening.  In No. 761, Westover v. United States , the defendant was handed over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation by *457 local authorities after they had detained and interrogated him for a lengthy period, both at night and the following morning.
**Combined Opinion**
 The abdication of the constitutional privilege the choice on his part to speak to the policewas not made knowingly or competently because of the failure to apprise him of his rights; the compelling atmosphere of the in-custody interrogation, and not an independent decision on his part, caused the defendant to speak.  A different phase of the Escobedo decision was significant in its attention to the absence of counsel during the questioning.  There, as in the cases today, we sought a protective device to dispel the compelling atmosphere of the interrogation.  In Escobedo , however, the police did not relieve the defendant of the anxieties which they had created in the interrogation rooms.  Rather, they denied his request for the assistance of counsel, 378 U. S., at 481, 488, 491.  [35] This heightened his dilemma, and *466 made his later statements the product of this compulsion.  Cf. Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503, 514</citedDecision> (1963).  The denial of the defendant's request for his attorney thus undermined his ability to exercise the privilege to remain silent if he chose or to speak without any intimidation, blatant or subtle.  The presence of counsel, in all the cases before us today, would be the adequate protective device necessary to make the process of police interrogation conform to the dictates of the privilege.  His presence would insure that statements made in the government-established atmosphere are not the product of compulsion.  It was in this manner that Escobedo explicated another facet of the pre-trial privilege, noted in many of the Court's prior decisions: the protection of rights at trial. [36] That counsel is present when statements are taken from an individual during interrogation obviously enhances the integrity of the fact-finding processes in court. The presence of an attorney, and the warnings delivered to the individual, enable the defendant under otherwise compelling circumstances to tell his story without fear, effectively, and in a way that eliminates the evils in the interrogation process.  Without the protections flowing from adequate warnings and the rights of counsel, "all the careful safeguards erected around the giving of testimony, whether by an accused or any other witness, would become empty formalities in a procedure where the most compelling possible evidence of guilt, a confession, would have already been obtained at the unsupervised pleasure of the police." Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 685 (1961) (HARLAN, J., dissenting).
**Combined Opinion**
 We also fully recognize the obligation of all citizens to aid in enforcing the criminal laws.  This Court, while protecting individual rights, has always given ample latitude to law enforcement agencies in the legitimate exercise of their duties.  The limits we have placed on the interrogation process should not constitute an undue interference with a proper system of law enforcement.  As we have noted, our decision does not in any way preclude police from carrying out their traditional investigatory functions.  Although confessions may play an important role in some convictions, the cases before us present graphic examples of the overstatement of the "need" for confessions.  In each case authorities conducted interrogations ranging up to five days in duration despite the presence, through standard investigating practices, of considerable evidence against each defendant.  [51] Further examples are chronicled in our prior cases. See, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503, 518-519</citedDecision> (1963); Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 541 (1961); Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401, 402 (1945).  [52] *482 It is also urged that an unfettered right to detention for interrogation should be allowed because it will often redound to the benefit of the person questioned.  When police inquiry determines that there is no reason to believe that the person has committed any crime, it is said, he will be released without need for further formal procedures.  The person who has committed no offense, however, will be better able to clear himself after warnings with counsel present than without.  It can be assumed that in such circumstances a lawyer would advise his client to talk freely to police in order to clear himself.  Custodial interrogation, by contrast, does not necessarily afford the innocent an opportunity to clear themselves.  A serious consequence of the present practice of the interrogation alleged to be beneficial for the innocent is that many arrests "for investigation" subject large numbers of innocent persons to detention and interrogation.

 98 Ariz. 18 , 401 P. 2d 721 .  In reaching its decision, the court emphasized heavily the fact that Miranda did not specifically request counsel.  We reverse.  From the testimony of the officers and by the admission of respondent, it is clear that Miranda was not in any way apprised of his right to consult with an attorney and to have one present during the interrogation, nor was his right not to be compelled to incriminate himself effectively protected in any other manner.  Without these warnings the statements were inadmissible.  The mere fact that he signed a statement which contained a typed-in clause stating that he had "full knowledge" of his "legal rights" does not approach the knowing and intelligent waiver required to relinquish constitutional rights.  Cf. <citedDecision>Haynes</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Washington</citedDecision> , 373 U. S. *493 503, 512-513 (1963); Haley v. Ohio, 332 U. S. 596, 601 (1948) (opinion of MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS).  No. 760.  Vignera v. New York .  Petitioner, Michael Vignera, was picked up by New York police on October 14, 1960, in connection with the robbery three days earlier of a Brooklyn dress shop.  They took him to the 17th Detective Squad headquarters in Manhattan.  Sometime thereafter he was taken to the 66th Detective Squad.  There a detective questioned Vignera with respect to the robbery.
**Combined Opinion**
 When at any point during an interrogation the accused seeks affirmatively or impliedly to invoke his rights to silence or counsel, interrogation must be forgone or postponed.  The Court further holds that failure to follow the new procedures requires inexorably the exclusion of any statement by the accused, as well as the fruits thereof.  Such a strict constitutional specific inserted at the nerve center of crime detection may well kill the patient.  [3] *501 Since there is at this time a paucity of information and an almost total lack of empirical knowledge on the practical operation of requirements truly comparable to those announced by the majority, I would be more restrained lest we go too far too fast.  II.  Custodial interrogation has long been recognized as "undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement." Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503, 515</citedDecision> (1963).  Recognition of this fact should put us on guard against the promulgation of doctrinaire rules.  Especially is this true where the Court finds that "the Constitution has prescribed" its holding and where the light of our past cases, from Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574 , (1884), down to <citedDecision>Haynes</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Washington, supra</citedDecision> , is to *502 the contrary.  Indeed, even in Escobedo the Court never hinted that an affirmative "waiver" was a prerequisite to questioning; that the burden of proof as to waiver was on the prosecution; that the presence of counsel absent a waiverduring interrogation was required; that a waiver can be withdrawn at the will of the accused; that counsel must be furnished during an accusatory stage to those unable to pay; nor that admissions and exculpatory statements are "confessions." To require all those things at one gulp should cause the Court to choke over more cases than Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 (1958), and Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 (1958), which it expressly overrules today.  The rule prior to todayas Mr. Justice Goldberg, the author of the Court's opinion in Escobedo, stated it in <citedDecision>Haynes</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Washington</citedDecision> depended upon "a totality of circumstances evidencing an involuntary .  .  .  admission of guilt." <citedDecision>373 U. S., at 514</citedDecision> .  And he concluded: "Of course, detection and solution of crime is, at best, a difficult and arduous task requiring determination and persistence on the part of all responsible officers charged with the duty of law enforcement.  And, certainly, we do not mean to suggest that all interrogation of witnesses and suspects is impermissible.  Such questioning is undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement.  The line between proper and permissible police conduct and techniques and methods offensive to due process is, at best, a difficult one to draw, particularly in cases such as this where it is necessary to make fine judgments as to the effect of psychologically coercive pressures and inducements on the mind and will of an accused.  .  .  .  We are here impelled to the conclusion, from all of the facts presented, that the bounds of due process have been exceeded." <citedDecision>Id., at 514-515</citedDecision> .  *503 III. I would continue to follow that rule.  Under the "totality of circumstances" rule of which my Brother Goldberg spoke in <citedDecision>Haynes</citedDecision> , I would consider in each case whether the police officer prior to custodial interrogation added the warning that the suspect might have counsel present at the interrogation and, further, that a court would appoint one at his request if he was too poor to employ counsel.  In the absence of warnings, the burden would be on the State to prove that counsel was knowingly and intelligently waived or that in the totality of the circumstances, including the failure to give the necessary warnings, the confession was clearly voluntary.  Rather than employing the arbitrary Fifth Amendment rule [4] which the Court lays down I would follow the more pliable dictates of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments which we are accustomed to administering and which we know from our cases are effective instruments in protecting persons in police custody.  In this way we would not be acting in the dark nor in one full sweep changing the traditional rules of custodial interrogation which this Court has for so long recognized as a justifiable and proper tool in balancing individual rights against the rights of society.  It will be soon enough to go further when we are able to appraise with somewhat better accuracy the effect of such a holding.  I would affirm the convictions in Miranda v. Arizona, No. 759; Vignera v. New York , No. 760; and Westover v. United States , No. 761.  In each of those cases I find from the circumstances no warrant for reversal.
**Combined Opinion**
 The earliest confession cases in this Court emerged from federal prosecutions and were settled on a nonconstitutional basis, the Court adopting the common-law rule that the absence of inducements, promises, and threats made a confession voluntary and admissible.  Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574 ; Pierce v. United States, 160 U. S. 355 .  While a later case said the Fifth Amendment privilege controlled admissibility, this proposition was not itself developed in subsequent decisions.  [2] The Court did, however, heighten the test of admissibility in federal trials to one of voluntariness "in fact," Wan v. *507 United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14 (quoted, ante, p. 462), and then by and large left federal judges to apply the same standards the Court began to derive in a string of state court cases. This new line of decisions, testing admissibility by the Due Process Clause, began in 1936 with Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 , and must now embrace somewhat more than 30 full opinions of the Court. [3] While the voluntariness rubric was repeated in many instances, e. g., Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U. S. 596 , the Court never pinned it down to a single meaning but on the contrary infused it with a number of different values.  To travel quickly over the main themes, there was an initial emphasis on reliability, e. g., Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S. 547 , supplemented by concern over the legality and fairness of the police practices, e. g., Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 , in an "accusatorial" system of law enforcement, Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 54 , and eventually by close attention to the individual's state of mind and capacity for effective choice, e. g., Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49 .  The outcome was a continuing re-evaluation on the facts of each case of how much pressure on the suspect was permissible.  [4] *508 Among the criteria often taken into account were threats or imminent danger, e. g., Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560 , physical deprivations such as lack of sleep or food, e. g., Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433 , repeated or extended interrogation, e. g., Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227 , limits on access to counsel or friends, Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 ; Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , length and illegality of detention under state law, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503</citedDecision> , and individual weakness or incapacities, Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 .  Apart from direct physical coercion, however, no single default or fixed combination of defaults guaranteed exclusion, and synopses of the cases would serve little use because the overall gauge has been steadily changing, usually in the direction of restricting admissibility.  But to mark just what point had been reached before the Court jumped the rails in Escobedo v. Illinois, 378 U. S. 478 , it is worth capsulizing the then-recent case of Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503</citedDecision> .  There, Haynes had been held some 16 or more hours in violation of state law before signing the disputed confession, had received no warnings of any kind, and despite requests had been refused access to his wife or to counsel, the police indicating that access would be allowed after a confession.  Emphasizing especially this last inducement and rejecting some contrary indicia of voluntariness, the Court in a 5-to-4 decision held the confession inadmissible.  There are several relevant lessons to be drawn from this constitutional history.  The first is that with over 25 years of precedent the Court has developed an elaborate, sophisticated, and sensitive approach to admissibility of confessions.  It is "judicial" in its treatment of one case at a time, see Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 635 (concurring opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE), flexible in its ability to respond to the endless mutations of fact presented, and ever more familiar to the lower courts.  *509 Of course, strict certainty is not obtained in this developing process, but this is often so with constitutional principles, and disagreement is usually confined to that borderland of close cases where it matters least.  The second point is that in practice and from time to time in principle, the Court has given ample recognition to society's interest in suspect questioning as an instrument of law enforcement.  Cases countenancing quite significant pressures can be cited without difficulty, [5] and the lower courts may often have been yet more tolerant.  Of course the limitations imposed today were rejected by necessary implication in case after case, the right to warnings having been explicitly rebuffed in this Court many years ago.  Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303 ; Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613 .  As recently as Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503, 515</citedDecision> , the Court openly acknowledged that questioning of witnesses and suspects "is undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement." Accord, Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 441 .  Finally, the cases disclose that the language in many of the opinions overstates the actual course of decision.  It has been said, for example, that an admissible confession must be made by the suspect "in the unfettered exercise of his own will," Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 8 , and that "a prisoner is not `to be made the deluded instrument of his own conviction,' " Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 581 (Frankfurter, J., announcing the Court's judgment and an opinion).  Though often repeated, such principles are rarely observed in full measure.  Even the word "voluntary" may be deemed somewhat *510 misleading, especially when one considers many of the confessions that have been brought under its umbrella.  See, e. g., supra, n. 5.
**Combined Opinion**
or "Did you kill your wife?" his response, if there is one, has somehow been compelled, even if the accused has *534 been clearly warned of his right to remain silent.  Common sense informs us to the contrary.  While one may say that the response was "involuntary" in the sense the question provoked or was the occasion for the response and thus the defendant was induced to speak out when he might have remained silent if not arrested and not questioned, it is patently unsound to say the response is compelled.  Today's result would not follow even if it were agreed that to some extent custodial interrogation is inherently coercive.  See Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143, 161 (Jackson, J., dissenting).  The test has been whether the totality of circumstances deprived the defendant of a "free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer," Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 241 , and whether physical or psychological coercion was of such a degree that "the defendant's will was overborne at the time he confessed," Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503, 513</citedDecision> ; Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528, 534 .  The duration and nature of incommunicado custody, the presence or absence of advice concerning the defendant's constitutional rights, and the granting or refusal of requests to communicate with lawyers, relatives or friends have all been rightly regarded as important data bearing on the basic inquiry.  See, e. g., Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 ; Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503</citedDecision> .  [3] *535 But it has never been suggested, until today, that such questioning was so coercive and accused persons so lacking in hardihood that the very first response to the very first question following the commencement of custody must be conclusively presumed to be the product of an overborne will. If the rule announced today were truly based on a conclusion that all confessions resulting from custodial interrogation are coerced, then it would simply have no rational foundation.  Compare Tot v. United States, 319 U. S. 463, 466 ; United States v. Romano, 382 U. S. 136 .  A fortiori that would be true of the extension of the rule to exculpatory statements, which the Court effects after a brief discussion of why, in the Court's view, they must be deemed incriminatory but without any discussion of why they must be deemed coerced.  See Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 624 .  Even if one were to postulate that the Court's concern is not that all confessions induced by police interrogation are coerced but rather that some such confessions are coerced and present judicial procedures are believed to be inadequate to identify the confessions that are coerced and those that are not, it would still not be essential to impose the rule that the Court has now fashioned.  Transcripts or observers could be required, specific time limits, tailored to fit the cause, could be imposed, or other devices could be utilized to reduce the chances that otherwise indiscernible coercion will produce an inadmissible confession.

 When federal officials arrest an individual, they must as always comply with the dictates of the congressional legislation and cases thereunder.  See generally, Hogan & Snee, The McNabb-Mallory Rule: Its Rise, Rationale and Rescue, 47 Geo. L. J. 1 (1958).  [33]  The decisions of this Court have guaranteed the same procedural protection for the defendant whether his confession was used in a federal or state court. It is now axiomatic that the defendant's constitutional rights have been violated if his conviction is based, in whole or in part, on an involuntary confession, regardless of its truth or falsity.  Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 544 (1961); Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1 (1924).  This is so even if there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction, e. g., Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401, 404 (1945); Bram v. United States, 168 U. S. 532, 540-542 (1897).  Both state and federal courts now adhere to trial procedures which seek to assure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession offered at trial, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964); United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 38 (1951); see also Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 624 (1896).  Appellate review is exacting, see Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503</citedDecision> (1963); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199 (1960).  Whether his conviction was in a federal or state court, the defendant may secure a post-conviction hearing based on the alleged involuntary character of his confession, provided he meets the procedural requirements, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963).  In addition, see Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U. S. 52 (1964).  [34]  See Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 241 (1941); Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 (1944); Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401 (1945); Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315 (1959); Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 (1963); Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503</citedDecision> (1963).  [35]  The police also prevented the attorney from consulting with his client.  Independent of any other constitutional proscription, this action constitutes a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel and excludes any statement obtained in its wake.  See People v. Donovan, 13 N. Y. 2d 148, 193 N. E. 2d 628 , 243 N. Y. S. 2d 841 (1963) (Fuld, J.).  [36] In re Groban, 352 U. S. 330, 340-352 (1957) (BLACK, J., dissenting); Note, 73 Yale L. J. 1000, 1048-1051 (1964); Comment, 31 U. Chi. L. Rev. 313 , 320 (1964) and authorities cited.  [37]  See p. 454, supra. Lord Devlin has commented: "It is probable that even today, when there is much less ignorance about these matters than formerly, there is still a general belief that you must answer all questions put to you by a policeman, or at least that it will be the worse for you if you do not."

Marked bills from the bank robbed were found in Westover's car. Articles stolen from the victim as well as from several other robbery victims were found in Stewart's home at the outset of the investigation.  [52]  Dealing as we do here with constitutional standards in relation to statements made, the existence of independent corroborating evidence produced at trial is, of course, irrelevant to our decisions.  Haynes v. Washington, <citedDecision>373 U. S. 503, 518-519</citedDecision> (1963); Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528, 537-538 (1963); Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 541 (1961); Blackburn v.

[53]  See, e. g., Report and Recommendations of the [District of Columbia] Commissioners' Committee on Police Arrests for Investigation (1962); American Civil Liberties Union, Secret Detention by the Chicago Police (1959).  An extreme example of this practice occurred in the District of Columbia in 1958.  Seeking three "stocky" young Negroes who had robbed a restaurant, police rounded up 90 persons of that general description.  Sixty-three were held overnight before being released for lack of evidence.  A man not among the 90 arrested was ultimately charged with the crime.
