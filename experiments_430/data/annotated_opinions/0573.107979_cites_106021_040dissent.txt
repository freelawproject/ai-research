 Accord, that year, McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 (1948) (gambling game seen through transom before entry).  Less than two years later, however, the Court returned to the Harris rule in United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56 (1950), where the Court held that the reasonableness of a search does not depend upon the practicability of obtaining a search warrant, and that the fact of a valid arrest is relevant to reasonableness.  Trupiano was pro tanto overruled.  Such rapid reversals have occurred before, 1 but they are rare.  Here there had been two about-faces, one following hard upon the other.  Justice Frankfurter objected in this language: “Especially ought the Court not reenforce needlessly the instabilities of our day by giving fair ground for the belief that Law is the expression of *772 chance — for instance, of unexpected changes in the Court’s composition and the contingencies in the choice of successors.” 339 U. S., at 86 .  Since that time, the rule of Weeks, Marron, Harris, and Rabinowitz has clearly been the law. E. g., Abel v. United States, <citedDecision>362 U. S. 217</citedDecision> (1960) (Frankfurter, J., writing for the Court) ; Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963).  2 II.  The rule which has prevailed, but for very brief or doubtful periods of aberration, is that a search incident to an arrest may extend to those areas under the control of the defendant and where items subject to constitutional seizure may be found. The justification for this rule must, under the language of the Fourth Amendment, lie in the reasonableness of the rule.  Terry v. Ohio, 392 U. S. 1, 9 (1968); Sibron v. New York, 392 U. S. 40 (1968); Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 222 (1960).  The Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” In terms, then, the Court must decide whether a given search is reasonable.  The Amendment does not proscribe “warrantless searches” but instead it proscribes “unrea *773 sonable searches” and this Court has never held nor does the majority today assert that warrantless searches are necessarily unreasonable.  Applying this reasonableness test to the area of searches incident to arrests, one thing is clear at the outset.

 Moreover, the statute under which the FBI exercises that power was later said by this Court to state the constitutional standard, Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98, 100 (1959), since it requires “reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing” a felony, 18 U. S. C. § 3052 , before a warrantless arrest may be made.  And the Court today has declined to review a warrantless arrest under the narcotics agent statute.  Jamison v. United States, post, p. 986.  See also my dissent in Shipley v. California, post, p. 821.  The judgment of Congress is that federal law enforcement officers may reasonably make warrantless arrests upon probable cause, and no judicial experience suggests that this judgment is infirm.  Indeed, past cases suggest precisely the contrary conclusion.  The validity of federal arrests was long governed by state law, United States v. Di Re, 332 U. S. 581, 589-592 (1948), and no requirement that warrants be sought whenever there is time to do so was imposed either by common-law history 14 or by decisions of this Court. This Court has upheld an execu *779 tive arrest warrant for deportation, permitting the arrest to occur without prior judicial scrutiny, Abel v. United States, <citedDecision>362 U. S. 217</citedDecision> (1960).  And this Court has regularly affirmed the validity of warrantless arrests without any indication whatever that there was no time to get a warrant, and indeed where all the circumstances pointed to the opposite conclusion.  E. g., Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23 (1963); Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307 (1959).  The lower federal courts have certainly been of the view that warrants are unnecessary even where there is time to obtain them.  Dailey v. United States, 261 F. 2d 870 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1958), cert. denied, 359 U. S. 969 (1959) (statutory warrantless arrest by federal narcotics agents); Smith v. United States, 103 U. S. App. D. C. 48, 52, 254 F. 2d 751, 755 , cert. denied, 357 U. S. 937 (1958); Mills v. United States, 90 U. S. App. D. C. 365, 196 F. 2d 600 , cert. denied, 344 U. S. 826 (1952) (sub silentio).  In light of the uniformity of judgment of the Congress, past judicial decisions, and common practice rejecting the proposition that arrest warrants are essential wherever it is practicable to get them, the conclusion is inevitable that such arrests and accompanying searches are reasonable, at least until experience teaches the contrary.  It must very often be the case that by the time probable cause to arrest a man is accumulated, the man is aware of police interest in him or for other good reasons is on the verge of flight.

 Nor does the majority *782 today give any added protection to the right of privacy of those whose houses there is probable cause to search.  A warrant would still be sworn out for those houses, and the privacy of their owners invaded.  The only possible justification for the majority’s rule is that in some instances arresting officers may search when they have no probable cause to do so and that such unlawful searches might be prevented if the officers first sought a warrant from a magistrate.  Against the possible protection of privacy in that class of cases, in which the privacy of the house has already been invaded by entry to make the arrest — an entry for which the majority does not assert that any warrant is necessary — must be weighed the risk of destruction of evidence for which there is probable cause to search, as a result of delays in obtaining a search warrant.  Without more basis for radical change than the Court’s opinion reveals, I would not upset the balance of these interests which has been struck by the former decisions of this Court. In considering searches incident to arrest, it must be remembered that there will be immediate opportunity to challenge the probable cause for the search in an adversary proceeding.  The suspect has been apprised of the search by his very presence at the scene, and having been arrested, he will soon be brought into contact with people who can explain his rights.  As Mr. Justice Brennan noted in a dissenting opinion, joined by The Chief Justice and Justices Black and Douglas, in Abel v. United States, <citedDecision>362 U. S. 217, 249-250</citedDecision> (1960), a search contemporaneous with a warrantless arrest is specially safeguarded since “[s]uch an arrest may constitutionally be made only upon probable cause, the existence of which is subject to judicial examination, see Henry v. United States, 361 U. S. 98, 100 ; and such an arrest demands the prompt bringing of the person arrested before a judicial officer, where the existence of *783 probable cause is to be inquired into.  Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 5 (a) and (c).  .  .  .  Mallory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449 ; McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 .” And since that time the Court has imposed on state and federal officers alike the duty to warn suspects taken into custody, before questioning them, of their right to a lawyer.  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436 (1966); Orozco v. Texas, 394 U. S. 324 (1969).  An arrested man, by definition conscious of the police interest in him, and provided almost immediately with a lawyer and a judge, is in an excellent position to dispute the reasonableness of his arrest and contemporaneous search in a full adversary proceeding.  I would uphold the constitutionality of this search contemporaneous with an arrest since there were probable cause both for the search and for the arrest, exigent circumstances involving the removal or destruction of evidence, and satisfactory opportunity to dispute the issues of probable cause shortly thereafter.  In this case, the search was reasonable.  Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105 (1943), overruled Jones v. Opelika, 316 U. S. 584 (1942); Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457 (1871), overruled Hepburn v. Griswold, 8 Wall. 603 (1870).  The majority cites Kremen v. United States, 353 U. S. 346 (1957), as suggesting an inconsistency.  There, however, in a per curiam opinion the Court merely overturned a general search in which the entire contents of a cabin, which it took 11 pages of fine print for the Court to inventory, were seized.  See Abel v. United States, <citedDecision>362 U. S. 217, 239</citedDecision> (1960) (Kremen distinguished as a “mass seizure").  Even Mr. Justice Frankfurter, joined in dissent in Rabinowitz by Mr. Justice Jackson, admitted that there was an exception to the search-warrant requirement in cases of necessity, and noted that this applied, for example, to vehicles which could readily be moved.  339 U. S. 56, at 73 .  Before the burglary of the coin store, petitioner had told its owner that he was planning a big robbery, had inquired about the alarm system in the store, the state of the owner’s insurance, and the location of the owner’s most valuable coins.  Petitioner wandered about the store the day before the burglary.  After the burglary, petitioner called the store’s owner and accused him of robbing the store himself for the insurance proceeds on a policy which, as *775 petitioner knew, had just been reduced from $50,000 to $10,000 coverage.  On being told that the robbery had been sloppy, petitioner excitedly claimed that it had been “real professional” but then denied the robbery.
