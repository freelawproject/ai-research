 Petitioner’s answer to the trustee’s complaint falsely denied the trustee’s allegations that a well-drilling machine and parts for the machine were stored at petition *698 er’s home and in a nearby warehouse.  Petitioner’s response to the trustee’s discovery motion incorrectly stated that petitioner had already turned over all of the requested records.  When the misrepresentations came to light, petitioner was charged with three counts of making false statements under 18 U. S. C. § 1001 .  1 That statute provides: “Whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States knowingly and willfully falsifies, conceals or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact, or makes any false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representations, or makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry, shall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.” Relying on our decision in United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503 (1955), the District Court instructed the jury that a bankruptcy court is a “department ... of the United States” within the meaning of §1001.  The jury convicted petitioner on all three § 1001 counts, and the District Court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 24 months’ imprisonment.  On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, petitioner argued that his convictions under §1001 were barred by the so-called “judicial function” exception.  First suggested over 30 years ago in Morgan v. United States, <citedDecision>309 F. 2d 234</citedDecision> (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), this doctrine limits the extent to which § 1001 reaches conduct occurring in the federal courts.  Under the exception, only those misrepresentations falling within a court’s “administrative” or “housekeeping” functions can give rise to liability *699 under § 1001; false statements made while a court is performing its adjudicative functions are not covered.  The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner’s convictions under § 1001.  Although the judicial function exception has become entrenched over the years in a number of Circuits, the Sixth Circuit concluded, over a dissent, that the exception does not exist.  16 F. 3d 694 (1994).  That conclusion created a split in the Circuits, prompting us to grant certiorari.  2 513 U. S. 959 (1994).

 Courts should not rely on inconclusive statutory history as a basis for refusing to give effect to the plain language of an Act of Congress, particularly when the Legislature has specifically defined the controverted term. In Bmmblett, the Court’s method of analysis resulted in a decision that is at war with the text of not one, but two different Acts of Congress.  Whether the doctrine of stare decisis nevertheless requires that we accept Bmmblett’s erroneous interpretation of §1001 is a question best answered after reviewing the body of law directly at issue: the decisions adopting the judicial function exception.  IV Although other federal courts have refrained from directly criticizing Bmmblett’s approach to statutory construction, it is fair to say that they have greeted the decision with something less than a warm embrace.  The judicial function exception, an obvious attempt to impose limits on Brambletfs expansive reading of § 1001, is a prime example.  As the following discussion indicates, the judicial function exception is almost as deeply rooted as Bmmblett itself.  The seeds of the exception were planted by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit only seven years after Bramblett was decided.  In Morgan v. United States, <citedDecision>309 F. 2d 234</citedDecision> (1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), the defendant, who had falsely held himself out to be a bona fide member of the bar, was prosecuted on three counts of violating § 1001 for concealing from the court his name, identity, *709 and nonadmission to the bar.  After first acknowledging that, but for Bramblett , it might well have accepted the argument that Congress did not intend § 1001 to apply to the courts, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction.  But the court was clearly troubled by the potential sweep of § 1001.  Noting that the statute prohibits “concealment” and “covering up” of material facts, as well as intentional falsehoods, the court wondered whether the statute might be interpreted to criminalize conduct that falls well within the bounds of responsible advocacy.  9 The court concluded its opinion with this significant comment: “We are certain that neither Congress nor the Supreme Court intended the statute to include traditional trial tactics within the statutory terms ‘conceals or covers up.’ We hold only, on the authority of the Supreme Court construction, that the statute does apply to the type of action with which appellant was charged, action which essentially involved the ‘administrative’ or ‘housekeeping’ functions, not the ‘judicial’ machinery of the court.” <citedDecision>309 F. 2d, at 237</citedDecision> .  Relying on <citedDecision>Morgan</citedDecision> , the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a conviction several years later “because § 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents as evidence in a criminal proceeding.” United States v. Erhardt, 381 F. 2d 173, 175 (1967) (per curiam).  The court explained that the judicial function exception suggested in <citedDecision>Morgan</citedDecision> was necessary to prevent the perjury statute, with its two-witness rule (since repealed), from being undermined.  381 F. 2d, at 175 .  *710 Once planted, the judicial function exception began to flower in a number of other Circuits.  The Ninth Circuit summarized the state of the law in 1985: “[T]he adjudicative functions exception to section 1001 has been suggested or recognized by appellate decisions since 1962, not long after the Supreme Court decided that section 1001 applies to matters within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch.  In these twenty-three years, there has been no response on the part of Congress either repudiating the limitation or refining it.  It therefore seems too late in the day to hold that no exception exists.” United States v. Mayer, 775 F. 2d 1387, 1390 (per curiam) (footnote omitted).  The Second Circuit sounded a similar theme in 1991, relying in part on the congressional acquiescence to which the Ninth Circuit had adverted in Mayer .

Rev. 845 (1992).  In Bramblett , the Court incorrectly stated that the 1863 Act only penalized misconduct by members of the military.  In fact, §3 of the Act established criminal and civil penalties for false claims and other misdeeds *705 committed by “any person not in the military or naval forces of the United States.” 12 Stat. 698 .  In 1873, the statute was codified and minor changes were made.  See Rev. Stat. § 5438.  The penalties were changed in the Act of May 30,1908, 35 Stat. 555 , and the statute was recodified as § 35 of the Criminal Code in the Act of Mar. 4,1909, 35 Stat. 1095 .  “ ‘Does a defendant “cover up ... a material fact” when he pleads not guilty?’ ‘Does an attorney “cover up” when he moves to exclude hearsay testimony he knows to be true, or when he makes a summation on behalf of a client he knows to be guilty?’ ” Morgan v. United States, <citedDecision>309 F. 2d 234, 237</citedDecision> (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963).  Some 17 years before Masterpol , the Second Circuit restricted the application of § 1001 in a slightly different manner.  In United States v. D'Amato, 507 F. 2d 26 (1974), the court overturned a § 1001 conviction arising out of a false affidavit submitted in the course of a private civil lawsuit.  Based upon a review of relevant case law and legislative history, the court concluded that § 1001 did not apply “where the Government is involved only by way of a court deciding a matter in which the Government or its agencies are not involved.” Id., at 28.  Accord, United States v. London, 714 F. 2d 1558, 1561-1562 (CA11 1983).  See also, e. g., Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S., at 172-173 (stare decisis has “special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done”); Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986) (noting “the strong presumption of continued validity that adheres in the judicial interpretation of a statute”); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 189 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring) (declining to overturn “a line of [statutory] authority which I firmly believe to have been incorrectly decided”); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 286 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting) (“Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.  This is commonly true, even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation”) (citation omitted).
**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
*716 Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I concur in the judgment of the Court, and join Parts I — III and VI of Justíce Stevens’ opinion. United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503 (1955), should be overruled. The doctrine of stare decisis protects the legitimate expectations of those who live under the law, and, as Alexander Hamilton observed, is one of the means by which exercise of “an arbitrary discretion in the courts” is restrained, The Federalist No. 78, p. 471 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Who ignores it must give reasons, and reasons that go beyond mere demonstration that the overruled opinion was wrong (otherwise the doctrine would be no doctrine at all). The reason here, as far as I am concerned, is the demonstration, over time, that Bramblett has unacceptable consequences, which can be judicially avoided (absent overruling) only by limiting Bramblett in a manner that is irrational or by importing exceptions with no basis in law. Unlike Justice Stevens, I do not regard the Courts of Appeals’ attempts to limit Bramblett as an “'intervening development of the law,’” ante, at 713 (quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 173 (1989)), that puts us to a choice between two conflicting lines of authority. Such “intervening developments” by lower courts that we do not agree with are ordinarily disposed of by reversal. See, e. g., McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350 (1987). Instead, the significance I find in the fact that so many Courts of Appeals have strained so mightily to discern an exception that the statute does not contain, see ante, at 699, n. 2 (collecting cases), is that it demonstrates how great a potential for mischief federal judges have discovered in the mistaken reading of 18 U. S. C. § 1001 , a potential we did not fully appreciate when Bramblett was decided. To be sure, since 18 U. S. C. §1001’s prohibition of concealment is violated only when *717 there exists a duty to disclose, see, e.g., United States v. Kingston, 971 F. 2d 481, 489 (CA10 1992); United States v. Richeson, 825 F. 2d 17, 20 (CA4 1987); United States v. Irwin, 654 F. 2d 671, 678-679 (CA10 1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 1016 (1982), it does not actually prohibit any legitimate trial tactic. There remains, however, a serious concern that the threat of criminal prosecution under the capacious provisions of § 1001 will deter vigorous representation of opposing interests in adversarial litigation, particularly representation of criminal defendants, whose adversaries control the machinery of § 1001 prosecution. One could avoid the problem by accepting the Courts of Appeals’ invention of a “judicial function” exception, but there is simply no basis in the text of the statute for that. Similarly unprincipled would be rejecting Bramblett’s dictum that §1001 applies to the courts, while adhering to Bramblett’s holding that §1001 applies to Congress. This would construct a bizarre regime in which “department” means the Executive and Legislative Branches, but not the Judicial, thereby contradicting not only the statute’s intent (as Bramblett does), but, in addition, all conceivable interpretations of the English language. Neither of these solutions furthers the goal of avoiding “an arbitrary discretion in the courts”; they seem to me much more arbitrary than simply overruling a wrongly decided case. The other goal of stare decisis, preserving justifiable expectations, is not much at risk here. Those whose reliance on Bramblett induced them to tell the truth to Congress or the courts, instead of lying, have no claim on our solicitude. Some convictions obtained under Bramblett may have to be overturned, and in a few instances wrongdoers may go free who could have been prosecuted and convicted under a different statute if Bramblett had not been assumed to be the law. I count that a small price to pay for the uprooting of this weed.
**Dissenting Opinion**
*718 Chief Justice Rehnquist, with whom Justice O’Con-nor and Justice Souter join, dissenting. The bankruptcy trustee objected to the discharge of petitioner, a voluntary bankrupt, believing that he had filed false information. The trustee filed a complaint under 11 U. S. C. § 727 , alleging petitioner stored a well-drilling machine at his residence; petitioner answered by denying the allegation “for the reason that it is untrue.” App. 12, ¶ 10. The trustee also alleged in a separate motion that petitioner had, despite requests, failed to turn over all the books and records relating to the bankruptcy estate. Petitioner filed a response denying the allegation, and asserting that he had produced the requested documents at the behest of a previous trustee. Petitioner was then indicted under 18 U. S. C. § 1001 , and a jury found that each of these responses was a lie. Today, the majority jettisons a 40-year-old unanimous decision of this Court, United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503 (1955), under which petitioner’s conviction plainly would have been upheld. It does so despite an admission that the Court’s reading of § 1001 in Bramblett was “not completely implausible,” ante, at 706. In replacing Bramblett’s plausible, albeit arguably flawed, interpretation of the statute with its own “sound” reading, the Court disrespects the traditionally stringent adherence to stare decisis in statutory decisions. Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U. S. 164, 172 (1989); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977). The two reasons offered by the plurality in Part V of the opinion and the justification offered by the concurring opinion fall far short of the institutional hurdle erected by our past practice against overruling a decision of this Court interpreting an Act of Congress. The first reason is styled as an “intervening development in the law”; under it, decisions of Courts of Appeals that cannot be reconciled with our earlier precedent are treated as a basis for disavowing, not the aberrant Court of Appeals deci *719 sions, but, mirabile dictu our own decision! This novel corollary to the principle of stare decisis subverts the very principle on which a hierarchical court system is built. The second reason given is that there has been little or no reliance on our Bramblett decision; I believe that this ground is quite debatable, if not actually erroneous. Today’s decision harkens to the important reason behind the doctrine of stare decisis, but does not heed it. That doctrine is “a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon ‘an arbitrary discretion.’ ” Patterson, supra, at 172 , citing The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton). Respect for precedent is strongest “in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court’s interpretation of its legislation.” Illinois Brick Co., supra, at 736. Justice Brandéis’ dissenting opinion in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 (1932), made the point this way: “Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right. This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation.” Id., at 406 (citations omitted). We have recognized a very limited exception to this principle for what had been called “intervening developments in the law.” But the cases exemplifying this principle, e. g., Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320 (1972); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U. S. 477 (1989), have invariably made clear that the “intervening developments” were in the case law of this Court, not of the lower federal courts. Indeed, in Illinois Brick Co., we refused to follow a line of lower court decisions *720 which had carved out an exception from one of our precedents. 431 U. S., at 743-744 . But today’s decision departs radically from the previously limited reliance on this exception. The principle of stare decisis is designed to promote stability and certainty in the law. While most often invoked to justify a court's refusal to reconsider its own decisions, it applies a fortiori to enjoin lower courts to follow the decision of a higher court. This principle is so firmly established in our jurisprudence that no lower court would deliberately refuse to follow the decision of a higher court. But cases come in all shapes and varieties, and it is not always clear whether a precedent applies to a situation in which some of the facts are different from those in the decided case. Here lower courts must necessarily make judgments as to how far beyond its particular facts the higher court precedent extends. If there is appeal as a matter of right from the lower court to the higher court, any decision by the lower court that is viewed as mistaken by the higher court will in the normal course of events be corrected in short order by reversal on appeal. But in the present day federal court system, where review by this Court is almost entirely discretionary, a different regime prevails. We receive nearly 7,000 petitions for certiorari every Term, and can grant only a tiny fraction of them. A high degree of selectivity is thereby enjoined upon us in exercising our certiorari jurisdiction, and our Rule 10 embodies the standards by which we decide to grant review. One of the reasons contained in Rule 10.1(a) is the existence of a conflict between one court of appeals and another. The negative implication of this ground, borne out time and again in our decisions to grant and deny certiorari, is that ordinarily a court of appeals decision interpreting one of our precedents — even one deemed to be arguably inconsistent with it — will not be reviewed unless it conflicts with a decision of another court of appeals. This fact is a necessary concomitant of the limited capacity in this Court. *721 One of the consequences of this highly selective standard for granting review is that this Court is deprived of a very important means of assuring that the courts of appeals adhere to its precedents. It is all the more important, therefore, that no actual inducements to ignore these precedents be offered to the courts of appeals. But today’s decision is just such an inducement; it tells courts of appeals that if they build up a body of case law contrary to ours, their case law will serve as a basis for overruling our precedent. It is difficult to imagine a more topsy-turvy doctrine than this, or one more likely to unsettle established legal rules that the doctrine of stare decisis is designed to protect. The plurality attempts to bolster this aspect of its opinion by blandly assuring us that “the cases endorsing the exception almost certainly reflect the intent of Congress.” Ante, at 713. Members of Congress will surely be surprised by this statement. Congress has not amended or considered amending § 1001 in the 40 years since Bramblett was decided. We have often noted the danger in relying on congressional inaction in construing a statute, Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U. S. 619, 632 (1993), citing Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U. S. 293, 306 (1988), but even there the “inaction” referred to is a failure of Congress to enact a particular proposal. Here there was not even any proposal before Congress. If we delve more deeply into the hypothetical thought processes of a very diligent Member of Congress who made a specialty of following cases construing § 1001, the Member would undoubtedly know of our decision in Bramblett 40 years ago. If he also followed decisions of the courts of appeals, he would know that in various forms — whether a “judicial function” exception or an “exculpatory no” rule— several Courts of Appeals have held § 1001 inapplicable to some statements made in the course of judicial proceedings. If, after due deliberation, he concluded that this exception was inconsistent with our opinion in Bramblett , he would *722 surely also realize that in due course, on the assumption that the Judiciary was functioning as it should, the Supreme Court would itself decide that the exception was inconsistent with Bmmblett, and disavow the exception. But of one thing he would have been in no doubt: that under Bmmblett one who lied to an officer of Congress was punishable under § 1001, since that was the precise holding of Bmmblett. But it is that very justifiable expectation of Congress that is set at naught by today’s decision, under which the legislative process is no longer protected by § 1001. The plurality offers a second reason in defense of its decision to overrule Bmmblett. It points to a lack of significant reliance interests in Bmmblett. It dispels any reliance prosecutors might have in enforcement of § 1001 by arguing that the Government has expressed a preference for proceeding under alternative statutes that punish comparable behavior. U. S. Dept, of Justice, United States Attorneys’ Manual ¶ 9-69.267 (1992). The Government offered a convincing explanation for this preference: it instructs prosecutors to proceed under alternative statutes due to the uncertain mine field posed by the judicial function exception adopted in some, but not all, Circuits. Brief for Petitioner 20, and n. 9. I do not think the Government disclaims reliance by adopting a defensive litigating strategy in response to the choice of lower courts to disregard precedent favorable to the Government. And in this particular case, the perjury alternative in 18 U. S. C. § 1621 was altogether unavailable to punish petitioner’s falsehoods because his statements were not verified, and the obstruction of justice alternative in 18 U. S. C. § 1503 was of dubious utility. Statistics compiled by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts indicate that the Government has secured convictions under § 1001 in 2,247 cases over the last five fiscal years. Because the Administrative Office does not break down its statistics by type of agency to which the defendant made a false statement, further exploration of the *723 subject must be limited to published decisions. It is unclear what proportion of these cases involved false statements made to the Legislative or Judicial Branch, but it appears that the Government has attempted to proceed under § 1001 for false statements made to the Judiciary and Legislature with mixed success. * To the extent it has secured valid convictions in some courts in reliance on Bramblett , the Government should not now be forced to endure requests for habeas relief that will inevitably be filed in the wake of the Court’s opinion. The additional comments set forth in the concurring opinion equally disregard the respect due a unanimous decision rendered by six Justices who took the same oath of office sworn by the six Justices who overrule Bramblett today. The doctrine of stare decisis presumes to reinforce the notion that justice is dispensed according to law and not to serve *724 “the proclivities of individuals.” Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U. S. 254, 265 (1986). The opinion of one Justice that another’s view of a statute was wrong, even really wrong, does not overcome the institutional advantages conferred by adherence to stare decisis in cases where the wrong is fully redressable by a coordinate branch of government. This, then, is clearly a case where it is better that the matter be decided than that it be decided right. Bramblett governs this case, and if the rule of that case is to be overturned it should be at the hands of Congress, and not of this Court. > For false statements made to Bankruptcy Courts, see United States v. Taylor, 907 F. 2d 801 (CA8 1990) (upheld dismissal under exculpatory no doctrine); United States v. Rowland, 789 F. 2d 1169 (CA5) (affirmed conviction), cert. denied, 479 U. S. 964 (1986).

**Combined Opinion**
Relying on our decision in United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503 (1955), the District Court instructed the jury that a bankruptcy court is a "department .  .  .  of the United States" within the meaning of § 1001.  The jury convicted petitioner on all three § 1001 counts, and the District Court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 24 months' imprisonment.  On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, petitioner argued that his convictions under § 1001 were barred by the so-called "judicial function" exception.  First suggested over 30 years ago in Morgan v. United States , <citedDecision>309 F. 2d 234</citedDecision> (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), this doctrine limits the extent to which § 1001 reaches conduct occurring in the federal courts.  Under the exception, only those misrepresentations falling within a court's "administrative" or "housekeeping" functions can give rise to liability *699 under § 1001; false statements made while a court is performing its adjudicative functions are not covered.  The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's convictions under § 1001.  Although the judicial function exception has become entrenched over the years in a number of Circuits, the Sixth Circuit concluded, over a dissent, that the exception does not exist.  16 F. 3d 694 (1994).  That conclusion created a split in the Circuits, prompting us to grant certiorari.  [2] 513 U. S. 959 (1994).
**Combined Opinion**
 Courts should not rely on inconclusive statutory history as a basis for refusing to give effect to the plain language of an Act of Congress, particularly when the Legislature has specifically defined the controverted term. In Bramblett , the Court's method of analysis resulted in a decision that is at war with the text of not one, but two different Acts of Congress.  Whether the doctrine of stare decisis nevertheless requires that we accept Bramblett `s erroneous interpretation of § 1001 is a question best answered after reviewing the body of law directly at issue: the decisions adopting the judicial function exception.

As the following discussion indicates, the judicial function exception is almost as deeply rooted as Bramblett itself.  The seeds of the exception were planted by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit only seven years after Bramblett was decided.  In Morgan v. United States, <citedDecision>309 F. 2d 234</citedDecision> (1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963), the defendant, who had falsely held himself out to be a bona fide member of the bar, was prosecuted on three counts of violating § 1001 for concealing from the court his name, identity, *709 and nonadmission to the bar.  After first acknowledging that, but for Bramblett , it might well have accepted the argument that Congress did not intend § 1001 to apply to the courts, the Court of Appeals upheld the conviction.  But the court was clearly troubled by the potential sweep of § 1001.  Noting that the statute prohibits "concealment" and "covering up" of material facts, as well as intentional falsehoods, the court wondered whether the statute might be interpreted to criminalize conduct that falls well within the bounds of responsible advocacy.  [9] The court concluded its opinion with this significant comment: "We are certain that neither Congress nor the Supreme Court intended the statute to include traditional trial tactics within the statutory terms `conceals or covers up.' We hold only, on the authority of the Supreme Court construction, that the statute does apply to the type of action with which appellant was charged, action which essentially involved the `administrative' or `housekeeping' functions, not the `judicial' machinery of the court." <citedDecision>309 F. 2d, at 237</citedDecision> .  Relying on <citedDecision>Morgan</citedDecision> , the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed a conviction several years later "because § 1001 does not apply to the introduction of false documents as evidence in a criminal proceeding." United States v. Erhardt, 381 F. 2d 173, 175 (1967) (per curiam) .  The court explained that the judicial function exception suggested in <citedDecision>Morgan</citedDecision> was necessary to prevent the perjury statute, with its two-witness rule (since repealed), from being undermined.  381 F. 2d, at 175 .  *710 Once planted, the judicial function exception began to flower in a number of other Circuits.  The Ninth Circuit summarized the state of the law in 1985: "[T]he adjudicative functions exception to section 1001 has been suggested or recognized by appellate decisions since 1962, not long after the Supreme Court decided that section 1001 applies to matters within the jurisdiction of the judicial branch.  In these twenty-three years, there has been no response on the part of Congress either repudiating the limitation or refining it.  It therefore seems too late in the day to hold that no exception exists." United States v. Mayer, 775 F. 2d 1387, 1390 (per curiam) (footnote omitted).
**Combined Opinion**
 The penalties were changed in the Act of May 30, 1908, 35 Stat. 555 , and the statute was recodified as § 35 of the Criminal Code in the Act of Mar. 4, 1909, 35 Stat. 1095 .  [9]  "`Does a defendant "cover up .  .  .  a material fact" when he pleads not guilty?' `Does an attorney "cover up" when he moves to exclude hearsay testimony he knows to be true, or when he makes a summation on behalf of a client he knows to be guilty?' " Morgan v. United States, <citedDecision>309 F. 2d 234, 237</citedDecision> (CADC 1962), cert. denied, 373 U. S. 917 (1963).  [10]  Some 17 years before Masterpol , the Second Circuit restricted the application of§ 1001 in a slightly different manner.  In United States v. D'Amato, 507 F. 2d 26 (1974), the court overturned a § 1001 conviction arising out ofa falseaffidavit submitted inthe course of a private civil lawsuit.  Based upon a review of relevant case law and legislative history, the court concluded that § 1001 did not apply "where the Government is involved only by way of a court deciding a matter in which the Government or its agencies are not involved."

S., at 172-173 ( stare decisis has "special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done"); Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986) (noting "the strong presumption of continued validity that adheres in the judicial interpretation of a statute"); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 189 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring) (declining to overturn "a line of [statutory] authority which I firmly believe to have been incorrectly decided"); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (" Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.
