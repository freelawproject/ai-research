430 U. S., at 281 .  Bellas Hess *311 did not rely on any such labeling of taxes and therefore did not automatically fall with Freeman and its progeny.  While contemporary Commerce Clause jurisprudence might not dictate the same result were the issue to arise for the first time today, Bellas Hess is not inconsistent with Complete Auto and our recent cases. Under Complete Auto `s four-part test, we will sustain a tax against a Commerce Clause challenge so long as the "tax [1] is applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing State, [2] is fairly apportioned, [3] does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and [4] is fairly related to the services provided by the State." 430 U. S., at 279 .  Bellas Hess concerns the first of these tests and stands for the proposition that a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail or common carrier lacks the "substantial nexus" required by the Commerce Clause.  Thus, three weeks after Complete Auto was handed down, we cited Bellas Hess for this proposition and discussed the case at some length.  In National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 551, 559</citedDecision> (1977), we affirmed the continuing vitality of Bellas Hess `"sharp distinction .  .  .  between mail-order sellers with [a physical presence in the taxing] State and those .  .  .  who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business." We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval ever since.  For example, in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 263 (1989), we expressed "doubt that termination of an interstate telephone call, by itself, provides a substantial enough nexus for a State to tax a call. See National Bellas Hess .  .  .  (receipt of mail provides insufficient nexus)." See also D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988); Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S., at 437 ; National Geographic Society, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 559</citedDecision> .  For these reasons, we disagree with the State Supreme Court's conclusion *312 that our decision in Complete Auto undercut the Bellas Hess rule.  The State of North Dakota relies less on Complete Auto and more on the evolution of our due process jurisprudence.  The State contends that the nexus requirements imposed by the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are equivalent and that if, as we concluded above, a mail-order house that lacks a physical presence in the taxing State nonetheless satisfies the due process "minimum contacts" test, then that corporation also meets the Commerce Clause "substantial nexus" test.  We disagree.  Despite the similarity in phrasing, the nexus requirements of the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are not identical.  The two standards are animated by different constitutional concerns and policies.

Complete Auto, 430 U. S., at 279 .  In contrast, the bright-line rule of Bellas Hess furthers the ends of the dormant Commerce Clause.  Undue *315 burdens on interstate commerce may be avoided not only by a case-by-case evaluation of the actual burdens imposed by particular regulations or taxes, but also, in some situations, by the demarcation of a discrete realm of commercial activity that is free from interstate taxation.  Bellas Hess followed the latter approach and created a safe harbor for vendors "whose only connection with customers in the [taxing] State is by common carrier or the United States mail." Under Bellas Hess, such vendors are free from state-imposed duties to collect sales and use taxes.  [8] Like other bright-line tests, the Bellas Hess rule appears artificial at its edges: Whether or not a State may compel a vendor to collect a sales or use tax may turn on the presence in the taxing State of a small sales force, plant, or office.  Cf. National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1977); Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S. 207 (1960).  This artificiality, however, is more than offset by the benefits of a clear rule.  Such a rule firmly establishes the boundaries of legitimate state authority to impose a duty to collect sales and use taxes and reduces litigation concerning those taxes.  This benefit is important, for as we have so frequently noted, our law in this area is something of a "quagmire" and the "application of constitutional principles to specific state statutes leaves much room for controversy and confusion and little in the way of precise guides to the States in the exercise of their indispensable power of *316 taxation." Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 457-458 (1959).  Moreover, a bright-line rule in the area of sales and use taxes also encourages settled expectations and, in doing so, fosters investment by businesses and individuals.  [9] Indeed, it is not unlikely that the mail-order industry's dramatic growth over the last quarter century is due in part to the bright-line exemption from state taxation created in Bellas Hess.

 Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., 386 U. S. 753 (1967), held that the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution prohibit a State from imposing the duty of use-tax collection and payment upon a seller whose only connection with the State is through common carrier or the United States mail.  I agree with the Court that the Due Process Clause holding of Bellas Hess should be overruled.  Even before Bellas Hess, we had held, correctly I think, that state regulatory jurisdiction could be asserted on the basis of contacts with the State through the United States mail.  See Travelers Health Assn. v. Virginia ex rel. State Corp. Comm'n, 339 U. S. 643, 646-650 (1950) (blue sky laws).  It is difficult to discern any principled basis for distinguishing between jurisdiction to regulate and jurisdiction to tax. As an original matter, it might have been possible to distinguish between jurisdiction to tax and jurisdiction to compel collection of taxes as agent for the State, but we have rejected that.  National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 551, 558</citedDecision> (1977); Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U. S. 207, 211 (1960).  I agree with the Court, moreover, that abandonment of Bellas Hess' due process holding is compelled by reasoning "[c]omparable" to that contained in our post-1967 cases dealing with state jurisdiction to adjudicate.  Ante, at 308.  I do not understand this to mean that the due process standards for *320 adjudicative jurisdiction and those for legislative (or prescriptive) jurisdiction are necessarily identical; and on that basis I join Parts I, II, and III of the Court's opinion.  Compare Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U. S. 102 (1987), with American Oil Co. v. Neill, 380 U. S. 451 (1965).  I also agree that the Commerce Clause holding of Bellas Hess should not be overruled.  Unlike the Court, however, I would not revisit the merits of that holding, but would adhere to it on the basis of stare decisis.

 See ante, at 310.  Thus, the Court concludes, Bellas Hess "did not automatically fall with Free- *323 man and its progeny" in our decision in Complete Auto. See ante, at 311.  I am unpersuaded by this attempt to distinguish Bellas Hess from Freeman and Spector, both of which were repudiated by this Court. See Complete Auto, supra, at 288-289 , and n. 15.  What we disavowed in Complete Auto was not just the "formal distinction between `direct' and `indirect' taxes on interstate commerce," ante, at 310, but also the whole notion underlying the Bellas Hess physical-presence ruleÂ—that "interstate commerce is immune from state taxation," Complete Auto, supra, at 288 .  The Court compounds its misreading by attempting to show that Bellas Hess "is not inconsistent with Complete Auto and our recent cases." Ante, at 311.  This will be news to commentators, who have rightly criticized Bellas Hess.  [1] Indeed, the majority displays no small amount of audacity in claiming that our decision in National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 551, 559</citedDecision> (1977), which was rendered several weeks after Complete Auto, reaffirmed the continuing vitality of Bellas Hess.  See ante, at 311.  Our decision in that case did just the opposite.  National Geographic held that the National Geographic Society was liable for use tax collection responsibilities in California.  The Society conducted an out-of-state mail-order business similar to the one at issue here and in Bellas Hess, and in addition, maintained two small offices in California that solicited advertisements for National Geographic Magazine.  The Society argued that its physical presence in California was unrelated to its mail-order sales, and thus that the Bel- *324 las Hess rule compelled us to hold that the tax collection responsibilities could not be imposed.  We expressly rejected that view, holding that the "requisite nexus for requiring an out-of-state seller [the Society] to collect and pay the use tax is not whether the duty to collect the use tax relates to the seller's activities carried on within the State, but simply whether the facts demonstrate `some definite link, some minimum connection, between (the State and) the person .

 IV The Court attempts to justify what it rightly acknowledges is an "artificial" rule in several ways.  See ante, at 315.  First, it asserts that the Bellas Hess principle "firmly establishes the boundaries of legitimate state authority to impose a duty to collect sales and use taxes and reduces litigation concerning those taxes." Ante, at 315.  It is very doubtful, *330 however, that the Court's opinion can achieve its aims.  Certainly our cases now demonstrate two "bright-line" rules for mail-order sellers to follow: Under the physical-presence requirement reaffirmed here, they will not be subjected to use tax collection if they have no physical presence in the taxing State; under the National Geographic rule, mail-order sellers will be subject to use tax collection if they have some presence in the taxing State even if that activity has no relation to the transaction being taxed.  See National Geographic, <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 560-562</citedDecision> .  Between these narrow lines lies the issue of what constitutes the requisite "physical presence" to justify imposition of use tax collection responsibilities.  Instead of confronting this question head on, the majority offers only a cursory analysis of whether Quill's physical presence in North Dakota was sufficient to justify its use tax collection burdens, despite briefing on this point by the State.  [3] See Brief for Respondent 45-47.  North Dakota contends that even should the Court reaffirm the Bellas Hess rule, Quill's physical presence in North Dakota was sufficient to justify application of its use tax collection law. Quill concedes it owns software sent to its North Dakota customers, but suggests that such property is insufficient to justify a finding of nexus.  In my view, the question of Quill's actual physical presence is sufficiently close to cast doubt on the majority's confidence that it is propounding a truly "brightline" rule.  Reasonable minds surely can, and will, differ over what showing is required to make out a "physical presence" *331 adequate to justify imposing responsibilities for use tax collection.

 See, e. g., Tyler Pipe Industries, Inc. v. Washington State Dept. of Revenue, 483 U. S. 232 (1987).  [8]  In addition to its common-carrier contacts with the State, Quill also licensed software to some of its North Dakota clients.  See n.1, supra .  The State "concedes that the existence in North Dakota of a few floppy diskettes to which Quill holds title seems a slender thread upon which to base nexus." Brief for Respondent 46.  We agree.  Although title to "a few floppy diskettes" present in a State might constitute some minimal nexus, in National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 551, 556</citedDecision> (1977), we expressly rejected a "`slightest presence' standard of constitutional nexus." We therefore conclude that Quill's licensing of software in this case does not meet the "substantial nexus" requirement of the Commerce Clause.  [9]  It is worth noting that Congress has, at least on one occasion, followed a similar approach in its regulation of state taxation.  In response to this Court's indication in Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota, 358 U. S. 450, 452 (1959), that, so long as the taxpayer has an adequate nexus with the taxing State, "net income from the interstate operations of a foreign corporation may be subjected to state taxation," Congress enacted Pub. L. 86-272, codified at 15 U. S. C. Â§ 381 .  That statute provides that a State may not impose a net income tax on any person if that person's "only business activities within such State [involve] the solicitation of orders [approved] outside the State [and] filled .  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 An overruling of Bellas Hess might raise thorny questions concerning the retroactive application of those taxes and might trigger substantial unanticipated liability for mailorder houses.  The precise allocation of such burdens is better resolved by Congress rather than this Court. [11]  See, e. g., H. R. 2230, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); S. 480, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); S.2368, 100th Cong.,2d Sess. (1988); H. R. 3521, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987); S. 1099, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987); H. R. 3549, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. (1985); S. 983, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. (1979); S. 282, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. (1973).  [1]  See, e. g., P. Hartman, Federal Limitations on State and Local Taxation Â§ 10.8 (1981); Hartman, Collection of Use Tax on Out-of-State Mail-Order Sales, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 993 , 1006-1015 (1986); Hellerstein, Significant Sales and Use Tax Developments During the Past Half Century, 39 Vand. L. Rev. 961 , 984-985 (1986); McCray, Overturning Bellas Hess: Due Process Considerations, 1985 B. Y. U. L. Rev. 265, 288-290; Rothfeld, Mail Order Sales and State Jurisdiction to Tax, 53 Tax Notes 1405 , 1414-1418 (1991).  [2]  Similarly, I am unconvinced by the majority's reliance on subsequent decisions that have cited Bellas Hess.  See ante, at 311.  In D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988), for example, we distinguished Bellas Hess on the basis of the company's "significant economic presence in Louisiana, its many connections with the State, and the direct benefits it receives from Louisiana in conducting its business." We then went on to note that the situation presented was much more analogous to that in National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, <citedDecision>430 U. S. 551</citedDecision> (1977).  See 486 U. S., at 33-34 .  In Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609, 626 (1981), the Court cited Bellas Hess not to revalidate the physical-presence requirement, but rather to establish that a "nexus" must exist to justify imposition of a state tax. And finally, in Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 437 (1980), the Court cited Bellas Hess for the due process requirements necessary to sustain a tax. In my view, these citations hardly signal the continuing support of Bellas Hess that the majority seems to find persuasive.  [3]  Instead of remanding for consideration of whether Quill's ownership of software constitutes sufficient physical presence under its new Commerce Clause nexus requirement, the majority concludes as a matter of law that it does not.  See ante, at 315, n. 8.  In so doing, the majority rebuffs North Dakota's challenge without setting out any clear standard for what meets the Commerce Clause physical-presence nexus standard and without affording the State an opportunity on remand to attempt to develop facts or otherwise to argue that Quill's presence is constitutionally sufficient.
