 233 Ga. 117 , 210 S. E. 2d 659 (1974).  After reviewing the trial transcript and the record, including the evidence, and comparing the evidence and sentence in similar cases in accordance with the requirements of Georgia law, the court concluded that, considering the nature of the crime and the defendant, the sentences of death had not resulted from prejudice or any other arbitrary factor and were not excessive or disproportionate to the penalty applied in similar cases. 2 The death *162 sentences imposed, for armed robbery, however, were vacated on the grounds that the death penalty had rarely been imposed in Georgia for that offense and that the jury improperly considered the murders as aggravating circumstances for the robberies after having considered the armed robberies as aggravating circumstances for the murders.  Id., at 127 , 210 S. E. 2d, at 667 .  We granted the petitioner’s application for a writ of certiorari limited to his challenge to the imposition of the death sentences in this case as “cruel and unusual” punishment in violation of the Eighth and the Fourteenth Amendments.  423 U. S. 1082 (1976).  II Before considering the issues presented it is necessary to understand the Georgia statutory scheme for the imposition of the death penalty.  3 The Georgia statute, as amended after our decision in Furman v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S. 238</citedDecision> (1972), retains the death penalty for six categories of crime: murder, 4 kidnaping for ransom or where *163 the victim is harmed, armed robbery, 5 rape, treason, and aircraft hijacking.  6 Ga. Code Ann. §§ 26-1101 , 26-1311, 26-1902, 26-2001, 26-2201, 26-3301 (1972).  The capital defendant’s guilt or innocence is determined in the traditional manner, either by a trial judge or a jury, in the first stage of a bifurcated trial. If trial is by jury, the trial judge is required to charge lesser included offenses when they are supported by any view of the evidence.  Sims v. State, 203 Ga. 668 , 47 S. E. 2d 862 (1948).  See Linder v. State, 132 Ga. App. 624, 625 , 208 S. E. 2d 630, 631 (1974).  After a verdict, finding, or plea of guilty to a capital crime, a presentence hearing is conducted before whoever made the determination of guilt.  The sentencing procedures are essentially the same in both bench and jury trials.

 A copy of the report is served upon defense counsel.  Under its special review authority, the court may either affirm the death sentence or remand the case for resentencing.  In cases in which the death sentence is affirmed there remains the possibility of executive clemency.  11 Ill We address initially the basic contention that the punishment of death for the crime of murder is, under all circumstances, “cruel and unusual” in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution.  In Part IV of this opinion, we will consider the sentence of death imposed under the Georgia statutes at issue in this case. The Court on a number of occasions has both assumed and asserted the constitutionality of capital punishment.  In several cases that assumption provided a necessary foundation for the decision, as the Court was asked to decide whether a particular method of carrying out a capital sentence would be allowed to stand under the Eighth Amendment.  12 But until Furman v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S. 238</citedDecision> (1972), the Court never confronted squarely the fundamental claim that the punishment of death always, regardless of the enormity of the offense or the procedure followed in imposing the sentence, is cruel and *169 unusual punishment in violation of the Constitution.  Although this issue was presented and addressed in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , it was not resolved by the Court. Four Justices would have held that capital punishment is not unconstitutional per se; 13 two Justices would have reached the opposite conclusion; 14 and three Justices, while agreeing that the statutes then before the Court were invalid as applied, left open the question whether such punishment may ever be imposed.  15 We now hold that the punishment of death does not invariably violate the Constitution.  A The history of the prohibition of “cruel and unusual” punishment already has been reviewed at length.  16 The phrase first appeared in the English Bill of Rights of 1689, which was drafted by Parliament at the accession of William and Mary.  See Granucci, “Nor Cruel and Unusual Punishments Inflicted:” The Original Meaning, 57 Calif. L. Rev. 839 , 852-853 (1969).  The English version appears to have been directed against punishments unauthorized by statute and beyond the jurisdiction of the sentencing court, as well as those disproportionate to the offense involved.  Id., at 860 .

 .”).  See also Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S. 459, 464 (1947) (second attempt at electrocution found not to violate *171 Eighth Amendment, since failure of initial execution attempt was “an unforeseeable accident” and “[t]here [was] no purpose to inflict unnecessary pain nor any unnecessary pain involved in the proposed execution”).  But the Court has not confined the prohibition embodied in the Eighth Amendment to “barbarous” methods that were generally outlawed in the 18th century.  Instead, the Amendment has been interpreted in a flexible and dynamic manner.  The Court early recognized that “a principle to be vital must be capable of wider application than the mischief which gave it birth.” Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 373 (1910).  Thus the Clause forbidding “cruel and unusual” punishments “is not fastened to the obsolete but may acquire meaning as public opinion becomes enlightened by a humane justice.” Id., at 378 .  See also <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 429-430</citedDecision> (Powell, J., dissenting); Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100-101 (1958) (plurality opinion).  In Weems the Court addressed the constitutionality of the Philippine punishment of cadena temporal for the crime of falsifying an official document.  That punishment included imprisonment for at least 12 years and one day, in chains, at hard and painful labor; the loss of many basic civil rights; and subjection to lifetime surveillance.  Although the Court acknowledged the possibility that “the cruelty of pain” may be present in the challenged punishment, 217 U. S., at 366 , it did not rely on that factor, for it rejected the proposition that the Eighth Amendment reaches only punishments that are “inhuman and barbarous, torture and the like.” Id., at 368 .  Rather, the Court focused on the lack of proportion between the crime and the offense: “Such penalties for such offenses amaze those who have formed their conception of the relation of a state to even its offending citizens from the practice *172 of the American commonwealths, and believe that it is a precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to offense.” Id., at 366-367 .  18 Later, in Trop v. Dulles, supra, the Court reviewed the constitutionality of the punishment of denationalization imposed upon a soldier who escaped from an Army stockade and became a deserter for one day. Although the concept of proportionality was not the basis of the holding, the plurality observed in dicta that “[fjines, imprisonment and even execution may be imposed depending upon the enormity of the crime.” 356 U. S., at 100 .  .  The substantive limits imposed by the Eighth Amendment on what can be made criminal and punished were discussed in Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962).  The Court found unconstitutional a state statute that made the status of being addicted to a narcotic drug a criminal offense.  It held, in effect, that it is “cruel and unusual” to impose any punishment at all for the mere status of addiction.  The cruelty in the abstract of the actual sentence imposed was irrelevant: “Even one day in prison would be a cruel and unusual punishment for the 'crime' of having a common cold.” Id., at 667 .  Most recently, in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, supra,</citedDecision> three Justices in separate concurring opinions found the Eighth Amendment applicable to procedures employed to select convicted defendants for the sentence of death.  It is clear from the foregoing precedents that the *173 Eighth Amendment has not been regarded as a static concept.  As Mr. Chief Justice Warren said, in an oft-quoted phrase, “[t]he Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.” Trop v. Dulles, supra, at 101 .  See also Jackson v. Bishop, 404 P. 2d 571 , 579 (CA8 1968).  Cf. Robinson v. California, supra, at 666 .  Thus, an assessment of contemporary values concerning the infliction of a challenged sanction is relevant to the application of the Eighth Amendment.  As we develop below more fully, see infra, at 175-176, this assessment does not call for a subjective judgment.  It requires, rather, that we look to objective indicia that reflect the public attitude toward a given sanction.  But our cases also make clear that public perceptions of standards of decency with respect to criminal sanctions are not conclusive.  A penalty also must accord with “the dignity of man,” which is the “basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment.” Trop v. Dulles, supra, at 100 (plurality opinion).  This means, at least, that the punishment not be “excessive.” When a form of punishment in the abstract (in this case, whether capital punishment may ever be imposed as a sanction for murder) rather than in the particular (the propriety of death as a penalty to be applied to a specific defendant for a specific crime) is under consideration, the inquiry into “excessiveness” has two aspects.  First, the punishment must not involve the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.  <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, supra, at 392-393</citedDecision> (Burger, C. J., dissenting).  See Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S., at 136 ; Weems v. United States, supra, at 381 .  Second, the punishment must not be grossly out of proportion to the severity of the crime.  Trop v. Dulles, supra, at 100 (plurality opinion) (dictum); Weems v. United States, supra, at 367 .  *174 B Of course, the requirements of the Eighth Amendment must be applied with an awareness of the limited role to be played by the courts.  This does not mean that judges have no role to play, for the Eighth Amendment is a restraint upon the exercise of legislative power.  “Judicial review, by definition, often involves a conflict between judicial and legislative judgment as to what the Constitution means or requires.  In this respect, Eighth Amendment cases come to us in no different posture.  It seems conceded by all that the Amendment imposes some obligations on the judiciary to judge the constitutionality of punishment and that there are punishments that the Amendment would bar whether legislatively approved or not.” <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 313-314</citedDecision> (White, J., concurring).  See also id., at 433 (Powell, J., dissenting).  19 But, while we have an obligation to insure that con *175 stitutional bounds are not overreached, we may not act as judges as we might as legislators.  “Courts are not representative bodies.  They are not designed to be a good reflex of a democratic society.  Their judgment is best informed, and therefore most dependable, within narrow limits.  Their essential quality is detachment, founded on independence.  History teaches that the independence of the judiciary is jeopardized when courts become embroiled in the passions of the day and assume primary responsibility in choosing between competing political, economic and social pressures.” Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, 525 (1951) (Frankfurter, J., concurring in affirmance of judgment).  20 Therefore, in assessing a punishment selected by a democratically elected legislature against the constitutional measure, we presume its validity.  We may not require the legislature to select the least severe penalty possible so long as the penalty selected is not cruelly inhumane or disproportionate to the crime involved.  And a heavy burden rests on those who would attack the judgment of the representatives of the people.  This is true in part because the constitutional test is intertwined with an assessment of contemporary standards and the legislative judgment weighs heavily in ascertaining such standards.  “[I]n a democratic society legislatures, not courts, are constituted to respond to the will and consequently the moral values of the people.” *176 <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, supra, at 383</citedDecision> (Burger, C. J., dissenting) .  The deference we owe to the decisions of the state legislatures under our federal system, <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 465-470</citedDecision> (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), is enhanced where the specification of punishments is concerned, for “these are peculiarly questions of legislative policy.” Gore v. United States, 357 U. S. 386, 393 (1958).  Cf. Robinson v. California, 370 U. S., at 664-665 ; Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S., at 103 (plurality opinion); In re Kemmler, 136 U. S., at 447 .  Caution is necessary lest this Court become, “under the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the ultimate arbiter of the standards of criminal responsibility .  .  .  throughout the country.” Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S. 514, 533 (1968) (plurality opinion).  A decision that a given punishment is impermissible under the Eighth Amendment cannot be reversed short of a constitutional amendment.  The ability of the people to express their preference through the normal democratic processes, as well as through ballot referenda, is shut off.  Revisions cannot be made in the light of further experience.  See <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, supra, at 461-462</citedDecision> (Powell, J., dissenting).  C In the discussion to this point we have sought to identify the principles and considerations that guide a court in addressing an Eighth Amendment claim.  We now consider specifically whether the sentence of death for the crime of murder is a per se violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.  We note first that history and precedent strongly support a negative answer to this question.  The imposition of the death penalty for the crime of murder has a long history of acceptance both in the United States and in England.  The common-law rule *177 imposed a mandatory death sentence on all convicted murderers.  McGautha v. California, 402 U. S. 183, 197-198 (1971).

 .  .  And the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted over three-quarters of a century later, similarly contemplates the existence of the capital sanction in providing that no State shall deprive any person of “life, liberty, or property” without due process of law. For nearly two centuries, this Court, repeatedly and *178 often expressly, has recognized that capital punishment is not invalid per se. In Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S., at 134-135 , where the Court found no constitutional violation in inflicting death by public shooting, it said: “Cruel and unusual punishments are forbidden by the Constitution, but the authorities referred to are quite sufficient to show that the punishment of shooting as a mode of executing the death penalty for the crime of murder in the first degree is not included in that category, within the meaning of the eighth amendment.” Rejecting the contention that death by electrocution was “cruel and unusual,” the Court in In re Kemmler, supra, at 447 , reiterated: “[T]he punishment of death is not cruel, within the meaning of that word as used in the Constitution.  It implies there something inhuman and barbarous, something more than the mere extinguishment of life.” Again, in Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U. S., at 464 , the Court remarked: “The cruelty against which the Constitution protects a convicted man is cruelty inherent in the method of punishment, not the necessary suffering involved in any method employed to extinguish life humanely.” And in Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S., at 99 , Mr. Chief Justice Warren, for himself and three other Justices, wrote: “Whatever the arguments may be against capital punishment, both on moral grounds and in terms of accomplishing the purposes of punishment .  .  .  the death penalty has been employed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is still widely accepted, it cannot be said to violate the constitutional concept of cruelty.” *179 Four years ago, the petitioners in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> and its companion cases predicated their argument primarily upon the asserted proposition that standards of decency had evolved to the point where capital punishment no longer could be tolerated.  The petitioners in those cases said, in effect, that the evolutionary process had come to an end, and that standards of decency required that the Eighth Amendment be construed finally as prohibiting capital punishment for any crime regardless of its depravity and impact on society.  This view was accepted by two Justices.  21 Three other Justices were unwilling to go so far; focusing on the procedures by which convicted defendants were selected for the death penalty rather than on the actual punishment inflicted, they joined in the conclusion that the statutes before the Court were constitutionally invalid.  22 The petitioners in the capital cases before the Court today renew the "standards of decency” argument, but developments during the four years since <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> have undercut substantially the assumptions upon which their argument rested.  Despite the continuing debate, dating back to the 19th century, over the morality and utility of capital punishment, it is now evident that a large proportion of American society continues to regard it as an appropriate and necessary criminal sanction.  The most marked indication of society's endorsement of the death penalty for murder is the legislative response to <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> .  The legislatures of at least 35 States 23 have enacted new statutes that provide for the *180 death penalty for at least some crimes that result in the death of another person.  And the Congress of the United States, in 1974, enacted a statute providing the death penalty for aircraft piracy that results in death.  24 These recently adopted statutes have attempted to address the concerns expressed by the Court in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> primarily (i) by specifying the factors to be weighed and the procedures to be followed in deciding when to impose a capital sentence, or (ii) by .making the death penalty mandatory for specified crimes.  But all of the post-Furman statutes make clear that capital punish *181 ment itself has not been rejected by the elected representatives of the people.  In the only statewide referendum occurring since Fur-man and brought to our attention, the people of California adopted a constitutional amendment that authorized capital punishment, in effect negating a prior ruling by the Supreme Court of California in People v. Anderson, 6 Cal. 3d 628 , 493 P. 2d 880 , cert. denied, 406 U. S. 958 (1972), that the death penalty violated the California Constitution.  25 The jury also is a significant and reliable objective index of contemporary values because it is so directly involved.  See <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 439-440</citedDecision> (Powell, J., dissenting).  See generally Powell, Jury Trial of Crimes, 23 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 1 (1966).  The Court has said that “one of the most important functions any jury can perform in making ... a selection [between life imprisonment and death for a defendant convicted in a capital case] is to maintain a link between contemporary community values and the penal system.” Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U. S. 510 , 519 n. 15 (1968).  It may be true that evolving standards have influenced juries in *182 recent decades to be more discriminating in imposing the sentence of death.  26 But the relative infrequency of jury verdicts imposing the death sentence does not indicate rejection of capital punishment per se. Rather, the reluctance of juries in many cases to impose the sentence may well reflect the humane feeling that this most irrevocable of sanctions should be reserved for a small number of extreme cases. See <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, supra, at 388</citedDecision> (Burger, C. J., dissenting).  Indeed, the actions of juries in many States since <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> are fully compatible with the legislative judgments, reflected in the new statutes, as to the continued utility and necessity of capital punishment in appropriate cases. At the close of 1974 at least 254 persons had been sentenced to death since Furman, 27 and by the end of March 1976, more than 460 persons were subject to death sentences.  As we have seen, however, the Eighth Amendment demands more than that a challenged punishment be acceptable to contemporary society.  The Court also must ask whether it comports with the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the Amendment.  Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S., at 100 (plurality opinion).  Although we cannot “invalidate a category of penalties because we deem less severe penalties adequate to serve the ends of *183 penology,’ <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, supra, at 451</citedDecision> (Powell, J., dissenting), the sanction imposed cannot be so totally without penological justification that it results in the gratuitous infliction of suffering.  Cf. Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U. S., at 135-136 ; In re Kemmler, 136 U. S., at 447 .  The death penalty is said to serve two principal social purposes: retribution and deterrence of capital crimes by prospective offenders.  28 In part, capital punishment is an expression of society’s moral outrage at particularly offensive conduct.  29 This function may be unappealing to many, but it is essential in an ordered society that asks its citizens to rely on legal processes rather than self-help to vindicate their wrongs.  “The instinct for retribution is part of the nature of man, and channeling that instinct in the administration of criminal justice serves an important purpose in promoting the stability of a society governed by law. When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they ‘deserve,’ then there are sown the seeds of anarchy — of self-help, vigilante justice, and lynch law.” <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, supra, at 308</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., concurring).  “Retribution is no longer the dominant objective of the criminal law,” Williams v. New York, 337 U. S. 241, 248 (1949), but neither is it a forbidden objective nor one inconsistent with our respect for the dignity of men.  *184 <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 394-395</citedDecision> (Burger, C. J., dissenting); id., at 452-454 (Powell, J., dissenting); Powell v. Texas, 392 U. S., at 531 535-536 (plurality opinion).  Indeed, the decision that capital punishment may be the appropriate sanction in extreme cases is an expression of the community’s belief that certain crimes are themselves so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death.  30 Statistical attempts to evaluate the worth of the death penalty as a deterrent to crimes by potential offenders have occasioned a great deal of debate.  31 The results *185 simply have been inconclusive.  As one opponent of capital punishment has said: “[A]fter all possible inquiry, including the probing of all possible methods of inquiry, we do not know, and for systematic and easily visible reasons cannot know, what the truth about this 'deterrent’ effect may be .... "The inescapable flaw is .  .  .
**Lead Opinion**
 Although some of the studies suggest that the death penalty may not function as a significantly greater deterrent than lesser penalties, 32 there is no convincing empirical evidence either supporting or refuting this view.  We may nevertheless assume safely that there are murderers, such as those who act in passion, for whom the threat of death has little or no deterrent effect.  But for many others, the death penalty undoubtedly is a signifi *186 cant deterrent.  There are carefully contemplated murders, such as murder for hire, where the possible penalty of death may well enter into the cold calculus that precedes the decision to act.  33 And there are some categories of murder, such as murder by a life prisoner, where other sanctions may not be adequate.  34 The value of capital punishment as a deterrent of crime is a complex factual issue the resolution of which properly rests with the legislatures, which can evaluate the results of statistical studies in terms of their own local conditions and with a flexibility of approach that is not available to the courts.  <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, supra, at 403-405</citedDecision> (Burger, C. J., dissenting).  Indeed, many of the post-Furman statutes reflect just such a responsible effort to define those crimes and those criminals for which capital punishment is most probably an effective deterrent.  In sum, we cannot say that the judgment of the Georgia Legislature that capital punishment may be necessary in some cases is clearly wrong.  Considerations of federalism, as well as respect for the ability of a legislature *187 to evaluate, in terms of its particular State, the moral consensus concerning the death penalty and its social utility as a sanction, require us to conclude, in the absence of more convincing evidence, that the infliction of death as a punishment for murder is not without justification and thus is not unconstitutionally severe.  Finally, we must consider whether the punishment of death is disproportionate in relation to the crime for which it is imposed.  There is no question that death as a punishment is unique in its severity and irrevocability.  <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 286-291</citedDecision> (Brennan, J., concurring); <citedDecision>id., at 306</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., concurring).  When a defendant’s life is at stake, the Court has been particularly sensitive to insure that every safeguard is observed.  Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 71 (1932); Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 77 (1957) (Harlan, J., concurring in result).  But we are concerned here only with the imposition of capital punishment for the crime of murder, and when a life has been taken deliberately by the offender, 35 we cannot say that the punishment is invariably disproportionate to the crime.  It is an extreme sanction, suitable to the most extreme of crimes.  We hold that the death penalty is not a form of punishment that may never be imposed, regardless of the circumstances of the offense, regardless of the character of the offender, and regardless of the procedure followed in reaching the decision to impose it.  IV We now consider whether Georgia may impose the death penalty on the petitioner in this case. *188 A While <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> did not hold that the infliction of the death penalty per se violates the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishments, it did recognize that the penalty of death is different in kind from any other punishment imposed under our system of criminal justice.  Because of the uniqueness of the death penalty, <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> held that it could not be imposed under sentencing procedures that created a substantial risk that it would be inflicted in an arbitrary and capricious manner.  Mr. Justice White concluded that “the death penalty is exacted with great infrequency even for the most atrocious crimes and .  .  .  there is no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which it is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.” <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 313</citedDecision> (concurring).  Indeed, the death sentences examined by the Court in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> were “cruel and unusual in the same way that being struck by lightning is cruel and unusual.  For, of all the people convicted of [capital crimes], many just as reprehensible as these, the petitioners [in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> were] among a capriciously selected random handful upon whom the sentence of death has in fact been imposed.  .  .  .  [T]he Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments cannot tolerate the infliction of a sentence of death under legal systems that permit this unique penalty to be so wantonly and so freakishly imposed.” <citedDecision>Id., at 309-310</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., concurring).  36 *189 <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> mandates that where discretion is afforded a sentencing body on a matter so grave as the determination of whether a human life should be taken or spared, that discretion must be suitably directed and limited so as to minimize the risk of wholly arbitrary and capricious action.  It is certainly not a novel proposition that discretion in the area of sentencing be exercised in an informed manner.  We have long recognized that “[f]or the determination of sentences, justice generally requires .  .  .  that there be taken into account the circumstances of the offense together with the character and propensities of the offender.” Pennsylvania ex rel. Sullivan v. Ashe, 302 U. S. 51, 55 (1937).  See also Williams v. Oklahoma, 358 U. S. 576, 585 (1959); Williams v. New York, 337 U. S., at 247 , 37 Otherwise, “the system cannot function in a consistent and a rational manner.” American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures § 4.1 (a), Commentary, p. 201 (App. Draft 1968).

 .  The obvious solution ... is to bifurcate the proceeding, abiding strictly by the rules of evidence until and unless there is a conviction, but once guilt has been determined opening the record to the further information that is relevant to sentence.  This is the analogue of the procedure in the ordinary case when capital punishment is not in issue; the court conducts a separate inquiry before imposing sentence.” ALI, Model Penal Code § 201.6, Comment 5, pp. 74 — 75 (Tent.  Draft No. 9, 1959).  See also Spencer v. Texas, 385 U. S. 554, 567-569 (1967); Report of the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, 1949-1953, Cmd.  8932, ¶¶555, 574; Knowlton, Problems of Jury Discretion in Capital Cases, 101 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1099 , 1135-1136 (1953).  When a human life is at stake and when the jury must have information prejudicial to the question of guilt but relevant to the question of penalty in order to impose a rational sentence, a bifur *192 cated system is more likely to ensure elimination of the constitutional deficiencies identified in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , 41 But the provision of relevant information under fair procedural rules is not alone sufficient to guarantee that the information will be properly used in the imposition of punishment, especially if sentencing is performed by a jury.  Since the members of a jury will have had little, if any, previous experience in sentencing, they are unlikely to be skilled in dealing with the information they are given.  See American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Sentencing Alternatives and Procedures, § 1.1 (b), Commentary, pp. 46-47 (Approved Draft 1968); President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice: The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society, Task Force Report: The Courts 26 (1967).  To the extent that this problem is inherent in jury sentencing, it may not be totally cor-rectible.  It seems clear, however, that the problem will be alleviated if the jury is given guidance regarding the factors about the crime and the defendant that the State, representing organized society, deems particularly relevant to the sentencing decision.  The idea that a jury should be given guidance in its *193 decisionmaking is also hardly a novel proposition.  Juries are invariably given careful instructions on the law and how to apply it before they are authorized to decide the merits of a lawsuit.

 While some have suggested that standards to guide a capital jury's sentencing deliberations are impossible to formulate, 43 the fact is that such standards have been developed.  When the drafters of the Model Penal Code faced this problem, they concluded “that it is within the realm of possibility to point to the main circumstances of aggravation and of mitigation that should be weighed and weighed against each other when they are presented in a concrete case." ALI, Model Penal Code § 201.6, Comment.  3, p. 71 (Tent.  Draft No. 9, 1959) (emphasis in original).  44 While such standards are by *194 necessity somewhat general, they do provide guidance to the sentencing authority and thereby reduce the likelihood that it will impose a sentence that fairly can be *195 called capricious or arbitrary.  45 Where the sentencing authority is required to specify the factors it relied upon in reaching its decision, the further safeguard of meaningful appellate review is available to ensure that death sentences are not imposed capriciously or in a freakish manner.  In summary, the concerns expressed in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> that the penalty of death not be imposed in an arbitrary or capricious manner can be met by a carefully drafted statute that ensures that the sentencing authority is given adequate information and guidance.  As a general proposition these concerns are best met by a system that provides for a bifurcated proceeding at which the sentencing authority is apprised of the information relevant to the imposition of sentence and provided with standards to guide its use of the information.  We do not intend to suggest that only the above-described procedures would be permissible under <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> or that any sentencing system constructed along these general lines would inevitably satisfy the concerns of Furman, 46 for each distinct system must be examined on an individual basis.  Rather, we have embarked upon this general exposition to make clear that it is possible to construct capital-sentencing systems capable of meeting Furman’s constitutional concerns.  47 *196 B We now turn to consideration of the constitutionality of Georgia’s capital-sentencing procedures.  In the wake of <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , Georgia amended its capital punishment statute, but chose not to narrow the scope of its murder provisions.  See Part II, supra. Thus, now as before Fur-man, in Georgia “[a] person commits murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied, causes the death of another human being.” Ga. Code Ann., § 26-1101 (a) (1972).  All persons convicted of murder “shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for life.” § 26-1101 (c) (1972).  Georgia did act, however, to narrow the class of murderers subject to capital punishment by specifying 10 *197 statutory aggravating circumstances, one of which must be found by the jury to exist beyond a reasonable doubt before a death sentence can ever be imposed.  48 In addition, the jury is authorized to consider any other appropriate aggravating or mitigating circumstances.  § 27-2534.1 (b) (Supp. 1975).  The jury is not required to find any mitigating circumstance in order to make a recommendation of mercy that is binding on the trial court, see § 27-2302 (Supp. 1975), but it must find a statutory aggravating circumstance before recommending a sentence of death.

 Was it committed in a particularly heinous way or in a manner that endangered the lives of many persons?  In addition, the jury’s attention is focused on the characteristics of the person who committed the crime: Does he have a record of prior convictions for capital offenses?  Are there any special facts about this defendant that mitigate against imposing capital punishment (e. g., his youth, the extent of his cooperation with the police, his emotional state at the time of the crime).  49 As a result, while *198 some jury discretion still exists, “the discretion to be exercised is controlled by clear and objective standards so as to produce non-discriminatory application.” Coley v. State, 231 Ga. 829, 834 , 204 S. E. 2d 612, 615 (1974).  As an important additional safeguard against arbitrariness and caprice, the Georgia statutory scheme provides for automatic appeal of all death sentences to the State’s Supreme Court. That court is required by statute to review each sentence of death and determine whether it was imposed under the influence of passion or prejudice, whether the evidence supports the jury’s finding of a statutory aggravating circumstance, and whether the sentence is disproportionate compared to those sentences imposed in similar cases. § 27-2537 (c) (Supp. 1975).  In short, Georgia’s new sentencing procedures require as a prerequisite to the imposition of the death penalty, specific jury findings as to the circumstances of the crime or the character of the defendant.  Moreover, to guard further against a situation comparable to that presented in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , the Supreme Court of Georgia compares each death sentence with the sentences imposed on similarly situated defendants to ensure that the sentence of death in a particular case is not disproportionate.  On their face these procedures seem to satisfy the concerns of <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> .  No longer should there be “no meaningful basis for distinguishing the few cases in which [the death penalty] is imposed from the many cases in which it is not.” <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 313</citedDecision> (White, J., concurring).  The petitioner contends, however, that the changes in the Georgia sentencing procedures are only cosmetic, that the arbitrariness and capriciousness condemned by <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> continue to exist in Georgia — both in traditional practices that still remain and in the new sentencing procedures adopted in response to <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> .  *199 1 First, the petitioner focuses on the opportunities for discretionary action that are inherent in the processing of any murder case under Georgia law. He notes that the state prosecutor has unfettered authority to select those persons whom he wishes to prosecute for a capital offense and to plea bargain with them.  Further, at the trial the jury may choose to convict a defendant of a lesser included offense rather than find him guilty of a crime punishable by death, even if the evidence would support a capital verdict.  And finally, a defendant who is convicted and sentenced to die may have his sentence commuted by the Governor of the State and the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles.  The existence of these discretionary stages is not determinative of the issues before us.  At each of these stages an actor in the criminal justice system makes a decision which may remove a defendant from consideration as a candidate for the death penalty.  <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , in contrast, dealt with the decision to impose the death sentence on a specific individual who had been convicted of a capital offense.  Nothing in any of our cases suggests that the decision to afford an individual defendant mercy violates the Constitution.  <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> held only that, in order to minimize the risk that the death penalty would be imposed on a capriciously selected group of offenders, the decision to impose it had to be guided by standards so that the sentencing authority would focus on the particularized circumstances of the crime and the defendant.  50 *200 2 The petitioner further contends that the capital-sentencing procedures adopted by Georgia in response to <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> do not eliminate the dangers of arbitrariness and caprice in jury sentencing that were held in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> to be violative of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  He claims that the statute is so broad and vague as to leave juries free to act as arbitrarily and capriciously as they wish in deciding whether to impose the death penalty.  While there is no claim that the jury in this case relied upon a vague or overbroad provision to establish the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance, the petitioner looks to the sentencing system as a whole (as the Court did in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> and we do today) and argues that it fails to reduce sufficiently the risk of arbitrary infliction of death sentences.  Specifically, Gregg urges that the statutory aggravating circumstances are too broad and too vague, that the sentencing procedure allows for arbitrary grants of mercy, and that the scope of the evidence and argument that can be considered at the presentence hearing is too wide.  *201 The petitioner attacks the seventh statutory aggravating circumstance, which authorizes imposition of the death penalty if the murder was “outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim/’ contending that it is so broad that capital punishment could be imposed in any murder case. 51 It is, of course, arguable that any murder involves depravity of mind or an aggravated battery.  But this language need not be construed in this way, and there is no reason to assume that the Supreme Court of Georgia will adopt such an open-ended construction.  52 In only one case has it upheld a jury’s decision to sentence a defendant to death when the only statutory aggravating circumstance found was that of the seventh, see McCorquodale v. State, 233 Ga. 369 , 211 S. E. 2d 577 (1974), and that homicide was a horrifying torture-murder.  53 *202 The petitioner also argues that two of the statutory aggravating circumstances are vague and therefore susceptible of widely differing interpretations, thus creating a substantial risk that the death penalty will be arbitrarily inflicted by Georgia juries.  54 In light of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia we must disagree.  First, the petitioner attacks that part of § 27-2534.1 (b) (1) that authorizes a jury to consider whether a defendant has a “substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions.” The Supreme Court of Georgia, however, has demonstrated a concern that the new sentencing procedures provide guidance to juries.  It held this provision to be impermissibly vague in Arnold v. State, 236 Ga. 534, 540 , 224 S. E. 2d 386, 391 (1976), because it did not provide the jury with “sufficiently 'clear and objective standards.’ ” Second, the petitioner points to § 27-2534.1 (b)(3) which speaks of creating a “great risk of death to more than one person.” While such a phrase might be susceptible of an overly broad interpretation, the Supreme Court of Georgia has not so construed it.  The only case in which the court upheld a conviction in reliance on this aggravating circumstance involved a man who stood up in a church and fired a gun indiscriminately into the audience.  See *203 Chenault v. State, 234 Ga. 216 , 216 S. E. 2d 223 (1975).  On the other hand, the court expressly reversed a finding of great risk when the victim was simply kid-naped in a parking lot.  See Jarrell v. State, 234 Ga. 410, 424 , 216 S. E. 2d 258, 269 (1975).  55 The petitioner next argues that the requirements of <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> are not met here because the jury has the power to decline to impose the death penalty even if it finds that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances are present in the case. This contention misinterprets <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> .  See supra, at 198-199.  Moreover, it ignores the role of the Supreme Court of Georgia which reviews each death sentence to determine whether it is proportional to other sentences imposed for similar crimes.  Since the proportionality requirement on review is intended to prevent caprice in the decision to inflict the penalty, the isolated decision of a jury to afford mercy does not render unconstitutional death sentences imposed on defendants who were sentenced under a system that does not create a substantial risk of arbitrariness or caprice.  The petitioner objects, finally, to the wide scope of evidence and argument allowed at presentence hearings.  We think that the Georgia court wisely has chosen not to impose unnecessary restrictions on the evidence that can be offered at such a hearing and to approve open and far-ranging argument.  See, e. g., Brown v. State, 235 Ga. 644 , 220 S. E. 2d 922 (1975).

 The court therefore vacated Gregg's death sentences for armed robbery and has followed a similar course in every other armed robbery death penalty case to come before it.  See Floyd v. State, 233 Ga. 280, 285 , 210 S. E. 2d 810, 814 (1974); Jarrell v. State, 234 Ga., at 424-425, 216 S. E. 2d, at 270 .  See Dorsey v. State, 236 Ga. 591 , 225 S. E. 2d 418 (1976).  The provision for appellate review in the Georgia capital-sentencing system serves as a check against the random or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty.  In particular, the proportionality review substantially eliminates the possibility that a person will be sentenced to die by the action of an aberrant jury.  If a time comes when juries generally do not impose the death sentence in a certain kind of murder case, the appellate review procedures assure that no defendant convicted under such circumstances will suffer a sentence of death.  V The basic concern of <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> centered on those defendants who were being condemned to death capriciously and arbitrarily.  Under the procedures before the Court in that case, sentencing authorities were not directed to give attention to the nature or circumstances of the crime committed or to the character or record of the defendant.  Left unguided, juries imposed the death sentence in a way that could only be called freakish.  The new Georgia sentencing procedures, by contrast, focus the jury’s attention on the particularized nature of the crime and the particularized characteristics of the individual defendant.  While the jury is permitted to consider any aggravating or mitigating circumstances, it must find and identify at least one statutory aggravating factor before it may impose a penalty of death.  In this way the jury's discretion is channeled.  No longer *207 can a jury wantonly and freakishly impose the death sentence; it is always circumscribed by the legislative guidelines.  In addition, the review function of the Supreme Court of Georgia affords additional assurance that the concerns that prompted our decision in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> are not present to any significant degree in the Georgia procedure applied here.  For the reasons expressed in this opinion, we hold that the statutory system under which Gregg was sentenced to death does not violate the Constitution.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Georgia Supreme Court is affirmed.  It is so ordered.  On cross-examination the State introduced a letter written by the petitioner to Allen entitled, “[a] statement for you,” with the instructions that Allen memorize and then burn it.  The statement was consistent with the petitioner’s testimony at trial. The court further held, in part, that the trial court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury with respect to voluntary manslaughter since there was no evidence to support that verdict.  Subsequent to the trial in this case limited portions of the Georgia statute were amended.

 Georgia Code Ann. §26-1101 (1972) provides: “(a) A person commits murder when he unlawfully and with malice aforethought, either express or implied, causes the death of another human being.  Express malice is that deliberate intention unlawfully to take away the life of a fellow creature, which is manifested by external circumstances capable of proof.  Malice shall be implied where no considerable provocation appears, and where all the circumstances of the killing show an abandoned and malignant heart.  “(b) A person also commits the crime of murder when in the commission of a felony he causes the death of another human being, irrespective of malice.  “(c) A person convicted of murder shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for life.” Section 26-1902 (1972) provides: “A person commits armed robbery when, with intent to commit theft, he takes property of another from the person or the immediate presence of another by use of an offensive weapon.  The offense robbery by intimidation shall be a lesser included offense in the offense of armed robbery.  A person convicted of armed robbery shall be punished by death or imprisonment for life, or by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than 20 years.” These capital felonies currently are defined as they were when <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> was decided.  The 1973 amendments to the Georgia statute, however, narrowed the class of crimes potentially punishable by death by eliminating capital perjury.  Compare § 26-2401 (Supp-1975) with §26-2401 (1972).  It is not clear whether the 1974 amendments to the Georgia statute were intended to broaden the types of evidence admissible at the presentence hearing.  Compare § 27-2503 (a) (Supp. 1975) with §27-2534 (1972) (deletion of limitation “subject to the laws of evidence”).  Essentially the same procedures are followed in the case of a guilty plea.  The judge considers the factual basis of the plea, as well as evidence in aggravation and mitigation.

 § 27-2537 (f) (Supp. 1975).  To aid the court in its disposition of these cases the statute further provides for the appointment of a special assistant and authorizes the employment of additional staff members.  §§ 27-2537 (f)-(h) (Supp. 1975).  See Ga. Const., Art. 5, §1, ¶12, Ga. Code Ann. §2-3011 (1973); Ga. Code Ann. §§77-501 , 77-511, 77-513 (1973 and Supp. 1975) (Board of Pardons and Paroles is authorized to commute sentence of death except in eases where Governor refuses to suspend that sentence).

Since five Justices wrote separately in support of the judgments in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds — Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice White.  See n. 36, infra.  <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 316-328</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring).  This conclusion derives primarily from statements made during the debates in the various state conventions called to ratify the Federal Constitution.  For example, Virginia delegate Patrick Henry objected vehemently to the lack of a provision banning “cruel and unusual punishments”: “What has distinguished our ancestors?  — That they would not admit of tortures, or cruel and barbarous punishment.  But Congress may introduce the practice of the civil law, in preference to that of the common law. They may introduce the practice of France, Spain, and Germany — of torturing, to extort a confession of the crime.” 3 J. Elliot, Debates 447-448 (1863).  A similar objection was made in the Massachusetts convention: “They are nowhere restrained from inventing the most cruel and unheard-of punishments and annexing them to crimes; and there is no constitutional check on them, but that racks and gibbets may be amongst the most mild instruments of their discipline.” 2 Elliot, supra, at 111.  The Court remarked on the fact that the law under review “has come to us from a government of a different form and genius from ours,” but it also noted that the punishments it inflicted “would have those bad attributes even if they were found in a Federal enactment and not taken from an alien source.” 217 U. S., at 377 .  Although legislative measures adopted by the people’s chosen representatives provide one important means of ascertaining contemporary values, it is evident that legislative judgments alone cannot be determinative of Eighth Amendment standards since that Amendment was intended to safeguard individuals from the abuse of legislative power.  See Weems v. United States, 217 U. S. 349, 371-373 (1910); <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 258-269</citedDecision> (Brennak, J., concurring).  Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962), illustrates the proposition that penal laws enacted by state legislatures may violate the Eighth Amendment because “in the light of contemporary human knowledge” they “would doubtless be universally thought to be an infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.” Id., at 666 .  At the time of Robinson nine States in addition to California had criminal laws that punished addiction similar to the law declared unconstitutional in Robinson .

Report of the Governor’s Study Commission on Capital Punishment 43 (Pa. 1973), The number of prisoners who received death sentences in the years from 1961 to 1972 varied from a high of 140 in 1961 to a low of 75 in 1972, with wide fluctuations in the intervening years: 103 in 1962; 93 in 1963; 106 in 1964; 86 in 1965; 118 in 1966; 85 in 1967; 102 in 1968; 97 in 1969; 127 in 1970; and 104 in 1971.  Department of Justice, National Prisoner Statistics Bulletin, Capital Punishment 1971-1972, p. 20 (Dec. 1974).

Department of Justice, National Prisoner Statistics Bulletin, Capital Punishment 1974, pp. 1, 26-27 (Nov. 1975), Another purpose that has been discussed is the incapacitation of dangerous criminals and the consequent prevention of crimes that they may otherwise commit in the future.

Lord Justice Denning, Master of the Rolls of the Court of Appeal in England, spoke to this effect before the British Royal Commission on Capital Punishment: “Punishment is the way in which society expresses its denunciation of wrong doing: and, in order to maintain respect for law, it is essential that the punishment inflicted for grave crimes should adequately reflect the revulsion felt by the great majority of citizens for them.  It is a mistake to consider the objects of punishment as being deterrent or reformative or preventive and nothing else.... The truth is that some crimes are so outrageous that society insists on adequate punishment, because the wrong-doer deserves it, irrespective of whether it is a deterrent or not.” Royal Commission on Capital -Punishment, Minutes of Evidence, Dec. 1, 1949, p. 207 (1950).

 8932.  Other types of calculated murders, apparently occurring with increasing frequency, include the use of bombs or other means of indiscriminate killings, the extortion murder of hostages or kidnap victims, and the execution-style killing of witnesses to a crime.  We have been shown no statistics breaking down the total number of murders into the categories described above.  The overall trend in the number of murders committed in the nation, however, has been upward for some time.  In 1964, reported murders totaled an estimated 9,250.  During the ensuing decade, the number reported increased 123%, until it totaled approximately 20,600 in 1974.  In 1972, the year <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> was announced, the total estimated was 18,-520.  Despite a fractional decrease in 1975 as compared with 1974, the number of murders increased in the three years immediately following <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> to approximately 20,400, an increase of almost 10%.  See FBI, Uniform Crime Reports, for 1964, 1972, 1974, and 1975, Preliminary Annual Release.  We do not address here the question whether the taking of the criminal's life is a proportionate sanction where no victim has been deprived of life — for example, when capital punishment is imposed for rape, kidnaping, or armed robbery that does not result in the death of any human being.  This view was expressed by other Members of the Court who concurred in the judgments.  See <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 255-257</citedDecision> (Douglas, J.); <citedDecision>id., at 291-295</citedDecision> (Brennan, J.).  The dissenters viewed this concern as the basis for the <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> decision: “The decisive grievance of the opinions ... is that the present system of discretionary sentencing in capital cases has failed to produce evenhanded justice; .  .  .  that the selection process has followed no rational pattern.” Id., at 398-399 (Burger, C. J., dissenting).  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure require as a matter of course that a presentence report containing information about a defendant’s background be prepared for use by the sentencing judge. Rule 32(c).  The importance of obtaining accurate sentencing information is underscored by the Rule’s direction to the sentencing court to “afford the defendant or his counsel an opportunity to comment [on the report] and, at the discretion of the court, to introduce testimony or other information relating to any alleged factual inaccuracy contained in the presentence report.” Rule 32 (c) (3) (A).  Indeed, we hold elsewhere today that in capital cases it is constitutionally required that the sentencing authority have information *190 sufficient to enable it to consider the character and individual circumstances of a defendant prior to imposition of a death sentence.

 “(f) The defendant acted under duress or under the domination of another person.  “ (g) At the time of the murder, the capacity of the defendant to appreciate the criminality [wrongfulness] of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was impaired as a result of mental disease or defect or intoxication.  "(h) The youth of the defendant at the time of the crime.” ALI Model Penal Code §210.6 (Proposed Official Draft 1962).  As Mr. Justice Brennan noted in McGautha v. California, supra, at 285-286 (dissenting opinion): “[E]ven if a State’s notion of wise capital sentencing policy is such that the policy cannot be implemented through a formula capable of mechanical application .  .  .  there is no reason that it should not give some guidance to those called upon to render decision.” A system could have standards so vague that they would fail adequately to channel the sentencing decision patterns of juries with the result that a pattern of arbitrary and capricious sentencing like that found unconstitutional in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> could occur.  In McGautha v. California, supra, this Court held that the *196 Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not require that a jury be provided with standards to guide its decision whether to recommend a sentence of life imprisonment or death or that the capital-sentencing proceeding be separated from the guilt-determination process.  McGautha was not an Eighth Amendment decision, and to the extent it purported to deal with Eighth Amendment concerns, it must be read in light of the opinions in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. Georgia.  There the Court ruled that death sentences imposed under statutes that left juries with untrammeled discretion to impose or withhold the death penalty violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  While <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> did not overrule Mc-Gautha, it is clearly in substantial tension with a broad reading of McGautha’s holding.  In view of Furman, McGautha can be viewed rationally as a precedent only for the proposition that standardless jury sentencing procedures were not employed in the cases there before the Court so as to violate the Due Process Clause.  We note that McGautha!s assumption that it is not possible to devise standards to guide and regularize jury sentencing in capital cases has been undermined by subsequent experience.  In view of that experience and the considerations set forth in the text, we adhere to Furman’s determination that where the ultimate punishment of death is at issue ■ a system of standardless jury discretion violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The text of the statute enumerating the various aggravating circumstances is set out at n. 9, supra. See Moore v. State, 233 Ga. 861, 865 , 213 S. E. 2d 829, 832 (1975).  The petitioner’s argument is nothing more than a veiled contention that <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> indirectly outlawed capital punishment by placing totally unrealistic conditions on its use.  In order to repair the alleged defects pointed to by the petitioner, it would be necessary to require that prosecuting authorities charge a capital offense whenever arguably there had been a capital murder and that they *200 refuse to plea bargain with, the defendant.  If a jury refused to convict even though the evidence supported the charge, its verdict would have to be reversed and a verdict of guilty entered or a new trial ordered, since the discretionary act of jury nullification would not be permitted.  Finally, acts of executive clemency would have to be prohibited.  Such a system, of course, would be totally alien to our notions of criminal justice.  Moreover, it would be unconstitutional.  Such a system in many respects would have the vices of the mandatory death penalty statutes we hold unconstitutional today in Woodson v. North Carolina, post, p. 280, and Roberts v. Louisiana, post, p. 325.

**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Marshall, dissenting.  * In Furman v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S. 238, 314</citedDecision> (1972) (concurring opinion), I set forth at some length my views on the basic issue presented to the Court in these cases. The death penalty, I concluded, is a cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  That continues to be my view.  I have no intention of retracing the “long and tedious journey,” <citedDecision>id., at 370</citedDecision> , that led to my conclusion in Fur-man.  My sole purposes here are to consider the suggestion that my conclusion in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> has been undercut by developments since then, and briefly to evaluate the basis for my Brethren’s holding that the extinction of life is a permissible form of punishment under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause.  In <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> I concluded that the death penalty is constitutionally invalid for two reasons.  First, the death penalty is excessive.  <citedDecision>Id., at 331-332</citedDecision> ; 342-359.  And *232 second, the American people, fully informed as to the purposes of the death penalty and its liabilities, would in my view reject it as morally unacceptable.  <citedDecision>Id., at 360-369</citedDecision> .  Since the decision in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , the legislatures of 35 States have enacted new statutes authorizing the imposition of the death sentence for certain crimes, and Congress has enacted a law providing the death penalty for air piracy resulting in death.  49 U. S. C. §§ 1472 (i), (n) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  I would be less than candid if I did not acknowledge that these developments have a significant bearing on a realistic assessment of the moral acceptability of the death penalty to the American people.  But if the constitutionality of the death penalty turns, as I have urged, on the opinion of an informed citizenry, then even the enactment of new death statutes cannot be viewed as conclusive.  In <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , I observed that the American people are largely unaware of the information critical to a judgment on the morality of the death penalty, and concluded that if they were better informed they would consider it shocking, unjust, and unacceptable.  <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 360-369</citedDecision> .  A recent study, conducted after the enactment of the post-Furman statutes, has confirmed that the American people know little about the death penalty, and that the opinions of an informed public would differ significantly from those of a public unaware of the consequences and effects of the death penalty.  1 Even assuming, however, that the post -Furman enactment of statutes authorizing the death penalty renders the prediction of the views of an informed citizenry an *233 uncertain basis for a constitutional decision, the enactment of those statutes has no bearing whatsoever on the conclusion that the death penalty is unconstitutional because it is excessive.  An excessive penalty is invalid under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause “even though popular sentiment may favor” it.  <citedDecision>Id., at 331</citedDecision> ; ante, at 173, 182-183 (opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); Roberts v. Louisiana, post, at 353-354 (White, ' J., dissenting).  The inquiry here, then, is simply whether the death penalty is necessary to accomplish the legitimate legislative purposes in punishment, or whether a less severe penalty — life imprisonment — would do as well.  <citedDecision>Furman, supra, at 342</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring).  The two purposes that sustain the death penalty as nonexcessive in the Court’s view are general deterrence and retribution.  In <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , I canvassed the relevant data on the deterrent effect of capital punishment.  <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 347-354</citedDecision> .  2 The state of knowledge at that point, after literally centuries of debate, was summarized as follows by a United Nations Committee: “It is generally agreed between the retentionists and abolitionists, whatever their opinions about the validity of comparative studies of deterrence, that the data which now exist show no correlation between the existence of capital punishment and lower rates of capital crime.” 3 The available evidence, I concluded in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , was convincing that “capital punishment is not necessary as a deterrent to crime in our society.” <citedDecision>Id., at 353</citedDecision> .  The Solicitor General in his amicus brief in these cases *234 relies heavily on a study by Isaac Ehrlich, 4 reported a year after <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , to support the contention that the death penalty does deter murder.  Since the Ehrlich study was not available at the time of <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> and since it is the first scientific study to suggest that the death penalty may have a deterrent effect, I will briefly consider its import.  The Ehrlich study focused on the relationship in the Nation as a whole between the homicide rate and “execution risk” — the fraction of persons convicted of murder who were actually executed.  Comparing the differences in homicide rate and execution risk for the years 1933 to 1969, Ehrlich found that increases in execution risk were associated with increases in the homicide rate.  5 But when he employed the statistical technique of multiple regression analysis to control for the influence of other variables posited to have an impact on the homicide rate, 6 Ehrlich found a negative correlation between changes in the homicide rate and changes in execution risk.  His tentative conclusion was that for the period from 1933 to 1967 each additional execution in the United States might have saved eight lives.  7 The methods and conclusions of the Ehrlich study *235 have been severely criticized on a number of grounds.  8 It has been suggested, for example, that the study is defective because it compares execution and homicide rates on a nationwide, rather than a state-by-state, basis.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 9 The most compelling criticism of the Ehrlich study is *236 that its conclusions are extremely sensitive to the choice of the time period included in the regression analysis.  Analysis of Ehrlich’s data reveals that all empirical support for the deterrent effect of capital'punishment disappears when the five most recent years are removed from his time series — that is to say, whether a decrease in the execution risk corresponds to an increase or a-decrease in the murder rate depends on the ending point of the sample period.  10 This finding has east severe doubts on the reliability of Ehrlich’s tentative conclusions.  11 Indeed, a recent regression study, based on Ehrlich’s theoretical model but using cross-section state data for the years 1950 and 1960, found no support for the conclusion that executions act as a deterrent.  12 The Ehrlich study, in short, is of little, if any, assistance in assessing the deterrent impact of the death penalty.  Accord, Commonwealth v. O’Neal, -Mass. -, -, 339 N. E. 2d 676, 684 (1975).  The evidence I reviewed in Furman 13 remains convincing, in my view, that “capital punishment is not necessary as a deterrent to crime in our society.” <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 353</citedDecision> .  The justification for the death penalty must be found elsewhere.  The other principal purpose said to be served by the death penalty is retribution.  14 The notion that retribu *237 tion can serve as a moral justification for the sanction of death finds credence in the opinion of my Brothers Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, and that of my Brother White in Roberts v. Louisiana, post, p. 337.  See also <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 394-395</citedDecision> (Burger, C. J., dissenting).  It is this notion that I find to be the most disturbing aspect of today’s unfortunate decisions.  The concept of retribution is a multifaceted one, and any discussion of its role in the criminal law must be undertaken with caution.  On one level, it can be said that the notion of retribution or reprobation is the basis of our insistence that only those who have broken the law be punished, and in this sense the notion is quite obviously central to a just system of criminal sanctions.  But our recognition that retribution plays a crucial role in determining who may be punished by no means requires approval of retribution as a general justification for punishment.  15 It is the question whether retribution can provide a moral justification for punishment — in particular, capital punishment — that we must consider.  My Brothers Stewart, Powell, and Stevens offer the following explanation of the retributive justification for capital punishment: “ ‘The instinct for retribution is part of the nature of man, and channeling that instinct in the administration of criminal justice serves an important purpose in promoting the stability of a society governed *238 by law. When people begin to believe that organized society is unwilling or unable to impose upon criminal offenders the punishment they 'deserve/ then there are sown the seeds of anarchy — of self-help, vigilante justice, and lynch law.’ ” Ante, at 183, quoting from <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Georgia, supra, at 308</citedDecision> (Stewart, J., concurring).  This statement is wholly inadequate to justify the death penalty.  As my Brother Brennan stated in <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , “[t]here is no evidence whatever that utilization of imprisonment rather than death encourages private blood feuds and other disorders.” <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 303</citedDecision> (concurring opinion).  16 It simply defies belief to suggest that the death penalty is necessary to prevent the American people from taking the law into their own.  hands.  In a related vein, it may be suggested that the expression of moral outrage through the imposition of the death penalty serves to reinforce basic moral values— that it marks some crimes as particularly offensive and therefore to be avoided.  The argument is akin to a deterrence argument, but differs in that it contemplates the individual’s shrinking from antisocial conduct, not because he fears punishment, but because he has been told in the strongest possible way that the conduct is wrong.  This contention, like the previous one, provides no support for the death penalty.  It is inconceivable that any individual concerned about conforming his conduct to what society says is “right” would fail to realize that murder is “wrong” if the penalty were simply life imprisonment.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 17 Some of the language of the opinion of my Brothers Stewart, Powell, and Stevens in No. 74-6257 appears positively to embrace this notion of retribution for its own sake as a justification for capital punishment.  18 They state: “[T]he decision that capital punishment may be the appropriate sanction in extreme cases is an expression of the community’s belief that certain crimes are themselves so grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death.” Ante, at 184 (footnote omitted).  *240 They then quote with approval from Lord Justice Denning’s remarks before the British Royal Commission on Capital Punishment: “ 'The truth is that some crimes are so outrageous that society insists on adequate punishment, because the wrong-doer deserves it, irrespective of whether it is a deterrent or not.’ ” Ante, at 184 n. 30.  Of course, it may be that these statements are intended as no more than observations as to the popular demands that it is thought must be responded to in order to prevent anarchy.  But the implication of the statements appears to me to be quite different — namely, that society’s judgment that the murderer “deserves” death must be respected not simply because the preservation of order requires it, but because it is appropriate that society make the judgment and carry it out.  It is this latter notion, in particular, that I consider to be fundamentally at odds with the Eighth Amendment.  See <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> v. Georgia, <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 343-345</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring).  The mere fact that the community demands the murderer’s life in return for the evil he has done cannot sustain the death penalty, for as Justices Stewart, Powell, and Stevens remind us, “the Eighth Amendment demands more than that a challenged punishment be acceptable to contemporary society.” Ante, at 182.  To be sustained under the Eighth Amendment, the death penalty must “eompor[t] with the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the Amendment,” ibid.; the objective in imposing it must be “[consistent] with our respect for the dignity of [other] men.” Ante, at 183.  See Trop v. Dulles, 356 U. S. 86, 100 (1958) (plurality opinion).  Under these standards, the taking of life “because the wrongdoer deserves it” surely must *241 fall, for such a punishment has as its very basis the total denial of the wrongdoer’s dignity and worth.  19 The death penalty, unnecessary to promote the goal of deterrence or to further any legitimate notion of retribution, is an excessive penalty forbidden by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.  I respectfully dissent from the Court’s judgment upholding the sentences of death imposed upon the petitioners in these cases. [This opinion applies also to No. 75-5706, Proffitt v. Florida, post, p. 242, and No. 75-5394, Jurek v. Texas, post, p. 262.]

I respectfully dissent from the Court’s judgment upholding the sentences of death imposed upon the petitioners in these cases. [This opinion applies also to No. 75-5706, Proffitt v. Florida, post, p. 242, and No. 75-5394, Jurek v. Texas, post, p. 262.]

In <citedDecision>Furman</citedDecision> , I considered several additional purposes arguably served by the death penalty.  <citedDecision>408 U. S., at 314, 342, 355-358</citedDecision> .  The only additional purpose mentioned in the opinions in, these cases is specific deterrence — preventing the murderer from com *237 mitting another crime.  Surely life imprisonment and, if necessary, solitary confinement would fully accomplish- this purpose.  Accord, Commonwealth v. O’Neal, — Mass. —, —, 339 N. E. 2d 676, 685 (1975); People v.
