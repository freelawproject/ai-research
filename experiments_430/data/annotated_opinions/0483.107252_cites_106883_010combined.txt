The cases before us raise questions which go to the roots of our concepts of American criminal jurisprudence: the restraints society must observe consistent with the Federal Constitution in prosecuting individuals for crime.  More specifically, we deal with the admissibility of statements obtained from an individual who is subjected to custodial police interrogation and the necessity for procedures which assure that the individual is accorded his privilege under the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution not to be compelled to incriminate himself.  *440 We dealt with certain phases of this problem recently in Escobedo v. Illinois, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 478</citedDecision> (1964).  There, as in the four cases before us, law enforcement officials took the defendant into custody and interrogated him in a police station for the purpose of obtaining a confession.  The police did not effectively advise him of his right to remain silent or of his right to consult with his attorney.  Rather, they confronted him with an alleged accomplice who accused him of having perpetrated a murder.  When the defendant denied the accusation and said "I didn't shoot Manuel, you did it," they handcuffed him and took him to an interrogation room.  There, while handcuffed and standing, he was questioned for four hours until he confessed.  During this interrogation, the police denied his request to speak to his attorney, and they prevented his retained attorney, who had come to the police station, from consulting with him.
**Combined Opinion**
 We held that the statements thus made were constitutionally inadmissible.  This case has been the subject of judicial interpretation and spirited legal debate since it was decided two years ago.  Both state and federal courts, in assessing its implications, have arrived at varying conclusions.  [1] A wealth of scholarly material has been written tracing its ramifications and underpinnings.  [2] Police and prosecutor *441 have speculated on its range and desirability.  [3] We granted certiorari in these cases, 382 U. S. 924 , 925, 937, in order further to explore some facets of the problems, thus exposed, of applying the privilege against self-incrimination to in-custody interrogation, and to give *442 concrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow.  We start here, as we did in <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> , with the premise that our holding is not an innovation in our jurisprudence, but is an application of principles long recognized and applied in other settings.  We have undertaken a thorough re-examination of the <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> decision and the principles it announced, and we reaffirm it.  That case was but an explication of basic rights that are enshrined in our Constitutionthat "No person .  .  .  shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself," and that "the accused shall .  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 Under any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and power.  Its general principles would have little value and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas.  Rights declared in words might be lost in reality.  And this has been recognized.  The *444 meaning and vitality of the Constitution have developed against narrow and restrictive construction." This was the spirit in which we delineated, in meaningful language, the manner in which the constitutional rights of the individual could be enforced against overzealous police practices.  It was necessary in <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> , as here, to insure that what was proclaimed in the Constitution had not become but a "form of words," Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, 251 U. S. 385, 392 (1920), in the hands of government officials.  And it is in this spirit, consistent with our role as judges, that we adhere to the principles of <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> today.  Our holding will be spelled out with some specificity in the pages which follow but briefly stated it is this: the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.  By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.  [4] As for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are required.  Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.  The defendant may waive effectuation of these rights, provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.  If, however, he indicates in any manner and at any stage of the *445 process that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking there can be no questioning.
**Combined Opinion**
 Patience and persistence, at times relentless questioning, are employed.  To obtain a confession, the interrogator must "patiently maneuver himself or his quarry into a position from which the desired objective may be attained." [23] When normal procedures fail to produce the needed result, the police may resort to deceptive stratagems such as giving false legal advice.  It is important to keep the subject off balance, for example, by trading on his insecurity about himself or his surroundings.  The police then persuade, trick, or cajole him out of exercising his constitutional rights.  Even without employing brutality, the "third degree" or the specific stratagems described above, the very fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on individual liberty and trades on the weakness of individuals.  [24] *456 This fact may be illustrated simply by referring to three confession cases decided by this Court in the Term immediately preceding our <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> decision.  In Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963), the defendant was a 19-year-old heroin addict, described as a "near mental defective," id., at 307-310 .  The defendant in Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 (1963), was a woman who confessed to the arresting officer after being importuned to "cooperate" in order to prevent her children from being taken by relief authorities.  This Court as in those cases reversed the conviction of a defendant in Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963), whose persistent request during his interrogation was to phone his wife or attorney.  [25] In other settings, these individuals might have exercised their constitutional rights.  In the incommunicado police-dominated atmosphere, they succumbed.  In the cases before us today, given this background, we concern ourselves primarily with this interrogation atmosphere and the evils it can bring.
**Combined Opinion**
 In McNabb, 318 U. S., at 343-344 , and in Mallory, 354 U. S., at 455-456 , we recognized both the dangers of interrogation and the appropriateness of prophylaxis stemming from the very fact of interrogation itself.  [32] Our decision in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 (1964), necessitates an examination of the scope of the privilege in state cases as well.  In Malloy , we squarely held the *464 privilege applicable to the States, and held that the substantive standards underlying the privilege applied with full force to state court proceedings.  There, as in Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U. S. 52 (1964), and Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965), we applied the existing Fifth Amendment standards to the case before us.  Aside from the holding itself, the reasoning in Malloy made clear what had already become apparentthat the substantive and procedural safeguards surrounding admissibility of confessions in state cases had become exceedingly exacting, reflecting all the policies embedded in the privilege, 378 U. S., at 7-8.  [33] The voluntariness doctrine in the state cases, as Malloy indicates, encompasses all interrogation practices which are likely to exert such pressure upon an individual as to disable him from *465 making a free and rational choice.  [34] The implications of this proposition were elaborated in our decision in Escobedo v. Illinois, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 478</citedDecision> , decided one week after Malloy applied the privilege to the States.  Our holding there stressed the fact that the police had not advised the defendant of his constitutional privilege to remain silent at the outset of the interrogation, and we drew attention to that fact at several points in the decision, 378 U. S., at 483, 485, 491.  This was no isolated factor, but an essential ingredient in our decision.  The entire thrust of police interrogation there, as in all the cases today, was to put the defendant in such an emotional state as to impair his capacity for rational judgment.  The abdication of the constitutional privilege the choice on his part to speak to the policewas not made knowingly or competently because of the failure to apprise him of his rights; the compelling atmosphere of the in-custody interrogation, and not an independent decision on his part, caused the defendant to speak.  A different phase of the <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> decision was significant in its attention to the absence of counsel during the questioning.  There, as in the cases today, we sought a protective device to dispel the compelling atmosphere of the interrogation.  In <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> , however, the police did not relieve the defendant of the anxieties which they had created in the interrogation rooms.  Rather, they denied his request for the assistance of counsel, 378 U. S., at 481, 488, 491.  [35] This heightened his dilemma, and *466 made his later statements the product of this compulsion.  Cf. Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 514 (1963).  The denial of the defendant's request for his attorney thus undermined his ability to exercise the privilege to remain silent if he chose or to speak without any intimidation, blatant or subtle.  The presence of counsel, in all the cases before us today, would be the adequate protective device necessary to make the process of police interrogation conform to the dictates of the privilege.  His presence would insure that statements made in the government-established atmosphere are not the product of compulsion.  It was in this manner that <citedDecision>Escobedo</citedDecision> explicated another facet of the pre-trial privilege, noted in many of the Court's prior decisions: the protection of rights at trial. [36] That counsel is present when statements are taken from an individual during interrogation obviously enhances the integrity of the fact-finding processes in court. The presence of an attorney, and the warnings delivered to the individual, enable the defendant under otherwise compelling circumstances to tell his story without fear, effectively, and in a way that eliminates the evils in the interrogation process.  Without the protections flowing from adequate warnings and the rights of counsel, "all the careful safeguards erected around the giving of testimony, whether by an accused or any other witness, would become empty formalities in a procedure where the most compelling possible evidence of guilt, a confession, would have already been obtained at the unsupervised pleasure of the police." Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 685 (1961) (HARLAN, J., dissenting).  Cf. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400 (1965).  *467 III. Today, then, there can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings and serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves.  We have concluded that without proper safeguards the process of in-custody interrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely.  In order to combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.
**Combined Opinion**
 Our aim is to assure that the individual's right to choose between silence and speech remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process.  A once-stated warning, delivered by those who will conduct the interrogation, cannot itself suffice to that end among those who most require knowledge of their rights.  A mere *470 warning given by the interrogators is not alone sufficient to accomplish that end.  Prosecutors themselves claim that the admonishment of the right to remain silent without more "will benefit only the recidivist and the professional." Brief for the National District Attorneys Association as amicus curiae, p. 14.  Even preliminary advice given to the accused by his own attorney can be swiftly overcome by the secret interrogation process.  Cf. Escobedo v. Illinois, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 478, 485, n. 5</citedDecision> .  Thus, the need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege comprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present during any questioning if the defendant so desires.  The presence of counsel at the interrogation may serve several significant subsidiary functions as well.  If the accused decides to talk to his interrogators, the assistance of counsel can mitigate the dangers of untrustworthiness.  With a lawyer present the likelihood that the police will practice coercion is reduced, and if coercion is nevertheless exercised the lawyer can testify to it in court. The presence of a lawyer can also help to guarantee that the accused gives a fully accurate statement to the police and that the statement is rightly reported by the prosecution at trial. See Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 443-448 (1958) (DOUGLAS, J., dissenting).  An individual need not make a pre-interrogation request for a lawyer.  While such request affirmatively secures his right to have one, his failure to ask for a lawyer does not constitute a waiver.
**Combined Opinion**
 These statements are incriminating in any meaningful sense of the word and may not be used without the full warnings and effective waiver required for any other statement.  In Escobedo itself, the defendant fully intended his accusation of another as the slayer to be exculpatory as to himself.  The principles announced today deal with the protection which must be given to the privilege against self-incrimination when the individual is first subjected to police interrogation while in custody at the station or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.  It is at this point that our adversary system of criminal proceedings commences, distinguishing itself at the outset from the inquisitorial system recognized in some countries.  Under the system of warnings we delineate today or under any other system which may be devised and found effective, the safeguards to be erected about the privilege must come into play at this point.  Our decision is not intended to hamper the traditional function of police officers in investigating crime.  See Escobedo v. Illinois, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 478, 492</citedDecision> .  When an individual is in custody on probable cause, the police may, of course, seek out evidence in the field to be used at trial against him.  Such investigation may include inquiry of persons not under restraint.  General on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the fact-finding process is not affected by our holding.  It is an act of *478 responsible citizenship for individuals to give whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement.  In such situations the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation is not necessarily present.  [46] In dealing with statements obtained through interrogation, we do not purport to find all confessions inadmissible.
**Combined Opinion**
 Moreover, the examples of police brutality mentioned by the Court [2] are rare exceptions to the thousands of cases *500 that appear every year in the law reports. The police agenciesall the way from municipal and state forces to the federal bureausare responsible for law enforcement and public safety in this country.  I am proud of their efforts, which in my view are not fairly characterized by the Court's opinion.  I.  The ipse dixit of the majority has no support in our cases. Indeed, the Court admits that "we might not find the defendants' statements [here] to have been involuntary in traditional terms." Ante, p. 457.  In short, the Court has added more to the requirements that the accused is entitled to consult with his lawyer and that he must be given the traditional warning that he may remain silent and that anything that he says may be used against him.  Escobedo v. Illinois, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 478, 490-491</citedDecision> (1964).  Now, the Court fashions a constitutional rule that the police may engage in no custodial interrogation without additionally advising the accused that he has a right under the Fifth Amendment to the presence of counsel during interrogation and that, if he is without funds, counsel will be furnished him.  When at any point during an interrogation the accused seeks affirmatively or impliedly to invoke his rights to silence or counsel, interrogation must be forgone or postponed.  The Court further holds that failure to follow the new procedures requires inexorably the exclusion of any statement by the accused, as well as the fruits thereof.  Such a strict constitutional specific inserted at the nerve center of crime detection may well kill the patient.  [3] *501 Since there is at this time a paucity of information and an almost total lack of empirical knowledge on the practical operation of requirements truly comparable to those announced by the majority, I would be more restrained lest we go too far too fast.  II.
**Combined Opinion**
 While a later case said the Fifth Amendment privilege controlled admissibility, this proposition was not itself developed in subsequent decisions.  [2] The Court did, however, heighten the test of admissibility in federal trials to one of voluntariness "in fact," Wan v. *507 United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14 (quoted, ante, p. 462), and then by and large left federal judges to apply the same standards the Court began to derive in a string of state court cases. This new line of decisions, testing admissibility by the Due Process Clause, began in 1936 with Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278 , and must now embrace somewhat more than 30 full opinions of the Court. [3] While the voluntariness rubric was repeated in many instances, e. g., Lyons v. Oklahoma, 322 U. S. 596 , the Court never pinned it down to a single meaning but on the contrary infused it with a number of different values.  To travel quickly over the main themes, there was an initial emphasis on reliability, e. g., Ward v. Texas, 316 U. S. 547 , supplemented by concern over the legality and fairness of the police practices, e. g., Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 , in an "accusatorial" system of law enforcement, Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 54 , and eventually by close attention to the individual's state of mind and capacity for effective choice, e. g., Gallegos v. Colorado, 370 U. S. 49 .  The outcome was a continuing re-evaluation on the facts of each case of how much pressure on the suspect was permissible.  [4] *508 Among the criteria often taken into account were threats or imminent danger, e. g., Payne v. Arkansas, 356 U. S. 560 , physical deprivations such as lack of sleep or food, e. g., Reck v. Pate, 367 U. S. 433 , repeated or extended interrogation, e. g., Chambers v. Florida, 309 U. S. 227 , limits on access to counsel or friends, Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 ; Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , length and illegality of detention under state law, e. g., Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 , and individual weakness or incapacities, Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 .  Apart from direct physical coercion, however, no single default or fixed combination of defaults guaranteed exclusion, and synopses of the cases would serve little use because the overall gauge has been steadily changing, usually in the direction of restricting admissibility.  But to mark just what point had been reached before the Court jumped the rails in Escobedo v. Illinois, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 478</citedDecision> , it is worth capsulizing the then-recent case of Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 .  There, Haynes had been held some 16 or more hours in violation of state law before signing the disputed confession, had received no warnings of any kind, and despite requests had been refused access to his wife or to counsel, the police indicating that access would be allowed after a confession.  Emphasizing especially this last inducement and rejecting some contrary indicia of voluntariness, the Court in a 5-to-4 decision held the confession inadmissible.  There are several relevant lessons to be drawn from this constitutional history.  The first is that with over 25 years of precedent the Court has developed an elaborate, sophisticated, and sensitive approach to admissibility of confessions.  It is "judicial" in its treatment of one case at a time, see Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 635 (concurring opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE), flexible in its ability to respond to the endless mutations of fact presented, and ever more familiar to the lower courts.  *509 Of course, strict certainty is not obtained in this developing process, but this is often so with constitutional principles, and disagreement is usually confined to that borderland of close cases where it matters least.
**Combined Opinion**
 More than the human dignity of the accused is involved; the human personality of others in the society must also be preserved.  Thus the values reflected by the privilege are not the sole desideratum; society's interest in the general security is of equal weight.  The obvious underpinning of the Court's decision is a deep-seated distrust of all confessions.  As the Court declares that the accused may not be interrogated without counsel present, absent a waiver of the right to counsel, and as the Court all but admonishes the lawyer to *538 advise the accused to remain silent, the result adds up to a judicial judgment that evidence from the accused should not be used against him in any way, whether compelled or not.  This is the not so subtle overtone of the opinionthat it is inherently wrong for the police to gather evidence from the accused himself.  And this is precisely the nub of this dissent.  I see nothing wrong or immoral, and certainly nothing unconstitutional, in the police's asking a suspect whom they have reasonable cause to arrest whether or not he killed his wife or in confronting him with the evidence on which the arrest was based, at least where he has been plainly advised that he may remain completely silent, see Escobedo v. Illinois, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 478, 499</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  Until today, "the admissions or confessions of the prisoner, when voluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence." Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 596 ; see also Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 584-585 .  Particularly when corroborated, as where the police have confirmed the accused's disclosure of the hiding place of implements or fruits of the crime, such confessions have the highest reliability and significantly contribute to the certitude with which we may believe the accused is guilty.  Moreover, it is by no means certain that the process of confessing is injurious to the accused.  To the contrary it may provide psychological relief and enhance the prospects for rehabilitation.  This is not to say that the value of respect for the inviolability of the accused's individual personality should be accorded no weight or that all confessions should be indiscriminately admitted.
