 This seems doubtful, in view of the very narrow purpose of Randolph’s proposal, namely, that federal courts of equity should not interfere with the enforcement of judgments at law rendered in the state courts.  See Taylor and Willis, The Power of Federal Courts to Enjoin Proceedings in State Courts, 42 Yale L. J. 1169, 1171, n. 14.  There is no record of any debates over the statute.  See 3 Annals of Congress (1791-93).  It has been suggested that the provision reflected the then strong feeling against the unwarranted intrusion of federal courts upon state sovereignty.  Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 , was decided on February 18, 1793, less than two weeks before the provision was enacted into law. The significance of this proximity is doubtful.  Compare Warren, Federal and State Court Interference, 43 Harv. L. Rev. 345 , 347-48, with Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, <citedDecision>200 U. S. 273, 291-92</citedDecision> .  Much more probable is the suggestion that the provision reflected the prevailing prejudices against equity jurisdiction.  The Journal of William Maclay (1927 ed.), chronicling the proceedings of the Senate while he was one of its members (1789-1791), contains abundant evidence of a widespread hostility to chancery practice.  See especially, pp. 92-94, 101-06 (debate on the bill that became Judiciary Act of 1789).  Moreover, Senator Ells-worth (soon to become Chief Justice of the United States), the principal draftsman of both the 1789 and 1793 Judiciary Acts, often indicated a dislike for equity jurisdiction.  See Brown, Life of Oliver Ellsworth (1905 ed.) 194; Journal of William Maclay (1927 ed.) 103-04; Warren, New *132 Light on the History of the Federal Judiciary Act of 1789, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 49 , 96-100.  3 Regardless of the various influences which shaped the enactment of § 5 of the Act of March 2, 1793, the purpose and direction underlying the provision are manifest from its terms: proceedings in the state courts should be free from interference by federal injunction.

 Section 262 of the Judicial Code, 36 Stat. 1162 , 28 U. S. C. § 377 , is derived from § 14 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 81 , which provided that the “courts of the United States shall have power to issue writs of scire facias, habeas corpus, and all other writs not specially provided for by the statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions, and agreeable to the principles and usages of law.” The general powers thus given to the federal courts were obviously limited by the subsequent enactment of the specific prohibitory provisions of the Act of 1793.  The first case arising under the provision was Diggs & Keith v. Wolcott, 4 Cranch 179 (1807), where the appellants brought an action at law on various promissory notes in a state court. While this action was still pending, the defendant filed a bill in the state chancery court for cancellation of the notes.  The latter suit was removed to the federal circuit court which cancelled the notes and enjoined the further prosecution of the state action at law. The report of the proceeding in this Court states merely that “the court being of opinion that a circuit court of the United States had not jurisdiction to enjoin proceedings in a state court, reversed the decree.” In his Commentaries on American Law (1826) vol. 1, p. 386, Chancellor Kent, stating that the decision in the case “is not to be contested,” refers to it as illustrative of a situation “in which any control by the federal over the state courts, other than by means of the established appellate jurisdiction, has equally been prevented.” Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 625 , holding that a federal court sitting in bankruptcy could not discharge the lien of a prior attachment made under state law, was the first case which expressly relied upon the Act of 1793.  In Orton v. Smith, 18 How. 263, 266 , the Court held it error to enjoin a state action to establish title to certain land.  “The courts of the United States have no such power over suitors in a state court.” The extent to which a federal court’s exclusive control over the res may require use of the injunction to effectuate its decrees in rem is illustrated by Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U. S. 188 ; Julian v. Central Trust Co., 193 U. S. 93 ; and Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, 292 U. S. 234, 241 .  Cf. Ex parte Baldwin, 291 U. S. 610, 615 .  For similar reasons we need not here consider cases like Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 , and Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, <citedDecision>200 U. S. 273</citedDecision> , with which compare Hale v. Bimco Trading Co., 306 U. S. 375, 378 .  The Court also held that in a foreclosure proceeding the complainant cannot join a third person who claims adversely to the mortgagor and mortgagee, and that consequently there was a misjoinder of parties.  96 U. S. at 341 .  These grounds for decision were, of course, alternative, and either alone was sufficient to dispose of the case. However, they were entirely separate and distinct, and there *138 is no basis for any inference that the Court might have upheld an injunction if Reynolds had been properly joined.  Nor need we consider common-law refinements in actions for ejectment, for the Court went explicitly on its duty to obey the Act of 1793.  Root v. Woolworth, 150 U. S. 401 , is erroneously regarded as illustrating a “relitigation” exception to § 265.  The case holds merely that courts of equity have jurisdiction to “effectuate their own decrees by injunctions or writs of assistance in order to avoid the relitigation of questions once settled between the same parties.” 150 U. S. at 411-12 .  The Court did not uphold a federal injunction against a state suit to relitigate a claim already settled by a previous federal decree — no such state suit had been brought.  Consequently, there was no occasion to consider the applicability of § 265.  The “first come, first served” rationale of cases like Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537 , was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U. S. 226, 235 .  Cf. Haines v. Carpenter, 91 U. S. 254, 257 .  There is no warrant for the assumption that, in the proposals for the Judicial Code of 1911, Congress had before it the “relitigation” exception as settled doctrine, and that by § 265 gave it legislative confirmation.  The Report of the Special Joint Committee on Revision and Codification of the Laws of the United States annotated the Act of 1793 with citations to twenty-six decisions of this Court. Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., p. 470.  Yet no reference was made to four of the five decisions of this Court prior to the *140 Judicial Code which are supposed to justify the “relitigation” doctrine: Ro ot v. Woolworth, 150 U. S. 401 ; Prout v. Starr, 188 U. S. 537 ; Riverdale Mills v. Manufacturing Co., 198 U. S. 188 ; Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line, <citedDecision>200 U. S. 273</citedDecision> .  (As we have already seen, “removal” cases like French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250 , and Dietzsch v. Huidekoper, 103 U. S. 494 , rest upon an entirely different footing.) None of the reports submitted to Congress contains any discussion of § 5 of the Act of 1793 and the decisions construing it.  See H. Rept. No. 818, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., referring to H. Doc. No. 783, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.; Sen. Rept. No. 388, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.; Final Report of the Commission to Revise and Codify the Laws of the United States (1906), pp. 29, 244.  Nor do the debates disclose any consideration of the question.  See 45 Cong. Rec., pts. Ill and IV, and 46 Cong. Rec., pts. I-V, passim.
