**Combined Opinion**
 Thereafter they returned to North Carolina where they lived together until the indictment was returned.  Petitioners pleaded not guilty and offered in evidence exemplified copies of the Nevada proceedings, contending that the divorce decrees and the Nevada marriage were valid in North Carolina as well as in Nevada.  The State contended that since neither of the defendants in the Nevada actions was served in Nevada nor entered an appearance there, the Nevada decrees would not be recognized as valid in North Carolina.  On this issue the court charged the jury in substance that *291 a Nevada divorce decree based on substituted service where the defendant made no appearance would not be recognized in North Carolina, under the rule of Pridgen v. Pridgen, 203 N.C. 533 , 166 S.E. 591 .  The State further contended that petitioners went to Nevada not to establish a bona fide residence but solely for the purpose of taking advantage of the laws of that State to obtain a divorce through fraud upon that court. On that issue the court charged the jury that, under the rule of State v. Herron, 175 N.C. 754 , 94 S.E. 698 , the defendants had the burden of satisfying the jury, but not beyond a reasonable doubt, of the bona fides of their residence in Nevada for the required time.  Petitioners excepted to these charges.  The Supreme Court of North Carolina in affirming the judgment held that North Carolina was not required to recognize the Nevada decrees under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution (Art. IV, § 1) by reason of Haddock v. Haddock, <citedDecision>201 U.S. 562</citedDecision> .  The intimation in the majority opinion (220 N.C. pp. 460-464) that the Nevada divorces were collusive suggests that the second theory on which the State tried the case may have been an alternative ground for the decision below, adequate to sustain the judgment under the rule of Bell v. Bell, 181 U.S. 175  a case in which this Court held that a decree of divorce was not entitled to full faith and credit when it had been granted on constructive service by the courts of a state in which neither spouse was domiciled.  But there are two reasons why we do not reach that issue in this case. In the first place, North Carolina does not seek to sustain the judgment below on that ground.  Moreover it admits that there probably is enough evidence in the record to require that petitioners be considered "to have been actually domiciled in Nevada." In the second place, the verdict against petitioners was a general one.  Hence, even though the doctrine of Bell v. Bell, supra , were to be deemed applicable here, we cannot determine on this record *292 that petitioners were not convicted on the other theory on which the case was tried and submitted, viz. the invalidity of the Nevada decrees because of Nevada's lack of jurisdiction over the defendants in the divorce suits.  That is to say, the verdict of the jury for all we know may have been rendered on that ground alone, since it did not specify the basis on which it rested.  It therefore follows here as in Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 368 , that if one of the grounds for conviction is invalid under the Federal Constitution, the judgment cannot be sustained.  No reason has been suggested why the rule of the Stromberg case is inapplicable here.  Nor has any reason been advanced why the rule of the Stromberg case is not both appropriate and necessary for the protection of rights of the accused.  To say that a general verdict of guilty should be upheld though we cannot know that it did not rest on the invalid constitutional ground on which the case was submitted to the jury, would be to countenance a procedure which would cause a serious impairment of constitutional rights.  Accordingly, we cannot avoid meeting the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> issue in this case by saying that the petitioners acquired no bona fide domicil in Nevada.  If the case had been tried and submitted on that issue only, we would have quite a different problem, as Bell v. Bell indicates.  We have no occasion to meet that issue now and we intimate no opinion on it.  However it might be resolved in another proceeding, we cannot evade the constitutional issue in this case on the easy assumption that petitioners' domicil in Nevada was a sham and a fraud.  Rather, we must treat the present case for the purpose of the limited issue before us precisely the same as if petitioners had resided in Nevada for a term of years and had long ago acquired a permanent abode there.  In other words, we would reach the question whether North Carolina could refuse to recognize the Nevada decrees because, in its view and contrary to *293 the findings of the Nevada court, petitioners had no actual, bona fide domicil in Nevada, if and only if we concluded that <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> was correctly decided.  But we do not think it was.  The <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> case involved a suit for separation and alimony, brought in New York by the wife on personal service of the husband.  The husband pleaded in defense a divorce decree obtained by him in Connecticut where he had established a separate domicil.  This Court held that New York, the matrimonial domicil where the wife still resided, need not give full faith and credit to the Connecticut decree, since it was obtained by the husband who wrongfully left his wife in the matrimonial domicil, service on her having been obtained by publication and she not having entered an appearance in the action.  But we do not agree with the theory of the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> case that, so far as the marital status of the parties is concerned, [4] a decree of divorce granted under such circumstances by one state need not be given full faith and credit in another.  Article IV, § 1 of the Constitution not only directs that "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State" but also provides that "Congress may by general laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof." Congress has exercised that power.  By the Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 28 U.S.C. 687, Congress has provided that judgments "shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are taken." Chief Justice Marshall stated in Hampton v. M'Connel, 3 Wheat. 234, 235 , that "the judgment of a state court should have the same credit, *294 validity, and effect, in every other court in the United States, which it had in the state where it was pronounced, and that whatever pleas would be good to a suit thereon in such state, and none others, could be pleaded in any other court in the United States." That view has survived substantially intact.  Fauntleroy v. Lum, 210 U.S. 230 .  This Court only recently stated that Art. IV, § 1 and the Act of May 26, 1790 require that "not some, but full" faith and credit be given judgments of a state court. Davis v. Davis, 305 U.S. 32, 40 .  Thus, even though the cause of action could not be entertained in the state of the forum, either because it had been barred by the local statute of limitations or contravened local policy, the judgment thereon obtained in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit.  See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290 ; Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra ; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 252 U.S. 411 ; Titus v. Wallick, 306 U.S. 282, 291 .  Some exceptions have been engrafted on the rule laid down by Chief Justice Marshall.  But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandeis in Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U.S. 629, 642 , "the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one." So far as judgments are concerned, the decisions, [5] as distinguished from dicta, [6] show that the *295 actual exceptions have been few and far between, apart from <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> .  For this Court has been reluctant to admit exceptions in case of judgments rendered by the courts of a sister state, since the "very purpose" of Art. IV, § 1 was "to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation." Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, pp. 276-277.  This Court, to be sure, has recognized that in case of statutes, "the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed," some "accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states" is necessary.  Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 294 U.S. 532, 547 .  But that principle would come into play only in case the Nevada decrees were assailed on the ground that Nevada must give full faith and credit in its divorce proceedings to the divorce statutes of North Carolina.  Even then, it would be of no avail here.
**Combined Opinion**
 One who challenges that right, because of the force given to a conflicting statute of another state by the full faith and credit clause, assumes the burden of showing, upon some rational basis, that of the conflicting interests involved those of the foreign state are superior to those of the *296 forum." Id., pp. 547-548.  It is difficult to perceive how North Carolina could be said to have an interest in Nevada's domiciliaries superior to the interest of Nevada.  Nor is there any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state.  Certainly Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U.S. 145 , did not so hold.  Indeed, the recent case of Pacific Employers Ins. Co. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 306 U.S. 493, 502 , held that in the case of statutes "the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to substitute for its own statute, applicable to persons and events within it, the conflicting statute of another state, even though that statute is of controlling force in the courts of the state of its enactment with respect to the same persons and events." Moreover, <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> is not based on the contrary theory.  Nor did it hold that a decree of divorce granted by the courts of one state need not be given full faith and credit in another if the grounds for the divorce would not be recognized by the courts of the forum.  It does not purport to challenge or disturb the rule, earlier established by Christmas v. Russell, supra , and subsequently fortified by Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra , that, even though the cause of action could not have been entertained in the state of the forum, a judgment obtained thereon in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit.  For the majority opinion in the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> case accepted both Cheever v. Wilson, 9 Wall. 108 , and Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U.S. 155 .  Cheever v. Wilson held that a decree of divorce granted by a state in which one spouse was domiciled and which had personal jurisdiction over the other was as conclusive in other states as it was in the state where it was obtained.  Atherton v. Atherton held that full faith and credit must be given a decree of divorce granted by *297 the state of the matrimonial domicil on constructive service against the other spouse who was a non-resident of that state.  The decisive difference between those cases and <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> was said to be that, in the latter, the state granting the divorce had no jurisdiction over the absent spouse, since it was not the state of the matrimonial domicil, but the place where the husband had acquired a separate domicil after having wrongfully left his wife.  This Court accordingly classified <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> with that group of cases which hold that when the courts of one state do not have jurisdiction either of the subject matter or of the person of the defendant, the courts of another state are not required by virtue of the full faith and credit clause to enforce the judgment.  [7] But such differences in result between <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> and the cases which preceded it rest on distinctions which in our view are immaterial, so far as the full faith and credit clause and the supporting legislation are concerned.  The historical view that a proceeding for a divorce was a proceeding in rem (2 Bishop, Marriage & Divorce, 4th ed., § 164) was rejected by the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> case. We likewise agree that it does not aid in the solution of the problem presented by this case to label these proceedings as proceedings in rem. Such a suit, however, is not a mere in personam action.  Domicil of the plaintiff, immaterial to jurisdiction in a personal action, is recognized in the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> case and elsewhere (Beale, Conflict of Laws, § 110.1) as essential in order to give the court jurisdiction which will entitle the divorce decree to extraterritorial effect, at least when the defendant has neither been personally served nor entered an appearance.  The findings *298 made in the divorce decrees in the instant case must be treated on the issue before us as meeting those requirements.  For it seems clear that the provision of the Nevada statute that a plaintiff in this type of case must "reside" in the State for the required period [8] requires him to have a domicil, [9] as distinguished from a mere residence, in the state.  Latterner v. Latterner, 51 Nev. 285 , 274 P. 194 ; Lamb v. Lamb, 57 Nev. 421 , 65 P.2d 872 .  Hence, the decrees in this case, like other divorce decrees, are more than in personam judgments.  They involve the marital status of the parties.  Domicil creates a relationship to the state which is adequate for numerous exercises of state power.
**Combined Opinion**
 Each state as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate concern in the marital status of persons domiciled within its borders.  The marriage relation creates problems of large social importance.  Protection of offspring, property interests, and the enforcement of marital responsibilities are but a few of commanding problems in the field of domestic relations with which the state must deal.  Thus it is plain that each state, by virtue of its command over its domiciliaries and its large interest in the institution of marriage, can alter within its *299 own borders the marriage status of the spouse domiciled there, even though the other spouse is absent.  There is no constitutional barrier if the form and nature of the substituted service (see Milliken v. Meyer, supra, p. 463 ) meet the requirements of due process.  Atherton v. Atherton, supra, p. 172 .  Accordingly, it was admitted in the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> case that the divorce decree, though not recognized in New York, was binding on both spouses in Connecticut where granted.  201 U.S. 569 , 572, 575, 579.  And this Court in Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 , upheld the validity within the Territory of Oregon of a divorce decree granted by the legislature to a husband domiciled there, even though the wife resided in Ohio where the husband had deserted her.  It therefore follows that, if the Nevada decrees are taken at their full face value (as they must be on the phase of the case with which we are presently concerned), they were wholly effective to change in that state the marital status of the petitioners and each of the other spouses by the North Carolina marriages.  Apart from the requirements of procedural due process ( Atherton v. Atherton, supra, p. 172 ) not challenged here by North Carolina, no reason based on the Federal Constitution has been advanced for the contrary conclusion.  But the concession that the decrees were effective in Nevada makes more compelling the reasons for rejection of the theory and result of the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> case. This Court stated in Atherton v. Atherton, supra, p. 162 , that "A husband without a wife, or a wife without a husband, is unknown to the law." But if one is lawfully divorced and remarried in Nevada and still married to the first spouse in North Carolina, an even more complicated and serious condition would be realized.  We would then have what the Supreme Court of Illinois declared to be the "most perplexing and distressing complications in the domestic relations of many citizens in the different States." Dunham v. Dunham, 162 Ill. 589, 607 .  Under the circumstances *300 of this case, a man would have two wives, a wife two husbands.  The reality of a sentence to prison proves that that is no mere play on words.  Each would be a bigamist for living in one state with the only one with whom the other state would permit him lawfully to live.  Children of the second marriage would be bastards in one state but legitimate in the other.  And all that would flow from the legalistic notion that where one spouse is wrongfully deserted he retains power over the matrimonial domicil so that the domicil of the other spouse follows him wherever he may go, while, if he is to blame, he retains no such power.  But such considerations are inapposite.  As stated by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissent in the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> case (201 U.S. p. 630), they constitute a "pure fiction, and fiction always is a poor ground for changing substantial rights." Furthermore, the fault or wrong of one spouse in leaving the other becomes under that view a jurisdictional fact on which this Court would ultimately have to pass.  Whatever may be said as to the practical effect which such a rule would have in clouding divorce decrees, the question as to where the fault lies has no relevancy to the existence of state power in such circumstances.  See Bingham, In the Matter of Haddock v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> , 21 Corn.  L.Q.  393, 426.  The existence of the power of a state to alter the marital status of its domiciliaries, as distinguished from the wisdom of its exercise, is not dependent on the underlying causes of the domestic rift.  As we have said, it is dependent on the relationship which domicil creates and the pervasive control which a state has over marriage and divorce within its own borders.  Atherton v. Atherton , which preceded <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> , and Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551 , which followed it, recognized that the power of the state of the matrimonial domicil to grant a divorce from the absent spouse did not depend on whether his departure from the state was or was not *301 justified.  As stated above, we see no reason, and none has here been advanced, for making the existence of state power depend on an inquiry as to where the fault in each domestic dispute lies.  And it is difficult to prick out any such line of distinction in the generality of the words of the full faith and credit clause.  Moreover, so far as state power is concerned, no distinction between a matrimonial domicil and a domicil later acquired has been suggested or is apparent.  See Mr. Justice Holmes dissenting, <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock, supra, p. 631</citedDecision> ; Goodrich, Matrimonial Domicile, 27 Yale L. Journ. 49.  It is one thing to say as a matter of state law that jurisdiction to grant a divorce from an absent spouse should depend on whether by consent or by conduct the latter has subjected his interest in the marriage status to the law of the separate domicil acquired by the other spouse.  Beale, Conflict of Laws, § 113.11; Restatement, Conflict of Laws, § 113.  But where a state adopts, as it has the power to do, a less strict rule, it is quite another thing to say that its decrees affecting the marital status of its domiciliaries are not entitled to full faith and credit in sister states.  Certainly if decrees of a state altering the marital status of its domiciliaries are not valid throughout the Union even though the requirements of procedural due process are wholly met, a rule would be fostered which could not help but bring "considerable disaster to innocent persons" and "bastardize children hitherto supposed to be the offspring of lawful marriage" (Mr. Justice Holmes dissenting in <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock, supra, p. 628</citedDecision> ), or else encourage collusive divorces.  Beale, Constitutional Protection of Decrees for Divorce, 19 Harv. L. Rev. 586 , 596.  These intensely practical considerations emphasize for us the essential function of the full faith and credit clause in substituting a command for the former principles of comity ( Broderick v. Rosner, supra, p. 643 ) and in altering the "status of the several states as independent foreign *302 sovereignties" by making them "integral parts of a single nation." Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, p. 277.  It is objected, however, that if such divorce decrees must be given full faith and credit, a substantial dilution of the sovereignty of other states will be effected.  For it is pointed out that under such a rule one state's policy of strict control over the institution of marriage could be thwarted by the decree of a more lax state.  But such an objection goes to the application of the full faith and credit clause to many situations.
**Combined Opinion**
 It is a Constitution which we are expounding  a Constitution which in no small measure brings separate sovereign states into an integrated whole through the medium of the full faith and credit clause.  Within the limits of her political power North Carolina may, of course, enforce her own policy regarding the marriage relation  an institution more basic in our civilization than any other.  But society also has an interest in the avoidance of polygamous marriages ( Loughran v. Loughran, 292 U.S. 216, 223 ) and in the protection of innocent offspring of marriages deemed legitimate in other jurisdictions.  And other states have an equally legitimate concern in the status of persons domiciled there as respects the institution of marriage.  So, when a court of one state acting in accord with the requirements of procedural due process alters the marital status of one domiciled in that state by granting him a divorce from his absent spouse, we cannot say its decree should be excepted from the full faith and credit clause merely because its enforcement or recognition in another state would conflict with the policy of the latter.  Whether Congress has the power to create exceptions (see Yarborough v. Yarborough, 290 U.S. 202, 215 , nt. 2, dissenting opinion) is a question on which we express no view.  It is sufficient here to note that Congress, in its sweeping requirement that judgments of the courts of one state be given full faith and credit in the courts of another, has not done so. And the considerable interests involved, and the substantial and far-reaching effects which the *304 allowance of an exception would have on innocent persons, indicate that the purpose of the full faith and credit clause and of the supporting legislation would be thwarted to a substantial degree if the rule of <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> were perpetuated.  Haddock v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> is overruled.  The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of North Carolina for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  Reversed.  MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring: I join in the opinion of the Court but think it appropriate to add a few words.  Article 91 of the British North America Act (1867) gives the Parliament of Canada exclusive legislative authority to deal with marriage and divorce.  Similarly, Article 51 of the Australia Constitution Act (1900) empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to marriage and divorce.  The Constitution of the United States, however, reserves authority over marriage and divorce to each of the forty-eight states.  That is our starting-point.  In a country like ours where each state has the constitutional power to translate into law its own notions of policy concerning the family institution, and where citizens pass freely from one state to another, tangled marital situations, like the one immediately before us, inevitably arise.  They arose before and after the decision in the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> case, <citedDecision>201 U.S. 562</citedDecision> , and will, I daresay, continue to arise no matter what we do today.  For these complications cannot be removed by any decisions this Court can make  neither the crudest nor the subtlest juggling of legal concepts could enable us to bring forth a uniform national law of marriage and divorce.  We are not authorized nor are we qualified to formulate a national code of domestic relations.  We cannot, by *305 making "jurisdiction" depend upon a determination of who is the deserter and who the deserted, or upon the shifting notions of policy concealed by the cloudy abstraction of "matrimonial domicile," turn this into a divorce and probate court for the United States.  There may be some who think our modern social life is such that there is today a need, as there was not when the Constitution was framed, for vesting national authority over marriage and divorce in Congress, just as the national legislatures of Canada and Australia have been vested with such powers.  Beginning in 1884, [1] numerous proposals to amend the Constitution to confer such authority have been introduced in Congress.  But those whose business it is to amend the Constitution have not seen fit to amend it in this way.
**Combined Opinion**
 There will be time enough to consider the scope of its power in this regard when Congress chooses to exercise it.  The duty of a state to respect the judgments of a sister state arises only where such judgments meet the tests of justice and fair dealing that are embodied in the historic phrase, "due process of law." But in this case all talk about due process is beside the mark.  If the actions of the Nevada court had been taken "without due process of law," the divorces which it purported to decree would have been without legal sanction in every state, including Nevada.  There would be no occasion to consider the applicability of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  It is precisely because the Nevada decrees do satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause and are binding in Nevada upon the absent spouses that we are called upon to decide whether these judgments, unassailable in the state which rendered them, are, despite the commands of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, null and void elsewhere.  North Carolina did not base its disregard of the Nevada decrees on the claim that they were a fraud and a sham, and no claim was made here on behalf of North Carolina *307 that the decrees were not valid in Nevada.  It is indisputable that the Nevada decrees here, like the Connecticut decree in the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> case, were valid and binding in the state where they were rendered.  Haddock v. Haddock, <citedDecision>201 U.S. 562, 569-70</citedDecision> ; Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 ; Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U.S. 155 .  In denying constitutional sanction to such a valid judgment outside the state which rendered it, the <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> decision made an arbitrary break with the past and created distinctions incompatible with the role of this Court in enforcing the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  Freed from the hopeless refinements introduced by that case, the question before us is simply whether the Nevada decrees were rendered under circumstances that would make them binding against the absent spouses in the state where they were rendered.  North Carolina did not challenge the power of Nevada to declare the marital status of persons found to be Nevada residents.  North Carolina chose instead to disrespect the consequences of Nevada's exertion of such power.  It is therefore no more rhetorical to say that Nevada is seeking to impose its policy upon North Carolina than it is to say that North Carolina is seeking to impose its policy upon Nevada.  For all but a very small fraction of the community the niceties of resolving such conflicts among the laws of the states are, in all likelihood, matters of complete indifference.  Our occasional pronouncements upon the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause doubtless have little effect upon divorces.
**Combined Opinion**
 The framers of the Constitution did not lay down rules to guide us in selecting which of two conflicting state judgments or public acts would receive federal aid in its extraterritorial enforcement.  Nor was it necessary.  There was, and is, an adequate body of law, if we do not reject it, by which to test jurisdiction or power to render the judgments in question so far as faith and credit by federal command is concerned.  By the application of well established rules these judgments fail to merit enforcement for two reasons.  *316 II.  LACK OF DUE PROCESS OF LAW. Thirty-seven years ago this Court decided that a state court, even of the plaintiff's domicile, could not render a judgment of divorce that would be entitled to federal enforcement in other states against a nonresident who did not appear, and was not personally served with process.  Haddock v. Haddock, <citedDecision>201 U.S. 562</citedDecision> (1905 Term).  The opinion was much criticized, particularly in academic circles.  [1] Until today, however, it has been regarded as law, to be accepted and applied, for good or ill, depending on one's view of the matter.  The theoretical reasons for the change are not convincing.  The opinion concedes that Nevada's judgment could not be forced upon North Carolina in absence of personal service if a divorce proceeding were an action in personam.  In other words, settled family relationships may be destroyed by a procedure that we would not recognize if the suit were one to collect a grocery bill.  [2] We have been told that this is because divorce is a proceeding in rem. The marriage relation is to be reified and treated as a res. Then it seems that this res follows a fugitive from matrimony into a state of easy divorce, although the other party to it remains at home where the res was contracted and where years of cohabitation would seem to give it local situs.
**Combined Opinion**
 It does not seem consistent with our legal system that one who has these continuing rights should be deprived of them without a hearing.  Neither does it seem that he or she should be summoned by mail, publication, or otherwise to a remote jurisdiction chosen by the other party and there be obliged to submit marital rights to adjudication under a state policy at odds with that of the state under which the marriage was contracted and the matrimonial domicile was established.  Marriage is often dealt with as a contract.  Of course a personal judgment could not be rendered against an absent party on a cause of action arising out of an ordinary commercial contract, without personal service of process.  I see no reason why the marriage contract, if such it be *318 considered, should be discriminated against, nor why a party to a marriage contract should be more vulnerable to a foreign judgment without process than a party to any other contract.  I agree that the marriage contract is different, but I should think the difference would be in its favor.  The Court thinks the difference is the other way: we are told that divorce is not a "mere in personam action" since <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock, supra</citedDecision> , held that domicile is necessary to jurisdiction for divorce.  But to hold that a state cannot have divorce jurisdiction unless it is the domicile is not to hold that it must have such jurisdiction if it is the domicile, as <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> itself demonstrates.  Further support for this view seems to be seen in Maynard v. Hill, 125 U.S. 190 , and in the Court's subsequent approval of that case in <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock, supra, at 569, 572, 574, 575, 579</citedDecision> .  All that Maynard v. Hill decided was that the Territory of Washington had jurisdiction to cut off any interest of an absent spouse in land within its borders.  But protection of land in the jurisdiction and protection against bigamy prosecutions out of the jurisdiction are plainly different matters.  [3] Although the Court concedes that its present decision would be insupportable if divorce were a "mere in personam action," it relies for support on opinions that the state where one is domiciled has the power to enter valid criminal, tax, and simple money judgments against  not for  him.  [4] Those opinions are wholly inapposite unless *319 they mean that Nevada has jurisdiction to nullify contract rights of a person never in the state or to declare that he is not liable for the commission of crime, payment of taxes, or the breach of a contract, in another state; and I am sure that nobody has ever supposed they meant that.  To hold that the Nevada judgments were not binding in North Carolina because they were rendered without jurisdiction over the North Carolina spouses, it is not necessary to hold that they were without any conceivable validity.  It may be, and probably is, true that Nevada has sufficient interest in the lives of those who sojourn there to free them and their spouses to take new spouses without incurring criminal penalties under Nevada law. I know of nothing in our Constitution that requires Nevada to adhere to traditional concepts of bigamous unions or the legitimacy of the fruit thereof.

Ordean, 234 U.S. 385 ; Clark v. Williard, 294 U.S. 211 ; Pink v. A.A.A. Highway Express Co., 314 U.S. 201 .  [4] Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, 286 U.S. 276, 279 ; New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, 300 U.S. 308, 313 ; Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463-464 ; Skiriotes v. Florida, 313 U.S. 69 .  [5]   Cf. Arndt v. Griggs ; Dewey v. Des Moines ; Grannis v. Ordean ; Clark v. Williard, supra, note 3 .  [6]  A spouse who appears and contests the jurisdiction of the court of another state to grant a divorce may not collaterally attack its findings of domicile and jurisdiction made after such appearance.  Davis v. Davis, 305 U.S. 32 .  So also, a deserter from the matrimonial domicile may be bound by a divorce granted by a court of the state where the matrimonial domicile is situated.  Whether fault on the part of the deserter is an essential seems on the basis of our cases on jurisdiction for divorce to be an open question; Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U.S. 155 ; <citedDecision>Haddock</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Haddock, supra, at 570, 572, 583</citedDecision> ; and Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551 ; but our decisions on analogous problems might be found to afford adequate support for a decision that it is not.  Cf. Washington ex rel. Bond & Goodwin & Tucker v. Superior Court, 289 U.S. 361 ; Doherty & Co. v. Goodman, 294 U.S. 623 .  See, further, Restatement, Conflict of Laws, §§ 112, 113.  [7]  This was the decision in Bell v. Bell, 181 U.S. 175 ; And Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U.S. 14 .  Davis v. Davis, supra, note 6, in no way indicates that a finding of domicile after appearance of the absent spouse and litigation of the question would be conclusive upon the state of his domicile in litigation involving its interests and not merely those of the parties.  Cf. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165, 172, n. 13 .  [8]  1 Beale, Conflict of Laws (1935) § 10.3.
