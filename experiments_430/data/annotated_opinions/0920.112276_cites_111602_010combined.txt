**Combined Opinion**
 "In order to assure the absence of such a motivation, we have concluded that whenever a judge imposes a more severe sentence upon a defendant after a new trial, the reasons for him doing so must affirmatively appear." Id. at 726 .  Otherwise, a presumption *799 arises that a greater sentence has been imposed for a vindictive purpose Â— a presumption that must be rebutted by " `objective information .  .  .  justifying the increased sentence.' " Texas v. McCullough, <citedDecision>475 U. S. 134, 142</citedDecision> (1986) (quoting United States v. Goodwin, 457 U. S. 368, 374 (1982)).  While the Pearce opinion appeared on its face to announce a rule of sweeping dimension, our subsequent cases have made clear that its presumption of vindictiveness "do[es] not apply in every case where a convicted defendant receives a higher sentence on retrial." <citedDecision>Texas</citedDecision> v. McCullough, <citedDecision>475 U. S., at 138</citedDecision> .  As we explained in <citedDecision>Texas</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>McCullough</citedDecision> , "the evil the [Pearce] Court sought to prevent" was not the imposition of "enlarged sentences after a new trial" but "vindictiveness of a sentencing judge." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> See also Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, 412 U. S. 17, 25 (1973) (the Pearce presumption was not designed to prevent the imposition of an increased sentence on retrial "for some valid reason associated with the need for flexibility and discretion in the sentencing process," but was "premised on the apparent need to guard against vindictiveness in the resentencing process").  Because the Pearce presumption "may operate in the absence of any proof of an improper motive and thus .  .  .  block a legitimate response to criminal conduct," United States v. Goodwin, supra, at 373 , we have limited its application, like that of "other `judicially created means of effectuating the rights secured by the [Constitution],' " to circumstances "where its `objectives are thought most efficaciously served,' " <citedDecision>Texas</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>McCullough, supra, at 138</citedDecision> , quoting Stone v. Powell, 428 U. S. 465, 482, 487 (1976).  Such circumstances are those in which there is a "reasonable likelihood," United States v. Goodwin, supra, at 373 , that the increase in sentence is the product of actual vindictiveness on the part of the sentencing authority.  Where there is no such reasonable likelihood, the burden remains upon the defendant to prove actual vindictiveness, *800 see Wasman v. United States, 468 U. S. 559, 569 (1984).  In Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U. S. 104 (1972), for example, we refused to apply the presumption when the increased sentence was imposed by the second court in a two-tiered system which gave a defendant convicted of a misdemeanor in an inferior court the right to trial de novo in a superior court. We observed that the trial de novo represented a "completely fresh determination of guilt or innocence" by a court that was not being "asked to do over what it thought it had already done correctly." Id., at 117 .  If the de novo trial resulted in a greater penalty, we said that "it no more follows that such a sentence is a vindictive penalty .  .
