 The case's tortuous history over the next 15 years indicates well the degree to which our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has shifted in recent times, while nevertheless retaining anomalies with which the lower courts have had to struggle.  In 1990, after extended discovery, Chief Judge Heebe of the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana granted summary judgment in favor of respondents.  Helms v. Cody, Civ. A. No. 85-5533, 1990 WL 36124 (Mar. 27), App. to Pet. for Cert. 137a.  He held that Chapter 2 violated the Establishment Clause because, under the second part of our three-part test in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612-613 (1971), the program had the primary effect of advancing religion.  Chapter 2 had such effect, in his view, because the materials and equipment loaned to the Catholic schools were direct aid to those schools and because the Catholic schools were, he concluded after detailed inquiry into their doctrine and curriculum, "pervasively sectarian." App. to Pet. for Cert. 151a.  Chief Judge Heebe relied primarily on Meek v. Pittenger, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 349</citedDecision> (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229 (1977), in which we held unconstitutional programs that provided many of the same sorts of materials and equipment as does Chapter 2.  In 1994, after having resolved the numerous other issues in the case, he issued an order permanently excluding pervasively sectarian schools in Jefferson Parish from receiving any Chapter 2 materials or equipment.  Two years later, Chief Judge Heebe having retired, Judge Livaudais received the case. Ruling in early 1997 on postjudgment motions, he reversed the decision of former Chief Judge Heebe and upheld Chapter 2, pointing to several significant changes in the legal landscape over the previous seven years.  Helms v. Cody, 1997 WL 35283 (Jan. 28), App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a.  In particular, Judge Livaudais cited our 1993 decision in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 , in which we held that a State could, as part *805 of a federal program for the disabled, provide a signlanguage interpreter to a deaf student at a Catholic high school.  Judge Livaudais also relied heavily on a 1995 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Walker v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 46 F. 3d 1449 , upholding Chapter 2 on facts that he found "virtually indistinguishable." The Ninth Circuit acknowledged in Walker , as Judge Heebe had in his 1990 summary judgment ruling, that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman appeared to erect a constitutional distinction between providing textbooks (permissible) and providing any other in-kind aid (impermissible).  46 F. 3d, at 1464 1465; see Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968) (upholding textbook program).  The Court of Appeals viewed this distinction, however, as "thin" and "unmoored from any Establishment Clause principles," and, more importantly, as "rendered untenable" by subsequent cases, particularly Zobrest .  46 F. 3d, at 1465-1466.  These cases, in the Ninth Circuit's view, revived the principle of Allen and of Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing , [3] that "state benefits provided to all citizens without regard to religion are constitutional." 46 F. 3d, at 1465.  The Ninth Circuit also relied, id., at 1467, on our observation in Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687 (1994), that "we have frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of any benefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges," id., at 704 .  The Ninth Circuit purported to distinguish <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman based on the percentage of schools receiving aid that were parochial (a large percentage in those cases and a moderate percentage in Walker ), 46 F. 3d, at 1468, but that court undermined this distinction when it observed that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> also upheld "the massive provision of textbooks *806 to parochial schools." 46 F. 3d, at 1468, n. 16.  Thus, although the Ninth Circuit did not explicitly hold that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman were no longer good law, its reasoning seemed to require that conclusion.  Finally, in addition to relying on our decision in Zobrest and the Ninth Circuit's decision in Walker , Judge Livaudais invoked Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U. S. 819 (1995), in which, a few months after Walker , we held that the Establishment Clause does not require a public university to exclude a student-run religious publication from assistance available to numerous other student-run publications.  Following Judge Livaudais' ruling, respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  While that appeal was pending, we decided Agostini , in which we approved a program that, under Title I of the ESEA, provided public employees to teach remedial classes at private schools, including religious schools.  In so holding, we overruled Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), and partially overruled School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985), both of which had involved such a program.  The Fifth Circuit thus faced a dilemma between, on the one hand, the Ninth Circuit's holding and analysis in Walker and our subsequent decisions in Rosenberger and Agostini , and, on the other hand, our holdings in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman .  To resolve the dilemma, the Fifth Circuit abandoned any effort to find coherence in our case law or to divine the future course of our decisions and instead focused on our particular holdings.  Helms v. Picard, 151 F. 3d 347, 371 (1998).  It thought such an approach required not only by the lack of coherence but also by Agostini `s admonition to lower courts to abide by any applicable holding of this Court even though that holding might seem inconsistent with our subsequent decisions, see Agostini, 521 U. S., at 237 .  The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that Agostini , by recognizing our rejection of the rule that "all government aid that directly assists the *807 educational function of religious schools is invalid," id., at 225 , had rejected a premise of <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , but that court nevertheless concluded that Agostini had neither directly overruled <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman nor rejected their distinction between textbooks and other in-kind aid.  The Fifth Circuit therefore concluded that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman controlled, and thus it held Chapter 2 unconstitutional.  We granted certiorari.  527 U. S. 1002 (1999).  II The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment dictates that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." In the over 50 years since Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), we have consistently struggled to apply these simple words in the context of governmental aid to religious schools.  [4] As we admitted in Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672 (1971), "candor compels the acknowledgment that we can only dimly perceive the boundaries of permissible government activity in this sensitive area." Id., at 678 (plurality opinion); see Lemon, 403 U. S., at 671 (White, J., concurring in judgment).
**Combined Opinion**
Id., at 234 .  In this case, our inquiry under Agostini 's purpose and effect test is a narrow one.  Because respondents do not challenge the District Court's holding that Chapter 2 has a secular purpose, and because the Fifth Circuit also did not question that holding, cf. 151 F. 3d, at 369, n. 17 , we will consider only Chapter 2's effect.  Further, in determining that effect, we will consider only the first two Agostini criteria, since neither respondents nor the Fifth Circuit has questioned the District Court's holding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a, that Chapter 2 does not create an excessive entanglement.  Considering Chapter 2 in light of our more recent case law, we conclude that it neither results in religious indoctrination by the government nor defines its recipients by reference to religion.  We therefore hold that Chapter 2 is not a "law respecting an establishment of religion." In so holding, we acknowledge what both the Ninth and Fifth Circuits saw was inescapable <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman are anomalies in our case law. We therefore conclude that they are no longer good law. *809 A As we indicated in Agostini , and have indicated elsewhere, the question whether governmental aid to religious schools results in governmental indoctrination is ultimately a question whether any religious indoctrination that occurs in those schools could reasonably be attributed to governmental action.  See Agostini, supra, at 226 (presence of signlanguage interpreter in Catholic school "`cannot be attributed to state decisionmaking'" (quoting Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 10 ) (emphasis added in Agostini )); 521 U. S., at 230 (question is whether "any use of [governmental] aid to indoctrinate religion could be attributed to the State"); see also Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 841-842 ; Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 488-489 (1986); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397 (1983); cf. Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U. S. 327, 337 (1987) ("For a law to have forbidden `effects' under Lemon , it must be fair to say that the government itself has advanced religion through its own activities and influence").  We have also indicated that the answer to the question of indoctrination will resolve the question whether a program of educational aid "subsidizes" religion, as our religion cases use that term. See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 230-231 ; see also id., at 230 .  In distinguishing between indoctrination that is attributable to the State and indoctrination that is not, we have consistently turned to the principle of neutrality, upholding aid that is offered to a broad range of groups or persons without regard to their religion.  If the religious, irreligious, and areligious are all alike eligible for governmental aid, no one would conclude that any indoctrination that any particular recipient conducts has been done at the behest of the government.  For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question.  If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any particular *810 indoctrination.
**Combined Opinion**
We rejected the dissent's objection that we had never before allowed "a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination." See id., at 18 (opinion of Blackmun, J.).  Finally, in Agostini itself, we used the reasoning of Witters and Zobrest to conclude that remedial classes provided under Title I of the ESEA by public employees did not impermissibly finance religious indoctrination.  521 U. S., at 228 ; see id., at 230-232 .  We found it insignificant that students did not have to directly apply for Title I services, that Title I instruction was provided to students in groups rather than individually, and that instruction was provided in the facilities of the private schools.  Id., at 226-229 .  To the extent that respondents intend their direct/indirect distinction to require that any aid be literally placed in the hands of schoolchildren rather than given directly to the school for teaching those same children, the very cases on which respondents most rely, <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman , demonstrate the irrelevance of such formalism.  In <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , we justified our rejection of a program that loaned instructional materials and equipment by, among other things, pointing out that the aid was loaned to the schools, and thus was "direct *818 aid." <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 362-363</citedDecision> .  The materials-and-equipment program in Wolman was essentially identical, except that the State, in an effort to comply with <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , see Wolman, 433 U. S., at 233, 250 , loaned the aid to the students.  (The revised program operated much like the one we upheld in Allen.  Compare Wolman, supra, at 248 , with Allen, 392 U. S., at 243-245 .) Yet we dismissed as "technical" the difference between the two programs: "[I]t would exalt form over substance if this distinction were found to justify a result different from that in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> .  " 433 U. S., at 250 .  Wolman thus, although purporting to reaffirm <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , actually undermined that decision, as is evident from the similarity between the reasoning of Wolman and that of the <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> dissent.  Compare Wolman, supra, at 250 (The "technical change in legal bailee" was irrelevant), with <citedDecision>Meek, supra,  at 391</citedDecision> (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) ("Nor can the fact that the school is the bailee be regarded as constitutionally determinative").  That <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman reached the same result, on programs that were indistinguishable but for the direct/indirect distinction, shows that that distinction played no part in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> .  Further, respondents' formalistic line breaks down in the application to real-world programs.  In Allen, for example, although we did recognize that students themselves received and owned the textbooks, we also noted that the books provided were those that the private schools required for courses, that the schools could collect students' requests for books and submit them to the board of education, that the schools could store the textbooks, and that the textbooks were essential to the schools' teaching of secular subjects.  See 392 U. S., at 243-245 .  Whether one chooses to label this program "direct" or "indirect" is a rather arbitrary choice, one that does not further the constitutional analysis.  Of course, we have seen "special Establishment Clause dangers," Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 , when money is *819 given to religious schools or entities directly rather than, as in Witters and Mueller , indirectly.  See 515 U. S., at 842 (collecting cases); id., at 846-847 (O'Connor, J., concurring); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608-609 (1988); compare Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), with Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472 (1973).

 .  [A] state-employed sign-language interpreter would serve as the conduit for James' religious education, thereby assisting Salpointe [High School] in its mission of religious indoctrination"); id., at 23 (interpreter *821 "is likely to place the imprimatur of governmental approval upon the favored religion"); see generally id., at 18-23 .  Quite clearly, then, we did not, as respondents do, think that the use of governmental aid to further religious indoctrination was synonymous with religious indoctrination by the government or that such use of aid created any improper incentives.  Similarly, had we, in Witters , been concerned with divertibility or diversion, we would have unhesitatingly, perhaps summarily, struck down the tuition-reimbursement program, because it was certain that Witters sought to participate in it to acquire an education in a religious career from a sectarian institution.  Diversion was guaranteed.  Mueller took the same view as Zobrest and Witters , for we did not in Mueller require the State to show that the tax deductions were only for the costs of education in secular subjects.  We declined to impose any such segregation requirement for either the tuition-expense deductions or the deductions for items strikingly similar to those at issue in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman , and here.  See Mueller, 463 U. S., at 391, n. 2 ; see also id., at 414 (Marshall, J., dissenting) ("The instructional materials which are subsidized by the Minnesota tax deduction plainly may be used to inculcate religious values and belief").  Justice O'Connor acknowledges that the Court in Zobrest and Witters approved programs that involved actual diversion.  See post, at 841 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The dissent likewise does not deny that Witters involved actual diversion.  See post, at 895-896, n. 16.  The dissent does claim that the aid in Zobrest "was not considered divertible," post, at 895, n. 16, but the dissent in Zobrest , which the author of today's dissent joined, understood the case otherwise.  See supra, at 820.  As that dissent made clear, diversion is the use of government aid to further a religious message.  See Zobrest, supra, at 21-22 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also post, at 842, 857 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  By that definition, the *822 government-provided interpreter in Zobrest was not only divertible, but actually diverted.  Respondents appear to rely on <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman to establish their rule against "divertible" aid.  But those cases offer little, if any, support for respondents.  <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> mentioned divertibility only briefly in a concluding footnote, see <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 366, n. 16</citedDecision> , and that mention was, at most, peripheral to the Court's reasoning in striking down the lending of instructional materials and equipment.  The aid program in Wolman explicitly barred divertible aid, 433 U. S., at 248 249, so a concern for divertibility could not have been part of our reason for finding that program invalid.  The issue is not divertibility of aid but rather whether the aid itself has an impermissible content.  Where the aid would be suitable for use in a public school, it is also suitable for use in any private school.  Similarly, the prohibition against the government providing impermissible content resolves the Establishment Clause concerns that exist if aid is actually diverted to religious uses.  [9] In Agostini , we explained Zobrest by making just this distinction between the content of aid and the use of that aid: "Because the only government aid in Zobrest was the interpreter, who was herself not inculcating any religious messages, no government indoctrination took place." 521 U. S., at 224 (second emphasis added).

 We are unwilling to elevate scattered de minimis statutory violations, discovered and remedied by the relevant authorities themselves prior to any litigation, to such a level as to convert an otherwise unobjectionable parishwide program into a law that has the effect of advancing religion.  IV In short, Chapter 2 satisfies both the first and second primary criteria of Agostini .  It therefore does not have the effect of advancing religion.  For the same reason, Chapter 2 also "cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion," Agostini, 521 U. S., at 235 .  Accordingly, we hold that Chapter 2 is not a law respecting an establishment of religion.  Jefferson Parish need not exclude religious schools from its Chapter 2 program.  [19] To the extent that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman conflict with this holding, we overrule them.  Our conclusion regarding <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman should come as no surprise.  The Court as early as Wolman itself left no doubt that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Allen were irreconcilable, see 433 U. S., at 251, n. 18 , and we have repeatedly reaffirmed Allen since then, see, e. g., Agostini, supra, at 231 .  (In fact, <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , in *836 discussing the materials-and-equipment program, did not even cite Allen.  See Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 363-366</citedDecision> .) Less than three years after Wolman , we explained that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> did not, despite appearances, hold that "all loans of secular instructional material and equipment inescapably have the effect of direct advancement of religion." Regan, 444 U. S., at 661-662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Then, in Mueller , we conceded that the aid at issue in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman did "resembl[e], in many respects," the aid that we had upheld in Everson and Allen.  463 U. S., at 393 , and n. 3; see id., at 402, n. 10 ; see also id., at 415 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (viewing Allen as incompatible with <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman , and the distinction between textbooks and other instructional materials as "simply untenable").  Most recently, Agostini , in rejecting Ball `s assumption that "all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid," Agostini, supra, at 225 , necessarily rejected a large portion (perhaps all, see Ball, 473 U. S., at 395 ) of the reasoning of <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman in invalidating the lending of materials and equipment, for Ball borrowed that assumption from those cases. See 521 U. S., at 220-221 (Shared Time program at issue in Ball was "surely invalid .  .  .  [g]iven the holdings in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman " regarding instructional materials and equipment).  Today we simply acknowledge what has long been evident and was evident to the Ninth and Fifth Circuits and to the District Court. The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed.  It is so ordered.  Justice O'Connor, with whom Justice Breyer joins, concurring in the judgment.  In 1965, Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, 79 Stat. 27 (1965 Act).  Under Title I, Congress provided monetary grants to States to address the needs of educationally deprived children of low-income families.  Under Title II, Congress provided further monetary *837 grants to States for the acquisition of library resources, textbooks, and other instructional materials for use by children and teachers in public and private elementary and secondary schools.  Since 1965, Congress has reauthorized the Title I and Title II programs several times.  Three Terms ago, we held in Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203 (1997), that Title I, as applied in New York City, did not violate the Establishment Clause.  I believe that Agostini likewise controls the constitutional inquiry respecting Title II presented here, and requires the reversal of the Court of Appeals' judgment that the program is unconstitutional as applied in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.  To the extent our decisions in Meek v. Pittenger, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 349</citedDecision> (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229 (1977), are inconsistent with the Court's judgment today, I agree that those decisions should be overruled.  I therefore concur in the judgment.  I I write separately because, in my view, the plurality announces a rule of unprecedented breadth for the evaluation of Establishment Clause challenges to government school aid programs.  Reduced to its essentials, the plurality's rule states that government aid to religious schools does not have the effect of advancing religion so long as the aid is offered on a neutral basis and the aid is secular in content.  The plurality also rejects the distinction between direct and indirect aid, and holds that the actual diversion of secular aid by a religious school to the advancement of its religious mission is permissible.  Although the expansive scope of the plurality's rule is troubling, two specific aspects of the opinion compel me to write separately.  First, the plurality's treatment of neutrality comes close to assigning that factor singular importance in the future adjudication of Establishment Clause challenges to government school aid programs.
**Combined Opinion**
 Agostini next requires us to ask whether Chapter 2 "result[s] in governmental indoctrination." 521 U. S., at 234 .  Because this is a more complex inquiry under our case law, it is useful first to review briefly the basis for our decision in Agostini that New York City's Title I program did not result in governmental indoctrination.  Under that program, public-school teachers provided Title I instruction to eligible *847 students on private school premises during regular school hours.  Twelve years earlier, in Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), we had held the same New York City program unconstitutional.  In Ball , a companion case to Aguilar , we also held that a similar program in Grand Rapids, Michigan, violated the Constitution.  Our decisions in Aguilar and Ball were both based on a presumption, drawn in large part from <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , see <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 367-373</citedDecision> , that public-school instructors who teach secular classes on the campuses of religious schools will inevitably inculcate religion in their students.  In Agostini , we recognized that "[o]ur more recent cases [had] undermined the assumptions upon which Ball and Aguilar relied." 521 U. S., at 222 .  First, we explained that the Court had since abandoned "the presumption erected in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Ball that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion." Id., at 223.  Rather, relying on Zobrest , we explained that in the absence of evidence showing that teachers were actually using the Title I aid to inculcate religion, we would presume that the instructors would comply with the program's secular restrictions.  See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-224 , 226 227.  The Title I services were required by statute to be "`secular, neutral, and nonideological.' " Id., at 210 (quoting 20 U. S. C. § 6321 (a)(2)).  Second, we noted that the Court had "departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid."
**Combined Opinion**
 Although respondents claim that Chapter 2 aid has been diverted to religious instruction, that evidence is de minimis, as I explain at greater length below.  See infra, at 864-867.  III Respondents contend that Agostini is distinguishable, pointing to the distinct character of the aid program considered there.  See Brief for Respondents 44-47.  In Agostini , federal funds paid for public-school teachers to provide secular instruction to eligible children on the premises of their religious schools.  Here, in contrast, federal funds pay for instructional materials and equipment that LEA's lend to religious schools for use by those schools' own teachers in their classes.  Because we held similar programs unconstitutional in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman , respondents contend that those decisions, and not Agostini , are controlling.  See, e. g., Brief for Respondents 11, 22-25.  Like respondents, Justice Souter also relies on <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman in finding the character of the Chapter 2 aid constitutionally problematic.  See post, at 893, 903.  At the time they were decided, <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman created an inexplicable rift within our Establishment Clause jurisprudence concerning government aid to schools.  Seven years before our decision in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , we held in Allen that a New York statute that authorized the lending of textbooks to students attending religious schools did not violate the *850 Establishment Clause.  392 U. S., at 238 .  We explained that the statute "merely [made] available to all children the benefits of a general program to lend school books free of charge," that the State retained ownership of the textbooks, and that religious schools received no financial benefit from the program.  Id., at 243-244 .  We specifically rejected the contrary argument that the statute violated the Establishment Clause because textbooks are critical to the teaching process, which in a religious school is employed to inculcate religion.  Id., at 245-248 .  In <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman , we adhered to Allen, holding that the textbook lending programs at issue in each case did not violate the Establishment Clause.  See Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 359-362</citedDecision> (plurality opinion); Wolman , 433 U. S., at 236 238 (plurality opinion).  At the same time, however, we held in both cases that the lending of instructional materials and equipment to religious schools was unconstitutional.  See <citedDecision>Meek, supra, at 362-366</citedDecision> ; Wolman, supra, at 248-251 .  We reasoned that, because the religious schools receiving the materials and equipment were pervasively sectarian, any assistance in support of the schools' educational missions would inevitably have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  For example, in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> we explained: "[I]t would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania's church-related elementary and secondary schools and to then characterize [the statute] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.  Even though earmarked for secular purposes, `when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission,' state aid has the impermissible primary effect of advancing religion." <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 365</citedDecision> -366 (quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U. S. 734, 743 (1973)).  *851 Thus, we held that the aid program " necessarily results in aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole," and " inescapably results in the direct and substantial advancement of religious activity." <citedDecision>Meek, supra, at 366</citedDecision> (emphases added).  Similarly, in Wolman , we concluded that, "[i]n view of the impossibility of separating the secular education function from the sectarian, the state aid inevitably flows in part in support of the religious role of the schools." 433 U. S., at 250 (emphasis added).  For whatever reason, the Court was not willing to extend this presumption of inevitable religious indoctrination to school aid when it instead consisted of textbooks lent free of charge.  For example, in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , despite identifying the religious schools' secular educational functions and religious missions as inextricably intertwined, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 366</citedDecision> , the Court upheld the textbook lending program because "the record in the case .  .  .  , like the record in Allen, contains no suggestion that religious textbooks will be lent or that the books provided will be used for anything other than purely secular purposes," id., at 361-362 (citation omitted).  Accordingly, while the Court was willing to apply an irrebuttable presumption that secular instructional materials and equipment would be diverted to use for religious indoctrination, it required evidence that religious schools were diverting secular textbooks to religious instruction.  The inconsistency between the two strands of the Court's jurisprudence did not go unnoticed, as Justices on both sides of the <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman decisions relied on the contradiction to support their respective arguments.  See, e. g., Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 384</citedDecision> (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("[W]hat the Court says of the instructional materials and equipment may be said perhaps even more accurately of the textbooks" (citation omitted)); <citedDecision>id., at 390</citedDecision> (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) ("The failure of the majority to justify the differing approaches to textbooks and instructional materials and *852 equipment in the above respect is symptomatic of its failure even to attempt to distinguish the .  .  .  textbook loan program, which the plurality upholds, from the .  .  .  instructional materials and equipment loan program, which the majority finds unconstitutional").  The irrationality of this distinction is patent.  As one Member of our Court has noted, it has meant that "a State may lend to parochial school children geography textbooks that contain maps of the United States, but the State may not lend maps of the United States for use in geography class." Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U. S. 38, 110 (1985) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (footnotes omitted).  Indeed, technology's advance since the Allen, <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , and Wolman decisions has only made the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment more suspect.  In this case, for example, we are asked to draw a constitutional line between lending textbooks and lending computers.  Because computers constitute instructional equipment, adherence to <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman would require the exclusion of computers from any government school aid program that includes religious schools.  Yet, computers are now as necessary as were schoolbooks 30 years ago, and they play a somewhat similar role in the educational process.  That Allen, <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , and Wolman would permit the constitutionality of a school aid program to turn on whether the aid took the form of a computer rather than a book further reveals the inconsistency inherent in their logic.  Respondents insist that there is a reasoned basis under the Establishment Clause for the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment.  They claim that the presumption that religious schools will use instructional materials and equipment to inculcate religion is sound because such materials and equipment, unlike textbooks, are reasonably divertible to religious uses.  For example, no matter what secular criteria the government employs in selecting a film projector to lend to a religious school, school officials can always divert that projector to religious *853 instruction.  Respondents therefore claim that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from giving or lending aid to religious schools when that aid is reasonably divertible to religious uses.  See, e. g., Brief for Respondents 11, 35.  Justice Souter also states that the divertibility of secular government aid is an important consideration under the Establishment Clause, although he apparently would not ascribe it the constitutionally determinative status that respondents do.
**Combined Opinion**
 I would reject respondents' proposed divertibility rule.  First, respondents cite no precedent of this Court that would require it.  The only possible direct precedential support for such a rule is a single sentence contained in a footnote from our Wolman decision.  There, the Court described Allen as having been "premised on the view that the educational content of textbooks is something that can be ascertained in advance and cannot be diverted to sectarian uses." Wolman, supra, at 251, n. 18 .  To the extent this simple description of Allen is even correct, it certainly does not constitute an actual holding that the Establishment Clause prohibits the government from lending any divertible aid to religious schools.  Rather, as explained above, the Wolman Court based its holding invalidating the lending of instructional materials and equipment to religious schools on the rationale adopted in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> that the secular educational function of a religious school is inseparable from its religious mission.  See Wolman, 433 U. S., at 250 .  Indeed, if anything, the Wolman footnote confirms the irrationality of the distinction between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment.  After the Wolman Court acknowledged that its holding with respect to instructional materials and equipment was in tension with Allen, the Court explained the continuing validity of Allen solely on the basis of stare decisis: " Board of Education v. Allen has remained law, and we now follow as a matter of stare decisis the principle that restriction of textbooks to those provided the public schools is sufficient to ensure *854 that the books will not be used for religious purposes." Wolman, supra, at 252, n. 18 .  Thus, the Wolman Court never justified the inconsistent treatment it accorded the lending of textbooks and the lending of instructional materials and equipment based on the items' reasonable divertibility.  Justice Souter's attempt to defend the divertibility rationale as a viable distinction in our Establishment Clause jurisprudence fares no better.  For Justice Souter, secular school aid presents constitutional problems not only when it is actually diverted to religious ends, but also when it simply has the capacity for, or presents the possibility of, such diversion.  See, e. g., post, at 893 (discussing "susceptibility [of secular supplies] to the service of religious ends").  Thus, he explains the Allen, <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , and Wolman decisions as follows: "While the textbooks had a known and fixed secular content not readily divertible to religious teaching purposes, the adaptable materials did not." Post, at 893-894.  This view would have come as a surprise to the Court in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , which expressly conceded that "the material and equipment that are the subjects of the loan .  .  .  are `self-polic[ing], in that starting as secular, nonideological and neutral, they will not change in use.' " <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 365</citedDecision> (quoting Meek v. Pittenger, 374 F. Supp. 639, 660 (ED Pa. 1974)).  Indeed, given the nature of the instructional materials considered in Meek and Wolman , it is difficult to comprehend how a divertibility rationale could have explained the decisions.  The statutes at issue in those cases authorized the lending of "periodicals, photographs, maps, charts, sound recordings, [and] films," Meek, supra, at 355, and "maps and globes," Wolman, supra, at 249 .  There is no plausible basis for saying that these items are somehow more divertible than a textbook given that each of the above items, like a textbook, has a fixed and ascertainable content.  In any event, even if Meek and Wolman had articulated the divertibility rationale urged by respondents and Justice *855 Souter, I would still reject it for a more fundamental reason.  Stated simply, the theory does not provide a logical distinction between the lending of textbooks and the lending of instructional materials and equipment.  An educator can use virtually any instructional tool, whether it has ascertainable content or not, to teach a religious message.
**Combined Opinion**
 In any event, Chapter 2 contains both a secular content restriction, 20 U. S. C. § 7372 (a)(1), and a prohibition on the use of aid for religious worship or instruction, § 8897, so Tilton provides no basis for upholding respondents' challenge.  Finally, our decision in Bowen proves only that actual diversion, as opposed to mere divertibility, is constitutionally impermissible.  See, e. g., 487 U. S., at 621 .  Had we believed that the divertibility of secular aid was sufficient to call the aid program into question, there would have been no need for the remand we ordered and no basis for the reversal.  IV Because divertibility fails to explain the distinction our cases have drawn between textbooks and instructional materials and equipment, there remains the question of which of the two irreconcilable strands of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence we should now follow.  Between the two, I would adhere to the rule that we have applied in the context of textbook lending programs: To establish a First Amendment violation, plaintiffs must prove that the aid in question actually is, or has been, used for religious purposes.  See Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 361-362</citedDecision> ; Allen, 392 U. S., at 248 .  Just as we held in Agostini that our more recent cases had undermined the assumptions underlying Ball and Aguilar , I would now hold that Agostini and the cases on which it relied have undermined the assumptions underlying Meek and Wolman .  To be sure, Agostini only addressed the specific presumption that public-school employees teaching on the premises of religious schools would inevitably inculcate religion.  Nevertheless, I believe that our definitive rejection of that presumption also stood foror at least strongly *858 pointed tothe broader proposition that such presumptions of religious indoctrination are normally inappropriate when evaluating neutral school aid programs under the Establishment Clause.  In Agostini , we repeatedly emphasized that it would be inappropriate to presume inculcation of religion; rather, plaintiffs raising an Establishment Clause challenge must present evidence that the government aid in question has resulted in religious indoctrination.  See 521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-227 .  We specifically relied on our statement in Zobrest that a presumption of indoctrination, because it constitutes an absolute bar to the aid in question regardless of the religious school's ability to separate that aid from its religious mission, constitutes a "flat rule, smacking of antiquated notions of `taint,' [that] would indeed exalt form over substance."
**Combined Opinion**
 Even though both Everson and Allen had anticipated some such distinction, neither case had used the term "neutral" in this way.  In Everson , Justice Black indicated that providing *880 police, fire, and similar government services to religious institutions was permissible, in part because they were "so separate and so indisputably marked off from the religious function." 330 U. S., at 18 .  Allen similarly focused on the fact that the textbooks lent out were "secular" and approved by secular authorities, 392 U. S., at 245 , and assumed that the secular textbooks and the secular elements of education they supported were not so intertwined with religious instruction as "in fact [to be] instrumental in the teaching of religion," id., at 248 .  Such was the Court's premise in Lemon for shifting the use of the word "neutral" from labeling the required position of the government to describing a benefit that was nonreligious.  We spoke of "[o]ur decisions from Everson to Allen [as] permitt[ing] the States to provide church-related schools with secular, neutral, or nonideological services, facilities, or materials," 403 U. S., at 616, and thereafter, we regularly used "neutral" in this second sense of "secular" or "nonreligious." See, e. g., Tilton, supra, at 687-688 (characterizing subsidized teachers in Lemon as "not necessarily religiously neutral," but buildings as "religiously neutral"); Meek v. Pittenger, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 349, 365-366</citedDecision> (1975) (describing instructional materials as "`secular, nonideological and neutral' " and "wholly neutral"); <citedDecision>id., at 372</citedDecision> (describing auxiliary services as "religiously neutral"); Roemer, supra, at 751 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (describing Tilton `s approved buildings as "neutral or nonideological in nature"); 426 U. S., at 754 (describing Meek `s speech and hearing services as "neutral and nonideological"); Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 10 (1993) (discussing translator as "neutral service"); Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 232 (1997) (discussing need to assess whether nature of aid was "neutral and nonideological"); cf. Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 478 (1973) (noting that District Court approved testing cost reimbursement as payment for services that were "`secular, neutral, or nonideological' " in character, citing Lemon, 403 U. S., at *881 616); Wolman, supra, at 242 (quoting Lemon, supra, at 616 (describing permitted services aid as "secular, neutral, or nonideological")).  The shift from equipoise to secular was not, however, our last redefinition, for the Court again transformed the sense of "neutrality" in the 1980's.  Reexamining and reinterpreting Everson and Allen, we began to use the word "neutral" to mean "evenhanded," in the sense of allocating aid on some common basis to religious and secular recipients.  Again, neither Everson nor Allen explicitly used "neutral" in this manner, but just as the label for equipoise had lent itself to referring to the secular characteristic of what a government might provide, it was readily adaptable to referring to the generality of government services, as in Everson `s paradigms, to which permissible benefits were compared.  The increased attention to a notion of evenhanded distribution was evident in Nyquist , where the Court distinguished the program under consideration from the government services approved in Allen and Everson , in part because "the class of beneficiaries [in Everson and Allen ] included all schoolchildren, those in public as well as those in private schools." 413 U. S ., at 782, n. 38.  Nyquist then reserved the question whether "some form of public assistance .  .  .  made available generally without regard to the sectarian-nonsectarian, or public-nonpublic nature of the institution benefitted" would be permissible.  Id., at 783, n. 38 (citations omitted).  Subsequent cases continued the focus on the "generality" of the approved government services as an important characteristic.  Meek , for example, characterized Everson and Allen as approving "a general program" to pay bus fares and to lend school books, respectively, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 360</citedDecision> ; <citedDecision>id., at 360, n. 8</citedDecision> (approving two similar "general program[s]" in New York and Pennsylvania), and Wolman upheld diagnostic services described as "`general welfare services for children,' " 433 U. S., at 243 (quoting Meek, supra, at 371, n. 21).  *882 Justice Blackmun, writing in Roemer , first called such a "general" or evenhanded program "neutral," in speaking of "facial neutrality" as a relevant consideration in determining whether there was an Establishment Clause violation.  "[R]eligious institutions need not be quarantined from public benefits that are neutrally available to all." 426 U. S., at 746-747 ; see also id., at 746 (discussing buses in Everson and school books in Allen as examples of "neutrally available" aid).  In Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388 (1983), the Court adopted the redefinition of neutrality as evenhandedness, citing Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 782, n. 38 , and alluding to our discussion of equal access in Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U. S. 263 (1981).  The Court upheld a system of tax deductions for sectarian educational expenses, in part because such a "facially neutral law," 463 U. S., at 401 , made the deduction available for " all parents, including those whose children attend public schools and those whose children attend nonsectarian private schools or sectarian private schools," id., at 397 .  Subsequent cases carried the point forward.  See, e. g., Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481, 487 (1986) (quoting Nyquist and characterizing program as making aid "available generally"); Zobrest, supra, at 8-9 (discussing "government programs that neutrally provide benefits to a broad class of citizens defined without reference to religion" and citing Mueller and Witters ); Agostini, supra, at 231 (discussing aid allocated on the basis of "neutral, secular criteria that neither favor nor disfavor religion, .
**Combined Opinion**
 Given the legitimacy of considering evenhandedness, then, there is no reason to avoid the term "neutrality" to refer to it.  But one crucial point must be borne in mind.  In the days when "neutral" was used in Everson `s sense of equipoise, neutrality was tantamount to constitutionality; the term was conclusory, but when it applied it meant that the government's position was constitutional under the Establishment Clause.  This is not so at all, however, under the most recent use of "neutrality" to refer to generality or evenhandedness of distribution.  This kind of neutrality is relevant in judging whether a benefit scheme so characterized should be seen as aiding a sectarian school's religious *884 mission, but this neutrality is not alone sufficient to qualify the aid as constitutional.  It is to be considered only along with other characteristics of aid, its administration, its recipients, or its potential that have been emphasized over the years as indicators of just how religious the intent and effect of a given aid scheme really is.  See, e. g., Tilton, 403 U. S., at 677-678 (opinion of Burger, C. J.) (acknowledging "no single constitutional caliper"); Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 358-359</citedDecision> (noting considerations as guidelines only and discussing them as a matter of degree); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 383 (1985) (quoting Meek ), overruled in part by Agostini, 521 U. S., at 203 ; Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687, 720 (1994) (opinion of O'Connor, J.) ("Experience proves that the Establishment Clause, like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single test"); Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 847-849 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (discussing need for linedrawing); id., at 852 (noting lack of a single "Grand Unified Theory" for Establishment Clause and citing Kiryas Joel ); cf. Agostini, supra, at 232-233 (examining a variety of factors).  Thus, the basic principle of establishment scrutiny of aid remains the principle as stated in Everson , that there may be no public aid to religion or support for the religious mission of any institution.  B The insufficiency of evenhandedness neutrality as a standalone criterion of constitutional intent or effect has been clear from the beginning of our interpretative efforts, for an obvious reason.  Evenhandedness in distributing a benefit approaches the equivalence of constitutionality in this area only when the term refers to such universality of distribution that it makes no sense to think of the benefit as going to any discrete group.  Conversely, when evenhandedness refers to distribution to limited groups within society, like groups of schools or schoolchildren, it does make sense to regard the benefit as aid to the recipients.  See, e. g., Everson , 330 U. S., *885 at 16 (discussing aid that approaches the "verge" of forbidden territory); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 612 ("[W]e can only dimly perceive the lines of demarcation in this extraordinarily sensitive area of constitutional law"); Nyquist , 413 U. S., at 760 761 (noting the "most perplexing questions" presented in this area and acknowledging "`entangl[ing] precedents' "); Mueller, 463 U. S., at 393 (quoting Lemon ); Witters, 474 U. S., at 485 (quoting Lemon ).  Hence, if we looked no further than evenhandedness, and failed to ask what activities the aid might support, or in fact did support, religious schools could be blessed with government funding as massive as expenditures made for the benefit of their public school counterparts, and religious missions would thrive on public money.
**Combined Opinion**
 Third, we have found relevance in at least five characteristics of the aid itself: its religious content; its cash form; its divertibility or actually diversion to religious support; its supplantation of traditional items of religious school expense; and its substantiality.  1 Two types of school aid recipients have raised special concern.  First, we have recognized the fact that the overriding religious mission of certain schools, those sometimes called *886 "pervasively sectarian," is not confined to a discrete element of the curriculum, Everson, 330 U. S., at 22-24 (Jackson, J., dissenting); id., at 45-47 (Rutledge, J., dissenting), but permeates their teaching.  [6] Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U. S. 664, 671 (1970); Lemon, supra, at 636-637 ("A school which operates to commingle religion with other instruction plainly cannot completely secularize its instruction.  Parochial schools, in large measure, do not accept the assumption that secular subjects should be unrelated to religious teaching"); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 621-622 (1988) (discussing pervasively sectarian private schools).  Based on record evidence and long experience, we have concluded that religious teaching in such schools is at the core of the instructors' individual and personal obligations, cf. Canon 803, § 2, Text & Commentary 568 ("It is necessary that the formation and education given in a Catholic school be based upon the principles of Catholic doctrine; teachers are to be outstanding for their correct doctrine and integrity of life"), and that individual religious teachers will teach religiously.  [7] Lemon, 403 U. S., at 615-620 ; id., at 635 *887 641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 ; Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 369-371</citedDecision> ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 249-250 (discussing nonseverability of religious and secular education); Ball, 473 U. S., at 399-400 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by Agostini, 521 U. S., at 236 .  As religious teaching cannot be separated from secular education in such schools or by such teachers, we have concluded that direct government subsidies to such schools are prohibited because they will inevitably and impermissibly support religious indoctrination.  Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12 (discussing Meek and Ball ).  Second, we have expressed special concern about aid to primary and secondary religious schools.  Tilton, 403 U. S., at 685-686 .  On the one hand, we have understood how the youth of the students in such schools makes them highly susceptible to religious indoctrination.  Lemon, supra, at 616 ("This process of inculcating religious doctrine is, of course, enhanced by the impressionable age of the pupils, in primary schools particularly").
**Combined Opinion**
 No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a schoolwide basis" (citations omitted)); Bowen, 487 U. S., at 614-615 ; Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 (noting that "we have recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions"); cf. Lemon, 403 U. S., at 619-620 (noting that safeguards and accounting inspections required to prevent government funds from supporting religious education will cause impermissible entanglement); Roemer, 426 U. S., at 753-757 (approving segregated funds after finding recipients not pervasively religious); Ball, 473 U. S., at 392-393 (noting that "[w]ith but one exception, our subsequent cases have struck down attempts by States to make payments out of *893 public tax dollars directly to primary or secondary religious educational institutions"), overruled in part by Agostini, supra, at 236 ; Witters, 474 U. S., at 487 ("It is equally well-settled .  .  .  that the State may not grant aid to a religious school, whether cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct subsidy to the religious school" (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)); Rosenberger, supra, at 851-852 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (noting that student fee was not a tax).  Divertibility is not, of course, a characteristic of cash alone, and when examining provisions for ostensibly secular supplies we have considered their susceptibility to the service of religious ends.  [13] In upholding a scheme to provide students with secular textbooks, we emphasized that "each book loaned must be approved by the public school authorities; only secular books may receive approval." Allen, 392 U. S., at 244-245 ; see also Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 361-362</citedDecision> (opinion of Stewart, J.); Wolman, supra, at 237-238 .  By the same token, we could not sustain provisions for instructional materials adaptable to teaching a variety of subjects.  [14] Meek, supra, at 363; Wolman, supra, at 249-250 .  While the textbooks had a known and fixed secular content not readily divertible *894 to religious teaching purposes, the adaptable materials did not.  [15] So, too, we explained the permissibility of busing on public routes to schools but not busing for field trips designed by religious authorities specifically because the latter trips were components of teaching in a pervasively religious school.  Compare Everson, 330 U. S., at 17 (noting wholly separate and secular nature of public bus fare to schools), with Wolman, 433 U. S., at 254 ("The field trips are an integral part of the educational experience, and where the teacher works within and for a sectarian institution, an unacceptable risk of fostering of religion is an inevitable byproduct" (citation omitted)).  We likewise were able to uphold underwriting the expenses of standard state testing in religious schools while being forced to strike down aid for testing designed by the school officials, because the latter tests could be used to reinforce religious teaching.
**Combined Opinion**
 [17] In Zobrest, 509 U. S., at 12 , the Court specifically distinguished Meek and Ball by explaining that the invalid programs in those cases "relieved sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students." In Agostini , the Court made a point of noting that the objects of the aid were "by law supplemental to the regular curricula" and, citing Zobrest , explained that the remedial education services did not relieve the religious schools of costs they would otherwise have borne.  521 U. S., at 228 (citing Zobrest, supra, at 12 ).  The Court explicitly stated that the *898 services in question did not "supplant the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already provided in New York City's sectarian schools." 521 U. S., at 229 .  Finally, we have recognized what is obvious (however imprecise), in holding "substantial" amounts of aid to be unconstitutional whether or not a plaintiff can show that it supplants a specific item of expense a religious school would have borne.  [18] In Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 366</citedDecision> , we invalidated the loan of instructional materials to religious schools because "faced with the substantial amounts of direct support authorized by [the program], it would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania's church-related elementary and secondary schools and then characterize [the program] as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian." <citedDecision>Id., at 365</citedDecision> .  See <citedDecision>id., at 366</citedDecision> ("Substantial aid to the educational function of such schools .  .  .  necessarily results in aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole"); see also Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 783 ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 250-251 .  In Witters, 474 U. S., at 488 , the Court asked whether the aid in question was a direct subsidy to religious schools and addressed the substantiality of the aid obliquely in noting that "nothing in the record indicates that .  .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 The facts most obviously relevant to the Chapter 2 scheme *903 in Jefferson Parish are those showing divertibility and actual diversion in the circumstance of pervasively sectarian religious schools.  The type of aid, the structure of the program, and the lack of effective safeguards clearly demonstrate the divertibility of the aid.  While little is known about its use, owing to the anemic enforcement system in the parish, even the thin record before us reveals that actual diversion occurred.  The aid that the government provided was highly susceptible to unconstitutional use.  Much of the equipment provided under Chapter 2 was not of the type provided for individual students, App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a; App. 262a 278a, but included "slide projectors, movie projectors, overhead projectors, television sets, tape recorders, projection screens, maps, globes, filmstrips, cassettes, computers," and computer software and peripherals, Helms v. Cody, No. 85-5533, 1990 WL 36124 (ED La., Mar. 27, 1990); App. to Pet. for Cert. 140a; App. 90a, 262a278a, as well as library books and materials, id., at 56a, 126a, 280a284a.  The videocassette players, overhead projectors, and other instructional aids were of the sort that we have found can easily be used by religious teachers for religious purposes.  Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 363</citedDecision> ; Wolman, 433 U. S., at 249-250 .  The same was true of the computers, which were as readily employable for religious teaching as the other equipment, and presumably as immune to any countervailing safeguard, App. 90a, 118a, 164a165a.  Although library books, like textbooks, have fixed content, religious teachers can assign secular library books for religious critique, and books for libraries may be religious, as any divinity school library would demonstrate.  The sheer number and variety of books that could be and were ordered gave ample opportunity for such diversion.  The divertibility thus inherent in the forms of Chapter 2 aid was enhanced by the structure of the program in Jefferson Parish.  Requests for specific items under Chapter 2 came not from secular officials, cf. Allen, 392 U. S., at 244 *904 245, but from officials of the religious schools (and even parents of religious school pupils), see ante, at 803 (noting that private religious schools submitted their orders to the government for specific requested items); App. 156a158a.  The sectarian schools decided what they wanted and often ordered the supplies, id., at 156a159a, 171a172a, to be forwarded directly to themselves, id., at 156a159a.
**Combined Opinion**
 By statute all purchases with Chapter 2 aid were to remain the property of the United States, 20 U. S. C. § 7372 (c)(1), merely being "lent" to the recipient nonpublic schools.  In actuality, however, the record indicates that nothing in the *908 Jefferson Parish program stood in the way of giving the Chapter 2 property outright to the religious schools when it became older.  Although old equipment remained the property of the local education agency, a local government administrative body, one agency employee testified that there was no set policy for dealing with old computers, which were probably given outright to the religious schools.  App. 161a 162a.  The witness said that government-funded instructional materials, too, were probably left with the religious schools when they were old, and that it was unclear whether library books were ever to be returned to the government.  Ibid. Providing such governmental aid without effective safeguards against future diversion itself offends the Establishment Clause, Tilton, 403 U. S., at 682-684 ; Nyquist, 413 U. S., at 776-777 , and even without evidence of actual diversion, our cases have repeatedly held that a "substantial risk" of it suffices to invalidate a government aid program on establishment grounds.  See, e. g., Wolman, 433 U. S., at 254 (invalidating aid for transportation on teacher-accompanied field trips because an "unacceptable risk of fostering of religion" was "an inevitable by product"); Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 372</citedDecision> (striking down program because of a "potential for impermissible fostering of religion"); Levitt, 413 U. S., at 480 (invalidating aid for tests designed by religious teachers because of "the substantial risk that .  .  .  examinations, prepared by teachers under the authority of religious institutions, will be drafted with an eye, unconsciously or otherwise, to inculcate students in the religious precepts of the sponsoring church"); Lemon, 403 U. S., at 619 (finding invalid aid with a "potential for impermissible fostering of religion"); cf. Bowen, 487 U. S., at 621 (noting that where diversion risk is less clearly made out, a case may be remanded for findings on actual diversion of aid to religious indoctrination); Regan, 444 U. S., at 656 (characterizing as "minimal" the chance that state-drafted tests with "complete" safeguards would be adopted to religious *909 testing).  A substantial risk of diversion in this case was more than clear, as the plurality has conceded.  The First Amendment was violated.  But the record here goes beyond risk, to instances of actual diversion.
**Combined Opinion**
 330 U. S., at 15-16 ; id., at 25-26 (Jackson, J., dissenting); id., at 28-29, 31-32 (Rutledge, J., dissenting).  [5]  Indeed, two of the dissenters in Allen agreed with the majority on this method of analysis, asking whether the books at issue were similar enough to fire and police protection.  See 392 U. S., at 252 (Black, J., dissenting); id., at 272 (Fortas, J., dissenting).  [6]  In fact, religious education in Roman Catholic schools is defined as part of required religious practice; aiding it is thus akin to aiding a church service.  See 1983 Code of Canon Law, Canon 798, reprinted in The Code of Canon Law: A Text and Commentary 566 (1985) (hereinafter Text & Commentary) (directing parents to entrust children to Roman Catholic schools or otherwise provide for Roman Catholic education); Canon 800, § 2, Text & Commentary 567 (requiring the faithful to support establishment and maintenance of Roman Catholic schools); Canons 802, 804, Text & Commentary 567, 568 (requiring diocesan bishop to establish and regulate schools "imparting an education imbued with the Christian spirit").  [7]  Although the Court no longer assumes that public school teachers assigned to religious schools for limited purposes will teach religiously, see Agostini v. Felton, 521 U. S. 203, 223-228 (1997), we have never abandoned the presumption that religious teachers will teach just that way.  Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 615-620 (1971); id., at 635-641 (Douglas, J., concurring); Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472, 480 (1973); Meek v. Pittenger, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 349, 369-371</citedDecision> (1975); Wol- man v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229, 249-250 (1977); School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373, 399-400 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part), overruled in part by Agostini, supra, at 236 .  Cf. NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 440 U. S. 490, 504 (1979) ("The church-teacher relationship in a church-operated school differs from the employment relationship in a public or other nonreligious school").  [8]  In Agostini , the Court indicated that "we have departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid," 521 U. S., at 225 , and cited Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, 474 U. S. 481 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1 (1993).  However, Agostini did not rely on this dictum, instead clearly stating that "[w]hile it is true that individual students may not directly apply for Title I services, it does not follow from this premise that those services are distributed `directly to the religious schools.' In fact, they are not.  No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a schoolwide basis." 521 U. S., at 228-229 (citations omitted).
