**Dissenting Opinion**
 See id., at 5 (Federal Government provided over $21 billion to States for education in 1998).  The distinction that the majority seeks to make — drawn in terms of gifts and entitlements — does not exist.  The majority is also wrong to say that this Court has “narrowed” Parden in its “subsequent opinion^],” ante, at 680, at least in any way relevant to today’s decision.  Parden considered two separate issues: (1) Does Congress have the power to require a State to waive its immunity?  (2) How clearly must Congress speak when it does so?  The Court has narrowed Parden only in respect to the second issue, not the first; but today we are concerned only with the first.  The Court in Employees of Dept. of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo., <citedDecision>411 U.S. 279</citedDecision> (1973), for example, discussed whether Congress had, or had not, “lift[ed]” sovereign immunity, not whether it could, or could not, have done so. <citedDecision>Id., at 285</citedDecision> *698 (“Congress did not lift the sovereign immunity of the States” (emphasis added)).  And Employees’ limitation of Parden , to “the area where private persons and corporations normally ran the enterprise,” took place in the context of clarity, not power.  <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 284</citedDecision> (specifying that “Congress can act” outside the limited area (emphasis added)).  Although two Justices would have limited Parden’s holding in respect to power, that limitation would simply have required Congress to give the States advance notice of the consequence (loss of sovereign immunity), which, as they noted, happened in Parden.  <citedDecision>411 U. S., at 296-297</citedDecision> (Marshall, J., concurring in result).  The remaining cases the majority mentions offer it no greater support.  One said, “We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 488 U. S. 468 , 475 (1987).  Two others also considered legislative clarity, not power.  Atascadero State Hospital, supra, at 247 (Rehabilitation Act “falls far short” of clearly indicating a waiver by a State accepting funds under the Act); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 674 (1974) (same for Social Security Act).  Even Seminole Tribe carefully avoided calling Par-den into question.  While specifying that Congress cannot, in the exercise of its Article I powers, “abrogate unilaterally the States’ immunity from suit,” 517 U. S., at 59 , it left open the scope of the term “unilaterally” by referring to Parden , without criticism, as standing for the “unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that the States may waive their sovereign immunity,” 517 U. S., at 65 .
