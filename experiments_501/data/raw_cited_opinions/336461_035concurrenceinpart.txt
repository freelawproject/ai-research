<p id="A6x">(concurring and dissenting):</p>
<p id="b1092-6">I concur in the judgment of the majority. I dissent from the stream of words used to arrive at the point of reversal. Naturally, this river of words brought forth elongated dissents.</p>
<p id="b1092-7">One will note that the author of the majority opinion cites the Texas Law Review and other law review comments in his footnote No. 1. These are notes on this case. Law reviews used to wait until the judicial process in a case was complete before entering the fray. Now they chaperone us during the pendency of a case. This is their First Amendment right.</p>
<p id="b1092-8">But if this practice of citing their current comment continues, then we shall be out lining up law reviews to support our views. After that we shall be taking the step of quoting the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. And it will be an easy jump then to include in our opinions the current comments of the Abilene Bugle and Bis-beeâ€™s Brewery Gulch Gazette.</p>
