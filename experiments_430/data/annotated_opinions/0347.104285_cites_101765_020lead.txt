Mr. Justice Douglas delivered the opinion of the Court. In 1943 petitioner, a native of Canada, filed his petition for naturalization in the District Court of Massachusetts.  He stated in his application that he understood the prin *62 ciples of the government of the United States, believed in its form of government, and was willing to take the oath of allegiance ( 54 Stat. 1157 , 8 U. S. C. § 735 (b)) which reads as follows: “I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; and that I take this obligation freely without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion: So help me God.” To the question in the application “If necessary, are you willing to take up arms in defense of this country?” he replied, “No (Non-combatant) Seventh Day Adventist.” He explained that answer before the examiner by saying “it is a purely religious matter with me, I have no political or personal reasons other than that.” He did not claim before his Selective Service board exemption from all military service, but only from combatant military duty.  At the hearing in the District Court petitioner testified that he was a member of the Seventh Day Adventist denomination, of whom approximately 10,000 were then serving in the armed forces of the United States as non-combatants, especially in the medical corps; and that he was willing to serve in the army but would not bear arms.  The District Court admitted him to citizenship.  The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, one judge dissenting.  149 F. 2d 760 .  It took that action on the authority of United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U. S. 644 ; United States v. Macintosh, <citedDecision>283 U. S. 605</citedDecision> , and United States v. Bland, 283 U. S. 636 , saying that the facts of the present case brought it squarely within the principle of those cases. The case is here on *63 a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted so that those authorities might be re-examined.  The Schwimmer, Macintosh and Bland cases involved, as does the present one, a question of statutory construction.  At the time of those cases, Congress required an alien, before admission to citizenship, to declare on oath in open court that “he will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bear true faith and allegiance to the same.” 1 It also required the court to be satisfied that the alien had during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of his application “behaved as a man of good moral character, attached to the principles of the Constitution of the United States, and well disposed to the good order and happiness of the same.” 2 Those provisions were reenacted into the present law in substantially the same, form.  3 While there are some factual distinctions between this case and the Schwimmer and <citedDecision>Macintosh</citedDecision> cases, the Bland case on its facts is indistinguishable.  But the principle emerging from the three cases obliterates any factual distinction among them.  As we recognized in In re Summers, 325 U. S. 561, 572, 577 , they stand for the same general rule — that an alien who refuses to bear arms will not be admitted to citizenship.  As an original proposition, we could not agree with that rule.  The fallacies underlying *64 it were, we think, demonstrated in the dissents of Mr. Justice Holmes in the Schwimmer case and of Mr. Chief Justice Hughes in the <citedDecision>Macintosh</citedDecision> case. The oath required of aliens does not in terms require that they promise to bear arms.  Nor has Congress expressly made any such finding a prerequisite to citizenship.  To hold that it is required is to read it into the Act by implication.  But we could not assume that Congress intended to make such an abrupt and radical departure from our traditions unless it spoke in unequivocal terms.  The bearing of arms, important as it is, is not the only way in which our institutions may be supported and defended, even in times of great peril.  Total war in its modern form dramatizes as never before the great cooperative effort necessary for victory.  The nuclear physicists who developed the atomic bomb, the worker at his lathe, the seamen on cargo vessels, construction battalions, nurses, engineers, litter bearers, doctors, chaplains — these, too, made essential contributions.

 The fact that his role may be limited by religious convictions rather than by physical characteristics has no necessary bearing on his attachment to his country or on his willingness to support and defend it to his utmost.  Petitioner’s religious scruples would not disqualify him from becoming a member of Congress or holding other public offices.  While Article VI, Clause 3 of the Constitution provides that such officials, both of the United States and the several States, “shall be bound by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution,” it significantly adds that “no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States.” The oath required is in no material respect different from that prescribed for aliens under the Nationality Act.  It has long contained the provision “that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion .  .  .” R. S. § 1757, 5 U. S. C. § 16 .  As Mr. Chief Justice Hughes stated in his dissent in the <citedDecision>Macintosh</citedDecision> case (283 U. S. p. 631), “the history of the struggle for religious liberty, the large number of citizens of our country, from the.  very beginning, who have been unwilling to sacrifice their religious convictions, and in particular, those who have been conscientiously opposed to war and who would not yield what they sincerely believed to be their allegiance to the will of God” — these considerations make it impossible to conclude “that such persons are to be deemed disqualified for public office in this country because of the requirement of the oath which must be taken before they enter upon their duties.” There is not the slightest suggestion that Congress set a stricter standard for aliens seeking admission to citizen *66 ship than it did for officials who make and enforce the laws of the nation and administer its affairs.  It is hard to believe that one need forsake his religious scruples to become a citizen but not to sit in the high councils of state.  As Mr. Chief Justice Hughes pointed out (United States v. Macintosh, supra, p. 633), religious scruples against bearing arms have been recognized by Congress in the various draft laws.  This is true of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 ( 54 Stat. 889 , 50 U. S. C. App. § 305 (g)) 4 as it was of earlier acts.  He who is inducted into the armed services takes an oath which includes the provision “that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the United States of America; that I will serve them honestly and faithfully against all their enemies whomsoever .  .
