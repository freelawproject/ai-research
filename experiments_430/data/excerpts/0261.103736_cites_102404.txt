 Thus, even though the cause of action could not be entertained in the state of the forum, either because it had been barred by the local statute of limitations or contravened local policy, the judgment thereon obtained in a sister state is entitled to full faith and credit.  See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290 ; Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra; Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 262 U. S. 411 ; Titus v. Wallick, 306 U. S. 282, 291 .  Some exceptions have been engrafted on the rule laid down by Chief Justice Marshall.  But as stated by Mr. Justice Brandéis in Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642 , “the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one.” So far as judgments are concerned, the decisions, 5 as distinguished from dicta, 6 show that the *295 actual exceptions have been few and far between, apart from Haddock v. Haddock .  For this Court has been reluctant to admit exceptions in case of judgments rendered by the courts of a sister state, since the “very purpose” of Art. IV, § 1 was “to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation.” Milwaukee County v. White Co., supra, pp. 276-277.  This Court, to be sure, has recognized that in case of statutes, “the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed,” some “accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states” is necessary.  Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, <citedDecision>294 U. S. 532, 547</citedDecision> .  But that principle would come into play only in case the Nevada decrees were assailed on the ground that Nevada must give full faith and credit in its divorce proceedings to the divorce statutes of North Carolina.  Even then, it would be of no avail here.  For as stated in .the Alaska Packers case, “Prima facie every state is entitled to enforce in its own courts its own statutes, lawfully enacted.  One who challenges that right, because of the force given to a conflicting statute of another state by the full faith and credit clause, assumes the burden of showing, upon some rational basis, that of the conflicting interests involved those of the foreign state are superior to those of the *296 forum.” Id., pp. 547-548.  It is difficult to perceive how North Carolina could be said to have an interest in Nevada’s domiciliaries superior to the interest of Nevada.  Nor is there any authority which lends support to the view that the full faith and credit clause compels the courts of one state to subordinate the local policy of that state, as respects its domiciliaries, to the statutes of any other state.

 They seem to rest on tire doctrine that the state where the land is located is “sole mistress” of its rules of real property.  See Hood v. McGehee, supra, p. 615 ; and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in Fall v. Eastin, supra, p. 14 .  That the case of Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., 191 U. S. 373 , is not an exception but only an appropriate application of the doctrine of Jorum non conveniens, see Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642-643 .  It has been repeatedly stated that the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to enforce the penal laws of another.  See, for example, Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U. S. 657, 666 ; Converse *295 v. Hamilton, 224 U. S. 243, 260 ; Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U. S. 145 , 160.  But the question of whether a judgment based on a penalty is entitled to full faith and credit was reserved in Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U. S. 268, 279 .  For other dicta that the application of the full faith and credit clause may be limited by the policy of the law of the forum, see Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, supra, p. 160; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm’n, <citedDecision>294 U. S. 532, 546</citedDecision> ; Broderick v. Rosner, supra, note 5, p. 642 .  Grover & Baker Machine Co. v. Radcliffe, 137 U. S. 287 ; National Exchange Bank v. Wiley, 195 U. S. 257 ; Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 U. S. 394 ; Chicago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 U. S. 25, 29 ; Flexner v. Parson, 248 U. S. 289 .  Sec. 9460, Nev. Comp. L. 1929, as amended L. 1931, p. 161, supra, note 3.  The fact that a stay in a state is not for long is not necessarily fatal to the existence of a domicil.  As stated in Williamson v. Osenton, 232 U. S. 619, 624 , the “essential fact that raises a change of abode to a change of domicil is the absence of any intention to live elsewhere.” The intention to stay for a time to which a person “did not then contemplate an end” was held sufficient.  Id., p. 625.  And see District of Columbia v. Murphy, 314 U. S. 441 .
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Frankfurter, concurring: I join in the opinion of the Court but think it appropriate to add a few words. Article 91 of the British North America Act (1867) gives the Parliament of Canada exclusive legislative authority to deal with marriage and divorce. Similarly, Article 51 of the Australia Constitution Act (1900) empowers the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to marriage and divorce. The Constitution of the United States, however, reserves authority over marriage and divorce to each of the forty-eight states. That is our starting-point. In a country like ours where each state has the constitutional power to translate into law its own notions of policy concerning the family institution, and where citizens pass freely from one state to another, tangled marital situations, like the one immediately before us, inevitably arise. They arose before and after the decision in the Haddock case, 201 U. S. 562 , and will, I daresay, continue to arise no matter what we do today. For these complications cannot be removed by any decisions this Court can make — neither the crudest nor the subtlest juggling of legal concepts could enable us to bring forth a uniform national law of marriage and divorce.' We are not authorized nor are we qualified to formulate a national code of domestic relations. We cannot, by *305 making “jurisdiction” depend upon a determination of who is the deserter and who the deserted, or upon the shifting notions of policy concealed by the cloudy abstraction of “matrimonial domicile,” turn this into a divorce and probate court for the United States. There may be some who think our modern social life is such that there is today a need, as there was not when the Constitution was framed, for vesting national authority over marriage and divorce in Congress, just as the national legislatures of Canada and Australia have been vested with such powers. Beginning in 1884, 1 numerous proposals to amend the Constitution to confer such authority have been introduced in Congress. But those whose business it is to amend the Constitution have not seen fit to amend it in this way. The need for securing national uniformity in dealing with divorce, either through constitutional amendment or by some other means, has long been the concern of the Conference of Governors and of special bodies convened to consider this problem. See, e. g., Proceedings of Governors’ Conference (1910) 185-98; Proceedings of National Congress on Uniform Divorce Laws (1906). This Court should abstain from trying to reach the same end by indirection. We should not feel challenged by a task that is not ours, even though it is difficult. Judicial attempts to solve problems that are intrinsically legislative — because their elements do not lend themselves to judicial judgment or because the necessary remedies are of a sort which judges cannot prescribe — are apt to be as futile in their achievement as they are presumptuous in their undertaking. *306 There is but one respect in which this Court can, within its traditional authority and professional competence, contribute uniformity to the law of marriage and divorce, and that is to enforce respect for the judgment of a state by its sister states when the judgment was rendered in accordance with settled procedural standards. As the Court's opinion shows, it is clearly settled that if a judgment is binding in the state where it was rendered, it is equally binding in every other state. This rule of law was not created by the federal courts. It comes from the Constitution and the Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 1 Stat. 122 . Congress has not exercised its power under the Full Faith and Credit Clause to meet the special problems raised by divorce decrees. There will be time enough to consider the scope of its power in this regard when Congress chooses to exercise it. The duty of a state to respect the judgments of a sister state arises only where such judgments meet the tests of justice and fair dealing that are embodied in the historic phrase, “due process of law.” But in this case all talk about due process is beside the mark. If the actions of the Nevada court had been taken “without due process of law,” the divorces which it purported to decree would have been without legal sanction in every state, including Nevada. There would be no occasion to consider the applicability of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. It is precisely because the Nevada decrees do satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause and are binding in Nevada upon the absent spouses that we are called upon to decide whether these judgments, unassailable in the state which rendered them, are, despite the commands of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, null and void elsewhere. North Carolina did not base its disregard of the Nevada decrees on the claim that they were a fraud and a sham, and no claim was made here on behalf of North Carolina *307 that the decrees were not valid in Nevada. It is indisputable that the Nevada decrees here, like the Connecticut decree in the Haddock case, were valid and binding in the state where they were rendered. Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U. S. 562, 569-70 ; Maynard v. Hill, 125 U. S. 190 ; Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U. S. 155 . In denying constitutional sanction to such a valid judgment outside the state which rendered it, the Haddock decision made an arbitrary break with the past and created distinctions incompatible with the role of this Court in enforcing the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Freed from the hopeless refinements introduced by that case, the question before us is simply whether the Nevada decrees were rendered under circumstances that would make them binding against the absent spouses in the state where they were rendered. North Carolina did not challenge the power of Nevada to declare the marital status of persons found to be Nevada residents. North Carolina chose instead to disrespect the consequences of Nevada’s exertion of such power. It is therefore no more rhetorical to say that Nevada is seeking to impose its policy upon North Carolina than it is to say that North Carolina is seeking to impose its policy upon Nevada. For all but a very small fraction of the community the niceties of resolving such conflicts among the laws of the states are, in all likelihood, matters of complete indifference. Our occasional pronouncements upon the requirements of the Full Faith and Credit Clause doubtless have little effect upon divorces. Be this as it may, a court is likely to lose its way if it strays outside the modest bounds of its own special competence and turns the duty of adjudicating only the legal phases of a broad social problem into an opportunity for formulating judgments of social policy quite beyond its competence as well as its authority. See Ames, Proposed Amendments to the Constitution of the United States during the First Century of its History, contained in the Annual Report of the American Historical Association, 1896, vol. II, p. 190; Sen. Doc. No. 93, 69th Cong., 1st Sess., and the successive compilations prepared by the Legislative Reference Service of the Library of Congress.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 It may be that for the purposes of that state the petitioners have been released from their marital vows, consistently with the procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, on the basis of compliance with its residential requirements and constructive service of process on the non-resident spouses.  But conceding the validity in Nevada of its decrees dissolving the marriages, it does not mechanically follow that the Full Faith and Credit Clause compels North Carolina to accept them.  We have recognized an area of flexibility in the application of the Clause to preserve and protect state policies in matters of vital public concern.  We have said that conflicts between such state policies should be resolved, “not by giving automatic effect to the full faith and credit clause, .  .  .  but by appraising the governmental interests of each jurisdiction, and turning the scale of decision according to their weight.” Alaska Packers Assn. v. Comm’n, <citedDecision>294 U. S. 532, 547</citedDecision> .  (See also Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U. S. 268, 273-274 , and compare the dissenting opinion in Yarborough v. Yarborough, 290 U. S. *310 202, 213-227 .) That Clause should no more be read “with literal exactness like a mathematical formula” than are other great and general clauses of the Constitution placing limitations upon the States to weld us into a Nation.  Cf. Home Bldg. & L. Assn. v. Blaisdell, 290 U. S. 398, 428 .  Rather it should be construed to harmonize its direction “with the necessary residuum of state power.” Id., at p. 435.  Prominent in the residuum of state power, as pointed out above, is the right of a state to deal with the marriage relations of its citizens and to pursue its chosen domestic policy of public morality in that connection.  Both Nevada and North Carolina have rights in this regard which are entitled to recognition.
**Combined Opinion**
