**Dissenting Opinion**
 *243 II The Court s concept of consistency assumes that there is no significant difference between a decision by the majority to impose a special burden on the members of a minority race and a decision by the majority to provide a benefit to certain members of that minority notwithstanding its incidental burden on some members of the majority.  In my opinion that assumption is untenable.  There is no moral or constitutional equivalence between a policy that is designed to perpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicate racial subordination.  Invidious discrimination is an engine of oppression, subjugating a disfavored group to enhance or maintain the power of the majority.  Remedial race-based preferences reflect the opposite impulse: a desire to foster equality in society.  No sensible conception of the Government’s constitutional obligation to “govern impartially,” Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 100 (1976), should ignore this distinction.  1 *244 To illustrate the point, consider our cases addressing the Federal Government’s discrimination against Japanese-Americans during World War II, Hirabayashi v. United States, <citedDecision>320 U. S. 81</citedDecision> (1943), and Korematsu v. United States, 323 U. S. 214 (1944).  The discrimination at issue in those cases was invidious because the Government imposed special burdens — a curfew and exclusion from certain areas on the West Coast 2 — on the members of a minority class defined by racial and ethnic characteristics.  Members of the same racially defined class exhibited exceptional heroism in the service of our country during that war.  Now suppose Congress decided to reward that service with a federal program that gave all Japanese-American veterans an extraordinary preference in Government employment.  Cf. Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256 (1979).  If Congress had done so, the same racial characteristics that motivated the discriminatory burdens in <citedDecision>Hirabayashi</citedDecision> and Korematsu would have defined the preferred class of veterans.  Nevertheless, “consistency” surely would not require us to describe the incidental burden on everyone else in the country as “odious” or “invidious” as those terms were used in those cases. We should reject a concept of “consistency” that would view the special preferences that the National Government has provided to Native Americans since 1834 3 *245 as comparable to the official discrimination against African-Americans that was prevalent for much of our history.  The consistency that the Court espouses would disregard the difference between a “No Trespassing” sign and a welcome mat.  It would treat a Dixiecrat Senator’s decision to vote against Thurgood Marshall’s confirmation in order to keep African-Americans off the Supreme Court as on a par with President Johnson’s evaluation of his nominee’s race as a positive factor.  It would equate a law that made black citizens ineligible for military service with a program aimed at recruiting black soldiers.  An attempt by the majority to exclude members of a minority race from a regulated market is fundamentally different from a subsidy that enables a relatively small group of newcomers to enter that market.  An interest in “consistency” does not justify treating differences as though they were similarities.

 See Missouri v. Jenkins, ante, at 112 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“[Tjime and again, we have recognized the ample authority legislatures possess to combat racial injustice .... It is only by applying strict scrutiny that we can distinguish between unconstitutional discrimination and narrowly tailored remedial programs that legislatures may enact to further the compelling governmental interest in redressing the effects of past discrimination”).  Even if this is so, however, I think it is unfortunate that the majority insists on applying the label “strict scrutiny” to benign race-based programs.  That label has usually been understood to spell the death of any governmental action to which a court may apply it.  The Court suggests today that “strict scrutiny” means something different — something less strict — when applied to benign racial classifications.  Although I agree that benign programs deserve different treatment than invidious programs, there is a danger that the fatal language of “strict scrutiny” will *244 skew the analysis and place well-crafted benign programs at unnecessary risk.  These were, of course, neither the sole nor the most shameful burdens the Government imposed on Japanese-Americans during that War.  They were, however, the only such burdens this Court had occasion to address in <citedDecision>Hirabayashi</citedDecision> and Korematsu .  See Korematsu, 323 U. S., at 223 (“Regardless of the true nature of the assembly and relocation centers ... we are dealing specifically with nothing but an exclusion order”).  See Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 541 (1974).  To be eligible for the preference in 1974, an individual had to “ ‘be one fourth or more degree Indian blood and be a member of a Federally-recognized tribe.’ ” Id., at 553, n. 24 , quoting 44 BIAM 335, 3.1 (1972).  We concluded that the classi *245 fication was not “racial” because it did not encompass all Native Americans.  417 U. S., at 553-554 .  In upholding it, we relied in part on the plenary power of Congress to legislate on behalf of Indian tribes.
