  WILLIAM C. CONNER, District Judge.

<p id="b222-17">
  This is an
  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  action to enforce maritime liens under 46 U.S.C.App. § 971. Plaintiff alleges that it has not been paid for bunker fuel furnished to defendant’s vessel in Saudi Arabia and New York, and that it is therefore entitled to liens. Defendant contends that no enforceable liens exist. The parties have cross-moved for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56, Fed.R. Civ.P. Plaintiff’s lien claim for the delivery in Saudi Arabia is dismissed for want of admiralty jurisdiction. Judgment is granted in plaintiff’s favor, however, with respect to the fuel delivered in New York.
 </p>
<p id="b222-18">
  BACKGROUND
 </p>
<p id="b222-19">
  Defendant Central Gulf Lines, Inc. (“Central Gulf”) is the owner of a vessel, the Green Harbour ex William Hooper (the “Hooper”). The Hooper was built in the United States with subsidies and financing provided by the federal government. She is classified by the American Bureau of Shipping, and flies the United States flag. Her port of registry is New Orleans, Louisiana.
 </p>
<p id="b222-20">
  The Hooper was chartered by a bareboat charter party to the Waterman Steamship Corporation (“Waterman”). Waterman used the Hooper in its U.S. flag common carrier service between ports in the United States and ports in the Middle East.
 </p>
<p id="b222-21">
  For forty years, plaintiff Exxon Corporation (“Exxon”) was Waterman’s exclusive worldwide supplier of gas and bunker fuel oil. Waterman and Exxon negotiated a marine fuel requirements contract in 1983. The unsigned document set minimum and maximum purchase limits. It provided that the fuel would be provided by the “Seller” (Exxon) or by “Supplying Companies, referred to in Seller’s ‘International Contract Price List for Marine Fuel Delivered as Ships’ Bunkers.’” Exhibit 3 to Affidavit of James E. Sharkey.
 </p>
<p id="b222-22">
  When Waterman wished to make a purchase pursuant to this agreement, it telephoned Exxon, providing the details of the vessel to be bunkered and the place and
  <span citation-index="1" class="star-pagination" label="157"> 
   *157
   </span>
  approximate time of loading. Exxon would either effect delivery on its own, or direct its local supplier to deliver the bunkers to the vessel. Exxon would invoice Waterman for the fuel supplied, and if a local supplier was used, pay its supplier.
 </p>
<p id="b223-3">
  Apparently, Exxon did not rely on local suppliers when providing ships with fuel in New York. Exxon alleges that on October 7, 1983, it supplied the Hooper with 41.929 tons of gas oil in New York. Exxon invoiced Waterman for $13,241.63 on October 18, 1983.
 </p>
<p id="b223-4">
  Whenever Exxon procured bunker fuel for Waterman vessels at the port in Jed-dah, Saudi Arabia, it used a local supplier, Arabian Marine Operating Co., Ltd. (“Arabian Marine”). The agreement controlling the relationship between Exxon and Arabian Marine provided that: “Exxon shall solicit and arrange for the sale of marine fuels to international customers having bunkering requirements at the port of Jed-dah. Arabian Marine shall supply marine fuels to those customers nominated by Exxon.” In return for Exxon’s services, Arabian Marine agreed to pay Exxon a “commission.” Under the terms of the agreement, Exxon would never actually own the fuel. “Title to all fuel delivered by Arabian Marine to the nominated customers solicited by Exxon will pass directly from Arabian Marine to the customer at the flange of the receiving vessel.” Exhibit 4 to Affidavit of James E. Sharkey.
 </p>
<p id="b223-5">
  Around January, 1982, Arabian Marine began providing its customers with certain discounts at Jeddah. Since Exxon’s company policy did not permit it to participate in this practice in Saudi Arabia, it suggested that Waterman make its own arrangements for price and supplies. Waterman elected to negotiate directly with Arabian Marine. Exhibit 4 to Affidavit of James E. Sharkey.
 </p>
<p id="b223-6">
  As of this time, Exxon was no longer involved in Waterman’s purchase of bunkers in Jeddah. As a matter of courtesy to their long-time customer, Exxon allowed Waterman to use its communications system so that Waterman could more easily transmit its orders to Arabian Marine. Exxon was no longer informed of the specifics of these deliveries, and received no payments on account of them.
 </p>
<p id="b223-9">
  On September 29, 1983, Waterman placed an order with Arabian Marine for the delivery of bunker fuel to be delivered to the Hooper in Jeddah on October 25, 1983. In mid-October, 1983, Arabian Marine informed Exxon that, due to Waterman’s financial condition, it would no longer deal directly with Waterman, and suggested that the previous arrangement be restored. Exxon consented. On October 26,1983, Arabian Marine delivered 4,242.47 tons of bunker fuel oil to the Hooper pursuant to the original agreement. Exxon was invoiced for this delivery on October 31, 1983. The invoice was paid by Exxon on November 15, 1983. Waterman was invoiced for $763,644.60 on November 8, 1983.
 </p>
<p id="b223-10">
  Waterman filed a Chapter 11 reorganization proceeding on December 1, 1983. On November 14, 1984, Exxon, Central Gulf, and Waterman reached an agreement under which Central Gulf consented to assume personal liability for the deliveries if this Court decides that the Hooper is liable
  <em>
   in rem
  </em>
  on account of the deliveries. Central Gulf also provided Exxon with a letter of credit as security for its promise.
 </p>
<p id="b223-11">
  A reorganization plan for Waterman was confirmed on June 19, 1986. It entitled Exxon to pursue this claim. Exxon has received, under the reorganization plan, certain cash and stock dividends. Exxon admits that its claim should be diminished by the amount that it receives under the reorganization plan.

   Choice of Law
  </em>
</p>
<p id="b224-5">
  Plaintiff Exxon contends that American law should govern whether maritime liens exist in this case. Defendant does not oppose this contention. I agree that this case should be decided according to American law. The United States has a significant interest in this case. The shipowner, the charterer, the ship, and the plaintiff were all American. On the other hand, Saudi Arabia has no interest in having its law apply in this case. The only foreign participant in this transaction, Arabian Marine, was not injured.

   The Maritime Liens
  </em>
</p>
<p id="ASS">
  Plaintiff Exxon claims that it is entitled to liens under Section 30, Subsec. P of the Federal Maritime Lien Act (the “Act”). The Act provides, in pertinent part:
 </p>
<blockquote id="b224-7">
  Any person furnishing ... supplies ... or other necessaries, to any vessel, whether foreign or domestic, upon the order of the owner of such vessel, or of a person authorized by the owner, shall have a maritime lien on the vessel, which may be enforced by suit in rem, and it shall not be necessary to allege or prove that credit was given to the vessel.
 </blockquote>

  46 U.S.C.App. § 971.
 </p>
<p id="b224-10">
  Defendant Central Gulf denies the existence of the Saudi Arabian lien on three alternative grounds: (1) Exxon did not “furnish” the Hooper with bunker fuel in Jeddah; (2) Exxon’s intervention in the Jed-dah transaction was a response to Arabian Marine’s request, not Waterman’s “order”; and (3) Exxon did not rely on the credit of the Hooper. Defendant denies the existence of the New York lien on the ground that there is no proof that Exxon delivered gas to the Hooper in New York.

  Applying the principles enunciated in
  <em>
   Peralta
  </em>
  to the facts at hand, it is evident that Exxon’s arrangement to procure fuel for the Hooper in Saudi Arabia was not a maritime contract. Admittedly, Exxon’s contract with Waterman is not called an “agency contract.” Indeed, it refers to Exxon as a “seller,” not a procurer, of marine fuel. Yet “the focus of our inquiry must not be on the name assigned to the contract, but rather on the nature of the services to be performed.”

<p id="b226-6">
  Under the contract, Exxon served in two distinct capacities. Its first role was as a supplier of marine fuels. When Waterman vessels called at ports where Exxon maintains its own blinker stations, Exxon promised to physically deliver the bunkers. When the vessels, however, called at ports where Exxon depends on local suppliers, Exxon promised to arrange for the local suppliers to provide Waterman ships with fuel. When acting in this latter capacity, Exxon was merely Waterman’s agent.
 </p>
<p id="b226-7">
  Exxon wore its agency hat when it procured bunkers for the Hooper in Jeddah. Its services with respect to the Jeddah delivery included taking Waterman’s order, contacting Arabian Marine, maintaining a bunkers contract with Arabian Marine, and advancing Waterman the purchase price by paying Arabian Marine. It never actually possessed the fuel that was supplied to the Hooper at Jeddah. Indeed, pursuant to Exxon’s contract with Arabian Marine, title to the fuel passed directly from Arabian Marine to the Hooper. In return for these services, Exxon received a commission which was deducted from Arabian Marine’s invoice to Exxon. In sum, Exxon’s role in the transaction was strictly “shoreside,”

  As a way of getting around the jurisdictional difficulty in this case, it might be argued that Exxon furnished the Hooper with the credit it needed to obtain the fuel, and thus was not a mere agent. That Exxon advanced the Hooper needed cash is admitted by Central Gulf. Defendant’s Memorandum of Law at 19-20 (“Exxon acted, as a guarantor of payment under the bunkering agreement ... ”). Defendant suggests, however, that a lien claimed by virtue of Exxon’s extension of credit would arise only by subrogation, and would be governed by Saudi Arabian law.

  The contract between Exxon and Waterman can be divided into the separate fuel orders. Each delivery was a separate occurrence; Exxon sent Waterman a separate bill for each transaction. Moreover, the deliveries could be divided into two groups: a first, in which Exxon relied on local suppliers to provide Waterman ships with the bunkers; and a second, in which Exxon delivered its own fuel to the vessels.

  Central Gulf has failed to produce any credible evidence controverting Exxon’s contention that it delivered bunkers to the Hooper in New York, and the evidence submitted by Exxon is sufficient to warrant summary judgment in its favor. Central Gulf admits that around October 7,

  1983, the Hooper requested Exxon to supply it with fuel in New York. It claims however, that the “bunkers were, in fact, delivered to the vessel by a supplier other than Exxon.” Affidavit of Francis A. Montbach 116. Apparently, Central Gulfs belief that Exxon did not deliver the fuel is based on Exxon’s failure “to produce even the most crucial piece of evidence; the delivery receipt.” Central Gulfs Reply Memorandum at 16. Exxon admits that “no bunker receipt ... has been found despite a diligent search,” Exxon’s Reply Memorandum at 2, but has supplied the Court with affidavits asserting that the delivery took place. Adam Rudzki, a Credit Manager at Exxon, disputes that “the fuel oil delivered to the WILLIAM HOOPER in New York on January 7,1983 was made by an entity other than Exxon,” and swears that the delivery “was made by Exxon Company, U.S.A. which was then, and still is, an unincorporated division of Exxon Corporation.” To this defendant responds that “Mr. Rudzki, who is not a marine salesman, ... must have obtained such knowledge from business records kept by Exxon.” Central Gulf’s Reply Memorandum at 16. Yet James Sharkey, who

  a marine salesman for Exxon, also swears that “[i]n accordance with [the Hooper’s] request, Exxon delivered the gas oil in question and subsequently invoiced Waterman (and the vessel) for this.” Affidavit of James E. Sharkey ¶ 12. Ironically, the only affidavit that defendant submits to dispute Exxon’s evidence is that of Francis Mont-bach, the attorney who represents Central Gulf in this litigation, and who has no personal knowledge of the transaction.
