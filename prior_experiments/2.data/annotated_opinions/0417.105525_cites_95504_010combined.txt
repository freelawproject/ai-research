To state such a proposition demonstrates the impossibility of carrying it into practice. Again, if the United States shall acquire by treaty the cession of territory having an established system of jurisprudence, where jury trials are unknown, but a method of fair and orderly trial prevails under an acceptable and long-established code, the preference of the people must be disregarded, their established customs ignored and they themselves coerced to accept, in advance of incorporation into the United States, a system of trial unknown to them and unsuited to their needs. We do not think it was intended, in giving power to Congress to make regulations for the territories, to hamper its exercise with this condition." Dorr v. United States, 195 U.S. 138 , 148. [6] *53 The "fundamental right" test is the one which the Court has consistently enunciated in the long series of cases e. g., American Ins. Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511 ; De Lima v. Bidwell, 182 U.S. 1 ; Downes v. Bidwell, <targetCase>182 U.S. 244</targetCase> ; Dorr v. United States, 195 U.S. 138 , Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U.S. 298 dealing with claims of constitutional restrictions on the power of Congress to "make all needful Rules and Regulations" for governing the unincorporated territories. The process of decision appropriate to the problem led to a detailed examination of the relation of the specific "Territory" to the United States. This examination, in its similarity to analysis in terms of "due process," is essentially the same as that to be made in the present cases in weighing congressional power to make "Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" against the safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The results in the cases that arose by reason of the acquisition of exotic "Territory" do not control the present cases, for the territorial cases rest specifically on Art. IV, § 3, which is a grant of power to Congress to deal with "Territory" and other Government property. Of course the power sought to be exercised in Great Britain and Japan does not relate to "Territory." [7] The Court's *54 opinions in the territorial cases did not lay down a broad principle that the protective provisions of the Constitution do not apply outside the continental limits of the United States.

Bidwell, <targetCase>182 U.S. 244</targetCase> , the first of the "Insular Cases" was decided over vigorous dissents from Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, joined by Justices Harlan, Brewer, and Peckham, and from Mr. Justice Harlan separately. The four dissenters took the position that all the restraints of the Bill of Rights and of other parts of the Constitution were applicable to the United States Government wherever it acted. This was the position which the Court had consistently followed prior to the "Insular Cases." See, e. g., Thompson v. Utah, 170 U.S. 343 ; Callan v. Wilson, 127 U.S. 540 . [25] As to the great significance of the right to trial by jury see text at note 13, supra, and the authorities referred to in that note. [26] Later the Court held that once a territory become "incorporated" all of the constitutional protections became "applicable." See, e. g., Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U.S. 516 , 520-521.
