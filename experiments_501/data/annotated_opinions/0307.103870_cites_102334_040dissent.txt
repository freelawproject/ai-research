**Dissenting Opinion**
 Most unwillingly, therefore, I must differ from my brethren with regard to legislation like this.  I cannot bring my mind to believe that the “liberty” secured by the Due Process Clause gives this Court authority to deny to the State of West Virginia the attainment of that which we all recognize as a legitimate legislative end, namely, the promo-' tion of good citizenship, by employment of the means here chosen.  Not so long ago we were admonished that “the only check upon our own exercise of power is our own sense of self-restraint.  For the removal of unwise laws from the statute books appeal lies not to the courts but to the ballot and to the processes of democratic government.” *648 United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1, 79 (dissent).  We have been told that generalities do not decide concrete cases. But the intensity with which a general principle is held may determine a particular issue, and whether we put first things first may decide a specific controversy.  The admonition that judicial self-restraint alone limits arbitrary exercise of our authority is relevant every time we are asked to nullify legislation.  The Constitution does not give us greater veto power when dealing with one phase of “liberty” than with another, or when dealing with grade school regulations than with college regulations that offend conscience, as was the case in Hamilton v. Regents, <citedDecision>293 U. S. 245</citedDecision> .  In neither situation is our function comparable to that of a legislature or are we free to act as though we were a super-legislature.  Judicial self-restraint is equally necessary whenever an exercise of 'political or legislative power is challenged.  There is no warrant in the constitutional basis of this Court’s authority for attributing different roles to it depending upon the nature of the challenge to the legislation.  Our power does not vary according to the particular provision of the Bill of Rights which is invoked.  The right not to have property taken without just compensation has, so far as the scope of judicial power is concerned, the same constitutional dignity as the right to be protected against unreasonable searches and seizures, and the latter has no less claim than freedom of the press or freedom of speech or religious freedom.  In no instance is this Court the primary protector of the particular liberty that is invoked.

 An act compelling profession of allegiance to a religion, no matter how subtly or tenuously promoted, is bad.  But an act promoting good citizenship and national allegiance is within the domain of governmental authority and is therefore to be judged by the same considerations of power and of constitutionality as those involved in the many *655 claims of immunity from civil obedience because of religious scruples.  That claims are pressed on behalf of sincere religious convictions does not of itself establish their constitutional validity.  Nor does waving the banner of religious freedom relieve us from examining into the power we are asked to deny the states.  Otherwise the doctrine of separation of church and state, so cardinal in the history of this nation and for the liberty of our people, would mean not the disestablishment of a state church but the establishment of all churches and of all religious groups.  The subjection of dissidents to the general requirement of saluting the flag, as a measure conducive to the training of children in good citizenship, is very far from being the first instance of exacting obedience to general laws that have offended deep religious scruples.  Compulsory vaccination, see Jacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U. S. 11 , food inspection regulations, see Shapiro v. Lyle, 30 F. 2d 971 , the obligation to bear arms, see Hamilton v. Regents, <citedDecision>293 U. S. 245, 267</citedDecision> , testimonial duties, see Stansbury v. Marks, 2 Dall. 213 , compulsory medical treatment, see People v. Vogelgesang, 221 N. Y. 290 , 116 N. E. 977 — these are but illustrations of conduct that has often been compelled in the enforcement of legislation of general applicability even though the religious consciences of particular individuals rebelled at the exaction.  Law is concerned with external behavior and not with the inner life of man.  It rests in large measure upon compulsion.  Socrates lives in history partly because he gave his life for the conviction that duty of obedience to secular law does not presuppose consent to its enactment or belief in its virtue.  The consent upon which free government rests is the consent that comes from sharing in the process of making and unmaking laws.  The state is not shut out from a domain because the individual conscience may deny the state’s claim.  The individual con *656 science may profess what faith it chooses.  It may affirm and promote that faith — in the language of the Constitution, it may “exercise” it freely — but it cannot thereby restrict community action through political organs in matters of community concern, so long as the action is not asserted in a discriminatory way either openly or by stealth.  One may have the right to practice one’s religion and at the same time owe the duty of formal obedience to laws that run counter to one’s beliefs.  Compelling belief implies denial of opportunity to combat it and to assert dissident views.  Such compulsion is one thing.  Quite another matter is submission to conformity of action while denying its wisdom or virtue and with ample opportunity for seeking its change or abrogation.  In Hamilton v. Regents, <citedDecision>293 U. S. 245</citedDecision> , this Court unanimously held that one attending a state-maintained university cannot refuse attendance on courses that offend his religious scruples.  That decision is not overruled today, but is distinguished on the ground that attendance at the institution for higher education was voluntary and therefore a student could not refuse compliance with its conditions and yet take advantage of its opportunities.  But West Virginia does not compel the attendance at its public schools of the children here concerned.  West Virginia does not so compel, for it cannot.  This Court denied the right of a state to require its children to attend public schools.  Pierce v. Society of Sisters, 268 U. S. 510 .  As to its public schools, West Virginia imposes conditions which it deems necessary in the development of future citizens precisely as California deemed necessary the requirements that offended the student’s conscience in the <citedDecision>Hamilton</citedDecision> case. The need for higher education and the duty of the state to provide it as part of a public educational system, are part of the democratic faith of most of our states.  The right to secure such education in institutions not maintained by public funds is unquestioned.  *657 But the practical opportunities for obtaining what is becoming in increasing measure the conventional equipment of American youth may be no less burdensome than that which parents are increasingly called upon to bear in sending their children to parochial schools because the education provided by public schools, though supported by their taxes, does not satisfy their ethical and educational necessities.  I find it impossible, so far as constitutional power is concerned, to differentiate what was sanctioned in the <citedDecision>Hamilton</citedDecision> case from what is nullified in this case. And for me it still remains to be explained why the grounds of Mr. Justice Cardozo’s opinion in <citedDecision>Hamilton</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Regents, supra,</citedDecision> are not sufficient to sustain the flag salute requirement.  Such a requirement, like the requirement in the <citedDecision>Hamilton</citedDecision> case, “is not an interference by the state with the free exercise of religion when the liberties of the constitution are read in the light of a century and a half of history during days of peace and war.” <citedDecision>293 U. S. 245, 266</citedDecision> .  The religious worshiper, “if his liberties were to be thus extended, might refuse to contribute taxes ... in furtherance of any other end condemned by his conscience as irreligious or immoral.  The right of private judgment has never yet been so exalted above the powers and the compulsion of the agencies of government.” <citedDecision>Id., at 268</citedDecision> .  Parents have the privilege of choosing which schools they wish their children to attend.  And the question here is whether the state may make certain requirements that seem to it desirable or important for the proper education of those future citizens who go to schools maintained by the states, or whether the pupils in those schools may be relieved from those requirements if they run counter to the consciences of their parents.  Not only have parents the right to send children to schools of their own choosing but the state has no right to bring such schools “under a strict governmental control” or give “affirmative direction *658 concerning the intimate and essential details of such schools, entrust their control to public officers, and deny both owners and patrons reasonable choice and discretion in respect of teachers, curriculum, and textbooks.” Farrington v. Tokushige, 273 U. S. 284, 298 .  Why should not the state likewise have constitutional power to make reasonable provisions for the proper instruction of children in schools maintained by it?  When dealing with religious scruples we are dealing with an almost numberless variety of doctrines and beliefs entertained with equal sincerity by the particular groups for which they satisfy man’s needs in his relation to the mysteries of the universe.  There are in the United States more than 250 distinctive established religious denominations.
