 Obviously, Dixon could not commit an "offence" under this provision until an order setting out conditions was issued.  The statute by itself imposes no legal obligation on anyone.  Dixon's cocaine possession, although an offense under D. C. Code Ann. § 33-541(a) (1988 and Supp. 1992), was not an offense under § 23-1329 until a *698 judge incorporated the statutory drug offense into his release order.  In this situation, in which the contempt sanction is imposed for violating the order through commission of the incorporated drug offense, the later attempt to prosecute Dixon for the drug offense resembles the situation that produced our judgment of double jeopardy in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977) (per curiam) .  There we held that a subsequent prosecution for robbery with a firearm was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause, because the defendant had already been tried for felony murder based on the same underlying felony.  We have described our terse per curiam in Harris as standing for the proposition that, for double jeopardy purposes, "the crime generally described as felony murder" is not "a separate offense distinct from its various elements." Illinois v. Vitale, <citedDecision>447 U. S. 410, 420-421</citedDecision> (1980).  Accord, Whalen v. United States, 445 U. S. 684, 694 (1980).  So too here, the "crime" of violating a condition of release cannot be abstracted from the "element" of the violated condition.  The Dixon court order incorporated the entire governing criminal code in the same manner as the Harris felony-murder statute incorporated the several enumerated felonies.  Here, as in Harris , the underlying substantive criminal offense is "a species of lesser-included offense." [2] <citedDecision>Vitale, supra, at 420</citedDecision> .  Accord, Whalen, supra .  *699 To oppose this analysis, the Government can point only to dictum in In re Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 594, 599-600 (1895), which, to the extent it attempted to exclude certain nonsummary contempt prosecutions from various constitutional protections for criminal defendants, has been squarely rejected by cases such as Bloom, 391 U. S., at 208.  The Government also relies upon In re Chapman, 166 U. S. 661 (1897), and Jurney v. MacCracken, 294 U. S. 125 (1935), which recognize Congress' power to punish as contempt the refusal of a witness to testify before it.  But to say that Congress can punish such a refusal is not to say that a criminal court can punish the same refusal yet again.  Neither case dealt with that issue, and Chapman specifically declined to address it, noting that successive prosecutions (before Congress for contemptuous refusal to testify and before a court for violation of a federal statute making such refusal a crime) were "improbable." 166 U. S., at 672 .

 Immediately *707 after stating that conviction for felony murder, a "greater crime," "cannot be had without conviction of the lesser crime," the Harris Court quotes Nielsen `s statement that "`a person [who] has been tried and convicted for a crime which has various incidents included in it, .  .  .  cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents.' " 433 U. S., at 682-683 , quoting from 131 U. S., at 188 .  It is clear from that context that Harris regarded "incidents included" to mean "offenses included"a reference to defined crimes rather than to conduct.  Finally, Justice Souter misdescribes <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> .  Despite his bold assertion to the contrary, see post, at 757, <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> unquestionably reads Harris as merely an application of the double jeopardy bar to lesser and greater included offenses.  [11] Justice Souter instead elevates the statement in <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> that, on certain hypothetical facts, the petitioner would have a "substantial" "claim" of double jeopardy on a Grady -type theory, see post, at 756-757, into a holding that the petitioner would win on that theory.  Post, at 757, 763.  No Justice, the <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> dissenters included, has ever construed this passage as answering, rather than simply raising, the question on which we later granted certiorari in Grady .  See <citedDecision>447 U. S., at 426</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., dissenting) (in addition to finding the same-conduct claim "substantial," dissent would find it "dispositive").  See also Grady, 495 U. S., at 510 ( <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> "suggested" same-conduct test adopted in Grady ).  In contrast to the above-discussed dicta relied upon by Justice Souter, there are two pre- Grady ( and post Nielsen ) cases that are directly on point.  In both Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S., at 343 , and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), the Court upheld subsequent *708 prosecutions after concluding that the Blockburger test (and only the Blockburger test) was satisfied.  [12] These cases are incompatible with the belief that Nielsen had created an additional requirement beyond the "elements" standard.  [13] Totally ignored by Justice Souter are the *709 many early American cases construing the Double Jeopardy Clause, which support only an "elements" test.  See Grady, supra, at 533-535 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  [14] But Grady was not only wrong in principle; it has already proved unstable in application.

 Justice Blackmun, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.  I cannot agree that contempt of court is the "same offence" under the Double Jeopardy Clause as either assault with intent to kill or possession of cocaine with intent to distribute it.  I write separately to emphasize two interrelated points.  I I agree with Justice Souter that "the Blockburger test is not the exclusive standard for determining whether the rule against successive prosecutions applies in a given case." Post, at 756.  I also share both his and Justice White's dismay that the Court so cavalierly has overruled a precedent that is barely three years old and that has proved neither unworkable nor unsound.  I continue to believe that Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), was correctly decided, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a subsequent criminal prosecution where the proof required to convict on the later offense would require proving conduct that constitutes an offense for which a defendant already has been prosecuted.  If this were a case involving successive prosecutions under the substantive criminal law (as was true in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), Illinois v. Vitale, <citedDecision>447 U. S. 410</citedDecision> (1980), and Grady ), I would agree that the Double Jeopardy *742 Clause could bar the subsequent prosecution.  But we are concerned here with contempt of court, a special situation.  We explained in Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., 481 U. S. 787 (1987): "The fact that we have come to regard criminal contempt as `a crime in the ordinary sense,' [ Bloom v. Illi- nois, 391 U. S. 194, 201 (1968)], does not mean that any prosecution of contempt must now be considered an execution of the criminal law in which only the Executive Branch may engage.  .  .  .  That criminal procedure protections are now required in such prosecutions should not obscure the fact that these proceedings are not intended to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws.

 .  cannot be a second time tried for one of those incidents without being twice put in jeopardy for the same offence.' In re Nielsen, *756 [131 U. S.,] at 188." 433 U. S., at 682-683 (citations and footnote omitted).  [7] Just as in Nielsen , the analysis in Harris turned on considering the prior conviction in terms of the conduct actually charged.  While that process might be viewed as a misapplication of a Blockburger lesser included offense analysis, the crucial point is that the Blockburger elements test would have produced a different result.  The case thus follows the holding in Nielsen and conforms to the statement already quoted from Brown , that the Blockburger test is not the exclusive standard for determining whether the rule against successive prosecutions applies in a given case. Subsequently, in Illinois v. Vitale, <citedDecision>447 U. S. 410</citedDecision> (1980), the Court again indicated that a valid claim of double jeopardy would not necessarily be defeated by the fact that the two offenses are not the "same" under the Blockburger test.  In that case, we were confronted with a prosecution for failure to reduce speed and a subsequent prosecution for involuntary manslaughter.  The opinion of the Illinois Supreme Court below had not made it clear whether the elements of failure to slow were always necessarily included within the elements of involuntary manslaughter by automobile, and we remanded for clarification of this point, among other things.  We held that "[i]f, as a matter of Illinois law, a careless failure to slow is always a necessary element of manslaughter by automobile, then the two offenses are the `same' under Blockburger and Vitale's trial on the latter charge would constitute double jeopardy .  .  .  ." <citedDecision>447 U. S., at 419-420</citedDecision> .  But that was not all. Writing for the Court, Justice White went on to say that, "[i]n any event, it may be that to sustain its manslaughter case the State may find it necessary *757 to prove a failure to slow or to rely on conduct necessarily involving such failure .  .  .  .  In that case, because Vitale has already been convicted for conduct that is a necessary element of the more serious crime for which he has been charged, his claim of double jeopardy would be substantial under Brown and our later decision in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977)." Id., at 420.  Over a decade ago, then, we clearly understood Harris to stand for the proposition that when one has already been tried for a crime comprising certain conduct, a subsequent prosecution seeking to prove the same conduct is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  [8] This is in no way inconsistent with <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> `s description of Harris as "treat[ing] a killing in the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense, and the robbery as a species of lesser-included offense." <citedDecision>447 U. S., at 420</citedDecision> .  The very act of "treating" it that way was a departure from straight Blockburger analysis; it was the same departure taken by the Nielsen Court. <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> read Harris (which itself quoted Nielsen ) to hold that even if the Blockburger test were satisfied, a second prosecution would not be permitted for conduct comprising the criminal act charged in the first.  Nielsen and Harris used the word "incident," while <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> used the word "conduct," but no matter which word is used to describe the unlawful activity for which one cannot again be forced to stand trial, the import of this successive-prosecution strand of our double jeopardy jurisprudence is clear.  Even if this had not been clear since the time of In re Nielsen, any debate should have been settled by our decision three Terms ago in Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), *758 that "the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a subsequent prosecution if, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, the government will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted." Id., at 510 (footnote omitted).  Grady did nothing more than apply a version of the Nielsen rule.  As against this sequence of consistent reasoning from Nielsen to Grady , the Court's citation to two cases, Gavieres v. United States, 220 U. S. 338, 343 (1911), and Burton v. United States, 202 U. S. 344, 379-381 (1906), cannot validate its insistence that, prior to Grady , our exclusive standard for barring successive prosecutions under the Double Jeopardy Clause was the Blockburger test.  See ante, at 707-708.  Burton came before the Court on a demurrer.

 .  .  with intent to kill" as a result of his actions on May 21, 1988.  App. 43-44.  The Court concludes that the later prosecutions are not barred, because in its view the offenses charged in the indictment each contained an element not contained in the contempt charge (with respect to the threats, that they be threats to kidnap, to inflict bodily injury, or to damage property; with respect to the assault, that it be undertaken with an intent to kill); and *763 because the contempt charge contained an element not specified by the criminal code sections that formed the basis for the indictment (violation of the CPO).  See ante, at 700-703.  [11] In each instance, however, the second prosecution is barred under Nielsen, Harris as we construed it in <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> , and Grady .  The conduct at issue constituted the conduct in the contempts first charged as well as in the crimes subsequently prosecuted, and the Government's prosecution of Foster twice for the conduct common to both would violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  VIII Grady simply applied a rule with roots in our cases going back well over 100 years.  Nielsen held that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars successive prosecutions for more than one statutory offense where the charges comprise the same act, and Harris, as understood in <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> , is properly read as standing for the same rule.  Overruling Grady alone cannot remove this principle from our constitutional jurisprudence.  Only by uprooting the entire sequence of cases, Grady, Vitale, Harris, and Nielsen , could this constitutional principle be undone.  Because I would not do that, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I concur in the judgment of the Court in Dixon and with respect to Count I in Foster, but respectfully dissent from the disposition of the case with respect to Counts IIV in Foster.

See Black's Law Dictionary 762 (6th ed. 1990) (defining "incidents of ownership"); J. Bouvier, Law Dictionary 783-784 (1883) (defining "incident" and giving examples of "incident to a reversion," and "incidents" to a contract).  That is perfectly clear from the very next sentence of Nielsen (which Justice Souter does not quote): "It may be contended that adultery is not an incident of unlawful cohabitation .  .  .  . "131 U. S.,at 189.  [12]  There is, for example, no other way to read the following passage in Illinois v. <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> , quoted by Justice Souter, post, at 757: "[In Harris ] we treated a killing in the course of a robbery as itself a separate statutory offense, and the robbery as a species of lesser-included offense." <citedDecision>447 U. S. 410, 420</citedDecision> (1980).  [13]  Justice Souter contends that Burton is not in point because the case arose on a demurrer to the indictment, so that the Court "was not presented with the factual basis for the charges." Post, at 758.  It would be a rare and unsatisfactory indictment that did not set forth the factual basis for the charges.  The Court in Burton discusses the facts at length.  202 U. S., at 379-381 .  It is obvious, and it was assumed by the Court, that the same conduct was at issue in both indictments.

 The point is nailed down by the Court's discussion of intercourse as an "incident" of cohabitation, id., at 189, after having indicated that intercourse need not be pleaded or proven under a cohabitation indictment, id., at 187; if "incident" did mean "element," pleading and proof of intercourse would, of course, have been required.  "Incident" here clearly means "act." [7]  Our cases, of course, hold that the same protection inheres after an acquittal.  See North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U. S. 711, 717 (1969).  [8]  In Brown we recognized that "[a]n exception may exist where the State is unable to proceed on the more serious charge at the outset because the additional facts necessary to sustain that charge have not occurred or have not been discovered despite the exercise of due diligence." 432 U. S., at 169, n. 7 .  [9]  It is true that in light of its decision to remand the case to provide the State further opportunity to put forward some other basis for its prosecution, the <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> Court, appropriately, described the claim only as "substantial." The important point, however, is the way in which the Court in <citedDecision>Vitale</citedDecision> (and, for that matter, the dissent in that case, see <citedDecision>447 U. S., at 426</citedDecision> (opinion of Stevens, J.)) read the Harris opinion.  [10]  Indeed, at least where the common elements of the offenses themselves describe a separate criminal offense, the Court's reading of Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), is apparently inconsistent even with the historical understanding of the Clause put forward by three of the dissenters in Grady .  See Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508, 531 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting 1 T. Starkie, Criminal Pleading, ch. xix, pp. 322-323 (2d ed. 1822)) ("`[I]f one charge consist of the circumstances A. B. C. and another of the circumstances A. D. E. then, if the circumstance which belongs to them in common does not of itself constitute a distinct substantive offence, an acquittal from the one charge cannot include an acquittal of the other' ") (emphasis supplied).  [11]  I agree, therefore, with Justice White that the element of knowledge of a court order is irrelevant for double jeopardy purposes.  See ante, at 734 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  []  I note that atleast the charge concerning assault with intent to kill would apparently have been barred under the approach taken in Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in Grady .  See n. 9, supra.
