**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring in the judgment.  I agree that the appellant Whitener has standing to assert the equal protection claims of males between 18 and 21 years old.  Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U. S. 438, 443-446 ; Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 481 ; Barrows v. Jackson, <citedDecision>346 U. S. 249, 255-260</citedDecision> ; Buchanan v. Warley, 245 U. S. 60, 72-73 ; see Note, Standing To Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii, 88 Harv. L. Rev. 423 , 431-436 (1974).  I also concur in the Court’s judgment on the merits of the constitutional issue before us.  *215 Every State has broad power under the Twenty-first Amendment to control the dispensation of alcoholic beverages within its borders.  E. g., California v. LaRue, 409 U. S. 109 ; Joseph E. Seagram & Sons v. Hostetter, 384 U. S. 35 ; Hostetter v. Idlewild Bon Voyage Liquor Corp., 377 U. S. 324, 330 ; Mahoney v. Joseph Triner Corp., 304 U. S. 401 ; State Board v. Young’s Market Co., 299 U. S. 59 .  But “[t]his is not to say that the Twenty-first Amendment empowers a State to act with total irrationality or invidious discrimination in controlling the distribution and dispensation of liquor .  .  .
