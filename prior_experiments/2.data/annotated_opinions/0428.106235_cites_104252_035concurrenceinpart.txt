**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
“We do not reach, in this case the factual situation involved in Commissioner v. Wilcox, 327 U. S. 404. We limit that case to its facts. There embezzled funds were held not to constitute taxable income to the embezzler' under § 22 (a). The issue here is whether money extorted from a victim with his consent induced solely by harassing demands and threats of violence is included in the definition of gross income- under § 22 (a).” 343 U. S., at 138. Brief for the United States in Opposition to Petition for Certiorari, Rutkin v. United States, 343 U. S. 130, pp. 13-14. The full sentence in the Court of Appeals opinion from which the Government quoted was: “So he [Rutkin] did receive the money with a ‘semblance of a bona fide claim of right’ as the embezzler had not in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. <targetCase>Wilcox, supra</targetCase>, 327 U. S. at page 408, 66 S. Ct. at page 549.” United States v. Rutkin, 189 F. 2d 431, 435. This factual distinction was clearly emphasized in the Court’s opinion in Rutkin: “[Rutkin] induced Reinfeld to consent to pay the money by creating a fear in Reinfeld that harm otherwise would come to him and to-his family. Reinfeld thereupon delivered his own money to petitioner. Petitioner’s control over the cash so received was such that, in the absence of Reinfeld’s unlikely repudiation of the transaction and demand for the money’s return, petitioner could enjoy its use as fully as though his title to it were unassailable.” Rutkin v. United States, 343 U. S. 130, 136-137. (Emphasis supplied.) The analogy between the borrower and the embezzler was lucidly analyzed by Judge Sibley in McKnight v. Commissioner, 127 F. 2d 572, 573-574. The several cases relied on by the Court do not, in our judgment, justify imposing a tax upon embezzled money.
