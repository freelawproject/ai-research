<p id="b277-13">The issue before us in this case is whether embezzled funds are to be included in the “gross income” of the embezzler in the year in which the funds are misappro<page-number citation-index="1" label="214">*214</page-number>priated under § 22 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and § 61 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b278-4">The facts are not in dispute. The petitioner is a union official who, with another person, embezzled in excess of $738,000 during the years 1951 through 1954 from his employer union and from an insurance company with which the union was doing business.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Petitioner failed to report these amounts in his gross income in those years and was convicted for willfully attempting to evade the federal income tax due for each of the years 1951 through 1954 in violation of § 145 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and § 7201 of the Internal Rev<page-number citation-index="1" label="215">*215</page-number>enue Code of 1954.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He was sentenced to a total of three years’ imprisonment.

In <em><span class="citation" data-id="104992"><a href="/opinion/104992/rutkin-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rutkin v.

<blockquote id="b279-5">“Wé do not reach in this case the factual situation involved in <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v.

<p id="b279-6">However, examination of the reasoning used in <em><span class="citation" data-id="104992"><a href="/opinion/104992/rutkin-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rutkin v. United States">Rutkin</a></span> </em>leads us inescapably to the conclusion that <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span> </em>was thoroughly devitalized.</p>
<p id="b279-7">The basis for the <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span> </em>decision was “that a taxable gain is conditioned upon (1) the presence of a claim of right to the alleged gain and (2) the absence of a definite, <page-number citation-index="1" label="216">*216</page-number>unconditional obligation to repay or return that which would otherwise constitute a gain. Without some bona fide legal or equitable claim, even though it be contingent or contested in nature, the taxpayer cannot be said to have received any gain or profit within the reach of §22 (a).” <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Commissioner</a></span> </em>v. <span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/#408" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox"><em>Wilcox, supra, </em>at p. 408</a></span>. Since Wilcox embezzled the money, held it “without any semblance of a bona fide claim of right,” <em>ibid., </em>and therefore “was at all times under an unqualified duty and obligation to repay the money to his employer,” <em>ibid., </em>the Court found that the money embezzled was not includible within “gross income.” But, Rutkin’s legal claim was no greater than that of Wilcox. It was specifically found “that petitioner had no basis for his claim . . . and that he obtained it by extortion.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="104992"><a href="/opinion/104992/rutkin-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rutkin v. United States">Rutkin</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at p. 135. Both Wilcox and Rutkin obtained the money by means of a criminal act; neither had a bona fide claim of right to the funds.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Nor was Rutkin’s obligation to repay the extorted money to the victim any less than that of Wilcox. The victim of an extortion, like the victim of an embezzlement, has a right to restitution. Furthermore, it is inconsequential that an embezzler may lack title to the sums he appropriates while an extortionist may gain a voidable title. Questions of federal income taxation are not determined by .such “attenuated subtleties.” <em>Lucas </em>v. <em>Earl, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101540"><a href="/opinion/101540/lucas-v-earl/#114" aria-description="Citation for case: Lucas v. Earl">281 U. S. 111, 114</a></span>; <em>Corliss </em>v. <page-number citation-index="1" label="217">*217</page-number><em>Bowers, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101568"><a href="/opinion/101568/corliss-v-bowers/#378" aria-description="Citation for case: Corliss v. Bowers">281 U. S. 376, 378</a></span>. Thus, the fact that Rutkin secured the money with the consent of his victim, <em><span class="citation" data-id="104992"><a href="/opinion/104992/rutkin-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rutkin v. United States">Rutkin</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at p. 138, is irrelevant. Likewise unimportant is the fact that the sufferer of an extortion is less likely to seek restitution than one whose funds are embezzled. What is important is that the right to recoupment exists in both situations.</p>
<p id="b281-5">Examination of the relevant cases in the courts of appeals lends credence to our conclusion that the <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span> </em>rationale was effectively vitiated by this Court’s decision in Rutkin,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although this case appears to be the first to arise that is “on all fours” with <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span>, </em>the lower federal courts, in deference to the undisturbed <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span> </em>holding, have earnestly endeavored to find distinguishing facts in the cases before them which would enable them to include sundry unlawful gains within “gross income.”<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b282-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="218">*218</page-number>It had been a well-established principle, long before either <em><span class="citation" data-id="104992"><a href="/opinion/104992/rutkin-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rutkin v. United States">Rutkin</a></span> </em>or <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span>, </em>that unlawful, as well as lawful, gains are comprehended within the term “gross income.” Section II B of the Income Tax Act of 1913 provided that “the net income of a taxable person shall include gains, profits, and income . . . from ... the transaction of any <em>lawful </em>business carried on for gain or profit, or gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever . . . .” (Emphasis supplied.) <span class="citation no-link">38 Stat. 167</span>. When the statute was amended in 1916, the one word “lawful” was omitted. This revealed, we think, the obvious intent of that Congress to tax income derived from both legal and illegal sources, to remove the incongruity of having the gains of the honest laborer taxed and the gains of the dishonest immune. <em><span class="citation" data-id="104992"><a href="/opinion/104992/rutkin-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rutkin v. United States">Rutkin</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at p. 138; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101083"><a href="/opinion/101083/united-states-v-sullivan/#263" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Sullivan">274 U. S. 259, 263</a></span>. Thereafter, the Court held that gains from illicit traffic in liquor are includible within “gross income.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="101083"><a href="/opinion/101083/united-states-v-sullivan/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Sullivan">Ibid.</a></span> </em>See also <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103779"><a href="/opinion/103779/johnson-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Johnson v. United States">318 U. S. 189</a></span>; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103859"><a href="/opinion/103859/united-states-v-johnson/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Johnson">319 U. S. 503</a></span>. And, the Court has pointed out, with approval, that there “has been a widespread and settled administrative and judicial recognition of the taxability of unlawful gains of many kinds,” <em><span class="citation" data-id="104992"><a href="/opinion/104992/rutkin-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rutkin v. United States">Rutkin</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at p. 137. These include protection payments made to racketeers, ransom payments paid to kidnappers, .bribes, money derived from the sale of unlawful insurance policies, graft, black market gains, funds obtained from the operation of lotteries, income from race track bookmaking and illegal prize fight pictures. <em>Ibid.</em></p>
<p id="b282-4">The starting point in all cases dealing with the question of the scope of what is included in “gross income” begins with the basic premise that the purpose of Congress was “to use the full measure of its taxing power.” <em>Helvering </em><page-number citation-index="1" label="219">*219</page-number>v. <em>Clifford, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103312"><a href="/opinion/103312/helvering-v-clifford/#334" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v. Clifford">309 U. S. 331, 334</a></span>. And the Court has given a liberal construction to the broad phraseology of the “gross income” definition statutes in recognition of the intention of Congress to tax all gains except those specifically exempted. <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Jacobson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104621"><a href="/opinion/104621/commissioner-v-jacobson/#49" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Jacobson">336 U. S. 28, 49</a></span>; <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Stockholms Enskilda Bank, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102311"><a href="/opinion/102311/helvering-v-stockholms-enskilda-bank/#87" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank">293 U. S. 84, 87-91</a></span>. The language of § 22 (a) of the 1939 Code, “gains or profits and income derived from any source whatever,” and the more simplified language of § 61 (a) of the 1954 Code, “all income from whatever source derived,” have been held to encompass all “aeces- • sions to wealth, clearly realized, and over which the taxpayers have complete dominion.” <em>Commissioner </em>v. <em>Clenshaw Glass Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="105281"><a href="/opinion/105281/commissioner-v-glenshaw-glass-co/#431" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co.">348 U. S. 426, 431</a></span>. A gain “constitutes taxable income when its recipient has such control over it that, as a practical matter, he derives readily realizable economic value from it.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="104992"><a href="/opinion/104992/rutkin-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rutkin v. United States">Rutkin</a></span> </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at p. 137. Under these broad principles, we believe that petitioner’s contention, that all unlawful gains are taxable except those resulting from embezzlement, should fail.</p>
<p id="b283-5">When a taxpayer acquires earnings, lawfully or unlawfully, without the consensual recognition, express or implied, of an obligation to repay and without restriction as to their disposition, “he has received income which he is required to return, even though it may still be claimed that he is not entitled to retain the, money, and even though he may still be adjudged hable to restore its equivalent.” <em>North American Oil </em>v. <em>Burnet, supra, </em>at p. 424. In such case, the taxpayer has “actual command over the property taxed — the actual benefit for which the tax is paid,” <em><span class="citation" data-id="101568"><a href="/opinion/101568/corliss-v-bowers/" aria-description="Citation for case: Corliss v. Bowers">Corliss</a></span> </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="101568"><a href="/opinion/101568/corliss-v-bowers/" aria-description="Citation for case: Corliss v. Bowers">Bowers, supra.</a></span> </em>This standard brings wrongful appropriations within the broad sweep of “gross income”; it excludes loans. When a law-abiding taxpayer mistakenly receives income in one year, which receipt is assailed and found to be invalid in a subsequent <page-number citation-index="1" label="220">*220</page-number>year, the taxpayer must nonetheless report the amount as “gross income” in the year received. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lewis, supra; Healy </em>v. <em>Commissioner, supra. </em>We do not believe that Congress intended to treat a law-breaking taxpayer differently. Just as the honest taxpayer may deduct any amount repaid in the year in which the repayment is made, the Government points out that, “If, when, and to the extent that the victim recovers back the misappropriated funds, there is of course a reduction in the embezzler’s income.” Brief for the United States, p. 24.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b284-4">Petitioner contends that the <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span> </em>rule has been in existence since 1946; that if Congress had intended to change the rule, it would have done so; that there was a general revision of the income tax laws in 1954 without mention of the rule; that a bill to change it<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> was introduced in the Eighty-sixth Congress but was not acted upon; that, therefore, we may not change the rule now. But the fact that Congress has remained silent or has re-enacted a statute which we have construed, or that congressional attempts to amend a rule announced by this Court have failed, does not necessarily debar us from re-examining and correcting the Court’s own errors. <em>Girouard </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104285"><a href="/opinion/104285/girouard-v-united-states/#69" aria-description="Citation for case: Girouard v.

Hallock">309 U. S. 106, 119-122</a></span>. There may have been any number of reasons why Congress acted as it did. <em>Helvering </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="103292"><a href="/opinion/103292/helvering-v-hallock/" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v. Hallock">Hallock, supra.</a></span> </em>One of the reasons could well <page-number citation-index="1" label="221">*221</page-number>be our subsequent decision in <em><span class="citation" data-id="104992"><a href="/opinion/104992/rutkin-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Rutkin v. United States">Rutkin</a></span> </em>which has been thought by many to have repudiated <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span>. </em>Particularly might this be true in light of the decisions of the Courts of Appeals which have been riding a narrow rail between the two cases and further distinguishing them to the disparagement of <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span>. </em>See notes 8 and 9, <em>supra.</em></p>
<p id="b285-5">We believe that <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span> </em>was wrongly decided and we find nothing in congressional history since then to persuade us that Congress intended to legislate the rule. Thus, we believe that we should now correct the error and the confusion resulting from it, certainly if we do so in a manner that will not prejudice those who might have relied on it. Cf. <em>Helvering </em>v. <span class="citation" data-id="103292"><a href="/opinion/103292/helvering-v-hallock/#119" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v. Hallock"><em>Hallock, supra, </em>at 119</a></span>. We should not continue to confound confusion, particularly when the result would be to perpetuate the injustice of relieving embezzlers of the duty of paying income taxes on the money they enrich themselves with through theft while honest people pay their taxes on every conceivable type of income.</p>
<p id="b285-6">But, we are dealing here with a felony conviction under statutes which apply to any person who “willfully” fails to account for his tax or who “willfully” attempts to evade his obligation. In <em>Spies </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103753"><a href="/opinion/103753/spies-v-united-states/#499" aria-description="Citation for case: Spies v. United States">317 U. S. 492, 499</a></span>, the Court said that § 145 (b) of the 1939 Code embodied “the gravest of offenses against the revenues,” and stated that willfulness must therefore include an evil motive and want of justification in view of all the circumstances. <em>Id., </em>at 498. Willfulness “involves a specific intent which must be proven by independent evidence and which cannot be inferred from the mere understatement of income.” <em>Holland </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105254"><a href="/opinion/105254/holland-v-united-states/#139" aria-description="Citation for case: Holland v. United States">348 U. S. 121, 139</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b285-7">We believe that the element of willfulness could not be proven in a criminal prosecution for failing to include embezzled funds in gross income in the year of misappropriation so long as the statute contained the gloss placed upon it by <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span> </em>at the time the alleged crime was <page-number citation-index="1" label="222">*222</page-number>committed. Therefore, we feel that petitioner’s conviction may not stand and that the indictment against him must be dismissed.</p>
<p id="b286-4">Since Mr. Justice Harlan, Mr. Justice Frank- ' eurter, and Mr. Justice Clark agree with us concerning <em><span class="citation" data-id="104252"><a href="/opinion/104252/commissioner-v-wilcox/" aria-description="Citation for case: Commissioner v. Wilcox">Wilcox</a></span>, </em>that case is overruled. Mr. Justice Black, Mr. Justice ' Douglas, and Mr. Justice Whittaker believe that petitioner’s conviction must be reversed and the case dismissed for the reasons stated in their opinions.</p>
<p id="b286-5">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded to the District Court with directions to dismiss the indictment.</p>
