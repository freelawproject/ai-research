<p id="b438-8">I dissent for the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Jaffree, </em>472 U. S. 38 (1985). The Court relies heavily on the principles of <em>Everson </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>330 U. S. 1 (1947), and <em>McCollum </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>333 U. S. 203 (1948), <em>ante, </em>at 381-382, 390, 391, 392, but de<page-number citation-index="1" label="401">*401</page-number>dines to discuss the faulty “wall” premise upon which those cases rest. In doing so the Court blinds itself to the first 150 years’ history of the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p id="b439-5">The Court today attempts to give content to the “effects” prong of the <em>Lemon </em>test by holding that a “symbolic link between government and religion” creates an impermissible effect. <em>Ante, </em>at 385. But one wonders how the teaching of “Math Topics,” “Spanish,” and “Gymnastics,” which is struck down today, creates a greater “symbolic link” than the municipal créche upheld in <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>465 U. S. 668 (1984), or the legislative chaplain upheld in <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>463 U. S. 783 (1983).</p>
<p id="b439-6">A most unfortunate result of this case is that to support its holding the Court, despite its disclaimers, impugns the integrity of public school teachers. Contrary to the law and the teachers’ promises, they are assumed to be eager inculcators of religious dogma, see <em>ante, </em>at 387-389, requiring, in the Court’s words, “ongoing inspection.” <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Felton, post, </em>at 412; see <em>ante, </em>at 387-389. Not one instance of attempted religious inculcation exists in the records of the school-aid cases decided today, even though both the Grand Rapids and New York programs have been in operation for a number of years. I would reverse.</p>
