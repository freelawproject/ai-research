**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Harlan, dissenting.  I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois on the basis of Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , *493 decided by this Court only six years ago.  Like my Brother White, post, p. 495, I think the rule announced today is most ill-conceived and that it seriously and unjustifiably fetters perfectly legitimate methods of criminal law enforcement.  Mr. Justice Stewart, dissenting.  I think this case is directly controlled by Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , and I would therefore affirm the judgment.  Massiah v. United States, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 201</citedDecision> , is not in point here.  In that case a federal grand jury had indicted Massiah.  He had retained a lawyer and entered a formal plea of not guilty.  Under our system of federal justice an indictment and arraignment are followed by a trial, at which the Sixth Amendment guarantees the defendant the assistance of counsel.  * But Massiah was released on bail, and thereafter agents of the Federal Government deliberately elicited incriminating statements from him in the absence of his lawyer.  We held that the use of these statements against him at his trial denied him the basic protections of the Sixth Amendment guarantee.  Putting to one side the fact that the case now before us is not a federal case, the vital fact remains that this case does not involve the deliberate interrogation of a defendant after the initiation of judicial proceedings against him.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 This Court has never held that the Constitution requires the police to give any “advice” under circumstances such as these.  Supported by no stronger authority than its own rhetoric, the Court today converts a routine police investigation of an unsolved murder into a distorted analogue of a judicial trial. It imports into this investigation constitutional concepts historically applicable only after the onset of formal prosecutorial proceedings.  By doing so, I think the Court perverts those precious constitutional guarantees, and frustrates the vital interests of society in preserving the legitimate and proper function of honest and purposeful police investigation.  Like my Brother ClaRK, I cannot escape the logic of my Brother White’s conclusions as to the extraordinary implications which emanate from the Court’s opinion in *495 this case, and I share their views as to the untold and highly unfortunate impact today’s decision may have upon the fair administration of criminal justice.  I can only hope we have completely misunderstood what the Court has said.  Mr. Justice White, with whom Mr. Justice Clark and Mr. Justice Stewart join, dissenting.  In Massiah v. United States, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 201</citedDecision> , the Court held that as of the date of the indictment the prosecution is disentitled to secure admissions from the accused.  The Court now moves that date back to the time when the prosecution begins to “focus” on the accused.  Although the opinion purports to be limited to the facts of this case, it would be naive to think that the new constitutional right announced will depend upon whether the accused has retained his own counsel, cf. Gideon v. Wainright, 372 U. S. 335 ; Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U. S. 12 ; Douglas v. California, 372 U. S. 353 , or has asked to consult with counsel in the course of interrogation.  Cf. Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U. S. 506 .  At the very least the Court holds that once the accused becomes a suspect and, presumably, is arrested, any admission made to the police thereafter is inadmissible in evidence unless the accused has waived his right to counsel.  The decision is thus another major step in the direction of the goal which the Court seemingly has in mind — to bar from evidence all admissions obtained from an individual suspected of crime, whether involuntarily made or not.  It does of course put us one step “ahead” of the English judges who have had the good sense to leave the matter a discretionary one with the trial court. * I reject this step and *496 the invitation to go farther which the Court has now issued.
