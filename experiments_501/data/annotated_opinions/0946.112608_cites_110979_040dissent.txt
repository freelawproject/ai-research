The “Confusion” In the nine years since Ross was decided, the Court has considered three cases in which the police had probable cause to search a particular container and one in which they had probable cause to search two vehicles.  The decisions in all four of those cases were perfectly straightforward and provide no evidence of confusion in the state or lower federal courts.  In United States v. Place, <citedDecision>462 U. S. 696</citedDecision> (1983), we held that, although reasonable suspicion justifies the temporary detention of an airline passenger’s luggage, the seizure in that particular case was unreasonable because of the prolonged delay in ascertaining the existence of probable cause.  In the course of our opinion, we noted that the then-recent decision in Ross had not modified the holding in Sanders.  <citedDecision>462 U. S., at 701, n. 3</citedDecision> .  We also relied on Chadwick for our conclusion that the temporary seizure of luggage is substantially less intrusive than a search of its contents.  <citedDecision>462 U. S., at 706-707</citedDecision> .  In Oklahoma v. Castleberry, 471 U. S. 146 (1985), police officers had probable cause to believe the defendant carried narcotics in blue suitcases in the trunk of his car. After arresting him, they opened the trunk, seized the suitcases, and searched them without a warrant.  The state court held that the search was invalid, explaining: “If the officer has probable cause to believe there is contraband somewhere in the car, but he does not know exactly where, he may search the entire car as well as any containers found therein.

 See ante, at 578-579 (referring to the undocumented prediction made by Justice Blackmun, joined by then-JusTiCE Rehnquist, in dissent in Chadwick); ante, at 579 (referring to the fact that the dissenters had “bemoaned the ‘inherent opaqueness’ of the difference between the Carroll and Chadwick principles and noted ‘the confusion to be created for all concerned’ ”).  One of the three pieces, Kamisar, The “Automobile Search” Cases: The Court Does Little to Clarify the “Labyrinth” of Judicial Uncertainty, in 3 The Supreme Court: Trends and Developments 1980-1981 (D. Opperman ed. 1982), was written prior to the decision in Ross .  Moreover, rather than criticizing Chadwick and Sanders, the article expressly endorses Justice Brennan’s refutation of the arguments advanced by Justice Black-mun in his dissent in Chadwick .  See Kamisar, supra, at 83-85.  The other two articles were written shortly after Ross , and both criticize Ross rather than Chadwick or Sanders.
