Mr. Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court. The interaction of two sections of an Oklahoma statute, Okla. Stat., Tit. 37, §§ 241 and 245 (.1958 and Supp. 1976) , 1 *192 prohibits the sale of “nonintoxicating” 3.2% beer to males under the age of 21 and to females under the age of 18.  The question to be decided is whether such a gender-based differential constitutes a denial to males 18-20 years of age of the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  This action was brought in the District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma on December 20, 1972, by appellant Craig, a male then between 18 and 21 years of age, and by appellant Whitener, a licensed vendor of 3.2% beer.  The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the gender-based differential on the ground that it constituted invidious discrimination against males 18-20 years of age.  A three-judge court convened under 28 U. S. C. § 2281 sustained the constitutionality of the statutory differential and dismissed the action.  <citedDecision>399 F. Supp. 1304</citedDecision> (1975).  We noted probable jurisdiction of appellants’ appeal, 423 U. S. 1047 (1976).  We reverse.  I We first address a preliminary question of standing.  Appellant Craig attained the age of 21 after we noted probable jurisdiction.  Therefore, since only declaratory and injunctive relief against enforcement of the gender-based differential is sought, the controversy has been rendered moot as to Craig.  See, e. g., DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U. S. 312 (1974).

 7 Clearly; the protection *200 of public health and safety represents an important function of state and local governments However, appellees’ statistics in our view cannot support the conclusion that the gender-based distinction closely serves to achieve that objective and therefore the distinction cannot under Reed withstand equal protection challenge.  The appellees introduced a variety of statistical surveys.  First, an analysis of arrest statistics for 1973 demonstrated that 18-20-year-old male arrests for “driving' under the influence” and “drunkenness” substantially exceeded female arrests for that same age period.  8 Similarly, youths aged 17-21 were found to be overrepresented among those killed *201 or injured in traffic accidents, with males again numerically exceeding females in this regard.  9 Third, a random roadside survey in Oklahoma City revealed that young males were more inclined to drive and drink beer than were their female counterparts.  10 Fourth, Federal Bureau of Investigation nationwide statistics exhibited a notable increase in arrests for “driving under the influence.” 11 Finally, statistical evidence gathered in other jurisdictions, particularly Minnesota and Michigan, was offered to corroborate Oklahoma’s experience by indicating the pervasiveness of youthful participation in motor vehicle accidents following the imbibing of alcohol.  Conceding that “the case is not free from doubt,” <citedDecision>399 F. Supp., at 1314</citedDecision> , the District Court nonetheless concluded that this statistical showing substantiated “a rational basis for the legislative judgment underlying the challenged classification.” <citedDecision>Id., at 1307</citedDecision> .  Even were this statistical evidence accepted as accurate, it nevertheless offers only a weak answer to the equal protection question presented here.  The most focused and relevant of the statistical surveys, arrests of 18-20-year-olds for alcohol-related driving offenses, exemplifies the ultimate unpersuasiveness of this evidentiary record.  Viewed in terms of the correlation between sex and the actual activity that Oklahoma seeks to regulate — driving while under the influence of alcohol — the statistics broadly establish that .18% of females and 2% of males in that age group were arrested for that offense.  While such a disparity is not trivial in a statistical sense, it hardly can form the basis for employment of a gender line as a classifying device.  Certainly if male *202 ness is to serve as a proxy for drinking and driving, a correlation of 2% must be considered an unduly tenuous “fit.” 12 Indeed, prior cases have consistently rejected the use of sex as a decisionmaking factor even though the statutes in question certainly rested on far more predictive empirical relationships than this.  13 Moreover, the statistics exhibit a variety of other shortcomings that seriously impugn their value to equal protection analysis.

 But this merely illustrates that proving broad sociological propositions by statistics is a dubious business, and one that inevitably is in tension with the normative philosophy that underlies the Equal Protection Clause.  17 Suffice to say that the showing offered by the appellees does not satisfy us that sex represents a legitimate, accurate proxy for the regulation of drinking and driving.  In fact, when it is further recognized that Oklahoma’s statute prohibits only the selling of 3.2% beer to young males and not their drinking the beverage once acquired (even after purchase by their 18-20-year-old female companions), the relationship between gender and traffic safety becomes far too tenuous to satisfy Reed’s requirement that the gender-based difference be substantially related to achievement of the statutory objective.  We hold, therefore, that under Reed , Oklahoma’s 3.2% beer statute invidiously discriminates against males 18-20 years of age.  D Appellees argue, however, that §§241 and 245 enforce state policies concerning the sale and distribution of alcohol and by force of the Twenty-first Amendment should therefore be held to withstand the equal protection challenge.  The District Court’s response to this contention is unclear.  The court assumed that the Twenty-first Amendment “strengthened” the State’s police powers with respect to alcohol regulation, <citedDecision>399 F. Supp., at 1307</citedDecision> , but then said that “the standards of review that [the Equal Protection Clause] mandates are not relaxed.” <citedDecision>Id., at 1308</citedDecision> .  Our view is, and we hold, that the Twenty-first Amendment does not save the *205 invidious gender-based discrimination from invalidation as a denial of equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The history of state regulation of alcoholic beverages dates from long before adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment.  In the License Cases, 5 How. 504, 579 (1847), the Court recognized a broad authority in state governments to regulate the trade of alcoholic beverages within their borders free from implied restrictions under the Commerce Clause.  Later in the century, however, Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U. S. 100 (1890), undercut the theoretical underpinnings of the License Cases. This led Congress, acting pursuant to its powers under the Commerce Clause, to reinvigorate the State's regulatory role through the passage of the Wilson 18 and Webb-Kenyon Acts.  19 See, e. g., Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland R. Co., 242 U. S. 311 (1917) (upholding Webb-Kenyon Act); In re Rahrer, 140 U. S. 545 (1891) (upholding Wilson Act).  With passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, the uneasy tension between the Commerce Clause and state police power temporarily subsided.

 § 245.  “A 'minor/ for the purposes of Section .  .  .  241 ... is defined as a *192 female under the age of eighteen (18) years, and a male under the age of twenty-one (21) years.” Appellants did not seek class certification of Craig as representative of other similarly situated males 18-20 years of age.  See, e. g., Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U. S. 393, 401 (1975).  The District Court’s opinion confirms that Whitener from the outset has based her constitutional challenge on gender-discrimination grounds, <citedDecision>399 F. Supp., at 1306</citedDecision> , and “[n]o challenge is made to [her] standing and requisite interest in the controversy .  .  .  .” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 1306 n. 1.  The standing question presented here is not answered by the principle stated in United States v. Raines, 362 U. S. 17, 21 (1960), that “one to whom application of a statute is constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it might also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional.” In Raines , the Court refused to permit certain public officials of Georgia to defend against application of the Civil Rights Act to their official conduct on the ground that the statute also might be construed to encompass the “purely private actions” of others.  The Raines rule remains germane in such a setting, where the interests of the litigant and the rights of the proposed third parties are in no way mutually interdependent.  Thus, a successful suit against Raines did not threaten to impair or diminish the independent private rights of others, and consequently, consideration of those third-party rights properly was deferred until another day. Of course, the Raines principle has also been relaxed where legal action *196 against the claimant threatens to “chill” the First Amendment rights of third parties.  See, e. g., Lewis v. New Orleans, 415 U. S. 130 (1974).  The fact that Baird chose to disobey the legal duty imposed upon him by the Massachusetts anticontraception statute, resulting in his criminal conviction, 405 U. S., at 440, does not distinguish the standing inquiry from that pertaining to the anticipatory attack in this case. In both Eisenstadt and here, the challenged statutes compel jus tertii claimants either to cease their proscribed activities or to suffer appropriate sanctions.  The existence of Art.. Ill “injury in fact” and the structure of the claimant’s relationship to the third parties are not altered by the litigative posture of the suit.  And, certainly, no suggestion will be heard that Whitener’s anticipatory challenge offends the normal requirements governing such actions.  See generally Steffel v. Thompson, 415 U. S. 452 (1974); Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U. S. 66 (1971); Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971).  Kahn v. Shevin, 416 U. S. 351 (1974) and Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498 (1975), upholding the use of gender-based classifications, rested upon the Court’s perception of the laudatory purposes of those laws as remedying disadvantageous conditions suffered by women in economic and military life. See 416 U. S., at 353-354; 419 U. S., at 508.  Needless to say, in this case Oklahoma does not suggest that the age-sex differential was enacted to ensure the availability of 3.2% beer for women as compensation for previous deprivations.  That this was the true purpose is not at all self-evident.  The pur *200 pose is not apparent from the face of the statute and the Oklahoma Legislature does not preserve statutory history materials capable of clarifying the objectives served by its legislative enactments.  The District Court acknowledged the nonexistence of materials necessary “to reveal what the actual purpose of the legislature was,” but concluded that “we feel it apparent that a major purpose of the legislature was to promote the safety of the young persons affected and the public generally.” <citedDecision>399 F. Supp., at 1311</citedDecision> n. 6.  Similarly, the attorney for Oklahoma, while proposing traffic safety as a legitimate rationale for the 3.2% beer law, candidly acknowledged at oral argument that he is unable to assert that traffic safety is “indeed the reason" for the gender line contained in § 245.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.  For this appeal we find adequate the appellee’s representation of legislative purpose, leaving for another day consideration of whether the statement of the State’s Assistant Attorney General should suffice to inform this Court of the legislature’s objectives, or whether the Court must determine if the litigant simply is selecting a convenient, but false, post hoc rationalization.  The disparities in 18-20-year-old male-female arrests were substantial for both categories of offenses: 427 versus 24 for driving under the influence of alcohol, and 966 versus 102 for drunkenness.  Even if we assume that a legislature may rely on such arrest data in some situations, these figures do not offer support for a differential age line, for the disproportionate arrests of males persisted at older ages; indeed, in the case of arrests for drunkenness, the figures for all ages indicated “even more male involvement in such arrests at later ages.” <citedDecision>399 F. Supp., at 1309</citedDecision> .  See also n. 14, infra.  This survey drew no correlation between the accident figures for any age group and levels of intoxication found in those killed or injured.  For an analysis of the results of this exhibit, see n. 16, infra.  The FBI made no attempt to relate these arrest figures either to beer drinking or to an 18-21 age differential, but rather found that male arrests for all ages exceeded 90% of the total.  Obviously, arrest statistics do not embrace all individuals who drink and drive.  But for purposes of analysis, this "underinclusiveness” must be discounted somewhat by the shortcomings inherent in this statistical sample, see n. 14, infra.

 In this regard, the disproportionately high arrest statistics for young males — and, indeed, the growing alcohol-related arrest figures for all ages and sexes — simply may be taken to document the relative futility of controlling driving behavior by the 3.2% beer *203 statute and like legislation, although we obviously have no means of estimating how many individuals, if any, actually were prevented from drinking by these laws.  See, e. g., nn. 9 and 11, supra. See also n. 16, infra.  The random roadside survey of drivers conducted in Oklahoma City during August 1972 found that 78% of drivers under 20 were male.  Turning to an evaluation of-their drinking habits and factoring out nondrinkers, 84% of the males versus 77% of the females expressed a preference for beer.  Further 16.5% of the men and 11.4% of the women had consumed some alcoholic beverage within two hours of the interview.  Finally, a blood alcohol concentration greater than .01% was discovered in 14.6% of the males compared to 11.5% of the females.  “The 1973 figures, although they contain some variations, reflect essentially the same pattern.” <citedDecision>399 F. Supp., at 1309</citedDecision> .  Plainly these statistical disparities between the sexes are not substantial.  Moreover, when the 18-20 age boundaries are lifted and all drivers analyzed, the 1972 roadside survey indicates that male drinking rose slightly whereas female exposure to alcohol remained relatively constant.  Again, in 1973, the survey established that “compared to all drivers interviewed, .  .  .  the under-20 age group generally showed a lower involvement with alcohol in terms of having drunk within the past two hours or having a significant BAC (blood alcohol content).” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> In sum, this survey provides little support for a gender line among teenagers and actually runs counter to the imposition of drinking restrictions based upon age.  See, e. g., n. 22, infra.  The Wilson Act, enacted in 1890, reads in pertinent part: “All .  .  .  intoxicating liquors or liquids transported into any State or Territory .  .
