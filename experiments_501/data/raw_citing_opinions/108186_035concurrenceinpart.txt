<author id="b153-6">Mr. Justice Harlan,</author>
<p id="AFKO">dissenting in No. 188, <em>ante, </em>p. 66, and concurring in the result in No. 927.</p>
<p id="b153-7">In <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">391 U. S. 145</a></span> (1968), the Court held, over my dissent, joined by Mr. Justice Stewart, that a state criminal defendant is entitled to a jury trial in any case which, if brought in a federal court, would require a jury under the Sixth Amendment. Today the Court concludes, in No. 188, <em>Baldwin </em>v. <em>New York, </em>that New York cannot constitutionally provide that misdemeanors carrying sentences up to one year shall be tried in New York City without a jury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At <page-number citation-index="1" label="118">*118</page-number>the same time the Court holds in No. 927, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Florida, </em>that Florida’s six-member-jury statute satisfies the Sixth Amendment as carried to the States by the <em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">Duncan</a></span> </em>holding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The necessary consequence of this decision is that 12-member juries are not <em>constitutionally </em>required in <em>federal </em>criminal trials either.</p>
<p id="b154-6">The historical argument by which the Court undertakes to justify its view that the Sixth Amendment does not require 12-member juries is, in my opinion, much too thin to mask the true thrust of this decision. The decision evinces, I think, a recognition that the “incor-porationist” view of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which underlay <em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">Duncan</a></span> </em>and is now carried forward into <em>Baldwin, </em>must be tempered to allow the States more elbow room in ordering their own criminal systems. With that much I agree. But to accomplish this by diluting constitutional protections within the federal system itself is something to which I cannot possibly subscribe. Tempering the rigor of <em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">Duncan</a></span> </em>should be done forthrightly, by facing up to the fact that at least in this area the “incorporation” doctrine does not fit well with our federal structure, and by the same token that <em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">Duncan</a></span> </em>was wrongly decided.</p>
<p id="b154-7">1 would sustain both the Florida and New York statutes on the constitutional premises discussed in my dissenting opinion in <em>Duncan, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">391 U. S., at 161</a></span> <em>et seq. </em>In taking that course in <em>Baldwin, </em>I cannot, in a matter that goes to the very pulse of sound constitutional adjudication, consider myself constricted by <em>stare </em>decisis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b155-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="119">*119</page-number>Accordingly, I dissent in No. 188 and, as to the jury issue, concur in the result in No. 927. Given <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106862"><a href="/opinion/106862/malloy-v-hogan/" aria-description="Citation for case: Malloy v. Hogan">378 U. S. 1</a></span> (1964), I join that part of the Court’s opinion in No. 927 relating to the Florida “alibi” procedure.</p>
<p id="b155-5">I</p>
<p id="b155-6">As a predicate for my conclusions, it is useful to map the circuitous route that has been taken in order to reach the results. In both cases, more patently in <em>Williams </em>than in <em>Baldwin, </em>the history of jury trial practice in both the state and federal systems has been indiscriminately jumbled together as opposed to the point of departure having been taken from the language in which the <em>federal </em>guarantee is expressed and the historical precedent that brings it to life. The consequence of this inverted approach to interpreting the Sixth Amendment results, fortuitously,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in <em>Baldwin </em>in a Sixth Amendment rule that would be reached under the correct approach, given the “incorporationist” philosophy of <em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">Duncan</a></span>, </em>but, unhappily, imposes it on the one jurisdiction in the country that has seen fit to do otherwise; and in <em>Williams </em>results in a Sixth Amendment rule that could only be reached by standing the constitutional dialectic on its head.</p>
<p id="b155-7">A</p>
<p id="b155-8">To the extent that the prevailing opinion premises its conclusions in the <em>Baldwin </em>case on federal precedent and the common-law practice, I agree that the federal right to <page-number citation-index="1" label="120">*120</page-number>jury trial attaches where an offense is punishable by as much as six months’ imprisonment. I think this follows both from the breadth of the language of the Sixth Amendment, which provides for a jury in “all criminal prosecutions,” and the evidence of historical practice. In this regard I believe that contemporary usage in the States is of little, if any, significance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For if exceptions are to be created out of the all-embracing language of the Sixth Amendment they should only be those that are anchored in history.</p>
<p id="b156-4">It is to the distinction between “petty” and “serious” offenses, rooted in the common law, that this Court has looked to ascertain the metes and bounds of the federal right guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment. See <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Clawans, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102801"><a href="/opinion/102801/district-of-columbia-v-clawans/" aria-description="Citation for case: District of Columbia v. Clawans">300 U. S. 617</a></span> (1937); <em>Schick </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="96128"><a href="/opinion/96128/schick-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Schick v. United States">195 U. S. 65</a></span> (1904); <em>Callan </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="92280"><a href="/opinion/92280/callan-v-wilson/#552" aria-description="Citation for case: Callan v. Wilson">127 U. S. 540, 552</a></span> (1888). Since the conventional, if not immutable practice at common law appears to have been to provide juries for offenses punishable by fines of more than £100 or sentences to hard labor of more than six months in prison, see Frankfurter &amp; Corcoran, Petty Federal Offenses and the Constitutional Guaranty of Trial by Jury, <span class="citation no-link">39 Harv. L. Rev. 917</span> (1926),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I think it <page-number citation-index="1" label="121">*121</page-number>appropriate to draw the line at six months in federal cases,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> although, for reasons to follow, I would not encumber the States by this requirement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b158-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="122">*122</page-number>B</p>
<p id="b158-4">In <em>Williams </em>the Court strangely does an about-face. Rather than bind the States by the hitherto undeviating and unquestioned federal practice of 12-member juries, the Court holds, based on a poll of state practice, that a six-man jury satisfies the guarantee of a trial by jury in a federal criminal system and consequently carries over to the States. This is a constitutional <em>renvoi. </em>With all respect, I consider that before today it would have been unthinkable to suggest that the Sixth Amendment’s right to a trial by jury is satisfied by a jury of six, or less, as is left open by the Court’s opinion in <em>Williams, </em>or by less than a unanimous verdict, a question also reserved in today’s decision.</p>
<p id="b158-5">1. The Court, in stripping off the livery of history from the jury trial, relies on a two-step analysis. With arduous effort the Court first liberates itself from the “intent of the Framers” and “the easy assumption in our past decisions that if a given feature existed in a jury at common law in 1789, then it was necessarily preserved in the Constitution.” <em>Ante, </em>at 92-93. Unburdened by <page-number citation-index="1" label="123">*123</page-number>the yoke of history the Court then concludes that the policy protected by the jury guarantee does not require its perpetuation in common-law form.</p>
<p id="b159-5">Neither argument is, in my view, an acceptable reason for disregarding history and numerous pronouncements of this Court that have made “the easy assumption” that the Sixth Amendment’s jury was one composed of 12 individuals. Even assuming ambiguity as to the intent of the Framers,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is common sense and not merely the <page-number citation-index="1" label="124">*124</page-number>blessing of the Framers that explains this Court’s frequent reminders that: “The interpretation of the Constitution of the United States is necessarily influenced by the fact that its provisions are framed in the language of the English common law, and are to be read in the light of its history.” <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em><span class="citation" data-id="92142"><a href="/opinion/92142/smith-v-alabama/#478" aria-description="Citation for case: Smith v. Alabama">124 U. S. 465, 478</a></span> (1888). This proposition was again put forward by Mr. Justice Gray speaking for the Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wong Kim Ark, </em><span class="citation" data-id="94842"><a href="/opinion/94842/united-states-v-wong-kim-ark/" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Wong Kim Ark">169 U. S. 649</a></span> (1898), where the Court was called upon to define the term “citizen” as used in the Constitution. “The Constitution nowhere defines the meaning of these words [the Citizenship Clause]. . . . In this, as in other respects, it must be interpreted in the light of the common law, the principles and history of which were familiarly known to the framers of the Constitution.” <span class="citation" data-id="94842"><a href="/opinion/94842/united-states-v-wong-kim-ark/#654" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Wong Kim Ark">169 U. S., at 654</a></span>. History continues to be a wellspring of constitutional interpretation. Indeed, history was even invoked by the Court in such decisions as <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Sain, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106544"><a href="/opinion/106544/townsend-v-sain/" aria-description="Citation for case: Townsend v. Sain">372 U. S. 293</a></span> (1963), and <em>Fay </em>v. <em>Noia, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106548"><a href="/opinion/106548/fay-v-noia/" aria-description="Citation for case: Fay v. Noia">372 U. S. 391</a></span> (1963), where it purported to interpret the constitutional provision for habeas corpus according to the “historic conception of the writ” and took note that the guarantee was one rooted in common law and should be so interpreted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107081"><a href="/opinion/107081/united-states-v-brown/#458" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Brown">381 U. S. 437, 458</a></span> (1965). In accordance with these precepts, sound constitutional interpretation requires, in my view, fixing the federal jury as it was known to the common law.</p>
<p id="b160-4">It is, of course, true that history should not imprison those broad guarantees of the Constitution whose proper scope is to be determined in a given instance by a blend <page-number citation-index="1" label="125">*125</page-number>of historical understanding and the adaptation of purpose to contemporary circumstances. Cf. <em>Katz </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107564"><a href="/opinion/107564/katz-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Katz v. United States">389 U.

Texas">381 U. S. 532, 595-596</a></span> (1965) (concurring opinion); <em>Olmstead </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101320"><a href="/opinion/101320/olmstead-v-united-states/#471" aria-description="Citation for case: Olmstead v. United States">277 U. S. 438, 471</a></span> (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lovett, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104303"><a href="/opinion/104303/united-states-v-lovett/#318" aria-description="Citation for case: United States v. Lovett">328 U. S. 303, 318</a></span> (1946) (Frankfurter, J., concurring).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process (1921). This is not, however, a circumstance of giving a term “a meaning not necessarily envisioned ... so as to adapt [it] to circumstances . . . uncontemplated.” See my opinion concurring in the result in <em>Welsh </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108165"><a href="/opinion/108165/welsh-v-united-states/#344" aria-description="Citation for case: Welsh v. United States">398 U. S. 333, 344</a></span> (1970). The right to a trial by jury, however, has no enduring meaning apart from historical form.</p>
<p id="b161-5">The second aspect of the Court’s argument is that the number “12” is a historical accident — even though one that has recurred without interruption since the 14th century (see <em>ante, </em>at 89) — and is in no way essential to the “purpose of the jury trial” which is to “safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge.” <em>Ante, </em>at 100. Thus history, the Court suggests, is no guide to the meaning of those rights whose form bears no relation to the policy they reflect. In this context the 12-member feature of the classical common-law jury is apparently regarded by the Court as mere adornment.</p>
<p id="b161-6">This second justification for cutting the umbilical cord that ties the form of the jury to the past is itself, as <page-number citation-index="1" label="126">*126</page-number>I see it, the most compelling reason for maintaining that guarantee in its common-law form. For if 12 jurors are not essential, why are six? What if New York, now compelled by virtue of <em>Baldwin </em>to provide juries for the trial of misdemeanors, concludes that three jurors are adequate “interposition between the accused and his accuser of the common-sense judgment of a group of laymen,” and constitute adequate “community participation and [provide] shared responsibility which results from that group’s determination of guilt or innocence”? The Court’s elaboration of what is required provides no standard and vexes the meaning of the right to a jury trial in federal courts, as well as state courts, by uncertainty. Can it be doubted that a unanimous jury of 12 provides a greater safeguard than a majority vote of six? The uncertainty that will henceforth plague the meaning of trial by jury is itself a further sufficient reason for not hoisting the anchor to history.</p>
<p id="b162-6">2. The circumvention of history is compounded by the cavalier disregard of numerous pronouncements of this Court that reflect the understanding of the jury as one of 12 members and have fixed expectations accordingly. Thus in <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Utah </em>a unanimous Court answered in the affirmative the question whether the Sixth Amendment jury “is a jury constituted, as it was at common law, of twelve persons, neither more nor less.” <span class="citation" data-id="94866"><a href="/opinion/94866/thompson-v-utah/#349" aria-description="Citation for case: Thompson v. Utah">170 U. S. 343, 349</a></span> (1898),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and it appears that before <em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">Duncan</a></span> </em>no Justice of this Court has seen fit to question this holding, one that has often been reiterated. See <em>Patton </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="101558"><a href="/opinion/101558/patton-v-united-states/#288" aria-description="Citation for case: Patton v. United States">281 U. S. 276, 288</a></span> (1930), where <page-number citation-index="1" label="127">*127</page-number>the Court reaffirmed earlier pronouncements and stated that the Sixth Amendment jury is characterized by three essential features: “(1) that the jury should consist of twelve men, neither more nor less; (2) that the trial should be in the presence and under the superintendence of a judge having power to instruct them as to the law and advise them in respect of the facts; and (3) that the verdict should be unanimous.” See also <em>Maxwell </em>v. <em>Dow, </em><span class="citation" data-id="95204"><a href="/opinion/95204/maxwell-v-dow/#586" aria-description="Citation for case: Maxwell v.

United States">357 U. S. 386, 392</a></span> (1958), in applying a constitutional provision “rooted in history ... a long course of adjudication in this Court carries impressive authority.”</p>
<p id="b163-5">The principle of <em>stare decisis </em>is multifaceted. It is a solid foundation for our legal system; yet care must be taken not to use it to create an unmovable structure. It provides the stability and predictability required for the ordering of human affairs over the course of time and a basis of “public faith in the judiciary as a source of impersonal and reasoned judgments.” <em>Moragne </em>v. <em>States Marine Lines, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108166"><a href="/opinion/108166/moragne-v-states-marine-lines-inc/#403" aria-description="Citation for case: Moragne v.

Louisiana">Duncan</a></span>. </em>It is, in part, the disregard of <em>stare decisis </em>in circumstances where it should apply, to which the Court is, of necessity, driven in <em>Williams </em>by the “incorporation” doctrine, that leads me to decline to follow <em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v.

The decision in <em>Williams, </em>however, casts aside workability and relevance and substitutes uncertainty. The only reason I can discern for today’s decision that discards numerous judicial pronouncements and historical precedent that sound constitutional interpretation would look to as controlling, is the Court’s disquietude with the tension between the jurisprudential consequences wrought by “incorporation” in <em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v.

<p id="b165-6">These decisions demonstrate that the difference between a “due process” approach, that considers each particular case on its own bottom to see whether the right alleged is one “implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,” see <em>Palko </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102879"><a href="/opinion/102879/palko-v-connecticut/#325" aria-description="Citation for case: Palko v.

The internal logic of the selective incorporation doctrine cannot be respected if the Court is both committed to interpreting faithfully the meaning of the federal Bill of Rights and recognizing the governmental diversity that exists in this country. The “backlash” in <em>Williams </em>exposes the malaise, for there the Court dilutes a federal guarantee in order to reconcile the logic of “incorporation,” the “jot-for-jot and case-for-case” application of the federal right to the States, with the reality of federalism. Can one doubt that had Congress tried to undermine the common-law right to trial by jury before <em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v.

Louisiana">391 U.

<p id="b166-5">A</p>
<p id="b166-6">The recent history of constitutional adjudication in state criminal cases is the ascendancy of the doctrine of <em>ad hoc </em>(“selective”) incorporation, an approach that absorbs one-by-one individual guarantees of the federal Bill of Rights into the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and holds them applicable to the States with all the subtleties and refinements born of history <page-number citation-index="1" label="131">*131</page-number>and embodied in case experience developed in the context of federal adjudication. Thus, with few exceptions the Court has “incorporated,” each time over my protest,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> almost all the criminal protections found within the first eight Amendments to the Constitution, and made them “jot-for-jot and case-for-case” applicable to the States.</p>

<p id="b169-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="133">*133</page-number>There is no need to travel again over terrain trod in earlier opinions in which I have endeavored to lay bare the historical and logical infirmities of this “incorpora-tionist” approach. On that score I am content to rest on what I said in dissent in <em>Duncan, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/#171" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">391 U. S., at 171</a></span>. I continue to consider the principles therein expressed as the sound basis for approaching the adjudication of state cases of the kind now before us. It is my firm conviction that “incorporation” distorts the “essentially federal nature of our national government,” <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. </em>v. <em>Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108160"><a href="/opinion/108160/atlantic-coast-line-railroad-v-brotherhood-of-locomotive-engineers/#285" aria-description="Citation for case: Atlantic Coast Line Railroad v. Brotherhood of Locomotive...">398 U. S. 281, 285</a></span> (1970), one of whose basic virtues is to leave ample room for governmental and social experimentation in a society as diverse as ours, and which also reflects the view of the Framers that “the security of liberty in America rested primarily upon the dispersion of governmental power across a federal system,” <span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/#173" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">391 U. S., at 173</a></span>. The Fourteenth Amendment tempered this basic philosophy but did not unstitch the basic federalist pattern woven into our constitutional fabric. The structure of our Government still embodies a philosophy that presupposes the diversity that engendered the federalist system.</p>
<p id="b169-5">That these doctrines are not only alive in rhetoric but vital in the world of practical affairs is evidenced by contemporary debate concerning the desirability of returning to “local” government the administration of many programs and functions that have in late years increasingly been centralized in the hands of the National Government.</p>
<p id="b170-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="134">*134</page-number>B</p>
<p id="b170-5">But the best evidence of the vitality of federalism is today’s decision in <em>Williams. </em>The merits or demerits of the jury system can, of course, be debated and those States that have diluted the common-law requirements evince a conclusion that the protection as known at common law is not necessary for a fair trial, or is only such marginal assurance of a fair trial that the inconvenience of assembling 12 individuals outweighs other gains in the administration of justice achieved by using only six individuals (or none at all as was the case in New York City).</p>
<p id="b170-6">The prevailing opinion rejects in <em>Baldwin </em>what would be the consistent approach, requiring affirmance, simply because New York City is the single jurisdiction in the Nation that sees fit to try misdemeanants without a jury. In doing so it, in effect, holds that “due process” is more offended by a trial without a jury for an offense punishable by no more than a year in prison than it is by a trial with a jury of six or less for offenses punishable by life imprisonment. This ignores both the basic fairness of the New York procedure and the peculiar local considerations that have led the New York Legislature to conclude that trial by jury is more apt to retard than further justice for criminal defendants in New York City.</p>
<p id="b170-7">I, for one, find nothing unfair in the New York system which provides the city defendant with an option, in lieu of a jury, of a bench trial before three judges, N. Y. C. Crim. Ct. Act § 40. Moreover, I think it counterproductive of fairness in criminal trials to hold by way of incorporation that juries are required of States in these days when congested calendars and attendant delays make what many students of criminal justice <page-number citation-index="1" label="135">*135</page-number>feel is one of the most significant contributions to <em>injustice </em>and hardship to criminal defendants.</p>
<p id="b171-5">The statistics cited by the New York Court of Appeals and amplified in the briefs are revealing and trenchant evidence of the crisis that presently bedevils the administration of criminal justice in New York City. New York’s population density, a factor which is, as noted by the President’s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society 5, 28 (1967), directly associated with crime, is twice that of Buffalo, the second largest city in the State. Statistics supplied by the Office of the State Administrator of the Judicial Conference of the State of New York show that: “From July, 1966 through December, 1968 the New York City Criminal Court disposed of 321,368 nontraffic misdemeanor cases; whereas in the next largest city, Buffalo, the City Court disposed of 8,189 nontraffic misdemeanor cases.” 24 N. Y. 2d 207, 218, <span class="citation" data-id="5524843"><a href="/opinion/5677036/hogan-v-rosenberg/#266" aria-description="Citation for case: Hogan v. Rosenberg">247 N. E. 2d 260, 266</a></span> (1969). Thus, New York City’s misdemeanor caseload is 39 times that of Buffalo’s although its population is only 17 times greater. After today each of such defendants in New York is entitled to a trial by some kind of a jury. It can hardly be gainsaid that a jury requirement with the attendant time for selection of jurors and deliberation, even if not invoked by all defendants, will increase delays in calendars, depriving all defendants of a prompt trial. Impressive evidence suggests that this requirement could conceivably increase delays in New York City courts by as much as a factor of eight. A study done of the administration of the Municipal Court in Minneapolis shows that the requirement of a trial by jury in cases of intoxicated driving increased court delays there from three to 24 months. Note, Right to a Jury Trial for Persons Accused of an Ordinance Violation, <span class="citation no-link">47 Minn. L. Rev. 93</span> (1962).</p>
<p id="b172-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="136">*136</page-number>Notwithstanding this critical situation the Court concludes that the Constitution requires a procedure fraught with delay even though the American Bar Association Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, Trial By Jury, has recognized the New York City three-judge procedure as a possible compromise measure where jury trials are not permitted or waived, and the further fact that one-half the defendants tried for misdemeanors in New York City are acquitted.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b172-5">Ill</p>
<p id="b172-6">Today’s decisions demonstrate a constitutional schizophrenia born of the need to cope with national diversity under the constraints of the incorporation doctrine. In <em>Baldwin </em>the prevailing opinion overrides the consideration of local needs, but in <em>Williams </em>the Court seeks out a minimum standard to avoid causing disruption in numerous instances even though, <em>a prion, </em>incorporation would surely require a jury of 12. The six-man, six-month rule of today’s decisions simply reflects the lowest common denominator in the scope and function of the right to trial by jury in this country, but the circumstance that every jurisdiction except New York City has a trial by a jury for offenses punishable by six months in prison obscures the variety of opinion that actually exists as to the proper place for the jury in the administration of justice. More discriminating analysis indicates that four States besides Florida authorize a jury of less than 12 to try felony <page-number citation-index="1" label="137">*137</page-number>offenses<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and three States authorize a nonunanimous verdict<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in felony cases, and at least two other States provide a trial without jury in the first instance for certain offenses punishable by more than one year with a right to <em>de novo </em>trial on appeal.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Eight States provide for juries ranging from five to 12 to try crimes punishable by one year in prison, and one State has provided for a verdict by nine in a jury of 12.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Five States first provide a bench trial for misdemeanors from which the defendant can seek a trial <em>de novo </em>by jury,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> a procedure that this Court, in a federal trial, has deemed incompatible with the Sixth Amendment for putting the accused to the burden of two trials if he wishes a jury verdict. See <em>Callan </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="92280"><a href="/opinion/92280/callan-v-wilson/" aria-description="Citation for case: Callan v. Wilson">127 U. S. 540</a></span> (1888).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b173-5">These varying provisions, reflecting as they do differing estimates of the importance of the jury in securing a fair trial and the feasibility of administering such a procedure given the local circumstances, and the extensive study and debate about the merits and demerits of the jury system, demonstrate that the relevance and proper role of trial by jury in the administration of criminal justice is yet far from sure.</p>
<p id="b174-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="138">*138</page-number>“Incorporation” in <em><span class="citation" data-id="107685"><a href="/opinion/107685/duncan-v-louisiana/" aria-description="Citation for case: Duncan v. Louisiana">Duncan</a></span> </em>closed the door on debate,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> irrespective of local circumstances, such as the backlogs in urban courts like those of New York City, and has, without justification, clouded with uncertainty the constitutionality of these differing state modes of proceeding, see Appendix, pending approval by this Court; it now promises to dilute in other ways the settled meaning of the federal right to a trial by jury. Flexibility for experimentation in the administration of justice should be returned to the States here and in other areas that now have been swept into the rigid mold of “incorporation.” I agree with The Chief Justice: “That the ‘near-uniform judgment of the Nation’ is otherwise than the judgment in some of its parts affords no basis ... to read into the Constitution something not found there.” Opinion of The Chief Justice in <em>Baldwin, ante, </em>at 77.</p>
<p id="b174-4">It is time, I submit, for this Court to face up to the reality implicit in today’s holdings and reconsider the “incorporation” doctrine before its leveling tendencies further retard development in the field of criminal procedure by stifling flexibility in the States and by discarding the possibility of federal leadership by example.</p>

<author id="b179-5">Mr. Justice Stewart,</author>
<p id="AzS">dissenting in No. 188, <em>ante, </em>p. 66, and concurring in the result in No. 927.</p>
<p id="b179-6">I substantially agree with the separate opinion Mr. Justice Harlan has filed in these cases — an opinion that fully demonstrates some of the basic errors in a mechanistic “incorporation” approach to the Fourteenth Amendment. I cannot subscribe to his opinion in its entirety, however, if only for the reason that it relies in part upon certain dissenting and concurring opinions in previous cases in which I did not join.</p>
<p id="b179-7">The “incorporation” theory postulates the Bill of Rights as the substantive metes and bounds of the Fourteenth Amendment. I think this theory is incorrect as a matter of constitutional history, and that as a matter of constitutional law it is both stultifying and unsound. It is, at best, a theory that can lead the Court only to a Fourteenth Amendment dead end. And, at worst, the spell of the theory’s logic compels the Court either to impose intolerable restrictions upon the constitutional sovereignty of the individual States in the administration of their own criminal law, or else intolerably to relax the explicit restrictions that the Framers actually did put upon the <em>Federal </em>Government in the administration of criminal justice. All this, and much more, is elaborated in Mr. Justice Harlan’s separate opinion, and I would affirm the judgments in both No. 188 and No. 927 for substantially the reasons he states.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b180-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="144">*144</page-number>The architect of the contemporary “incorporation” approach to the Fourteenth Amendment is, of course, Mr. Justice Black. See <em>Adamson </em>v. <em>California, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104455"><a href="/opinion/104455/adamson-v-california/#68" aria-description="Citation for case: Adamson v. California">332 U. S. 46, 68</a></span> (dissenting opinion).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And the separate opinion my Brother Black has filed today in No. 927 could serve as Exhibit A to illustrate the extraordinary habits of thought into which some of us have fallen in conditioned reflex to that erroneous constitutional doctrine. “Incorporation” has become so Pavlovian that my Brother Black barely mentions the Fourteenth Amendment in the course of an 11-page opinion dealing with the procedural rule the State of Florida has adopted for cases tried in Florida courts under Florida’s criminal laws.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His opinion relies .instead upon the “plain and obvious meaning” of the “specific words” of the Fifth Amendment and other “provisions of the Bill of Rights” which, together with “the history surrounding <page-number citation-index="1" label="145">*145</page-number>the adoption of those provisions,” make clear that “[t]he Framers . . . designed” those rights “to shield the defendant against state power.”</p>
<p id="b181-5">Though I admire the rhetoric, I submit with all deference that those statements are, to quote their author, “plainly and simply wrong as a matter of fact and law . . . If the Constitution forbids the Florida alibi-defense procedure, it is because of the Fourteenth Amendment, and not because of either the “specific words” of the Bill of Rights or “the history surrounding” their adoption. For as every schoolboy knows, the Framers “designed” the Bill of Rights not against “state power,” but against the power of the Federal Government.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>

<p id="b159-6"> The Court’s conclusions from the historical materials, by its own admission, can hardly be characterized as solid. The entire argument seems to flow from the fact that the Senate Committee substituted the present language of the Sixth Amendment for the more specific House version that incorporated the unanimity requirement and expressly tied the jury to “other accustomed requisites.” But the meaning of this change is wholly speculative, for, apart from the “vicinage” requirement, there is no concrete evidence cited by the Court to show that the Senate opposed the more likely features of the Madison version adopted by the House. In the context of an amendment notable for its sparseness of language,, a more likely explanation of the Senate’s action is that it was streamlining the Madison version on the assumption that the most prominent features of the jury would be preserved as a matter of course. This interpretation of the events is supported by the fact that the only specifically objectionable feature of the common-law jury — the vicinage requirement — was pre-empted by language providing for a trial by a jury of the district, thus leaving the remaining attributes undefined in face of the distinct expectation that those charged with interpretation would look to the common law. Nor is this explanation rendered less forceful by the fact, noted by the Court, that “reception” of the common-law jury did not unfailingly mean 12 in early colonial times. As the Court itself acknowledges, the States that had constitutions in 1787 provided for juries of 12. The Court’s other arguments — (1) that simple reference to a jury in Article III was not necessarily thought to mean to the Framers a common-law jury in fight of the need felt to add the Amendments and Madison’s more elaborate proposal for the Sixth Amendment; and, (2) that the allusion to “common law” in the Seventh Amendment suggests that it is not the backdrop for the Sixth Amendment jury — are too remote to require rejoinder.</p>

<p id="b180-6"> I have had occasion to state elsewhere my own understanding, for whatever it is worth, of the motivational origins of Fourteenth Amendment “incorporation”:</p>
<blockquote id="AO6">“Shortly before Justice Jackson came to the Court, some of its then more junior members had embraced the comforting theory that the Fourteenth Amendment’s substantive impact upon the states could be exactly measured by the specific restrictions that the first eight Amendments imposed upon the National Government. I call this a 'comforting’ theory, because, for critics of the old Court’s subjective approach to due process, it was a theory that appeared to give the Fourteenth Amendment objective content and definable scope.” (Footnotes omitted.)
