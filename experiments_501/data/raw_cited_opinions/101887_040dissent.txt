<p id="AlF">dissenting.</p>
<p id="b382-8">Chapter 147 of the Session Laws of Oklahoma, 1925, declares that the manufacture of ice for sale and distribution is “ a public business ”; confers upon the Corporation Commission in respect to it the powers of regulation customarily exercised over public utilities; ,and -provides specifically for securing adequate service. The statute makes it a misdemeanor to engage in the business without a license from the Commission; directs that the license shall not issue except pursuant to a prescribed written application, after a formal hearing upon adequate notice <page-number citation-index="1" label="281">*281</page-number>both to the community to be served and to the general public, and a showing upon competent evidence, of the necessity <em>“ </em>at the place desired;” and it provides that the application may be denied, among other grounds, if “ the facts proved at said hearing disclose that the facilities for the manufacture, sale and distribution of ice by some person, firm or corporation already licensed by said Commission at said point, community or place are sufficient to meet the public needs therein.”</p>
<p id="b383-4">Under a license, so granted, the New State Ice Company is, and for some years has been, engaged in the manufacture, sale and distribution of ice at Oklahoma City, and has invested in that business 1500,000. While it was so engaged, Liebmann, without having obtained or applied for a license, purchased a parcel of land in that city and commenced the construction thereon of an ice plant for the purpose of entering the business in competition with the plaintiff. To enjoin him from doing so this suit was brought by the Ice Company. Compare <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Corporation Commission, </em>278 U. S. 515. Liebmann contends that the manufacture of ice for sale and distribution is not a public business; that it is a private business and, indeed, a common calling; that the right to engage in a common calling is one of the fundamental liberties guaranteed by the due process clause; and that to make his right to engage in that calling dependent upon a finding of public necessity deprives him of liberty and property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Upon full hearing the District Court sustained that contention and dismissed the bill. 42 F. (2d) 913. Its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 52 F. (2d) 349. The case is here on appeal. In my opinion, the judgment should be reversed.</p>
<p id="b383-5"><em>First. </em>The Oklahoma statute makes entry into the business of manufacturing ice for sale and distribution dependent, in effect, upon a certificate of public convenience <page-number citation-index="1" label="282">*282</page-number>and necessity. Such a certificate was unknown to the common law. It is a creature of the machine age, in which plants have displaced tools and businesses are substituted for trades. The purpose of requiring it is to promote the public interest by preventing waste. Particularly in those businesses in which interest and depreciation charges on plant constitute a large element in the cost of production, experience has taught that the financial burdens incident to unnecessary duplication of facilities are likely to bring high rates and poor service.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There, cost is usually dependent, among other things, upon volume; and division of possible patronage among competing concerns may so raise the unit cost of operation as to make it impossible to provide adequate service at reasonable rates. The introduction in the United States of the certificate of public convenience and necessity marked the growing conviction that under certain circumstances free competition might be harmful to the community and that, when it was so, absolute freedom to enter the business of one’s choice should be denied.</p>
<p id="b384-5">Long before the enactment of the Oklahoma statute here challenged a like requirement had become common in the United States in some lines of business. The certificate -was required first for railroads; then for street railways; then for other public utilities whose operation is dependent upon the grant of some special privilege.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="283">*283</page-number>Latterly, the requirement has been widely extended to common carriers by motor vehicle which use the highways, but which, unlike street railways and electric light' companies, are not dependent upon the grant of any special privilege.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In Oklahoma the certificate was required, as early as 1915, for cotton gins — a business then declared a public one, and, like the business of manufacturing ice,, conducted wholly upon private property. Sess. Laws, 1915, c. 176, § 3. See <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Corporation Commission, </em>278 U. S. 515, 517. As applied to public. utilities, the validity under the Fourteenth Amendment of the requirement of the certificate has never been successfully questioned.</p>
<p id="b385-4"><em>Second. </em>Oklahoma declared the business of manufacturing ice for sale and distribution a “ public business; ” that is, a public utility. So far as appears, it was the first State to do so.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Of course, a legislature cannot by-<page-number citation-index="1" label="284">*284</page-number>mere legislative fiat convert a business into a public utility. <em>Producers Transportation Co. </em>v. <em>Railroad Commission, </em>251 U. S. 228, 230. But the conception of a public utility is not static.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The welfare of the community may require that the business of supplying ice be made a public utility, as well as the business of supplying water or any other necessary commodity or service. If the business is, or can be made, a public utility, it must be possible to make the issue of a certificate a prerequisite to engaging in it.</p>
<p id="b386-6">Whether the local conditions are such as to justify converting a private business into a public one is a matter primarily for the determination of the state, legislature. Its determination is subject to judicial review; but the usual presumption of validity attends the enactment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="285">*285</page-number>The action of the State must be held valid unless clearly arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. “ The - legislature being familiar with local conditions is, primarily, the judge of the necessity of such enactments. The mere fact that a court may differ with the legislature in its views of public policy, or that judges may hold views inconsistent with the propriety of the legislation in question, affords no ground for judicial interference, . . .” <em>McLean </em>v. <em>Arkansas, </em>211 U. S. 539, 547. Whether the grievances are real or fancied, whether the remedies are wise or foolish, are not matters about which the Court may concern itself.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> “ Our present duty is to pass. upon the statute before us, and if it has been enacted upon a belief of evils that is not arbitrary we cannot measure their extent against the estimate of the legislature.” <em>Tanner </em>v. <em>Little, </em>240 U. S. 369, 385. A decision that the legislature’s belief of evils was arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable may not be made without enquiry into the facts with reference to which it acted.</p>
<p id="b387-5"><em>Third. </em>Liebmann challenges the statute — not an order of the Corporation Commission. If he had applied for a license and been denied one, we should have been obliged to enquire whether the evidence introduced before <page-number citation-index="1" label="286">*286</page-number>the Commission justified it in. refusing permission to establish an additional ice plant in Oklahoma City. As he did not apply but challenges the statute itself, our enquiry is of an entirely different nature. Liebmann Tests his defense upon the broad claim that the Federal Constitution gives him the right to enter' the business of manufacturing ice for sale even if his doing so be found by the properly constituted, authority to be inconsistent with the public welfare. He claims that, whatever the local conditions may demand, to confer upon the Commission power to deny that right is an unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious restraint upon his liberty.</p>
<p id="AxUs">The function of the Court is primarily to determine whether the conditions in Oklahoma are such that the legislature could not reasonably conclude (1) that the public welfare required. treating the manufacture of ice for sale and distribution as a “public business”; and (2) that in order to ensure to the inhabitants of some communities an adequate supply of ice at reasonable rates it was necessary to give the Commission power to exclude the establishment of an additional ice plant in places where the community was already well served. Unless the Coürt can say that the Federal Constitution confers an absolute right to engage anywhere in the business of manufacturing ice for sale, it cannot properly decide that the legislators acted unreasonably without first ascertaining what was the experience of Oklahoma in respect to the ice business. The relevant facts appear, in part, of record. Others are matters of common knowledge to those familiar with the ice business. Compare <em>Muller </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>208 U. S. 412, 419, 420. They show the. actual conditions, or the beliefs, on which the legislators acted. In considering these matters we do not, in a strict senseitake judicial notice of them as embodying statements of' uncontrovertible facts. Our function is only to determine the reasonableness of the legislature’s belief in the existence" of evils and in the effectiveness of the remedy <page-number citation-index="1" label="287">*287</page-number>provided. In performing this function we have no occasion to consider whether all the statements of fact which may be the basis of the-prevailing belief are well-founded; and we have, of course, no right to weigh conflicting evidence.</p>
<p id="b389-4">(A) In Oklahoma a regular supply of ice may reasonably be considered a necessary of life, comparable to that of water, gas and electricity. The climate, which heightens the need of ice for comfortable and wholesome living, precludes resort to the natural product.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There, as elsewhere, the development of the manufactured ice industry in recent years <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> has. been attended by deep-seated alterations in the economic structure and by radical changes in habits of popular thought and living. Ice has come to be regarded as a household, necessity, indispensable to the preservation, of' food and so to economical household management and the maintenance of health.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>. Its.crm<page-number citation-index="1" label="288">*288</page-number>mercial uses are extensive. In urban communities, they absorb a large proportion of the total amount of ice manufactured for sale.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The transportation, storage and distribution of a great - part of the nation’s food supply is dependent upon a continuous, and dependable supply of ice.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It appears from the record that in certain parts Of Oklahoma a large trade in dairy and other products has <page-number citation-index="1" label="289">*289</page-number>been built up as a result of rulings of the Corporation Commission under the Act of 1925, compelling licensed manufacturers to serve agricultural communities;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that this trade would be destroyed if the supply of ice. were withdrawn.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> .We cannot say that the legislature of Oklahoma acted arbitrarily in declaring that ice is an ■article of primary necessity, in industry and agriculture as well as in the household, partaking of the fundamental character of electricity, gas, water, transportation and' communication.</p>
<p id="b391-4">Nor can the Court properly take judicial notice that, in Oklahoma, the means of manufacturing ice,for private use are within the reach of all persons who are dependent upon it. Certainly it has not been so. In 1925 domestic mechanical refrigeration had scarcely emerged from the experimental stage.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Since that time, the production and consumption of ice manufactured, for sale, far from <page-number citation-index="1" label="290">*290</page-number>diminishing, has steadily increased.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In Oklahoma the mechanical household refrigerator is still an article of relative luxury.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Legislation essential to the protection of individuals of limited or no means is not invalidated by the circumstance that other individuals are financially able to protect themselves.. The businesses of power companies and of common carriers by street railway, steam railroad or motor vehicle fall within the field of public control, although it is possible, for a relatively modest outlay, to install individual power plants, or to purchase <page-number citation-index="1" label="291">*291</page-number>motor vehicles for private carriage of passengers or goods. The question whether in Oklahoma the means of securing refrigeration otherwise than by ice manufactured for sale and distribution has become so general as to destroy popular dependence upon ice plants is one peculiarly appropriate for the determination of its legislature and peculiarly inappropriate for determination by this Court, which cannot have knowledge of all the relevant facts. ,</p>
<p id="b393-4">The business of supplying ice is not only a necessity, like that of supplying food or clothing or shelter, but the legislature could also consider that it is one which lends itself peculiarly to monopoly.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Characteristically the business is conducted in local plants with a market narrowly limited in area,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and this for the reason that ice <page-number citation-index="1" label="292">*292</page-number>manufactured at a distance cannot effectively compete with a plant on the ground.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In small towns and rural communities<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the duplication of plants, and in larger communities the duplication of delivery service,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> is wasteful and ultimately burdensome to consumers. At the same time the relative ease and cheapness with which an ice plant may be constructed exposes the industry to destructive and frequently ruinous competition. Competition in the industry • tends to be destructive because ice plants have a determinate capacity, and inflexibledixed charges and operating costs, and because in a' market of limited area the volume of sales is not readily expanded. Thus, the erection of a new plant in a locality already adequately served often causes managers to go to extremes in cutting prices in order to secure business. Trade journals and reports of association meetings of ice manufacturers bear ample witness to the hostility of the industry to such corn-<page-number citation-index="1" label="293">*293</page-number>petition, and to its unremitting efforts, through trade associations, informal agreements, combination of delivery-systems, and in particular through the consolidation of plants, to protect markets and prices against competition of any character.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b395-4">That these forces were operative in Oklahoma prior to the passage of the Act under review, is apparent from the record. Thus, it was testified that in only six or seven localities in the State containing, in the aggregate, not more than 235,000 of the total population of approximately 2,000,000, was there “ a semblance of competition ”;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and that even in those localities the prices of ice were ordinarily uniform. The balance of the population was, and still is, served by companies enjoying complete monopoly. Compare <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S. 113, 131, 132; <em>Sinking Fund Cases, </em>99 U. S. 700, 747; <em>Wabash, St. L. &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Illinois, </em>118 U. S. 557, 569; <em>Spring Valley Water Works </em>v. <em>Schottler, </em>110 U. S. 347, 354; <em>Budd </em>v. <em>New York, </em>143 U. S. 517, 545; <em>Wolff Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Court, </em>262 U. S. 522, 528. Where there was competition, it often resulted to. the disadvantage rather <page-number citation-index="1" label="294">*294</page-number>than the advantage of the public, both in respect to prices and to service. Some communities were without ice altogether, and the State was without means of assuring their supply. There is abundant evidence of widespread dis-\ satisfaction with ice service prior to the Act of 1925,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and of material improvement in the situation subse- . quently. It is stipulated in the record that the ice industry as a whole in Oklahoma has acquiesced in and accepted the Act and the status which it creates.</p>
<p id="b396-6">(B) The statute under review rests not only upon the facts just detailed but upon a long period of experience in more limited regulation dating back to the first year of Oklahoma’s statehood. For 17 years prior to the passage of the Act of 1925, the Corporation Commission under § 13 of the Act of. June 10, 1908, had exercised jurisdiction oyer the rates, practices and service of ice plants, its action in each case, however, being predicated upon a finding that the company complained of enjoyed a “virtual monopoly” of the ice business in the community which it served.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The jurisdiction thus exer<page-number citation-index="1" label="295">*295</page-number>cised was upheld by the Supreme. Court of the State in <em>Oklahoma Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Corporation Commission, </em>96 Okla. 19; 220 Pac. 54. The court said, at p. 24:</p>
<blockquote id="b397-4">“ The manufacture, sale, and distribution of ice in many respects closely resemble the sale and'distribution of gas as fuel, or electric current, and in many communities the same company that manufactures, sells, and distributes electric current is the only concern that manufactures,. sells,.and distributes ice, and by reason of the nature and extent of the ice business it is impracticable in that community to interest any other concern in such business. In this situation, the distributor of such a necessity as ice should not be permitted by reason of the impracticability of any one else engaging in the business to charge unreasonable prices, and if such an abuse is persisted in, the'regulatory power of the State should be invoked to protect the public.” See also <em>Consumers Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Phipps, </em>120 Okla. 223; 251 Pac. 63.</blockquote>
<p id="b397-5">By formal orders, the Commission repeatedly fixed or approved prices to be charged in particular communities;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> required ice to be sold without discrimination<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index="1" label="296">*296</page-number>and to be distributed as equitably as possible to the extent of the capacity of the plant;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> forbade short weights and ordered scales to be carried on delivery wagons and ice to be weighed upon the customer’s request;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and undertook to compel sanitary practices in the manufacture of ice<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> and courteous service of patrons.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Many of these regulations, other than those fixing prices, were embodied in a general order to all ice companies, issued July 15, 1921, and are still in effect.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Informally, the Commis<page-number citation-index="1" label="297">*297</page-number>sion adjusted a much greater volume of complaints of a similar nature.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It appears from the record that for some years prior to the Act of 1925 one day of each week was reserved by the Commission to hear complaints relative to the ice business.</p>
<p id="b399-4">As early as 1911, the Commission in its annual report to the Governor, had recommended legislation more clearly delineating its powers in this field:</p>
<blockquote id="b399-5">“ There should be a law passed putting the regulation of ice plants under the jurisdiction of the Commission. The Commission is now assuming this jurisdiction under an Act passed by the Legislature known as the anti-trust law. A specific law upon this subject would obviate any question of jurisdiction.” <footnotemark>35</footnotemark></blockquote>
<p id="b399-6">This recommendation was several times repeated, in terms revealing the extent and character of public complaint against the practices of ice companies.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b400-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="298">*298</page-number>The enactment of the so-called Ice Act in. 1925 enlarged the existing jurisdiction of the Corporation Commission by removing the requirement of a finding of virtual monopoly in each particular case, compare <em>Budd </em>v. <em>New York, </em>143 U. S. 517, 545, with <em>Brass </em>v. <em>Stoeser, </em>153 U. S. 391, 402, 403; by conferring the same authority to compel adequate service as in the case of other public utilities; and by committing to the Commission the function of issuing licenses equivalent to a certificate of public convenience and necessity. With the exception of the granting and denying of such licenses and the exertion of wider control over service, the regulatory activity of the Commission in respect to ice plants has not changed in character since 1925. It appears to have diminished somewhat in volume.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b401-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="299">*299</page-number>In 1916, the. Commission urged, in its report to the Governor, that all public utilities under its jurisdiction be required to secure from the Commission “what is known as a ‘certificate of.public convenience and necessity ’ before the duplication of facilities.”</p>
<p id="b401-4">“ This would prevent ruinous competition resulting in the driving out of business of small though' competent public service utilities by more powerful corporations, and often consequent demoralization of service, or the requiring of the public to patronize two utilities in a community where one would be adequate.” <footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b401-5">Up to that time a certificate of public convenience and necessity to engage in the business had been applied only to cotton gins. Okla. Sess. Laws, 1915, c. 176, § 3: In 1917 a certificate from the Commission was declared prerequisite to the construction of new telephone or telegraph lines.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> In 1923 it was required for the operation of motor carriers.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> In 1925, the year in which the Ice Act was passed, the requirement was extended also to power, heat, light, gas, electric or water companies pro<page-number citation-index="1" label="300">*300</page-number>posing to do business in any locality already possessing one such utility.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b402-5"><em>Fourth. </em>Can it be said in the light of these facts that it was not an appropriate exercise of legislative discretion to authorize the Commission to deny a license to enter the business in localities where necessity for another plant did not exist? The need of some remedy for the evil of destructive competition, where competition existed, had been and was widely felt. Where competition did not exist, the propriety of public regulation had been proven. Many communities were not supplied with ice at all. The particular remedy adopted was not enacted hastily. The statute was based upon a long-established state policy recognizing the public importance of the ice business, and upon 17 years’ legislative and administrative experience in the regulation of it. The advisability of treating the ice business as a public utility and of applying to it the certificate of convenience and necessity had been under consideration for many years. Similar legislation had been enacted in Oklahoma under similar circumstances with respect to other public services. The measure bore a substantial relation to the evils found to exist. Under these circumstances, to hold the Act void as being unreasonable, would, in my opinion involve the exercise not of the function of judicial review, but the function of a super-legislature. If the Act is to be stricken down, it must be on the ground that the Federal Constitution guarantees to the individual the absolute right to enter the ice business, however detrimental the exercise o(f that right may be to the public welfare. Such,' indeed, appears to be the contention made.</p>
<p id="b403-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="301">*301</page-number><em>Fifth. </em>The claim, is that manufacturing ice for sale and distribution is a business inherently private, and, in effect, that no state of facts can justify denial of the right to engage in it. To supply one’s self with water, electricity, gas, ice or any other article, is inherently a matter of private concern. So also may be the business of supplying the same articles to others for compensation. But the business of supplying to others, for compensation, any article or service whatsoever may become a matter of public concern. Whether it is, or is not, depends upon the conditions existing in the community affected.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> If it is a matter of public concern, it may be regulated, whatever the business. The public’s concern may be limited to a single feature of the business, so that the needed protection can be secured by a relatively slight degree of regulation. Such is the concern over possible incompetence, which dictates the licensing of dentists, <em>Dent </em>v. <em>West Virginia, </em>129 U. S. 114, 122; <em>Douglas </em>v. <em>Noble, </em>261 U. S. 165, 170; or the concern over possible dishonesty, which led to the licensing of auctioneers or hawkers, <em>Baccus </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>232 U. S. 334, 338. On the other hand, the public’s concern about a particular business may be so pervasive and varied as to require constant detailed supervision and a very high degree of regulation. Where this is true, it is common to speak of the business as being a <em>“ </em>public ” one, although it- is privately owned. It is to such businesses that the designation “ public utility ” is commonly applied; or they are spoken.of as “ affected with a public interest.” <em>German Alliance Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>233 U. S. 389, 408.</p>
<p id="b403-4">A regulation valid for one kind of business may, of course, be invalid for another; since the reasonableness' <page-number citation-index="1" label="302">*302</page-number>of every regulation is dependent upon the relevant facts. But so far as concerns the power to regulate, there is no difference in essence, between a business called private and one called a public utility or said to be <em>“ </em>affected with a public interest.” Whatever the nature of the business, whatever the scope or character of the regulation applied, the source of the power invoked is the same. And likewise the constitutional limitation upon that power. ■ The source is the police power. The limitation is that set by the due process clause, which, as construed, requires- that the regulation shall be not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious; and that the means of regulation selected shall have a real or substantial relation to the object sought to be obtained. The notion of a distinct, category of business <em>“ </em>affected with a public interest,” employing property “ devoted to a public use,” rests upon historical error. The consequences which it is sought to draw from those phrases are belied by the meaning in which they were first used centuries ago,<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> and by the decision of this Court, in <em>Munn </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>94 U. S. 113, which first introduced them into the law of the Constitution.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In my opinion, the true principle is that the <page-number citation-index="1" label="303">*303</page-number>State’s power extends to every regulation of any business reasonably required and appropriate for the public protection. I find in the due process clause no other limitation upon the character or the scope of regulation permissible.</p>
<p id="b405-4"><em>Sixth. </em>It is urged specifically that manufacturing ice for sale and- distribution is a common calling; and that the right to engage in a common calling is one of the fundamental liberties guaranteed by the due process clause. To think of the ice-manufacturing business as a common calling is difficult; so recent is it in origin and so peculiar in character. Moreover, the Constitution does not require that every calling which has been common shall ever remain so. The liberty to engage in a common calling, like other liberties, may be limited in the exercise of the police power. The slaughtering of cattle had been a common calling in New Orleans before the monopoly sustained in <em>Slaughter-House Cases, </em>16 Wall. 36, was created by the legislature. Prior to the Eighteenth Amendment selling liquor was a common calling, but this Court held it to be consistent with the due process clause for a State to abolish the calling, <em>Bartemeyer </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>18 Wall. 129; <em>Mugler </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>123 U. S. 623, or to establish a system limiting the number of licenses, <em>Crowley </em>v. <em>Christensen, </em>137 U. S. 86. Every citizen has the right to navigate a river or lake, and may even carry others thereon for hire. But the ferry privilege may be made exclusive in order that the patronage may be sufficient to justify maintaining the ferry service, <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Taylor’s Executor, </em>1 Black 603, 633, 634.</p>
<p id="b406-5"><page-number citation-index="1" label="304">*304</page-number><em>1 </em>It is settled that the police power commonly invoked •in aid of health, safety and morals, extends equally to the promotion of the public welfare.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark>- The cases just cited show that, while, ordinarily, free competition in the com-, mon callings has been encouraged, the public welfare may at other times demand that monopolies be created. Upon this principle is based our whole modern practice of public utility regulation. It is no objection to the validity of the statute here assailed that it fosters monopoly. That, indeed, is its design. The certificate of public convenience and invention is a device — a recent social-economic invention — thrqugh which the monopoly is kept under effective control by vesting in a commission the power to terminate it whenever that course is required in the public interest. To grant any monopoly to any person as a ' favor is forbidden even if terminable. But where, as ['here, there is reasonable ground for the legislative con- : elusion that in order to secure a necessary service at ij reasonable rates, it may be necessary to curtail the right Jito enter the calling, it is, in my opinion,-consistent with the due process clause to do so, whatever the nature of the business. The existence of such power in the legislature seems indispensable in our ever-changing society. .</p>
<p id="b406-6">It is settled by unanimous decisions of this Court, that the due process clause does not prevent a State or city from engaging in the business of supplying its inhabitants with articles in general use, when it is believed that they <page-number citation-index="1" label="305">*305</page-number>cannot be secured at reasonable prices from the private dealers. Thus, a city may, if the local law permits, buy and sell at retail coal and wood, <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Portland, </em>245 U. S. 217; or gasoline, <em>Standard Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Lincoln, </em>275 U. S. 504. And a State may, if permitted by its own Constitution, build and operate warehouses, "elevators, packinghouses, flour mills or other factories, <em>Green </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>253 U. S. 233. As States may engage in a business, because it is a public purpose to assure to their inhabitants an adequate supply of necessary articles, may they not achieve this public purpose, as Oklahoma has done, by exercising the lesser power of preventing single individuals from wantonly engaging in the business and thereby making impossible a dependable private source of supply? As a State so entering upon a business may exert the taxing' power all individual dealers may be driven from the calling by the unequal competition. If States are denied the power to prevent the harmful entry of a few individuals’into a business, they may thus, in effect, close it-altogether to private enterprise.</p>
<p id="b407-4"><em>Seventh. </em>The economic emergencies of the past were incidents of scarcity. In those days it was preeminently the common callings that were the subjects of regulation. The danger then threatening was excessive prices. To prevent what was deemed extortion, the English Parliament fixed the prices of commodities and of services from time to time during the four centuries preceding the Declaration of Independence.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Like legislation was en<page-number citation-index="1" label="306">*306</page-number>acted in the Colonies; and in the States, after the Revolution.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> When .the first due process clause was written into the Federal Constitution, the price of bread was being fixed by statute in at least two of the States, and this practice continued long thereafter.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Dwelling houses when occupied by the owner are preeminently private property. From the foundation of our Government those who wished to lease residential property had been free to charge to tenants such rentals as they pleased. But for years after the World War had ended, the scarcity of dwellings in the City of New York was such that the State’s legislative power was invoked to ensure reasonable rentals. The constitutionality of the statute was sustained by this Court. <em>Marcus Brown Holding Co. </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>256 U. S. 170. Similar legislation of Congress for the City of Washington was also upheld. <em>Block </em>v. <em>Hirsh, </em>256 U. S. 135.</p>
<p id="b408-6"><em>Eighth. </em>The people of the United States are now confronted with an emergency more serious 'than war. Misc.y is wide-spread, in a time, not of scarcity, but of over-abundance. The long-continued depression has brought unprecedented unemployment, a catastrophic fall in commodity prices and a volume of economic losses which threatens our financial institutions.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Some people <page-number citation-index="1" label="307">*307</page-number>believe that the existing conditions threaten even the stability of the capitalistic system.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Economists are searching for the causes of this disorder and are reexamining the bases of our industrial structure. Business men are seeking possible remedies. Most of them realize that failure to distribute widely the profits of industry has been a prime cause of our present plight. But rightly or wrongly, many ■ persons think that one of the major contributing causes has been unbridled competition.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Increasingly, doubt is expressed whether it is economically wise, or morally right, that men should be permitted to <page-number citation-index="1" label="308">*308</page-number>add to the producing facilities' of an industry which is already suffering from over-capacity. In justification of that doubt, men point to the excess-capacity of our productive facilities' resulting from their vast expansion without corresponding increase in the consumptive capacity of the people. They assert that through improved methods of manufacture, made possible by advances in science and invention and vast accumulation of capital, our industries had become capable of producing from thirty to one hundred per cent, more than was consumed even in days of vaunted prosperity; and that the present capacity will, for a long time, exceed the needs of business.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> All agree that irregularity in employment — the greatest of our evils — cannot be overcome unless production and consumption are more nearly balanced. Many insist there must be some form of economic control. There are plans for proration. There? are many proposals for stabilization.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> And some thoughtful men ' <page-number citation-index="1" label="309">*309</page-number>of wide business experience insist that all projects for stabilization and proration must prove futile unless, in some wáy, the equivalent of the certificate of public convenience arid necessity is made a prerequisite to embarking new capital in an industry in which the capacity already exceeds the production schedules.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b411-4">Whether that view is sound nobody knows. The objections to the proposal are obvious and grave. The remedy might bring evils worse than the present disease.. The <page-number citation-index="1" label="310">*310</page-number>obstacles to success seem insuperable.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> The economic and social sciences are largely uncharted seas. We have been none too successful- in the modest essays in economic control already entered upon. The new proposal involves a vast extension of the area of control. Merely to acquire the knowledge essential ás a basis for the exercise of this multitude of judgments would be a formidable task; and each of the thousands of these judgments would call for some measure of prophecy. Even more serious are the obstacles to success inherent in the demands which execution of the project would make upon human intelligence and upon the character of men. Man is weak and his judgment is at best fallible.</p>
<p id="b412-5">Yet the advances in the exact sciences and the achievements in invention remind us that the seemingly impossible sometimes happens. There are many men now living who were in the habit of using the age-old expression: “It-is as impossible as flying.” The discoveries in physical science, the triumphs in invention, attest the value of the process of trial and error. In large measure, these advances have been due.to. experimentation. In those fields experimentation has, for two centuries, been not only free but encouraged. Some people assert that our present plight is due, in part, to the limitations set <page-number citation-index="1" label="311">*311</page-number>by courts upon experimentation in the fields of social and economic science; and to the discouragement to which proposals for betterment there have been subjected otherwise.. There must be power in the States and the Nation to remould, through experimentation, our economic practices and institutions to meet changing social and economic needs. I cannot believe that the framers of the-Fourteenth Amendment, or the States which ratified it, intended to deprive us of the power to correct the evils of technological unemployment and excess productive ca.pacity which have attended progress in the useful arts.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b413-4">To stay experimentation in things social and economic is a grave responsibility. Denial of the right to experiment may be fraught with serious consequences to the Nation. • It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country; This Court has the power to prevent ah experiment.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We may strike down the statute which embodies it on the ground that, in our opinion, the measure is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. We have power to do this, because the due process clause has been held by the Court applicable to matters of substantive law as well as to matters of procedure. But in the exercise of this high power, we must be ever on our guard, lest we erect our prejudices into legal principles. If we would guide by the light of reason, we must let our minds be bold.</p>

A considerable part of this refrigeration is supplied by concerns manufacturing ice for sale. Such concerns commonly supply ice "used in car-icing. Mechanical refrigeration is beyond the means of many small retail dealers. Moreover, since decay in food, once begun, cannot be arrested by subsequent refrigeration, ice, or a substitute, is often essential on the farm. See M. E. Pennington and A.

The population of the State in 1930 was 2,396,000. Fifteenth Census, vol. I, p. 18. It is estimated that 965,000 household refrigerators were sold in 1931, of which only 10,146 were sold in Oklahoma.

The price of ice for domestic use in Oklahoma’ varies from 40 to 70 cents the hundredweight. New families use as much as three or four tons of ice in a year.. In view of these facts, this Court can scarcely have judicial knowledge that in Oklahoma all families or businesses which are able to purchase ice are able to purchase a mechanical refrigerator. See Report of Committee on Fundamental Equipment, submitted to the President’s Conference on Home Building and Home Ownership, pp. Ill, 128-129.

<p id="b393-5"> It is noteworthy that the ice industry has the characteristic of uniformity of product or service common to most public utilities, and distinguishing it from other businesses in which differences in quality or style make difficult effective regulation.

<p id="b393-6">The tendency of the industry to be conducted as a public utility is reflected in the widespread entry into it in recent years of electrical, gas, and water utilities, and the like. Such companies in Oklahoma operate more than one-third of the ice plants. See Ice and Refrigeration Blue Book (10th ed.), pp. 1268-88.

<p id="b399-9"> In its Eighth and Ninth Annual Report, dated November 20, 1916, p. 5, the Commission said: “The scope of legislation pertaining to those utilities which serve the public generally should be broadened. Two conspicuous examples are ice plants and cotton compresses. Chapter 93, Session Laws, 1915, extends the jurisdiction of the Corporation Commission over water, heat, light, and power .companies, but does not include ice plants. Numerous complaints are received by the Commission each year as to extortionate practices of ice companies and exorbitant prices charged. The same jurisdiction should be given the Corporation Commission over ice plants as it exercises over gas, electric and water companies.”</p>
<p id="b399-10">In its Eleventh Annual Report, October 3, 1918, p. xxii, it was said: “The business of manufacturing and distributing ice is as much a matter of public concern as is the business of rendering water, electric or gas service and should be subject to the same regulation. Complaints are continuously being made to the Commission in reference to prices of ice, practices of ice companies, or service rendered by such companies, and the Commission lias frequently been called upon to exercise jurisdiction under the so-called Anti-Trust Laws. Specific legislation should be enacted in reference to these <page-number citation-index="1" label="298">*298</page-number>companies and the power of regulation should be madé definite and certain:”</p>
<p id="b400-7">Again, in the Twelfth Annual Report, November 18, 1919, p. 1: “ During the past summer season numerous complaints against practices and rates of ice utilities have arisen from at least a hundred towns and cities throughout the State. The same jurisdiction should be given the Corporation Commission over ice plants as it exercises over gas, electric, and water companies.”</p>

In In re Application of the Shawnee Ice Co. for increase of capacity in its plant, 22d Ann. Rep., p. 834, the applicant was allowed to withdraw its application, and the intervening application of E. A. Liebemann to erect a.new plant was denied. In Burbank Ice Co. Kaw City Ice &amp; Power Co., 23d Ann. Rep., p, 558, the defendant's permit to <page-number citation-index="1" label="299">*299</page-number>distribute ice in the town of Shidler was revoked upon a showing that it distributed during the summer months only and that the plaintiff’s local plant was operated throughout the year, was adequate to meet local needs, and could not be maintained in the face of the defendant’s competition. See also In re Application of New State Ice Co., <em>ibid., </em>p. 748. Other formal orders of the Commission have been issued without opinion.</p>
