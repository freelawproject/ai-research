xisting right but created a new one. Wheaton v. Peters, 8 Pet. 591, 661; American Tobacco Co., v. Werckmeister, 207 U.S. 284, 291; Globe Newspaper Co., v. Walker, 210 U.S. 356, 362; Caliga v.

The principle of the immunity from state taxation of instrumentalities of the Federal Government, and of the corresponding immunity of state instrumentalities from Federal taxation  essential to the maintenance of our dual system  has its inherent limitations. It is aimed at the protection of the operations of government (McCulloch v.
