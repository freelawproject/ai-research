**Lead Opinion**
 On February 16, 1951, the Regents, after viewing “The Miracle,” determined that it was “sacrilegious” and for that reason ordered the Commissioner of Education to rescind appellant’s license to exhibit the picture.  The Commissioner did so. Appellant brought the present action in the New York courts to review the determination of the Regents.  6 Among the claims advanced by appellant were (1) that the statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment as a prior restraint upon freedom of speech and of the press; (2) that it is invalid under the same Amendment as a violation of the guaranty of separate church and state and as a prohibition of the free exercise of religion; and, (3) that the term “sacrilegious” is so vague and indefinite as to offend due process.  The Appellate Division rejected all of appellant’s contentions and upheld the Regents’ determination.  278 App. Div. 253 , 104 N. Y. S. 2d 740.  On appeal the New York Court of Appeals, two judges dissenting, affirmed the order of the Appellate Division.  <citedDecision>303 N. Y. 242</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>101 N. E. 2d 665</citedDecision> .  The case is here on appeal.  28 U. S. C. § 1257 (2).  As we view the case, we need consider only appellant’s contention that the New York statute is an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech and a free press.  In Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm’n, 236 U. S. 230 (1915), a distributor of motion pictures sought to enjoin the enforcement of an Ohio statute which required the prior approval of a board of censors before any motion *500 picture could be publicly exhibited in the state, and which directed the board to approve only such films as it adjudged to be “of a moral, educational or amusing and harmless character.” The statute was assailed in part as an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court rejected this contention, stating that the first eight Amendments were not a restriction on state action.  215 F. 138, 141 (D. C. N. D. Ohio 1914).
