 Cummings involved the constitutionality of amendments to the Missouri Constitution of 1865 which provided that no one could engage in a number of specified professions (Cummings was a priest) unless he first swore that he had taken no part in the rebellion against the Union.  At issue in Garland was a federal statute which required attorneys to take a similar oath before they could practice in federal courts.  This Court struck down both provisions as bills of attainder on the ground that they were legislative acts inflicting punishment on a specific group: clergymen and lawyers who had taken part in the rebellion and therefore could not truthfully take the oath.  In reaching its result, the Court emphatically rejected the argument that the con *448 stitutional prohibition outlawed only a certain class of legislatively imposed penalties: “The deprivation of any rights, civil or political, previously enjoyed, may be punishment, the circumstances attending and the causes of the deprivation determining this fact.  Disqualification from office may be punishment, as in cases of conviction upon impeachment.  Disqualification from the pursuits of a lawful avocation, or from positions of trust, or from the privilege of appearing in the courts, or acting as an executor, administrator, or guardian, may also, and often has been, imposed as punishment.” 4 Wall., at 320.  The next extended discussion of the Bill of Attainder Clause 21 came in 1946, in United States v. Lovett, <citedDecision>328 U. S. 303</citedDecision> , where the Court invalidated § 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, 1943, 57 Stat. 431 , 450, which prohibited payment of further salary to three named federal employees, 22 as a bill of attainder.  “ [Legislative acts, no matter what their form, that apply either to named individuals or to easily ascer *449 tainable members of a group in such a way as to inflict punishment on them without a judicial trial are bills of attainder prohibited by the Constitution.  .  .  .  This permanent proscription from any opportunity to serve the Government is punishment, and of a most severe type.  ... No one would think that Congress could have passed a valid law, stating that after investigation it had found Lovett, Dodd, and Watson 'guilty’ of the crime of engaging in 'subversive activities,’ defined that term for the first time, and sentenced them to perpetual exclusion from any government employment.

 Id., at 509-511.  These cases are relevant to the question before us.  Even assuming that Congress had reason to conclude that some Communists would use union positions to bring about political strikes, “it cannot automatically be inferred that all members shar[e] their evil purposes or participate] in their illegal conduct.” Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232, 246 .  In utilizing the term “members of the Communist Party” to designate those persons who are likely to incite political strikes, it plainly is not the case that Congress has merely substituted a convenient shorthand term for a list of the characteristics it was trying to reach.  31 IV. The Solicitor General argues that § 504 is not a bill of attainder because the prohibition it imposes does not constitute “punishment.” In support of this conclusion, he urges that the statute was enacted for preventive rather *457 than retributive reasons — that its aim is not to punish Communists for what they have done in the past, but rather to keep them from positions where they will in the future be able to bring about undesirable events.  He relies on American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382 , which upheld § 9 (h) of the National Labor Relations Act, the predecessor of the statute presently before us.  In Douds the Court distinguished Cummings, Garland and <citedDecision>Lovett</citedDecision> on the ground that in those cases “the individuals involved were in fact being punished for past actions; whereas in this case they are subject to possible loss of position only because there is substantial ground for the congressional judgment that their beliefs and loyalties will be transformed into future conduct.” <citedDecision>Id., at 413</citedDecision> .  This case is not necessarily controlled by Douds .  For to prove its assertion that § 9 (h) was preventive rather than retributive in purpose, 32 the Court in Douds focused *458 on the fact that members of the Communist Party could escape from the class of persons specified by Congress simply by resigning from the Party: “Here the intention is to forestall future dangerous acts; there is no one who may not, by a voluntary alteration of the loyalties which impel him to action, become eligible to sign the affidavit.  We cannot conclude that this section is a bill of attainder.” Id., at 414 .  Section 504, unlike § 9 (h), disqualifies from the holding of union office not only present members of the Communist Party, but also anyone who has within the past five years been a member of the Party.  However, even if we make the assumption that the five-year provision was inserted not out of desire to visit retribution but purely out of a belief that failure to include it would lead to pro forma resignations from the Party which would not decrease the threat of political strikes, it still clearly appears that § 504 inflicts “punishment” within the meaning of the Bill of Attainder Clause.  It would be archaic to limit the definition of “punishment” to “retribution.” Punishment serves several purposes: retributive, rehabilitative, deterrent — and preventive.

 A number of English bills of attainder were enacted for preventive purposes — that is, the legislature made a judgment, undoubtedly based largely on past acts and associations (as § 504 is) 33 that a given person or group was likely to cause trouble (usually, overthrow the *459 government) and therefore inflicted deprivations upon that person or group in order to keep it from bringing about the feared event.  34 It is also clear that many of the early American bills attainting the Tories were passed in order to impede their effectively resisting the Revolution.  “In the progress of the conflict, and particularly in its earliest periods, attainder and confiscation had been resorted to generally, throughout the continent, as a means of war.  But it is a fact important to the history of the revolting colonies, that the acts prescribing penalties, usually offered to the persons against whom they were directed the option of avoiding them, by acknowledging their allegiance to the existing governments.  “It was a preventive, not a vindictive policy.  In the same humane spirit, as the contest approached its close, and the necessity of these severities diminished, many of the states passed laws offering pardons *460 to those who had been disfranchised, and restoring them to the enjoyment of their property .. ..” 35 Thus Justice Iredell was on solid historical ground when he observed, in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 399-400 , that “attainders, on the principle of retaliation and proscription„ have marked all the vicissitudes of party triumph.” (Emphasis supplied.) We think that the Court in Douds misread United States v. <citedDecision>Lovett</citedDecision> when it suggested, 339 U. S., at 413 , that that case could be distinguished on the ground that the sanction there imposed was levied for purely retributive reasons.  In <citedDecision>Lovett</citedDecision> the Court, after reviewing the legislative history of § 304 of the Urgent Deficiency Appropriation Act, <citedDecision>328 U. S., at 308-313</citedDecision> , concluded that the statute was the product of a congressional drive to oust from government persons whose (congressionally determined) “subversive” tendencies made their continued employment dangerous to the national welfare: “the purpose of all who sponsored § 304 .  .  .  clearly was to ‘purge’ the then existing and all future lists of government employees of those whom Congress deemed guilty of ‘subversive activities’ and therefore ‘unfit’ to hold a federal job.” Id., at 314.  Similarly, the purpose of the statute before us is to purge the governing boards of labor unions of' those whom Congress regards as guilty of subversive acts and associations and therefore unfit to fill positions which might affect interstate commerce.  36 *461 The Solicitor General urges us to distinguish <citedDecision>Lovett</citedDecision> on the ground that the statute struck down there “singled out three identified individuals.” It is of course true that § 504 does not contain the words “Archie Brown,” and that-it inflicts its deprivation upon more than three people.  However, the decisions of this Court, as well as the historical background of the Bill of Attainder Clause, make it crystal clear that these are distinctions without a difference.  It was not uncommon for English acts of attainder to inflict their deprivations upon relatively large groups of people, 37 sometimes by description rather than name.  38 Moreover, the statutes voided in Cummings and Garland were of this nature.  39 We cannot agree that the fact that § 504 inflicts its deprivation upon the membership of the Communist Party rather than upon a list of named individuals takes it out of the category of bills of attainder.  We do not hold today that Congress cannot weed dangerous persons out of the labor movement, any more than the Court held in <citedDecision>Lovett</citedDecision> that subversives must be permitted to hold sensitive government positions.  Rather, we make again the point made in <citedDecision>Lovett</citedDecision> : that Congress must accomplish such results by rules of general applicability.  It cannot specify the people upon whom the sanction it prescribes is to be levied.  Under our Constitution, Congress possesses full legislative authority, but the task of adjudication must be left to other tribunals.  *462 This Court is always reluctant to declare that an Act of Congress violates the Constitution, but in this case we have no alternative.  As Alexander Hamilton observed: “By a limited constitution, I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex post facto laws, and the like.  Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of the courts of justice; whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the constitution void.  Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.” 40 The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.

 James Madison expressed similar sentiments: “Bills of attainder, ex post facto laws, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts, are contrary to the first principles of the social compact, and to every principle of sound legislation.  The two former are expressly prohibited by the declarations prefixed to some of the state constitutions, and all of them are prohibited by the spirit and scope of these fundamental charters.  Our own experience has taught us, nevertheless, that additional fences against these dangers *445 ought not to be omitted.  Very properly, therefore, have the convention added this constitutional bulwark in favour of personal security and private rights .... The sober people of America are weary of the fluctuating policy which has directed the public councils.  They have seen with regret and with indignation, that sudden changes, and legislative interferences, in cases affecting personal rights, become jobs in the hands of enterprising and influential speculators; and snares to the more industrious and less informed part of the community.” The Federalist, No. 44, p. 351 (Hamilton ed. 1880).  1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, pp. 536-537 (8th ed. 1927).  To the same effect, see Colder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 389 ; United States v. Lovett, <citedDecision>328 U. S. 303, 317-318</citedDecision> ; II Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States, p. 210 (4th ed. 1873); III Hamilton, History of the Republic of the United States, p. 31 (1859); Pound, Justice According to Law II, 14 Col. L. Rev. 1, 7-12.  Macaulay’s account of the attainder of Sir John Fenwick is particularly vivid: “Some hundreds of gentlemen, every one of whom had much more than half made up his mind before the case was open, performed the office both of judge and jury.  They were not restrained, as a judge is restrained, by the sense of responsibility .... They were not selected, *446 as a jury is selected, in a manner which enables a culprit to exclude his personal and political enemies.  The arbiters of the prisoner’s fate came in and went out as they chose.  They heard a fragment here and there of what was said against him, and a fragment here and there of what was said in his favor.  During the progress of the bill they were exposed to every species of influence.  One member might be threatened by the electors of his borough with the loss of his seat .... In the debates arts were practised and passions excited which are unknown to well-constituted tribunals, but from which no great popular assembly divided into parties ever was or ever will be free.” IX Macaulay, History of England, p. 207 (1900).

In 1872, in Pierce v. Carskadon, 16 Wall. 234 , the Court voided as a bill of attainder a West Virginia statute conditioning access to the courts upon the taking of an oath similar to those involved in Cummings and Garland.  In Dent v. West Virginia, 129 U. S. 114 , this Court upheld a West Virginia statute requiring that physicians obtain a license in order to practice.  Appellant argued, inter alia, that the statute was a bill of attainder because the granting of a license was conditioned upon graduating from medical school, practicing for 10 years, or passing a special examination.  The Court rejected the argument on the ground that the statute set forth general qualifications applicable to all persons who wanted to practice medicine, id., at 124 , and did not single out a specific person or group for deprivation.  See also Drehman v. Stifle, 8 Wall. 595 .  Section 304 provided: “No part of any appropriation, allocation, or fund (1) which is made available under or pursuant to this Act, or (2) which is now, or which *449 is hereafter made, available under or pursuant to any other Act, to any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States, shall be used, after November 15, 1943, to pay any part of the salary, or other compensation for the personal services, of Goodwin B. Watson, William E. Dodd, Junior, and Robert Morss Lovett, unless prior to such date such person has been appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate: Provided, That this section shall not operate to deprive any such person of payment for leaves of absence or salary, or of any refund or reimbursement, which have accrued prior to November 15, 1943 Although it may be that underinelusiveness is a characteristic of most bills of attainder, we doubt that it is a necessary feature.  We think it clear from the <citedDecision>Lovett</citedDecision> opinion that § 304 would have been voided even if it could have been demonstrated that no one other than Lovett, Watson and Dodd possessed the characteristics which Congress was trying to reach.  The vice of attainder is that the legislature has decided for itself that certain persons possess certain characteristics and are therefore deserving of sanction, not that it has failed to sanction others similarly situated.  We of course take no position on whether or not members of the Communist Party are in fact likely to incite political strikes.  The point we make is rather that the Constitution forbids Congress from making such determinations.  See 367 U. S., at 146 (Black, J., dissenting).  “It need hardly be said that it is upon the particular evidence in a particular record that a particular defendant must be judged, and not upon the evidence in some other record or upon what may be supposed to be the tenets of the Communist Party.” Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290, 299 .  It is argued that § 504 is not a bill of attainder because prior to its enactment there had been an administrative adjudication (by the Subversive Activities Control Board) of “the nature of the Party.” Compare Hawker v. New York, 170 U. S. 189 ; DeVeau v. Braisted, 363 U. S. 144, 160 .

 Professor Chafee has pointed out that even the death penalty was often inflicted largely for preventive purposes: “There was no good middle ground between beheading and doing nothing.  If the ousted adviser were left at liberty, he could readily turn his resentment into coercion or rebellion and make a magnificent comeback to the utter ruin of those who had driven him from his high place.  Therefore, the usual object of Parliamentary proceedings against an important minister was to put him to death.” Chafee, Three Human Rights in the Constitution of 1787, pp. 103-104 (1956).  The preventive purpose of the “Act for the Attainder of the pretended Prince of Wales of High Treason” of 1700, 13 Will. 3 , c. 3, is demonstrated by the parliamentary declaration that anyone corresponding with the Prince or his followers would be subject to prosecution for treason.
