 If these tax-immunity cases had any common thread, it was in the attempt to distinguish between “governmental” and “proprietary” functions.  7 To say that the distinction be *542 tween “governmental” and “proprietary” proved to be stable, however, would be something of an overstatement.  In 1911, for example, the Court declared that the provision of a municipal water supply “is no part of the essential governmental functions of a State.” Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 172 .  Twenty-six years later, without any intervening change in the applicable legal standards, the Court simply rejected its earlier position and decided that the provision of a municipal water supply was immune from federal taxation as an essential governmental function, even though municipal waterworks long had been operated for profit by private industry.  Brush v. Commissioner, 300 U. S., at 370-373 .  At the same time that the Court was holding a municipal water supply to be immune from federal taxes, it had held that a state-run commuter rail system was not immune.  Helvering v. Powers, <citedDecision>293 U. S. 214</citedDecision> (1934).  Justice Black, in Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 427 (1938), was moved to observe: “An implied constitutional distinction which taxes income of an officer of a state-operated transportation system and exempts income of the manager of a municipal water works system manifests the uncertainty created by the ‘essential’ and ‘non-essential’ test” (concurring opinion).  It was this uncertainty and instability that led the Court shortly thereafter, in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), unanimously to conclude that the distinction between “governmental” and “proprietary” functions was “untenable” and must be abandoned.  See id., at 583 (opinion of Frankfurter, J., joined by Rutledge, J.); id., at 586 (Stone, C. J., concurring, joined by Reed, Murphy, and Burton, JJ.); id., at 590-596 (Douglas, J., dissenting, joined by Black, J.).  See also Massachusetts v. United States, 435 U. S. 444, 457 , and n. 14 (1978) (plurality opinion); Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92, 101 (1946).  *543 Even during the heyday of the governmental/proprietary distinction in intergovernmental tax-immunity doctrine the Court never explained the constitutional basis for that distinction.  In South Carolina , it expressed its concern that unlimited state immunity from federal taxation would allow the States to undermine the Federal Government’s tax base by expanding into previously private sectors of the economy.

 We are informed that basic wage levels in the mass-transit industry traditionally have been well in excess of the minimum wages prescribed by the FLSA.  See Brief for National League of Cities et al. as Amici Curiae 7-8.  The District Court also analyzed the status of mass transit under the four-part test devised by the Sixth Circuit in Amersbach v. City of Cleveland, 598 F. 2d 1033 (1979).  In that case, the Court of Appeals looked to (1) whether the function benefits the community as a whole and is made available at little or no expense; (2) whether it is undertaken for public service or pecuniary gain; (3) whether government is its principal provider; and (4) whether government is particularly suited to perform it because of a community-wide need.  Id., at 1037 .  See also, however, Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Assn. v. Abbott Laboratories, 460 U. S. 150, 154, n. 6 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 781 , and n. 7 (1982) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542, 558 , and n. 2 (1975) (dissenting opinion).  See Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U. S. 107, 172 (1911) (“essential”); Helvering v. Therrell, 303 U. S. 218, 225 (1938) (same); Helvering v. Powers, <citedDecision>293 U. S. 214, 225</citedDecision> (1934) (“usual”); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175, 185 (1936) (“activities in which the states have traditionally engaged”); South Carolina v. United States, 199 U. S. 437, 461 (1905) (“strictly governmental”).  In South Carolina , the Court relied on the concept of “strictly governmental” functions to uphold the application of a federal liquor license tax to a state-owned liquor-distribution monopoly.  In Flint , the Court stated: “The true distinction is between .  .  .  those operations of the States essential to the execution of its [sic] governmental functions, and which the State can only do itself, and those activities which are of a private character”; under this standard, “[i]t is no part of the essential governmental functions of a State to provide means of transportation, supply artificial light, water and the like.” 220 U. S., at 172 .  In Ohio v. Helvering, 292 U. S. 360 (1934), another case involving a state liquor-distribution monopoly, the Court stated that “the business of buying and selling commodities ... is not the performance of a governmental function,” and that “[w]hen a state enters the market place seeking customers it divests itself of its quasi sovereignty pro tanto, and takes on the character of a trader, so far, at least, as the taxing power of the federal government is concerned.” Id., at 369 .  In <citedDecision>Powers</citedDecision> , the Court upheld the application of the federal income tax to the income of trustees of a state-operated commuter railroad; the Court reiterated that “the State cannot withdraw sources of revenue from the federal taxing power by engaging in businesses which constitute a departure from usual governmental functions and to which, by reason of their nature, the federal taxing power would normally extend,” regardless of the *542 fact that the proprietary enterprises “are undertaken for what the State conceives to be the public benefit.” <citedDecision>293 U. S., at 225</citedDecision> .  Accord, Allen v. Regents, 304 U. S. 439, 451-453 (1938).  That concern was especially weighty in South Carolina because liquor taxes, the object of the dispute in that case, then accounted for over one-fourth of the Federal Government’s revenues.  See New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 598, n. 4 (1946) (dissenting opinion).  Indeed, the “traditional” nature of a particular governmental function can be a matter of historical nearsightedness; today’s self-evidently “traditional” function is often yesterday’s suspect innovation.  Thus, National League of Cities offered the provision of public parks and recreation as an example of a traditional governmental function.  426 U. S., at 851 .

 .  would have been regarded as a novel exercise of legislative power.” Id,, at 297.  For much the same reasons, the existence vel non of a tradition of federal involvement in a particular area does not provide an adequate standard for state immunity.  Most of the Federal Government’s current regulatory activity originated less than 50 years ago with the New Deal, and a good portion of it has developed within the past two decades.  The recent vintage of this regulatory activity does not dimmish the strength of the federal interest in applying regulatory standards to state activities, nor does it affect the strength of the States’ interest in being free from federal supervision.  Although the Court’s intergovernmental tax-immunity decisions ostensibly have subjected particular state activities to federal taxation because those activities “ha[ve] been traditionally within [federal taxing] power from the beginning,” New York v. United States, 326 U. S., at 588 (Stone, C. J., concurring, joined by Reed, Murphy, and Burton, JJ.), the Court has not in fact required federal taxes to have long historical records in order to be effective.  The income tax at issue in <citedDecision>Powers, supra,</citedDecision> took effect less than a decade before the tax years for which it was challenged, while the federal tax whose application was *545 upheld in New York v. United States took effect in 1932 and was rescinded less than two years later.  See Helvering v. Powers, <citedDecision>293 U.
