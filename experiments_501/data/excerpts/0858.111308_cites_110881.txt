 The genius of our government provides that, within the sphere of constitutional action, the people — acting not through the courts but through their elected legislative representatives — have the power to determine as conditions demand, what services and functions the public welfare requires.” Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S., at 427 (concurring opinion).  We therefore now reject, as unsound in principle and unworkable in practice, a rule of state immunity from federal regulation that turns on a judicial appraisal of whether a *547 particular governmental function is “integral” or “traditional.” Any such rule leads to inconsistent results at the same time that it disserves principles of democratic self-governance, and it breeds inconsistency precisely because it is divorced from those principles.  If there are to be limits on the Federal Government’s power to interfere with state functions — as undoubtedly there are — we must look elsewhere to find them.  We accordingly return to the underlying issue that confronted this Court in National League of Cities — the manner in which the Constitution insulates States from the reach of Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.  Ill The central theme of National League of Cities was that the States occupy a special position in our constitutional system and that the scope of Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause must reflect that position.  Of course, the Commerce Clause by its specific language does not provide any special limitation on Congress’ actions with respect to the States.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, <citedDecision>460 U. S. 226, 248</citedDecision> (1983) (concurring opinion).  It is equally true, however, that the text of the Constitution provides the beginning rather than the final answer to every inquiry into questions of federalism, for “[bjehind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control.” Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 322 (1934).  National League of Cities reflected the general conviction that the Constitution precludes “the National Government [from] devouring] the essentials of state sovereignty.” Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S., at 205 (dissenting opinion).  In order to be faithful to the underlying federal premises of the Constitution, courts must look for the “postulates which limit and control.” What has proved problematic is not the perception that the Constitution’s federal structure imposes limitations on the Commerce Clause, but rather the nature and content of those limitations.  One approach to defining the limits on Con *548 gress’ authority to regulate the States under the Commerce Clause is to identify certain underlying elements of political sovereignty that are deemed essential to the States’ “separate and independent existence.” Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869).  This approach obviously underlay the Court’s use of the “traditional governmental function” concept in National League of Cities.  It also has led to the separate requirement that the challenged federal statute “address matters that are indisputably ‘attribute^] of state sovereignty.’” Hodel, 452 U. S., at 288 , quoting National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 845 .  In National League of Cities itself, for example, the Court concluded that decisions by a State concerning the wages and hours of its employees are an “undoubted attribute of state sovereignty.” 426 U. S., at 845 .  The opinion did not explain what aspects of such decisions made them such an “undoubted attribute,” and the Court since then has remarked on the uncertain scope of the concept.  See <citedDecision>EEOC</citedDecision> v. Wyoming, <citedDecision>460 U. S., at 238, n. 11</citedDecision> .  The point of the inquiry, however, has remained to single out particular features of a State’s internal governance that are deemed to be intrinsic parts of state sovereignty.  We doubt that courts ultimately can identify principled constitutional limitations on the scope of Congress’ Commerce Clause powers over the States merely by relying on a priori definitions of state sovereignty.  In part, this is because of the elusiveness of objective criteria for “fundamental” elements of state sovereignty, a problem we have witnessed in the search for “traditional governmental functions.” There is, however, a more fundamental reason: the sovereignty of the States is limited by the Constitution itself.  A variety of sovereign powers, for example, are withdrawn from the States by Article I, § 10.  Section 8 of the same Article works an equally sharp contraction of state sovereignty by authorizing Congress to exercise a wide range of legislative powers and (in conjunction with the Supremacy Clause of Article VI) to displace contrary state legislation.  See *549 Hodel, 452 U. S., at 290-292 .  By providing for final review of questions of federal law in this Court, Article III curtails the sovereign power of the States’judiciaries to make authoritative determinations of law. See Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304 (1816).  Finally, the developed application, through the Fourteenth Amendment, of the greater part of the Bill of Rights to the States limits the sovereign authority that States otherwise would possess to legislate with respect to their citizens and to conduct their own affairs.  The States unquestionably do “retai[n] a significant measure of sovereign authority.” <citedDecision>EEOC</citedDecision> v. Wyoming, <citedDecision>460 U. S., at 269</citedDecision> (Powell, J., dissenting).  They do so, however, only to the extent that the Constitution has not divested them of their original powers and transferred those powers to the Federal Government.  In the words of James Madison to the Members of the First Congress: “Interference with the power of the States was no constitutional criterion of the power of Congress.  If the power was not given, Congress could not exercise it; if given, they might exercise it, although it should interfere with the laws, or even the Constitution of the States.” 2 Annals of Cong. 1897 (1791).  Justice Field made the same point in the course of his defense of state autonomy in his dissenting opinion in Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U. S. 368 , 401 (1893), a defense quoted with approval in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U. S. 64, 78-79 (1938): “[T]he Constitution of the United States .  .  .  recognizes and preserves the autonomy and independence of the States — independence in their legislative and independence in their judicial departments.  [Federal] [supervision over either the legislative or the judicial action of the States is in no case permissible except as to matters by the Constitution specifically authorized or delegated to the United States.  Any interference with either, except as thus permitted, is an invasion of *550 the authority of the State and, to that extent, a denial of its independence.” As a result, to say that the Constitution assumes the continued role of the States is to say little about the nature of that role.  Only recently, this Court recognized that the purpose of the constitutional immunity recognized in National League of Cities is not to preserve “a sacred province of state autonomy.” <citedDecision>EEOC</citedDecision> v. Wyoming, <citedDecision>460 U. S., at 236</citedDecision> .  With rare exceptions, like the guarantee, in Article IV, § 3, of state territorial integrity, the Constitution does not carve out express elements of state sovereignty that Congress may not employ its delegated powers to displace.  James Wilson reminded the Pennsylvania ratifying convention in 1787: “It is true, indeed, sir, although it presupposes the existence of state governments, yet this Constitution does not suppose them to be the sole power to be respected.” 2 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 439 (J. Elliot 2d ed. 1876) (Elliot).  The power of the Federal Government is a “power to be respected” as well, and the fact that the States remain sovereign as to all powers not vested in Congress or denied them by the Constitution offers no guidance about where the frontier between state and federal power lies.  In short, we have no license to employ freestanding conceptions of state sovereignty when measuring congressional authority under the Commerce Clause.  When we look for the States’ “residuary and inviolable sovereignty,” The Federalist No. 39, p. 285 (B. Wright ed. 1961) (J. Madison), in the shape of the constitutional scheme rather than in predetermined notions of sovereign power, a different measure of state sovereignty emerges.  Apart from the limitation on federal authority inherent in the delegated nature of Congress' Article I powers, the principal means chosen by the Framers to ensure the role of the States in the federal system lies in the structure of the Federal Government itself.

 14 The States have obtained federal funding for such services as police and fire protection, education, public health and hospitals, parks and recreation, and sanitation.  15 Moreover, at the same time that the States have exercised their influence to obtain federal support, they have been able to exempt themselves from a wide variety of obligations imposed by Congress under the Commerce Clause.  For example, the Federal Power Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, and the Sherman Act all contain express or implied exemptions for States and their subdivisions.  16 The fact that some federal statutes such as the FLSA extend general obligations to the States cannot obscure the extent to which the political position of *554 the States in the federal system has served to minimize the burdens that the States bear under the Commerce Clause.  17 We realize that changes in the structure of the Federal Government have taken place since 1789, not the least of which has been the substitution of popular election of Senators by the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913, and that these changes may work to alter the influence of the States in the federal political process.  18 Nonetheless, against this background, we are convinced that the fundamental limitation that the constitutional scheme imposes on the Commerce Clause to protect the “States as States” is one of process rather than one of result.  Any substantive restraint on the exercise of Commerce Clause powers must find its justification in the procedural nature of this basic limitation, and it must be tailored to compensate for possible failings in the national political process rather than to dictate a “sacred province of state autonomy.” <citedDecision>EEOC</citedDecision> v. Wyoming, <citedDecision>460 U. S., at 236</citedDecision> .  Insofar as the present cases are concerned, then, we need go no further than to state that we perceive nothing in the overtime and minimum-wage requirements of the FLSA, as applied to SAMTA, that is destructive of state sovereignty or violative of any constitutional provision.  SAMTA faces nothing more than the same minimum-wage and overtime obligations that hundreds of thousands of other employers, public as well as private, have to meet.  *555 In these cases, the status of public mass transit simply underscores the extent to which the structural protections of the Constitution insulate the States from federally imposed burdens.  When Congress first subjected state mass-transit systems to FLSA obligations in 1966, and when it expanded those obligations in 1974, it simultaneously provided extensive funding for state and local mass transit through UMTA.  In the two decades since its enactment, UMTA has provided over $22 billion in mass-transit aid to States and localities.  19 In 1983 alone, UMTA funding amounted to $3.7 billion.

 Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37, 44 (1971).  If federalism so conceived and so carefully cultivated by the Framers of our Constitution is to remain meaningful, this Court cannot abdicate its constitutional responsibility to oversee the Federal Government’s compliance with its duty to respect the legitimate interests of the States.  Due to the emergence of an integrated and industrialized national economy, this Court has been required to examine and review a breathtaking expansion of the powers of Congress.  In doing so the Court correctly perceived that the Framers of our Constitution intended Congress to have sufficient power to address national problems.  But the Framers were not single-minded.  The Constitution is animated by an array of intentions.  EEOC v. Wyoming, <citedDecision>460 U. S. 226, 265-266</citedDecision> (1983) (Powell, J., dissenting).  Just as surely as the Framers envisioned a National Government capable of solving national problems, they also envisioned a republic whose vitality was assured by the diffusion of power not only among the branches of the Federal Government, but also between the Federal Government and the States.  FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 790 (1982) (O’Connor, J., dissenting).  In the 18th century these intentions did not conflict because technology had not yet converted every local problem into a national one.  A conflict has now emerged, and the Court today retreats rather than reconcile the Constitution’s dual concerns for federalism and an effective commerce power.  *582 We would do well to recall the constitutional basis for federalism and the development of the commerce power which has come to displace it.  The text of the Constitution does not define the precise scope of state authority other than to specify, in the Tenth Amendment, that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution are reserved to the States.

 .  .  always been regarded as exceptional in our polity, an intrusion to be justified by some necessity, the special rather than the ordinary case.” Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government, 54 Colum. L. Rev. 543 , 544-545 (1954).  Today, as federal legislation and coercive grant programs have expanded to embrace innumerable activities that were once viewed as local, the burden of persuasion has surely shifted, and the extraordinary has become ordinary.  See Engdahl, Sense and Nonsense About State Immunity, 2 Constitutional Commentary 93 (1985).  For example, recently the Federal Government has, with this Court’s blessing, undertaken to tell the States the age at which they can retire their law enforcement officers, and the regulatory standards, procedures, and even the agenda which their utilities commissions must consider and follow.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, <citedDecision>460 U. S. 226</citedDecision> (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742 (1982).  The political process *588 has not protected against these encroachments on state activities, even though they directly impinge on a State’s ability to make and enforce its laws.  With the abandonment of National League of Cities , all that stands between the remaining essentials of state sovereignty and Congress is the for self-restraint.  The problems of federalism in an integrated national economy are capable of more responsible resolution than holding that the States as States retain no status apart from that which Congress chooses to let them retain.  The proper resolution, I suggest, lies in weighing state autonomy as a factor in the balance when interpreting the means by which Congress can exercise its authority on the States as States.  It is insufficient, in assessing the validity of congressional regulation of a State pursuant to the commerce power, to ask only whether the same regulation would be valid if enforced against a private party.  That reasoning, embodied in the majority opinion, is inconsistent with the spirit of our Constitution.  It remains relevant that a State is being regulated, as National League of Cities and every recent case have recognized.  See <citedDecision>EEOC</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wyoming, supra;</citedDecision> Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co., 455 U. S. 678, 684 (1982); Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Recl.  Assn., 452 U. S. 264, 287-288 (1981); National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 841-846 .  As far as the Constitution is concerned, a State should not be equated with any private litigant.  Cf. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U. S. 410, 428 (1979) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (criticizing the ability of a state court to treat a sister State no differently than a private litigant).  Instead, the autonomy of a State is an essential component of federalism.  If state autonomy is ignored in assessing the means by which Congress regulates matters affecting commerce, then federalism becomes irrelevant simply because the set activities remaining beyond the reach of such a commerce power “may well be negligible.” Ante, at 545.  It has been difficult for this Court to craft bright fining the scope of the state autonomy protected by National *589 League of Cities.
