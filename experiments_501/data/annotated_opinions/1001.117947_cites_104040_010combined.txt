 In Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81 (1943), the Court considered a curfew applicable only to persons of Japanese ancestry.  The Court observedcorrectlythat "[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality," and that "racial discriminations are in most circumstances irrelevant and therefore prohibited." Id., at 100 .  But it also cited Detroit Bank for the proposition that the Fifth Amendment "restrains only such discriminatory legislation by Congress as amounts to a denial of due process," 320 U. S., at 100 , and upheld the curfew because "circumstances within the knowledge of those charged with the responsibility for maintaining the national defense afforded a rational basis for the decision which they made." Id., at 102 .  Eighteen months later, the Court again approved wartime measures directed at persons of Japanese ancestry.  Korematsu v. United States, <citedDecision>323 U. S. 214</citedDecision> (1944), concerned an order that completely excluded such persons from particular areas.  The Court did not address the view, expressed in cases like Hirabayashi and Detroit Bank , that the Federal Government's obligation to provide equal protection differs significantly from that of the States.  Instead, it began by noting that "all legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect .  .  .  [and] courts must subject them to the most rigid scrutiny." <citedDecision>323 U. S., at 216</citedDecision> .  That promising dictum might be read to undermine the view that the Federal Government is under a lesser obligation to avoid injurious racial classifications *215 than are the States.  Cf. <citedDecision>id., at 234-235</citedDecision> (Murphy, J., dissenting) ("[T]he order deprives all those within its scope of the equal protection of the laws as guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment").  But in spite of the "most rigid scrutiny" standard it had just set forth, the Court then inexplicably relied on "the principles we announced in the Hirabayashi case," id., at 217 , to conclude that, although "exclusion from the area in which one's home is located is a far greater deprivation than constant confinement to the home from 8 p. m. to 6 a. m.," id., at 218 , the racially discriminatory order was nonetheless within the Federal Government's power.  [*] In Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497 (1954), the Court for the first time explicitly questioned the existence of any difference between the obligations of the Federal Government and the States to avoid racial classifications.  Bolling did note that "[t]he `equal protection of the laws' is a more explicit safeguard of prohibited unfairness than `due process of law,' " id., at 499 .  But Bolling then concluded that, "[i]n view of [the] decision that the Constitution prohibits the states from maintaining racially segregated public schools, it would be unthinkable that the same Constitution would impose a lesser duty on the Federal Government." Id., at 500 .  Bolling `s facts concerned school desegregation, but its reasoning was not so limited.  The Court's observations that "[d]istinctions between citizens solely because of their ancestry are by their very nature odious," Hirabayashi, supra, at 100 , and that "all legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect," *216 <citedDecision>Korematsu, supra, at 216</citedDecision> , carry no less force in the context of federal action than in the context of action by the States indeed, they first appeared in cases concerning action by the Federal Government.  Bolling relied on those observations, 347 U. S., at 499, n. 3 , and reiterated "`that the Constitution of the United States, in its present form, forbids, so far as civil and political rights are concerned, discrimination by the General Government, or by the States, against any citizen because of his race,'" id., at 499 (quoting Gibson v. Mississippi, 162 U. S. 565, 591 (1896)) (emphasis added).  The Court's application of that general principle to the case before it, and the resulting imposition on the Federal Government of an obligation equivalent to that of the States, followed as a matter of course.  Later cases in contexts other than school desegregation did not distinguish between the duties of the States and the Federal Government to avoid racial classifications.  Consider, for example, the following passage from McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U. S. 184 , a 1964 case that struck down a race-based state law: "[W]e deal here with a classification based upon the race of the participants, which must be viewed in light of the historical fact that the central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate racial discrimination emanating from official sources in the States.  This strong policy renders racial classifications `constitutionally suspect,' Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U. S. 497, 499 ; and subject to the `most rigid scrutiny,' Korematsu v. United States, <citedDecision>323 U. S. 214, 216</citedDecision> ; and `in most circumstances irrelevant' to any constitutionally acceptable legislative purpose, Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81, 100 ." Id., at 191-192 .  McLaughlin `s reliance on cases involving federal action for the standards applicable to a case involving state legislation *217 suggests that the Court understood the standards for federal and state racial classifications to be the same.  Cases decided after McLaughlin continued to treat the equal protection obligations imposed by the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments as indistinguishable; one commentator observed that "[i]n case after case, fifth amendment equal protection problems are discussed on the assumption that fourteenth amendment precedents are controlling." Karst, The Fifth Amendment's Guarantee of Equal Protection, 55 N. C. L. Rev. 541, 554 (1977).  Loving v. Virginia, 388 U. S. 1 (1967), which struck down a race-based state law, cited Korematsu for the proposition that "the Equal Protection Clause demands that racial classifications .  .

 *243 II The Court's concept of "consistency" assumes that there is no significant difference between a decision by the majority to impose a special burden on the members of a minority race and a decision by the majority to provide a benefit to certain members of that minority notwithstanding its incidental burden on some members of the majority.  In my opinion that assumption is untenable.  There is no moral or constitutional equivalence between a policy that is designed to perpetuate a caste system and one that seeks to eradicate racial subordination.  Invidious discrimination is an engine of oppression, subjugating a disfavored group to enhance or maintain the power of the majority.  Remedial race-based preferences reflect the opposite impulse: a desire to foster equality in society.  No sensible conception of the Government's constitutional obligation to "govern impartially," Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 100 (1976), should ignore this distinction.  [1] *244 To illustrate the point, consider our cases addressing the Federal Government's discrimination against JapaneseAmericans during World War II, Hirabayashi v. United States, 320 U. S. 81 (1943), and Korematsu v. United States, <citedDecision>323 U. S. 214</citedDecision> (1944).  The discrimination at issue in those cases was invidious because the Government imposed special burdensa curfew and exclusion from certain areas on the West Coast [2] on the members of a minority class defined by racial and ethnic characteristics.  Members of the same racially defined class exhibited exceptional heroism in the service of our country during that war.  Now suppose Congress decided to reward that service with a federal program that gave all Japanese-American veterans an extraordinary preference in Government employment.  Cf. Personnel Administrator of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U. S. 256 (1979).  If Congress had done so, the same racial characteristics that motivated the discriminatory burdens in Hirabayashi and Korematsu would have defined the preferred class of veterans.  Nevertheless, "consistency" surely would not require us to describe the incidental burden on everyone else in the country as "odious" or "invidious" as those terms were used in those cases. We should reject a concept of "consistency" that would view the special preferences that the National Government has provided to Native Americans since 1834 [3] *245 as comparable to the official discrimination against AfricanAmericans that was prevalent for much of our history.

 [5] *274 Minority entrepreneurs sometimes fail to gain contracts though they are the low bidders, and they are sometimes refused work even after winning contracts.  [6] Bias both conscious and unconscious, reflecting traditional and unexamined habits of thought, [7] keeps up barriers that must come down if equal opportunity and nondiscrimination are ever genuinely to become this country's law and practice.  Given this history and its practical consequences, Congress surely can conclude that a carefully designed affirmative action program may help to realize, finally, the "equal protection of the laws" the Fourteenth Amendment has promised since 1868.  [8] *275 II The lead opinion uses one term, "strict scrutiny," to describe the standard of judicial review for all governmental classifications by race.  Ante, at 235-237.  But that opinion's elaboration strongly suggests that the strict standard announced is indeed "fatal" for classifications burdening groups that have suffered discrimination in our society.  That seems to me, and, I believe, to the Court, the enduring lesson one should draw from Korematsu v. United States, <citedDecision>323 U. S. 214</citedDecision> (1944); for in that case, scrutiny the Court described as "most rigid," <citedDecision>id., at 216</citedDecision> , nonetheless yielded a pass for an odious, gravely injurious racial classification.  See ante, at 214-215 (lead opinion).  A Korematsu -type classification, as I read the opinions in this case, will never again survive scrutiny: Such a classification, history and precedent instruct, properly ranks as prohibited.  For a classification made to hasten the day when "we are just one race," ante, at 239 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), however, the lead opinion has dispelled the notion that "strict scrutiny" is "`fatal in fact.' " Ante, at 237 (quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448, 519 (1980) (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment)).  Properly, a majority of the Court calls for review that is searching, in order to ferret out classifications in reality malign, but masquerading as benign.  See ante, at 228-229 (lead opinion).

 Nevertheless, the fact that persons of different races do, indeed have differently colored skin, may give rise to a belief that there is some significant difference between such persons.  The inclusion of minority teachers in the educational process inevitably tends to dispel that illusion whereas their exclusion could only tend to foster it.  The inclusionary decision is consistent with the principle that all men are created equal; the exclusionary decision is at war with that principle.  One decision accords with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the other does not.  Thus, consideration of whether the consciousness of race is exclusionary or inclusionary plainly distinguishes the Board's valid purpose in this case from a race-conscious decision that would reinforce assumptions of inequality." 476 U. S., at 316-317 (dissenting opinion).  [6]  Despite the majority's reliance on Korematsu v. United States, <citedDecision>323 U. S. 214</citedDecision> (1944), ante, at 214-215, that case does not stand for the proposition that federal remedial programs are subject to strict scrutiny.  Instead, Korematsu specifies that "all legal restrictions which curtail the civil rights of a single racial group are immediately suspect." 323 U. S., at 216, quoted ante, at 214 (emphasis added).  The programs at issue in this case (as in most affirmative-action cases) do not "curtail the civil rights of a single racial group"; they benefit certain racial groups and impose an indirect burden on the majority.  [7]  We have rejected this proposition outside of the affirmative-action context as well.  In Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U. S. 88, 100 (1976), we held: "The federal sovereign, like the States, must govern impartially.  The concept of equal justice under law is served by the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process, as well as by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
