 On February 16, 1951, the Regents, after viewing “The Miracle,” determined that it was “sacrilegious” and for that reason ordered the Commissioner of Education to rescind appellant’s license to exhibit the picture.  The Commissioner did so. Appellant brought the present action in the New York courts to review the determination of the Regents.  6 Among the claims advanced by appellant were (1) that the statute violates the Fourteenth Amendment as a prior restraint upon freedom of speech and of the press; (2) that it is invalid under the same Amendment as a violation of the guaranty of separate church and state and as a prohibition of the free exercise of religion; and, (3) that the term “sacrilegious” is so vague and indefinite as to offend due process.  The Appellate Division rejected all of appellant’s contentions and upheld the Regents’ determination.  278 App. Div. 253 , 104 N. Y. S. 2d 740.  On appeal the New York Court of Appeals, two judges dissenting, affirmed the order of the Appellate Division.  <citedDecision>303 N. Y. 242</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>101 N. E. 2d 665</citedDecision> .  The case is here on appeal.  28 U. S. C. § 1257 (2).  As we view the case, we need consider only appellant’s contention that the New York statute is an unconstitutional abridgment of free speech and a free press.  In Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm’n, 236 U. S. 230 (1915), a distributor of motion pictures sought to enjoin the enforcement of an Ohio statute which required the prior approval of a board of censors before any motion *500 picture could be publicly exhibited in the state, and which directed the board to approve only such films as it adjudged to be “of a moral, educational or amusing and harmless character.” The statute was assailed in part as an unconstitutional abridgment of the freedom of the press guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  The District Court rejected this contention, stating that the first eight Amendments were not a restriction on state action.  215 F. 138, 141 (D. C. N. D. Ohio 1914).

At another point the Court of Appeals gave “sacrilegious” the following definition: “the act of violating or profaning anything sacred.” <citedDecision>Id., at 255</citedDecision> , 101 N. E. 2d at 670.  The Court of Appeals also approved the Appellate Division’s interpretation: “As the court below said of the statute in question, ‘All it purports to do is to bar a visual caricature of religious beliefs held sacred by one sect or another ....’” Id., at 258, 101 N. E. 2d at 672.  Judge Fuld, dissenting, concluded from all the statements in the majority opinion that “the basic criterion appears to be whether the film treats a religious theme in such a manner as to offend the religious beliefs of any group of persons.  If the film does have that effect, and it is ‘offered as a form of entertainment,’ it apparently falls within the statutory ban regardless of the sincerity and good faith of the producer of the film, no matter how temperate the treatment of the theme, and no matter how unlikely a public disturbance or breach of the peace.  The drastic nature of such a ban is highlighted by the fact that the film in question makes no direct attack on, or criticism of, any religious dogma or principle, and it is not claimed to be obscene, scurrilous, intemperate or abusive.” Id., at 271-272, 101 N. E. 2d at 680.  Cf. Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88, 97 (1940); Stromberg v. California, 283 U. S. 359, 369-370 (1931).  Cf. Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U. S. 268 (1951); Saia v. New York, 334 U.
