Mr. Justice White delivered the opinion of the Court. This case raises an important issue concerning the construction of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution— whether Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1163 (B) (1956), which is part of Arizona's Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, is invalid under that clause as being in conflict with the mandate of § 17 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. § 35 , providing that receipt of a discharge in bankruptcy fully discharges all but certain specified judgments.  The courts below, concluding that this case was controlled by Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, <citedDecision>369 U. S. 153</citedDecision> (1962), and Reitz v. Mealey, 314 U. S. 33 (1941), two earlier opinions of this Court dealing with alleged conflicts between the Bankruptcy Act and state financial responsibility laws, ruled against the claim of conflict and upheld the Arizona statute.  On July 8, 1965, petitioner Adolfo Perez, driving a car registered in his name, was involved in an automobile accident in Tucson, Arizona.  The Perez automobile was not covered by liability insurance at the time of the collision.  The driver of the second ca,r was the minor daughter of Leonard Pinkerton, and in September 1966 the Pinkertons sued Mr. and Mrs. Perez in state court for personal injuries and property damage sustained in the accident.  On October 31, 1967, the petitioners confessed judgment in this suit, and a judgment order was entered against them on November 8, 1967, for $2,425.98 plus court costs.  Mr. and Mrs. Perez each filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in Federal District Court on November 6, 1967.  Each of them duly scheduled the judgment debt *639 to the Pinkertons.

 until the person gives proof of financial responsibility” for a future period.  8 Again, the validity of this limited requirement that some drivers post evidence of financial responsibility for the future in order to regain driving privileges is not questioned here.  Nor is the broader issue of whether a *643 State may require proof of financial responsibility as a precondition for granting driving privileges to anyone before us for decision.  What is at issue here is the power of a State to include as part of this comprehensive enactment designed to secure compensation for automobile accident victims a section providing that a discharge in bankruptcy of the automobile accident tort judgment shall have no effect on the judgment debtor’s obligation to repay the judgment creditor, at least insofar as such repayment may be enforced by the withholding of driving privileges by the State.  It was that question, among others, which petitioners raised after suspension of their licenses and registration by filing a complaint in Federal District Court seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and requesting a three-judge court. They asserted several constitutional violations, and also alleged that § 28-1163 (B) was in direct conflict with the Bankruptcy Act and was thus violative of the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution.  9 In support of their complaint, Mr. and Mrs. Perez filed affidavits stating that the suspension of their licenses and registration worked both physical and financial hardship upon them and their children.  The District Judge granted the petitioners leave to proceed in forma pauperis, but thereafter granted the respondents’ motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, citing <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz.  10 The Court of Appeals affirmed, relying on *644 the same two decisions.  421 F. 2d 619 (CA9 1970).  We granted certiorari.  400 U. S. 818 (1970).  I Deciding whether a state statute is in conflict with a federal statute and hence invalid under the Supremacy-Clause is essentially a two-step process of first ascertaining the construction of the two statutes and then determining the constitutional question whether they are in conflict.  In the present case, both statutes have been authoritatively construed.

 .  [i]nthe final analysis,” our function is to determine whether a challenged state statute “stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.” Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U. S. 52, 67 (1941).  Since Hines the Court has frequently adhered to this articulation of the meaning of the Supremacy Clause.  See, e. g., Nash v. Florida Industrial Comm’n, 389 U. S. 235, 240 (1967); Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co., 376 U. S. 225, 229 (1964); Colorado Anti-Discrimination Comm’n v. Continental Air Lines, Inc., 372 U. S. 714, 722 (1963) (dictum); Free v. Bland, 369 U. S. 663, 666 (1962); Hill v. Florida, 325 U. S. 538 , 542-543 (1945); Sola Electric Co. v. Jefferson Electric Co., 317 U. S. 173, 176 (1942).  Indeed, in Florida Lime & *650 Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U. S. 132 (1963), a recent case in which the Court was closely divided, all nine Justices accepted the Hines test.  Id., at 141 (opinion of the Court), 165 (dissenting opinion).  Both <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> 13 and Reitz , however, ignored this controlling principle.  The Court in <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> conceded that Utah’s financial responsibility law left “the bankrupt to some extent burdened by the discharged debt,” 369 U. S., at 171, made “it more probable that the debt will be paid despite the discharge,” id., at 173, and thereby made “some inroad ... on the consequences of bankruptcy .  .  .  .” Id., at 171.  Utah’s statute, in short, frustrated Congress’ policy of giving discharged debtors a new start.  But the <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> majority was not concerned by this frustration.  In upholding the statute, the majority opinion did not look to the effect of the legislation but simply asserted that the statute was “not an Act for the Relief of Mulcted Creditors,” <citedDecision>id., at 174</citedDecision> , and was “not designed to aid collection of debts but to enforce a policy against irresponsible driving .  .  .  .” <citedDecision>Id., at 169</citedDecision> .  The majority, that is, looked to the purpose of the state legislation and upheld it because the purpose was not to circumvent the Bankruptcy Act but to promote highway safety; those in dissent, however, were concerned that, whatever the purpose of the Utah Act, its “plain and inevitable effect .  .  .  [was] to create a powerful weapon for collection of a debt from which [the] bankrupt [had] been released by federal law.” <citedDecision>Id., at 183</citedDecision> .  Such a result, they argued, left “the States free ... to impair ... an important and historic policy *651 of this Nation .  .  .  embodied in its bankruptcy laws.” <citedDecision>Id., at 185</citedDecision> .  The opinion of the Court in Reitz was similarly concerned, not with the fact that New York’s financial responsibility law frustrated the operation of the Bankruptcy Act, but with the purpose of the law, which was divined as the promotion of highway safety.  As the Court said: “The penalty which § 94-b imposes for injury due to careless driving is not for the protection of the creditor merely, but to enforce a public policy that irresponsible drivers shall not, with impunity, be allowed to injure their fellows.  The scheme of the legislation would be frustrated if the reckless driver were permitted to escape its provisions by the simple expedient of voluntary bankruptcy, and, accordingly, the legislature declared that a discharge in bankruptcy should not interfere with the operation of the statute.  Such legislation is not in derogation of the Bankruptcy Act.  Rather it is an enforcement of permissible state policy touching highway safety.” 314 U. S., at 37 .  The dissenting opinion written by Mr. Justice Douglas for himself and three others noted that the New York legislation put “the bankrupt ... at the creditor’s mercy,” with the results that “[i]n practical effect the bankrupt may be in as bad, or even worse, a position than if the state had made it possible for a creditor to attach his future wages” and that “[bankruptcy .  .  .  [was not] the sanctuary for hapless debtors which Congress intended.” Id., at 41 .  We can no longer adhere to the aberrational doctrine of <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz that state law may frustrate the operation of federal law as long as the state legislature in passing its law had some purpose in mind other than *652 one of frustration.  Apart from the fact that it is at odds with the approach taken in nearly all our Supremacy Clause cases, such a doctrine would enable state legislatures to nullify nearly all unwanted federal legislation by simply publishing a legislative committee report articulating some state interest or policy — other than frustration of the federal objective — that would be tapgentially furthered by the proposed state law. In view of the consequences, we certainly would not apply the <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> doctrine in all Supremacy Clause cases. Although it is possible to argue that <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz are somehow confined to cases involving either bankruptcy or highway safety, analysis discloses no reason why the States should have broader power to nullify federal law in these fields than in others.  Thus, we conclude that <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz can have no authoritative effect to the extent they are inconsistent with the controlling principle that any state legislation which frustrates the full effectiveness of federal law is rendered invalid by the Supremacy Clause.  Section 28-1163 (B) thus may not stand.  III Even accepting the Supremacy Clause analysis of <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz — that is, looking to the purpose rather than the effect of state laws — those decisions are not dispositive of this case. Just as <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> went a step beyond Reitz and broadened the holding of the earlier case, 369 U. S., at 184 (dissenting opinion), so in the present case the respondents asked the courts below and this Court to expand the holdings of the two previous cases. The distinction between <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz and this case lies in the State’s expressed legislative purpose.  <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz were aberrational in their treatment of this question as well.  The majority opinions in both cases assumed, without citation of state court authority or any indication that such precedent was unavailable, *653 that the purpose of the state financial responsibility laws there under attack was not provision of relief to creditors but rather deterrence of irresponsible driving.  The assumption was, in effect, that all state legislatures which had enacted prdvisions such as § 28-1163 (B) had concluded that an uninsured motorist about to embark in his car would be more careful on the road if he did not have available what the majority in <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> cavalierly characterized as an “easy refuge in bankruptcy.” 369 U. S., at 173.  14 Passing the question of whether the Court gave sufficient attention to binding state interpretations of state legislative purpose and conceding that it employed proper technique in divining as obvious from their face the aim of the state enactments, the present case raises doubts about whether the Court was correct even in its basic assumptions.  The Arizona Supreme Court has declared that Arizona’s Safety Responsibility Act “has for its principal purpose the protec *654 tion of the public .  .  .  from financial hardship” resulting from involvement in traffic accidents with uninsured motorists unable to respond to a judgment.  Schecter v. Killingsworth, 93 Ariz., at 280 , 380 P. 2d, at 140 .  The Court in <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> was able to declare, although the source of support is unclear, that the Utah statute could be upheld because it was “not an Act for the Relief of Mulcted Creditors” or a statute “designed to- aid collection of debts.” 369 U. S., at 174, 169.  But here the respondents urge us to- uphold precisely the sort of statute that <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> would have stricken down — one with a declared purpose to protect judgment creditors “from financial hardship” by giving them a powerful weapon with which to force bankrupts to pay their debts despite their discharge.  Whereas the Acts in <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz had the effect of frustrating federal law but had, the Court said, no such purpose, the Arizona Act has both that effect and that purpose.  Believing as we do that <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz are not in harmony with sound constitutional principle, they certainly should not be extended to cover this new and distinguishable case. IV One final argument merits discussion.  The dissent points out that the District of Columbia Code contains an anti-discharge provision similar to that included in the Arizona Act.  Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act of the District of Columbia, D. C. Code Ann. § 40-464 (1967), 68 Stat. 132 .  In light of our decision today, the sum of the argument is to draw into question the constitutional validity of the District's anti-discharge section, for as noted in the dissent the Constitution confers upon Congress the power “[t]o establish .  .  .  uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.” U. S. Const., Art. I, § 8, cl. 4 (emphasis *655 added).

 U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  Mr. and Mrs. Perez also alleged in their complaint that certain provisions of the Arizona Act imposed involuntary servitude in violation of the Thirteenth Amendment, and denied Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection.  They also claimed that portions of the Arizona Act operated as a bill of attainder in violation of Art. I, § 10, of the Constitution.  The District Judge, in refusing to request the convening of a three-judge court, ruled that these constitutional claims were “obviously insubstantial.” The Court of Appeals agreed.  421 F. 2d 619 , 625 (CA9 1970).  Because *644 of our resolution of this case, we express no opinion as to the substantiality of any of petitioners’ other constitutional claims.  As discussed below, the majorities in <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz also seemed unwilling to be bound by, or even to look for, state court constructions of the financial responsibility laws before them.  See *645 infra, at 652-654.  It is clear, however, from even a cursory examination of decisions in other States that the conclusion of the Arizona Supreme Court as to the purpose of the financial responsibility law is by no means unusual.  See, e. g., Sullivan v. Cheatham, 264 Ala. 71, 76 , 84 So. 2d 374, 378 (1955) (“The purpose of the [Motor Vehicle Safety-Responsibility] Act is clearly to require and establish financial responsibility for every owner or operator of a motor vehicle ‘in any manner involved in an accident.’.  .  .  The Act is designed to protect all persons having claims arising out of highway accidents.”); Escobedo v. State Dept. of Motor Vehicles, 35 Cal. 2d 870, 876 , 222 P. 2d 1, 5 (1950) (“[T]he state chose to allow financially irresponsible licensed operators to drive until they became involved in an accident with the consequences described in the [financial responsibility law] and their financial irresponsibility was thus brought to the attention of the department, and then to require suspension of their licenses.”); People v. Nothaus, 147 Colo. 210, 215-216 , 363 P. 2d 180, 183 (1961) (“The requirement of C. R. S. ’53, 13-7-7, that the director of revenue, '.

 See Reitz, 314 U. S., at 40-43 (Douglas, J., dissenting).  Under Art. 3 of the Arizona Act, dealing with the posting of security for damages arising from a particular accident, the victim may cut the superintendent out by executing a release from liability or agreeing to some other written settlement or confession of judgment providing for payment of some damages, in installments or otherwise.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1143 (A) (4) discussed in n. 2, supra. Assuming that such an agreement or confession of judgment providing for installment payments is filed with the superintendent, it prevents him from suspending driving privileges for failure to post the amount of financial security the superintendent determines to be necessary; however, if the careless driver later defaults on one installment, the victim may give notice to the superintendent, who must then use his power of suspension to either coerce full payment or the posting of security.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1144 (3), discussed in n. 3, supra. Under Art. 4, dealing with suspension for nonpayment of a judgment, the victim who has chosen to reduce his claim to judgment maintains substantial control over the suspension of driving privileges if the judgment remains unsatisfied 60 days after entry.  He may consent that the judgment debtor’s driving privileges not be suspended, but the debtor still must furnish proof of financial responsibility for the future.  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. §28-1162 (B).  For an argument that a similar provision delegating to judgment creditors the right to choose which careless drivers who do not pay judgments shall escape suspension conflicts with the Bankruptcy Act see Kesler, <citedDecision>369 U. S., at 179-182</citedDecision> (Warren, C. J., dissenting) .  If the judgment debtor is able to secure a discretionary court order permitting him to pay a judgment in installments under §28-1165 (A), the creditor may cause suspension of driving privileges until the judgment is fully satisfied by notifying the superintendent of any default in payment of the installments.  Ariz. Rev. *648 Stat. Ann. §28-1165 (C).  Again, however, the judgment debtor must still give proof of financial responsibility for the future.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 28-1165 (B).  <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> also decided a jurisdictional question, holding that a Supremacy Clause challenge to a state statute was required to be heard by a three-judge district court under 28 U. S. C. §2281 .  See 369 U. S., at 155-158.  This jurisdictional part of the decision was overruled almost four years later in Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 116 (1965).  It also seems clear that even under the logic of <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz Mrs. Perez should not have lost her driving privileges.  She was not present when the accident occurred, and no act or omission on her part contributed to it.  Because the automobile was community property under Arizona law and because judgment was confessed as to her in the Pinkerton negligence action, the Court of Appeals reasoned that loss of Mrs. Perez’ license “is the price an Arizona wife must pay for negligent driving by her husband of the community vehicle” when the resulting judgment is not paid.  421 F. 2d, at 624.  The <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz assumption that depriving uninsured motorists of the full relief afforded by a discharge in bankruptcy would prompt careful driving is without foundation when applied to Mrs. Perez.  As the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated in a recent decision involving similar facts: “Even accepting the fiction that, as applied to drivers, motor vehicle responsibility statutes are intended to promote safety, it is just too much fiction to contend that, applied to a judgment debtor held vicariously liable for the omission of a sub-agent, the statute is anything but a means for the enforcement of judgments.” Miller v. Anckaitis, 436 F. 2d 115, 118 (CA3 1970) (en banc).  See S. Rep. No. 10, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935); H. R. Rep. No. 208, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935) (both presenting a summary of the provisions of the proposed statute dealing with “Financial Responsibility of Motor Vehicle Operators in the District of Columbia,” but failing to mention the fact that a discharge in bankruptcy of an accident judgment would have no effect on suspension of driving privileges for failure to satisfy such judgment); H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 799, 74th Cong., 1st Sess. (1935) (Conference Report making no mention of anti-discharge provision); 79 Cong. Rec. 272-273 (Senate); 79 Cong. Rec. 3416-3417, 4621-4629, 4631-4641, 6556-6564 (House).  Some members of the House, which debated some aspects of the financial responsibility law concept rather extensively in 1935, demonstrated in debate that they were totally unaware of any of the provisions designed to enforce payment of a judgment for injuries caused by the first accident of a financially irresponsible driver.  See 79 Cong. Rec. 4624 (remarks of Reps. Fitzpatrick and Sisson); id,., at 4625 (remarks of Rep. Hull).  When the present District of Columbia financial responsibility law was enacted in 1954, debate was much more limited and the reports of the House and Senate District Committees were quite brief.  Except for the reading of the bill, no mention was made of the anti-discharge provision.

 Left specifically unanswered in that case, but acknowledged as a “serious question,” 314 U. S., at 38 , was the claim that interim amendments of the statutes gave the creditor control over the initiation and duration of the suspension and thus violated the Bankruptcy Act.  The dissenters, speaking through Mr. Justice Douglas, concluded that that constitutional issue “cannot be escaped .  .  .  unless we are to overlook the realities of collection methods.” 314 U. S., at 43 .  Nine years ago, the same argument again was advanced, this time with respect to Utah’s Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act, and again was rejected.  Kesler v. Department of Public Safety, <citedDecision>369 U. S. 153, 158-174</citedDecision> (1962).  There, Utah’s provisions relating to duration of suspension and restoration, more stringent than those of New York, were challenged.  It was claimed that the statutes made the State a “collecting agent for the creditor rather than furthering an interest in highway safety,” *662 and that suspension that could be perpetual “only renders the collection pressure more effective.” <citedDecision>369 U. S., at 169</citedDecision> .  There was a troublesome jurisdictional issue in the case, the decision as to which was later overruled, Swift & Co. v. Wickham, 382 U. S. 111, 124-129 (1965), but on the merits the Court, by a five-to-three vote, sustained all the Utah statutes then under attack: 4 “But the lesson Zavelo [v. Reeves, 227 U. S. 625 (1913)] and Spalding [v. New York ex rel. Backus, 4 How. 21 (1845)] teach is that the Bankruptcy Act does not forbid a State to attach any consequence whatsoever to a debt which has been discharged.  “The Utah Safety Responsibility Act leaves the bankrupt to some extent burdened by the discharged debt.  Certainly some inroad is made on the consequences of bankruptcy if the creditor can exert pressure to recoup a discharged debt, or part of it, through the leverage of the State’s licensing and registration power.  But the exercise of this power is deemed vital to the State’s well-being, and, from the point of view of its interests, is wholly unrelated to the considerations which propelled Congress to enact a national bankruptcy law. There are here overlapping interests which cannot be uncritically resolved by exclusive regard to the money consequences of enforcing a widely adopted measure for safeguarding life and safety.  “.  .

 ... To whatever extent these provisions make it more probable that the debt will be paid despite the discharge, each no less reflects the State’s important deterrent interest.  Congress had no thought of amending the Bankruptcy Act-when it adopted this law for the District of Columbia; we do not believe Utah’s identical statute conflicts with it either.  “Utah is not using its police power as a devious collecting agency under the pressure of organized creditors.  Victims of careless car drivers are a wholly diffused group of shifting and uncertain composition, not even remotely united by a common financial interest.  The Safety Responsibility Act is not an Act for the Relief of Mulcted Creditors.  It is not directed to bankrupts as such.  Though in a particular case a discharged bankrupt who wants to have his rightfully suspended license and registration restored may have to pay the amount of a discharged debt, or part of it, the bearing of the statute on the purposes served by bankruptcy legislation is essentially tangential.” <citedDecision>369 U. S., at 170-174</citedDecision> (footnotes omitted).  Mr. Justice Black, joined by Mr. Justice Douglas, dissented on the ground that Utah Code Ann. § 41-12-15 (1953), essentially identical to Arizona’s §28-1163 (B), *664 operated to deny the judgment debtor the federal immunity given him by § 17 of the Bankruptcy Act and, hence, violated the Supremacy Clause.  <citedDecision>369 U. S., at 182-185</citedDecision> .  The Perezes in their brief, p. 7, acknowledge that the Arizona statutes challenged here “are not unlike the Utah ones discussed in Kesler.” Accordingly, Adolfo Perez is forced to urge that Reitz and the remaining portion of <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> that bears upon the subject be overruled.  The Court bows to that argument.  I am not prepared to overrule those two cases and to undermine their control over Adolfo Perez’ posture here.  I would adhere to the rulings and I would hold that the States have an appropriate and legitimate concern with highway safety; that the means Arizona has adopted with respect to one in Adolfo’s position (that is, the driver whose negligence has caused harm to others and whose judgment debt based on that negligence remains unsatisfied) in its attempt to assure driving competence and care on the part of its licensees, as well as to protect others, is appropriate state legislation; and that the Arizona statute, like its Utah counterpart, despite the tangential effect upon bankruptcy, does not operate in derogation of the Bankruptcy Act or conflict with it to the extent it may rightly be said to violate the Supremacy Clause.  Other factors of significance are also to be noted: 1.  The Court struggles to explain away the parallel District of Columbia situation installed by Congress itself.  Section 40-464 of the D. C. Code Ann. (1967) in all pertinent parts is identical with Arizona’s § 28-1163 (B).  The only difference is in the final word, namely, “article” in the Arizona statute and “chapter” in the District’s.  The District of Columbia statute was enacted as § 48 of Pub. Law 365 of May 25, 1954, effective one year later, 68 Stat. 132 .  This is long after the Bankruptcy Act *665 was placed on the books and, indeed, long after this Court’s decision in Lewis v. Roberts, 267 U. S. 467 (1925), that a personal injury judgment is a provable claim in bankruptcy.  Surely, as the Court noted in Kesler, <citedDecision>369 U. S., at 173-174</citedDecision> , “Congress had no thought of amending the Bankruptcy Act when it adopted this law for the District of Columbia.” See Lee v. England, 206 F. Supp. 957 (DC 1962).  Congress must have regarded the two statutes as consistent and compatible, and cannot have thought otherwise for the last 35 years.  5 If the statutes truly are in tension, then I would suppose that the later one, that is, § 40-464, would be the one to prevail.  Gibson v. United States, 194 U. S. 182, 192 (1904).  But, if so, we then have something less than the “uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States” that Art. I, § 8, cl. 4, of the Constitution commands, for the law would be one way in Arizona (and, by the present overruling of Reitz and <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> , in New York and in Utah) and the other way in the District of Columbia.  Unfortunately, such is the dilemma in which the Court’s decision today leaves us.  2.  Arizona’s § 28-1163 (B) also has its counterparts in the statutes of no less than 44 other States.  6 It is, after *666 all, or purports to be, a uniform Act.  I suspect the Court’s decision today will astonish those members of the Congress who were responsible for the District of Columbia Code provision, and will equally astonish the legislatures of those 44 States that absorbed assurance from Reitz and <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> that the provision withstands constitutional attack.  3.  The Court rationalizes today’s decision by saying that <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> went beyond Reitz and that the present case goes beyond <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> , and that that is too much.  It would justify this by noting the Arizona Supreme Court’s characterization of the Arizona statute as one for the protection of the public from financial hardship and by con- *667 eluding, from this description, that the statute is not a public highway safety measure, but rather a financial one protective, I assume the implication is, of insurance companies.  The Arizona court’s characterization of its statute, I must concede, is not a fortunate one.  However, I doubt that that court, in evolving that description, had any idea of the consequences to be wrought by this Court’s decision today.  I am not willing to say that the description in Schecter v. Killingsworth, 93 Ariz. 273 , 380 P. 2d 136 (1963), embraced the only purpose of the State’s legislation.  Section 28-1163 (B) is a part of the State’s Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act and does not constitute an isolated subchapter of that Act concerned only with financial well-being of the victims of drivers’ negligence.  In any event, as the Court’s opinion makes clear, the decision today would be the same however the Arizona court had described its statute.  4.  While stare decisis “is no immutable principle,” 7 as a glance at the Court’s decisions over the last 35 years, or over almost any period for that matter, will disclose, it seems to me that the principle does have particular validity and application in a situation such as the one confronting the Court in this case. Here is a statute concerning motor vehicle responsibility, a substantive matter peculiarly within the competence of the State rather than the National Government.  Here is a serious and conscientious attempt by a State to legislate and do something about the problem that, in terms of death and bodily injury and adverse civilian effect, is so alarming.  Here is a statute widely adopted by the several States and legitimately assumed by the lawmakers of those States to be consistent with the Bankruptcy Act, an assumption rooted in positive, albeit divided, decision *668 by this Court, not once, but twice.  And here is a statute the Congress itself, the very author of the Bankruptcy Act, obviously considered consistent therewith.  I fear that the Court today makes stare decisis meaningless and downgrades it to the level of a tool to be used or cast aside as convenience dictates. I doubt if Justices Roberts, Stone, Reed, Frankfurter, Murphy, Warren, Clark, Harlan, Brennan, and Stewart, who constituted the respective majorities on the merits in Reitz and <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> , were all that wrong.  5.  Adolfo’s affidavit protestation of hardship goes no further than to assert a resulting reliance upon friends and neighbors or upon public transportation or upon walking to cover the seven miles from his home to his place of work; this is inconvenience, perhaps, even in this modern day when we are inclined to equate convenience with necessity and to eschew what prior generations routinely accepted as part of the day’s labor, but it falls far short of the “great harm” and “irreparable injury” that he otherwise asserts only in general and conclusory terms.  Perez’ professed inconvenience stands vividly and starkly in contrast with his victims’ injuries.  But as is so often the case, the victim, once damaged, is seemingly beyond concern.  What seems to become important is the perpetrator’s inconvenience.  6.

Thus, as the parties appear to agree, she could neither enter into a contract for the purchase of an automobile nor acquire insurance upon it except by use of her separate property.  *670 The Court of Appeals ruled that Mrs. Perez’ posture, as the innocent wife who had no connection with the negligent conduct that led to the confession and entry of judgment, was, under the logic of <citedDecision>Kesler</citedDecision> and Reitz , “a distinction without a significant difference” even though “she had no alternative.” 421 F. 2d 619 , 622-623.  The court opined that the spouse can acquire an automobile with her separate funds and that negligent operation of it on separate business would then not call into question the liability of the other spouse.  It described Emma’s legal status as “closely analogous” to that of the automobile owner who permits another person to drive, and it regarded as authority cases upholding a State’s right to revoke the owner’s license and registration after judgment had been entered against him and remains unsatisfied.  The husband was described, under Arizona law, as the managing agent of the wife in the control of the community automobile, and “the driver’s licenses of both husband and wife are an integral part of the ball of wax, which is the basis of the Arizona community property laws.” The loss of her license “is the price an Arizona wife must pay for negligent driving by her husband of the community vehicle” when the resulting judgment is not paid.  421 F. 2d, at 624.  For what it is worth, Emma’s affidavit is far more persuasive of hardship than Adolfo’s.  She relates the family automobile to the children and their medical needs and to family purchasing at distant discount stores.
**Concurrence Opinion**
 I therefore would hold that under these circumstances the State’s action, under § 28-1163 (B), in withholding from Emma her operator’s license is not, within the language of Reitz , an appropriate means for Arizona “to insure competence and care on the part of [Emma] and to protect others” using the highways, 314 U. S., at 36 , and that it interferes with the paramount federal interest in her bankruptcy discharge and violates the Supremacy Clause.  [For Appendix to opinion of Blackmun, J., see post, p. 672.] *672 See Appendix to this opinion, post, p. 672.  The petitioners urge upon us only the Supremacy Clause.  In 1943 some of the motor vehicle uniform laws were “withdrawn from active promulgation pending further study” by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws.  9B U. L. A.

Department of Public Safety, <citedDecision>369 U. S. 153, 158-168</citedDecision> (1962).  Mr. Chief Justice Warren, dissenting in part, would have upheld the Utah statutes other than that “which gives to a creditor the discretion of determining if and when driving privileges may be restored by the State .  .  .  <citedDecision>369 U.

Section 3 of the earlier Act provided, 49 Stat. 167 , that a judgment’s discharge in bankruptcy, as distinguished from other discharge, would not relieve the judgment debtor from suspension.  Ala.
