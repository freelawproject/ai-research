While the proceedings in the District Court were entitled in Elmore’s action and the United States was not a party until the appeal, those circumstances though relevant (Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 445-446) are not conclusive as.to the nature of the contempt. The fact that Nye was ordered to pay the costs of the proceeding, including $500 to Guthrie, is also not decisive. .As Mr. Justice Brandéis stated in Union Tool Co. v. Wilson, 259 U. S. 107, 110, “Where a fine is imposed partly as compensation to the complainant and partly as punishment, the criminal feature of the order is dominant and fixes *43 its character for purposes of review.” The order imposes unconditional fines payable to the United States. It awards no relief to a private suitor. The prayer for relief 8 and the acts charged 9 carry the criminal hallmark. Cf. Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 449. They clearly do not reveal any purpose to punish for contempt “in aid of the adjudication sought in the principal suit.” Lamb v. Cramer, 285 U. S. 217, 220. When there is added the “significant” fact (Bessette v. W. B. Conkey Co., 194 U. S. 324, 329) that Nye and Mayers were strangers, not parties, to Elmore’s action, there can be no reasonable doubt that the punitive character of the order was dominant. We come then to the question of the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals. We disagree with the government in its contention that the appeal in this case was governed by the Criminal Appeals Rules. Those rules were promulgated pursuant to the provisions of the Act of March 8, 1934 (48 Stat. 399; 28 U. S. C. § 723a) which provided, inter alia, that this Court should have “the power to prescribe, from time to time, rules of practice and procedure with respect to any or all proceedings after verdict, or finding of guilt by the court if a jury has been waived, or plea of guilty, in criminal - cases.” The rules were adopted “as the Rules of Practice and Procedure in all .proceedings after plea of guilty, verdict of guilt by a jury or finding of guilt by the trial court where a jury is waived, in criminal cases.” 292 U. S. 661.

300-301. And when .the Act came before this Court in Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 511, Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the Court, acknowledgéd that it had limited the power of those courts. And see. Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364, 374. So far as the decisions of this Court are concerned, that view persisted to the time when Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, was decided. See Ex parte Wall, 107 U. S. 265; Savin, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 267, 276; Cuddy, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 280, 285; Eilenbecker v. District Court, 134 U. S. 31, 38. Mindful of that history, we come to the construction of § 268 of the Judicial Code in light of the specific facts of this case. The question is whether the words “so near thereto” have a geographical or a causal connotation. Read in their context and in the light of their ordinary meaning, we conclude that they are to be construed as geographical terms. In Ex parte Robinson, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, at p. 511, it was said that as a result of those provisions the power to punish for contempts “can only be exercised to insure order and decorum” in court. “Misbehavior of any person in their presence” plainly falls in that category. Ex parte Terry, 128 U. S. 289. And in Savin, Petitioner, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, it was also held to include attempted bribes of a witness, one in the jury room and within a few feet of the court room and one in the hallway immediately adjoining the court room. See Cooke v. United States, 267 U. S. 517. The phrase “so near thereto as to obstruct the' administration of justice” likewise con *49 notes that the misbehavior must be in the vicinity of the court. Nelles & King, Contempt by Publication in the United States, 28 Col. L. Rev. 525, 530. It is not sufficient that the misbehavior charged has some direct relation to the work of the court. “Near” in this context, juxtaposed to “presence,” suggests physical proximity not .relevancy. In fact, if the words “so near thereto” are not read in the geographical sense, they come close, as the government admits, to being surplusage. There may, of course, be many types of “misbehavior” which will “obstruct the administration of justice” but which may not be “in” or “near” to the “presence” of the court. Broad categories of such acts, however, were expressly recognized in § 2 of the Act of March 2, 1831 and subsequently in § 135 of the Criminal Code. It has been held that an act of misbehavior though covered by the latter provisions may also be a contempt if committed in the “presence” of the Court. Savin, Petitioner, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>. And see Sinclair v. United States, 279 U. S. 749. Yet in view of the history of those provisions, meticulous regard for those separate categories of offenses must be had, so that ■the instances where there is no right to jury trial will be narrowly restricted. If “so near thereto” be given a causal meaning, then § 268 by the process of judicial construction will have regained much of the generality which Congress in 1831 emphatically intended to remove. See Thomas, Problems oj Contempt oj Court (1934) c. VII. If that phrase be not restricted to acts in the vicinity of the court but be allowed to embrace acts which have a “reasonable tendency” to “obstruct the administration of justice” (Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, p. 421) then the conditions which Congress sought to alleviate in 1831 have largely been restored. See Fox, The History oj Contempt oj Court (1927) c. IX. The result will be- that the offenses which Congress designated as true crimes under § 2 of the Act of March 2, *50 1831 will be absorbed as contempts wherever they may take place. We cannot by the process of interpretation obliterate the distinctions which Congress drew. We are dealing here only with a problem of statutory construction, not with a. question as to the constitutionally permissible scope of the contempt power. But that is no reason why we should adhere to the construction adopted by Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, and leave to Congress the task of delimiting the' statute as thus interpreted. Though the statute in ques*tion has been on the books for over a century, it has not received during its long life the broad interpretation which that decision gave it. Rather, that broad construction is relatively recent. So far as decisions of this Court are concerned, the statute did not receive any such expanded interpretation- until Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, was decided in 1918. The decisions of this Court prior to 1918 plainly recognized, as we have noted, that Congress through the Act of March 2, 1831 had imposed a limitation on the power to punish for contempts^ — a view consistent with the holdings of the lower federal courts during the years immediately following the enactment of the statute. The early view was best expressed in Ex parte Poulson, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, decided in 1835. In that case it was held that the Act of March 2, 1831 gave the court no power to punish a newspaper publisher for contempt for publishing an “offensive’’ article relative to a pending case. It was held that the first section of the Act “alludes to that kind of misbehavior which is calculated to disturb the order of the court, such as noise, tumultuous or disorderly behavior, either in or so near to it as to prevent its proceeding in the orderly dispatch of its business.” p. 1208. That was a. plain recognition that the words “so near thereto” connoted physical proximity. And prior to 1918 the decisions of this Court did not depart from that theory, *51 however they may have expanded the earlier, notions of “misbehavior.” To be sure, the lower federal courts in the intervening years had expressed a contrariety of views on the meaning of the statute 16 and some were giving it an expanded scope 17 which was later approved in Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>. But it is significant that not until after the turn of this century did the first line of fracture appear suggesting that the stat* ute authorized summary punishment for publication. 18 Thus the legislative history of this statute and its career demonstrate that this case presents the question of correcting a plain misreading of language and history so as to give full respect to- the meaning which Congress unmistakably intended the statute to have. Its legislative history, its interpretation prior to 1918, the character and nature of the contempt proceedings, admonish us not to give renewed vitality to the doctrine of Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, but to recognize the substantial legislative limitations on the contempt power which were occasioned by the Judge Peck episode. And they necessitate an adherence to the original construction of the statute so that, unless its requirements are clearly satisfied, an offense will be dealt with as the law deals with the run of illegal acts. Cf. Mr. Justice Holmes *52 dissenting in Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United Stales, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, pp. 422 et seq. The conduct of petitioners (if the facts found are taken to be true) was highly reprehensible. It is of a kind which corrupts the judicial process and impedes the administration of justice. But the fact that it is not reachable through the summary procedure of contempt does not mean that such conduct can. proceed with impunity. Section 135 of the Criminal Code, a descendant of § 2 of the Act of March 2, 1831, embraces a broad category of offenses.. And certainly it cannot be denied that the conduct here in question comes far closer to thev family of offenses there described than it does.to the more limited classes of contempts described in § 268 of the Judicial Code. The acts' complained of took place miles from the District Court. The evil influence which affected Elmore was in ho possible sense in the “presence” of the court or “near thereto.” So far as the crime of contempt is concerned, the fact that the judge received Elmore’s letter is inconsequential. We may concede that there was an obstruction in the administration of justice, as evidenced by the long delay and large expense which the reprehensible conduct of petitioners entailed. And it would follow that under the “reasonable tendency” rule of Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, the court below did not err in affirming the judgment of conviction. But for the reasons stated that decision must be overruled. The fact that in purpose and effect there was an obstruction in the administration of justice did not bring the condemned conduct within the vicinity of the court in any normal meaning of the term. It was not misbehavior in the vicinity of the court disrupting to quiet and order or actually interrupting the court in the conduct of its business. Cf Savin, Petitioner, <targetCase>supra</targetCase>, at p. 278. Hence, it was not embraced within § 268 of the Judicial Code. *53 If petitioners can be punished for their misconduct, it must be under the Criminal Code where they will be afforded the normal safeguards surrounding criminal prosecutions. Accordingly, the judgment below is Reversed. Nye’s daughter was married to the son of Council, one of the defendants in the Elmore action. Mayers (Meares) was Nye’s tenant who was acquainted with Elmore. The court had deferred action on Elmore’s inspired request for a dismissal at the request of Guthrie and pending an investigation by him.
