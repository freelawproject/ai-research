 See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., supra, at 347-349.  The principles recognized in the libel decisions suggest that government may take broader action to protect the public from injury produced by false or deceptive price or product advertising than from harm caused by defamation.  In contrast to the press, which must often attempt to assemble the true facts from sketchy and sometimes conflicting sources under the pressure of publication deadlines, the commercial advertiser generally knows the product or service he seeks to sell and is in a position to verify the accuracy of his factual representations before he disseminates them.  The advertiser’s access to the truth about his product and its price substantially eliminates any danger that governmental regulation of false or misleading price or product advertising will chill accurate and nondeceptive commercial expression.  There *778 is, therefore, little need to sanction “some falsehood in order to protect speech that matters.” Id., at 341 .  The scope of constitutional protection of communicative expression is not universally inelastic.  In the area of labor relations, for example, the Court has recognized that “an employer’s free speech right to communicate his views to his employees is firmly established and cannot be infringed by a union or the National Labor Relations Board.” NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., <citedDecision>395 U. S. 575, 617</citedDecision> .  See NLRB v. Virginia Electric & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469 .  Yet, in that context, the Court has concluded that the employer’s freedom to communicate his views to his employees may be restricted by the requirement that any predictions “be carefully phrased on the basis of objective fact.” 3 <citedDecision>395 U. S., at 618</citedDecision> .  In response to the contention that the “line between so-called permitted predictions and proscribed threats is too vague to stand up under traditional First Amendment analysis,” the Court relied on the employer’s intimate knowledge of the employer-employee relationship and his ability to “avoid coercive speech simply by avoiding conscious overstatements he has reason to believe will mislead his em *779 ployees.” <citedDecision>Id., at 620</citedDecision> .  Cf. United States v. 95 Barrels of Vinegar, 265 U. S. 438, 443 (“It is not difficult to choose statements, designs and devices which will not deceive”).  Although speech in the labor relations setting may be distinguished from commercial advertising, 4 the Gissel Packing Co. opinion is highly significant in the present context because it underscores the constitutional importance of the speaker’s specific and unique knowledge of the relevant facts and establishes that a regulatory scheme monitoring “the impact of utterances” is not invariably inconsistent with the First Amendment.  5 See <citedDecision>395 U. S., at 620</citedDecision> .  The Court’s determination that commercial advertising of the kind at issue here is not “wholly outside the protection of” the First Amendment indicates by its very phrasing that there are important differences between commercial price and product advertising, on the one hand, and ideological communication on the other.  See ante, at 771-772, n. 24.  Ideological expression, be it oral, literary, pictorial, or theatrical, is integrally related to the exposition of thought — thought that may shape our concepts of the whole universe of man.  Although such expression may convey factual information relevant to social and individual decisionmaking, it is protected by *780 the Constitution, whether or not it contains factual representations and even if it includes inaccurate assertions of fact.  Indeed, disregard of the “truth” may be employed to give force to the underlying idea expressed by the speaker.  6 “Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea,” and the only way that ideas can be suppressed is through “the competition of other ideas,” Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S., at 339-340 .

 Indeed, the elimination of false and deceptive claims serves to promote the one facet of commercial price and product advertising that warrants First Amendment protection — its contribution to the flow of accurate and rehable information relevant to public and private decisionmaking.  In recent years the soundness of the sweeping language of the Chrestensen opinion has been repeatedly questioned.  See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 819-821 ; Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 314-315 , and n. 6 (Brennan, J., dissenting); Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm’n, 413 U. S. 376, 398 (Douglas, J., dissenting); id., at 401 , and n. 6 (Stewart, J., dissenting); Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (Douglas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 .  See, e. g., Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U. S. 507, 520 ; Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 209 ; Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 828 ; Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 115 .  In the labor relations area, governmental regulation of expression by employers has been justified in part by the competing First Amendment associational interests of employees and by the economic dependence of employees on their employers.  See NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., <citedDecision>395 U. S., at 617-618</citedDecision> ; NLRB v. Virginia Electric & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477 .  The Court in Gissel Packing Co. emphasized the NLRB’s expertise in determining whether statements by employers would tend to mislead or coerce employees.  <citedDecision>395 U. S., at 620</citedDecision> .  The NLRB’s armamentarium for responding to material misrepresentations and deceptive tactics includes the issuance of cease-and-desist orders and the securing of restraining orders.  See 29 U. S. C. §§160 (c), (j).  Speech by an employer or a labor union organizer that contains material misrepresentations of fact or appeals to racial prejudice may form the basis of an unfair labor practice or warrant the invalidation of a certification election.  See, e. g., Sewell Mfg. Co., 138 N. L. R. B. 66; United States Gypsum Co., 130 N. L. R. B. 901; Gummed Products Co., 112 N. L. R. B. 1092.  Such restrictions would clearly violate First Amendment guarantees if applied to political expression concerning the election of candidates to public office.  See Vanasco v. Schwartz, 401 F. Supp. 87 (EDNY) (three-judge court), summarily aff’d sub nom. Schwartz v. Postel, 423 U. S. 1041 .
