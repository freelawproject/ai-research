Id., at 687-689. Many constitutional standards involve "undoubte[d] . . . gray areas," Fry v. United States, 421 U.S. 542 , 558 (1975) (dissenting opinion), and, despite the difficulties that this Court and other courts have encountered so far, it normally might be fair to venture the assumption that case-by-case development would lead to a workable standard for determining whether a particular governmental function should be immune from federal regulation under the Commerce Clause. A further cautionary note is sounded, however, by the Court's experience in the related field of state immunity from federal taxation. In South Carolina v. United States, 199 U.S. 437 (1905), the Court held for the first time that the state tax immunity recognized in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871), extended only to the "ordinary" and "strictly governmental" instrumentalities of state governments and not to instrumentalities "used by the State in the carrying on of an ordinary private business." 199 U.S. , at 451 , 461. While the Court applied the distinction outlined in South Carolina for the following 40 years, at no time during that period did the Court develop a consistent formulation of the kinds of governmental functions that were entitled to immunity. The Court identified the protected functions at various times as "essential," "usual," "traditional," or "strictly governmental." [6] *541 While "these differences in phraseology . .

as Amici Curiae 7-8. [4] The District Court also analyzed the status of mass transit under the four-part test devised by the Sixth Circuit in Amersbach v. City of Cleveland, 598 F.2d 1033 (1979). In that case, the Court of Appeals looked to (1) whether the function benefits the community as a whole and is made available at little or no expense; (2) whether it is undertaken for public service or pecuniary gain; (3) whether government is its principal provider; and (4) whether government is particularly suited to perform it because of a community-wide need. Id., at 1037. [5] See also, however, Jefferson County Pharmaceutical Assn. v. Abott Laboratories, 460 U.S. 150 , 154, n. 6 (1983); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742 , 781, and n. 7 (1982) (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); Fry v. United States, 421 U.S. 542 , 558, and n. 2 (1975) (dissenting opinion). [6] See Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., 220 U.S. 107 , 172 (1911) ("essential"); Helvering v. Therrell, 303 U.S. 218 , 225 (1938) (same); Helvering v. Powers, 293 U.S. 214 , 225 (1934) ("usual"); United States v. California, 297 U.S. 175 , 185 (1936) ("activities in which the states have traditionally engaged"); South Carolina v. United States, 199 U.S. 437 , 461 (1905) ("strictly governmental"). [7] In South Carolina, the Court relied on the concept of "strictly governmental" functions to uphold the application of a federal liquor license tax to a state-owned liquor-distribution monopoly. In Flint, the Court stated: "The true distinction is between . . . those operations of the States essential to the execution of its [sic] governmental functions, and which the State can only do itself, and those activities which are of a private character"; under this standard, "[i]t is no part of the essential governmental functions of a State to provide means of transportation, supply artificial light, water and the like." 220 U.S. , at 172 .
