<author id="b241-11">Mr. Justice DAVIS,</author>
<p id="Ajr">with whom concurred the CHIEF JUSTICE, dissenting, said:</p>
<p id="b241-12">I am constrained to enter my dissent to the opinion and judgment of the court in this case, for the reason that this suit, although in form otherwise, is in effect' against the State of Texas. The object which it seeks to obtain shows this to be so, which is to deprive the State of the power to dispose, in its own way, of its public lands, and this object, by &gt;fhe decision just rendered, is accomplished. In my judgment the bill should have been dismissed, because the State is exempt from suit at-the instance of private persons, and on the face of th.e bill it is apparent that the State is arraigned as a defendant.</p>
