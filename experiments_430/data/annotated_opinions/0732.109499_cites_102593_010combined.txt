 "[A]lthough an emergency may not call into life a power which has never lived, nevertheless emergency may afford a reason for the exertion of a living power already enjoyed." Wilson v. New, 243 U. S. 332, 348 (1917).  With respect to the Court's decision in Wirtz , we reach a different conclusion.  Both appellee and the District Court thought that decision required rejection of appellants' *854 claims.  Appellants, in turn, advance several arguments by which they seek to distinguish the facts before the Court in Wirtz from those presented by the 1974 amendments to the Act.  There are undoubtedly factual distinctions between the two situations, but in view of the conclusions expressed earlier in this opinion we do not believe the reasoning in Wirtz may any longer be regarded as authoritative.  Wirtz relied heavily on the Court's decision in United States v. California, <citedDecision>297 U. S. 175</citedDecision> (1936).  The opinion quotes the following language from that case: " `[We] look to the activities in which the states have traditionally engaged as marking the boundary of the restriction upon the federal taxing power.  But there is no such limitation upon the plenary power to regulate commerce.  The state can no more deny the power if its exercise has been authorized by Congress than can an individual.' <citedDecision>297 U. S., at 185</citedDecision> ." 392 U. S., at 198 .  But we have reaffirmed today that the States as States stand on a quite different footing from an individual or a corporation when challenging the exercise of Congress' power to regulate commerce.  We think the dicta [18] from *855 United States v. <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> , simply wrong.  [19] Congress may not exercise that power so as to force directly upon the States its choices as to how essential decisions regarding the conduct of integral governmental functions are to be made.  We agree that such assertions of power, if unchecked, would indeed, as Mr. Justice Douglas cautioned in his dissent in Wirtz , allow "the National Government [to] devour the essentials of state sovereignty," 392 U. S., at 205 , and would therefore transgress the bounds of the authority granted Congress under the Commerce Clause.  While there are obvious differences between the schools and hospitals involved in Wirtz , and the fire and police departments affected here, each provides an integral portion of those governmental services which the States and their political subdivisions have traditionally afforded their citizens.  [20] We are therefore persuaded that Wirtz must be overruled.  *856 The judgment of the District Court is accordingly reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  So ordered.

 made emphatic the embracing and penetrating nature of [Congress' commerce] power by *858 warning that effective restraints on its exercise must proceed from political rather than from judicial processes." My Brethren do not successfully obscure today's patent usurpation of the role reserved for the political process by their purported discovery in the Constitution of a restraint derived from sovereignty of the States on Congress' exercise of the commerce power.  Mr. Chief Justice Marshall recognized that limitations "prescribed in the constitution," Gibbons v. Ogden, supra, at 196 , restrain Congress' exercise of the power.  See Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184, 191 (1964); Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S. 294, 305 (1964); United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 114 (1941).  Thus laws within the commerce power may not infringe individual liberties protected by the First Amendment, Mabee v. White Plains Publishing Co., 327 U. S. 178 (1946); the Fifth Amendment, Leary v. United States, 395 U. S. 6 (1969); or the Sixth Amendment, United States v. Jackson, 390 U. S. 570 (1968).  But there is no restraint based on state sovereignty requiring or permitting judicial enforcement anywhere expressed in the Constitution; our decisions over the last century and a half have explicitly rejected the existence of any such restraint on the commerce power.  [2] *859 We said in United States v. California, <citedDecision>297 U. S. 175, 184</citedDecision> (1936), for example: "The sovereign power of the states is necessarily diminished to the extent of the grants of power to the federal government in the Constitution.  .  .  .  [T]he power of the state is subordinate to the constitutional exercise of the granted federal power." This but echoed another principle emphasized by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall: "If any one proposition could command the universal assent of mankind, we might expect it would be thisthat the government of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme within its sphere of action.  This would seem to result necessarily from its nature.

 See ante, at 845, 854.  Of course, regulations that this Court can say are not regulations of "commerce" cannot stand, Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S. 453, 466 (1938), and in this sense "[t]he Court has ample power to prevent .  .  .  `the utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity.' " Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196 (1968).  [3] But my *861 Brethren make no claim that the 1974 amendments are not regulations of "commerce"; rather they overrule Wirtz in disagreement with historic principles that United States v. <citedDecision>California, supra</citedDecision> , reaffirmed: "[W]hile the commerce power has limits, valid general regulations of commerce do not cease to be regulations of commerce because a State is involved.  If a State is engaging in economic activities that are validly regulated by the Federal Government when engaged in by private persons, the State too may be forced to conform its activities to federal regulation." Wirtz, supra, at 196-197 .  Clearly, therefore, my Brethren are also repudiating the long line of our precedents holding that a judicial finding that Congress has not unreasonably regulated a subject matter of "commerce" brings to an end the judicial role.  "Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional." M`Culloch v. Maryland, supra, at 421.  The reliance of my Brethren upon the Tenth Amendment as "an express declaration of [a state sovereignty] limitation," ante, at 842, [4] not only suggests that they *862 overrule governing decisions of this Court that address this question but must astound scholars of the Constitution.

" Id., at 101 .  The Court emphatically rejected that argument, in an opinion joined by Mr. Chief Justice Stone, reasoning: "Since the Emergency Price Control Act has been sustained as a congressional exercise of the war power, the [State's] argument is that the extent of that power as applied to state functions depends on whether these are `essential' to the state government.  The use of the same criterion in measuring the constitutional power of Congress to tax has proved to be unworkable, and we reject it as a guide in the field here involved.  Cf. United States v. California, .  .  .  <citedDecision>297 U. S. at 183-185</citedDecision> ." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> [6] *865 The footnote to this statement rejected the suggested dichotomy between essential and nonessential state governmental functions as having "proved to be unworkable" by referring to "the several opinions in New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 ." Id., at 101 n. 7.  Even more significant for our purposes is the Court's citation of United States v. <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> , a case concerned with Congress' power to regulate commerce, as supporting the rejection of the State's contention that state sovereignty is a limitation on Congress' war power.  <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> directly presented the question whether any state-sovereignty restraint precluded application of the Federal Safety Appliance Act to a state owned and operated railroad.  The State argued "that as the state is operating the railroad without profit, for the purpose of facilitating the commerce of the port, and is using the net proceeds of operation for harbor improvement, .  .  .  it is engaged in performing a public function in its sovereign capacity and for that reason cannot constitutionally be subjected to the provisions of the federal Act." <citedDecision>297 U. S., at 183</citedDecision> .  Mr. Justice Stone rejected the contention in an opinion *866 for a unanimous Court. His rationale is a complete refutation of today's holding: "That in operating its railroad [the State] is acting within a power reserved to the states cannot be doubted.  .  .  .  The only question we need consider is whether the exercise of that power, in whatever capacity, must be in subordination to the power to regulate interstate commerce, which has been granted specifically to the national government.  The sovereign power of the states is necessarily diminished to the extent of the grants of power to the federal government in the Constitution.

 .  .  .  Hence we look to the activities in which the states have traditionally engaged as marking the boundary of the restriction upon the federal taxing power.  But there is no such limitation upon the plenary power to regulate commerce.  The state can no more deny the power if its exercise has been authorized by Congress than can an individual.  " <citedDecision>Id., at 183-185</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  [7] *867 Today's repudiation of this unbroken line of precedents that firmly reject my Brethren's ill-conceived abstraction can only be regarded as a transparent cover for invalidating a congressional judgment with which they disagree.  [8] The only analysis even remotely resembling that *868 adopted today is found in a line of opinions dealing with the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment that ultimately provoked a constitutional crisis for the Court in the 1930's E. g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238 (1936); United States v. Butler, 297 U. S. 1 (1936); Hammer v. Dagenhart, 247 U. S. 251 (1918).  See Stern, The Commerce Clause and the National Economy, 1933-1946, 59 Harv. L. Rev. 645 (1946).  We tend to forget that the Court invalidated legislation during the Great Depression, not solely under the Due Process Clause, but also and primarily under the Commerce Clause and the Tenth Amendment.  It may have been the eventual abandonment of that overly restrictive construction of the commerce power that spelled defeat for the Courtpacking plan, and preserved the integrity of this institution, id., at 682, see, e. g., United States v. Darby, 312 U. S. 100 (1941); Mulford v. Smith, 307 U. S. 38 (1939); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., 301 U. S. 1 (1937), but my Brethren today are transparently trying to cut back on that recognition of the scope of the commerce power.  My Brethren's approach to this case is not far different from the dissenting opinions in the cases that averted the crisis.  See, e. g., Mulford v. Smith, supra, at 51 (Butler, J., dissenting); NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp., supra, at 76 (McReynolds, J., dissenting).  [9] *869 That no precedent justifies today's result is particularly clear from the awkward extension of the doctrine of state immunity from federal taxationan immunity conclusively distinguished by Mr. Justice Stone in <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> , and an immunity that is "narrowly limited" because "the people of all the states have created the national government and are represented in Congress," Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405, 416 (1938) (Stone, J.) [10] to fashion a judicially enforceable restraint on *870 Congress' exercise of the commerce power that the Court has time and again rejected as having no place in our constitutional jurisprudence.  [11] "[W]here [Congress] *871 keeps within its sphere and violates no express constitutional limitation it has been the rule of this Court, going back almost to the founding days of the Republic, not to interfere." Katzenbach v. McClung, 379 U. S., at 305 .  To argue, as do my Brethren, that the 1974 amendments are directed at the "States qua States," and "displac[e] state policies regarding the manner in which they will structure delivery of those governmental services which their citizens require," ante, at 847, and therefore "directly penaliz[e] the States for choosing to hire governmental employees on terms different from those which Congress has sought to impose," ante, at 849, is only to advance precisely the unsuccessful arguments made by the State of Washington in Case v. Bowles and the State of California in United States v. <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> .  The 1974 amendments are, however, an entirely legitimate exercise of the commerce power, not in the slightest restrained by any doctrine of state sovereignty cognizable in this Court, as Case v. Bowles , United States v. <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> , Maryland v. Wirtz , and our other pertinent precedents squarely and definitively establish.  Moreover, since Maryland v. Wirtz is overruled, the Fair Labor Standards Act is invalidated in its application to all state employees "in [any areas] that the States have regarded as integral parts of their governmental activities." Ante, at 854 n. 18.  This standard is a meaningless limitation on the Court's state-sovereignty doctrine, and thus today's holding goes beyond even what the States of Washington and California urged in Case v. Bowles and United States v. <citedDecision>California</citedDecision> , and by its logic would overrule those cases and with them Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), and certain reasoning in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U. S. 279, 284-285 (1973).  I cannot recall another instance in the Court's history when the reasoning of so many decisions covering so long a span of time has been *872 discarded in such a roughshod manner.  That this is done without any justification not already often advanced and consistently rejected, clearly renders today's decision an ipse dixit reflecting nothing but displeasure with a congressional judgment.  My Brethren's treatment of Fry v. United States, 421 U. S. 542 (1975), further illustrates the paucity of legal reasoning or principle justifying today's result.  Although the Economic Stabilization Act "displace[d] the States' freedom," ante, at 852the reason given for invalidating the 1974 amendmentsthe result in Fry is not disturbed since the interference was temporary and only a national program enforced by the Federal Government could have alleviated the country's economic crisis.  Thus, although my Brethren by fiat strike down the 1974 amendments without analysis of countervailing national considerations, Fry by contrary logic remains undisturbed because, on balance, countervailing national considerations override the interference with the State's freedom.  Moreover, it is sophistry to say the Economic Stabilization Act "displaced no state choices," ante, at 853, but that the 1974 amendments do, ante, at 848.

 It is absurd to suggest that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between curbs against increasing wages and curbs against paying wages lower than the federal minimum.  Today's holding patently is in derogation of the sovereign power of the Nation to regulate interstate commerce.  Can the States engage in businesses competing with the private sector and then come to the courts arguing that withdrawing the employees of those businesses from the private sector evades the power of the Federal Government to regulate commerce?  See New York v. *873 United States, 326 U. S., at 582 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  No principle given meaningful content by my Brethren today precludes the States from doing just that.  Our historic decisions rejecting all suggestions that the States stand in a different position from affected private parties when challenging congressional exercise of the commerce power reflect that very concern.  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968); United States v. California, <citedDecision>297 U. S. 175</citedDecision> (1936).  Fry only last Term emphasized "that States are not immune from all federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status.  " 421 U. S., at 548 (emphasis added).  For "[b]y empowering Congress to regulate commerce.  .  .  the States necessarily surrendered any portion of their sovereignty that would stand in the way of such regulation."

 Mr. Justice Frankfurter noted a distinction between immunities claimed to invalidate state taxes on federal activities and those urged as a basis for rejecting federal taxes.  "The federal government is the government of all the States, and all the States share in the legislative process by which a tax of general applicability is laid." Id., at 577 .  See M`Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405-406 (1819).  He also recognized that immunity in this area had been significantly eroded since it was first used to protect state officials from a federal tax in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871).  See, e. g., Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 (1939), overruling Collector v. Day, supra ; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376 (1938); Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U. S. 123 (1932).  Even more significantly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out that the existence of a state immunity from federal taxation, to the extent that it was based on any vague sovereignty notions, was inconsistent with the holding in United States v. California, <citedDecision>297 U. S. 175</citedDecision> (1936), that state sovereignty does not restrict federal exercise of the commerce power.  326 U. S., at 582 .  [8]  My Brethren's reliance on Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869), and Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869), is puzzling to say the least.  The Brethren make passing reference to the unique historical setting in which those cases were decided, ante, at 844, but pointedly ignore the significance of the events of those days.  During the tenure of Mr. Chief Justice Chase, the War Between the States, fought to preserve the supremacy of the Union, was won; Congress and the States then enacted three constitutional Amendments, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, enlarging federal power and concomitantly contracting the States' power, see Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 345 (1880); and Congress enacted a variety of laws during Reconstruction further restricting state sovereignty.  Texas v. White itself noted that the Constitution empowered Congress to form a new government in a State if the citizens of that State were being denied a republican form of government.  7 Wall., at 729.
