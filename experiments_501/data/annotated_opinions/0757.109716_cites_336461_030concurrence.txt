 .  .  Schwinn’s territorial restrictions requiring dealers to confine their sales to exclusive territories prescribed by Schwinn prevented a dealer from competing for customers outside his territory.  .  .  .  Schwinn’s restrictions guaranteed each wholesale distributor that it would be absolutely isolated from all competition from other Schwinn wholesalers.” <citedDecision>537 F. 2d 980, 989-990</citedDecision> (1976).  Moreover, like its franchised retailers, Schwinn’s distributors were absolutely barred from selling to nonfranchised retailers, further limiting the possibilities of intrabrand price competition.  The majority apparently gives no weight to the Court of Appeals’ reliance on the difference between the competitive effects of Sylvania’s location clause and Schwinn’s interlocking “system of vertical restraints affecting both wholesale and retail distribution.” <citedDecision>Id., at 989</citedDecision> .  It also ignores post-Schwinn *63 decisions of the Third and Tenth Circuits upholding the validity of location clauses similar to Sylvania’s here.  Salco Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 517 F. 2d 567 (CA10 1975) ; Kaiser v. General Motors Corp., 530 F. 2d 964 (CA3 1976), aff’g 396 F. Supp. 33 (ED Pa. 1975).  Finally, many of the scholarly authorities the majority cites in support of its overruling of Schwinn have not had to strain to distinguish location clauses from the restrictions invalidated there.  E. g., Robinson, Recent Antitrust Developments: 1974, 75 Colum. L. Rev. 243 , 278 (1975) (outcome in Sylvania not preordained by Schwinn because of marked differences in the vertical restraints in the two cases); McLaren, Territorial and Customer Restrictions, Consignments, Suggested Retail Prices and Refusals to Deal, 37 Antitrust L. J. 137, 144M45 (1968) (by implication Schwinn exempts location clauses from its per se rule); Pollock, Alternative Distribution Methods After Schwinn, 63 Nw. U. L. Rev. 595 , 603 (1968) (“Nor does the Schwinn doctrine outlaw the use of a so-called ‘location clause’.  .  .”).

 Moreover, the Schwinn brand name enjoyed superior consumer acceptance and commanded a premium price as, in the District Court’s words, “the Cadillac of the bicycle industry.” 237 F. Supp., at 335 .  This premium gave Schwinn dealers a margin of *64 protection from interbrand competition and created the possibilities for price cutting by discounters that the Government argued were forestalled by Schwinn’s customer restrictions.  3 Thus, judged by the criteria economists use to measure market power — -product differentiation and market share 4 — Schwinn enjoyed a substantially stronger position in the bicycle market than did Sylvania in the television market.  This Court relied on Schwinn’s market position as one reason not to apply the rule of reason to the vertical restraints challenged there.  “Schwinn was not a newcomer, seeking to break into or stay in the bicycle business.  It was not a 'failing company.’ On the contrary, at the initiation of these practices, it was the leading bicycle producer in the Nation.” 388 U. S., at 374 .  And the Court of Appeals below found “another significant distinction between our case and Schwinn” in Syl-vania’s “precarious market share,” which “was so small when it adopted its locations practice that it was threatened with expulsion from the television market.” <citedDecision>537 F. 2d, at 991</citedDecision> .  5 *65 In my view there are at least two considerations, both relied upon by the majority to justify overruling Schwinn, that would provide a “principled basis” for instead refusing to extend Schwinn to a vertical restraint that is imposed by a “faltering” manufacturer with a “precarious” position in a generic product market dominated by another firm.  The first is that, as the majority puts it, “when interbrand competition exists, as it does among television manufacturers, it provides a significant check on the exploitation of intrabrand market power because of the ability of consumers to substitute a different brand of the same product.” Ante, at 52 n. 19.  See also ante, at 54.  6 Second is the view, argued forcefully in the economic literature cited by the majority, that the potential benefits of vertical restraints in promoting interbrand competition are particularly strong where the manufacturer imposing the restraints is seeking to enter a new market or to expand a small market share.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> 7 The majority even recognizes that Schwinn “hinted” at an exception for new entrants and failing firms from its per se rule.  Ante, at 53-54, n. 22.  In other areas of antitrust law, this Court has not hesitated to base its rules of per se illegality in part on the defendant’s market power.  Indeed, in the very case from which the majority draws its standard for per se rules, Northern Pac. R. Co. v. United States, 356 U. S. 1, 5 (1958), the *66 Court stated the reach of the per se rule against tie-ins under § 1 of the Sherman Act as extending to all defendants with “sufficient economic power with respect to the tying product to appreciably restrain free competition in the market for the tied product ...” 356 U. S., at 6 .  And the Court subsequently approved an exception to this per se rule for “infant industries” marketing a new product.  United States v. Jerrold Electronics Corp., 187 F. Supp. 545 (ED Pa. 1960), aff’d per curiam, 365 U. S. 567 (1961).  See also United States v. Philadelphia Nat. Bank, 374 U. S. 321, 363 (1963), where the Court held presumptively illegal a merger “which produces a firm controlling an undue percentage share of the relevant market I see no doctrinal obstacle to excluding firms with such minimal market power as Sylvania’s from the reach of the Schwinn rule.

 By contrast, a manufacturer was free to contract with his agents to “[fix] the price by which his agents transfer the title from him directly to [the] consumer .  .  .  however comprehensive as a mass or whole in [the] effect [of these contracts].” Id., at 488 .  Although these two cases have been called into question by subsequent decisions, see United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U. S. 29 (1960), and Simpson v. Union Oil Co., 377 U. S. 13 (1964), their rationale runs through our case law in the area of distributional restraints.  In Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, 340 U. S. 211, 213 (1951), the Court held that an agreement to fix resale prices was per se illegal under § 1 because “such agreements, no less than those to fix minimum prices, cripple the freedom of traders and thereby restrain their ability to sell in accordance with their own judgment.” Accord, Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U. S. 145, 152 (1968).  See generally Judge Browning’s dissent below, <citedDecision>537 F. 2d, at 1018-1022</citedDecision> ; ABA Antitrust Section, Monograph No. 2, Vertical Restrictions Limiting Intrabrand Competition 29-31, 82-83, 87-91, 96-97 (1977); Blake & Jones, Toward a Three-Dimensional Antitrust Policy, 65 Colum. L. Rev. 422 , 427-436 (1965).  After summarily rejecting this concern, reflected in our interpretations of the Sherman Act, for “the autonomy of independent businessmen,” ante, at 53 n. 21, the majority not surprisingly finds “no justification” for Schwinn’s distinction between sale and nonsale transactions because the distinction is “essentially unrelated to any relevant economic impact.” Ante, at 56.  But while according some weight to the business *69 man’s interest in controlling the terms on which he trades in his own goods may be anathema to those who view the Sherman Act as directed solely to economic efficiency, 9 this principle is without question more deeply eHrbeHded'ia our cases than the notions of “free rider” effects and distrmtK tional efficiencies borrowed by the majority from the “new economics of vertical relationships.” Ante, at 54^-57.  Perhaps the Court is right in partially abandoning this principle and in judging the instant nonprice vertical restraints solely by their “relevant economic impact”; but the precedents which reflect this principle should not be so lightly rejected by the Court. The rationale of Schwinn is no doubt difficult to discern from the opinion, and it may be wrong; it is not, however, the aberration the majority makes it out to be here.  I have a further reservation about the majority’s reliance on “relevant economic impact” as the test for retaining per se rules regarding vertical restraints.  It is common ground among the leading advocates of a purely economic approach to the question of distribution restraints that the economic arguments in favor of allowing vertical nonprice restraints generally apply to vertical price restraints as well.  10 Although *70 the majority asserts that “the per se illegality of price restrictions .
