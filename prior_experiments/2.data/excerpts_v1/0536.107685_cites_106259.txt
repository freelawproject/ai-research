Journal of the First Session of the Senate 72; 1 Annals of Congress 76; Brennan, The Bill of Rights and the States, in E. Cahn, The Great Rights 65, 69 (1963); E. Dumbauld, The Bill of Rights 46, 215 (1957). This relatively clear indication that the framers of the Sixth Amendment did not intend its jury trial requirement to bind the States is, of course, of little relevance to interpreting the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted specifically to place limitations upon the States. Cf. Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U.S. 380 (1927); Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652 , 666 (1925). [21] Thompson v. Utah, 170 U.S. 343 , 349-350 (1898), quoting 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States ยง 1779. See also Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717 , 721-722 (1961); United States ex rel. Toth v.

[13] Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U.S. 22 , 31. [14] Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 . The right to counsel was found in the Fourteenth Amendment because, the Court held, it was essential to a fair trial. See 372 U.S. , at 342-345 . [15] Klopfer v. North Carolina, 386 U.S. 213 . [16] Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 . [17] Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717 . [18] The same illogical way of dealing with a Fourteenth Amendment problem was employed in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 , which held that the Due Process Clause guaranteed the protection of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment against state action. I disagreed at that time both with the way the question was framed and with the result the Court reached. See my dissenting opinion, id., at 14. I consider myself bound by the Court's holding in Malloy with respect to self-incrimination. See my concurring opinion in Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609 , 615. I do not think that Malloy held, nor would I consider myself bound by a holding, that every question arising under the Due Process Clause shall be settled by an arbitrary decision whether a clause in the Bill of Rights is "in" or "out." [19] The Court has so held in, e. g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717 . Compare Dennis v. United States, 339 U.S. 162 . [20] E. g., Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U.S. 516 . [21] E. g., Andres v. United States, 333 U.S. 740 . With respect to the common-law number and unanimity requirements, the Court suggests that these present no problem because "our decisions interpreting the Sixth Amendment are always subject to reconsideration. . .

[23] E. g., Callan v. Wilson, 127 U.S. 540 ; District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617 ; District of Columbia v. Colts, 282 U.S. 63 . [24] The precise issue in Maxwell was whether a jury of eight rather than 12 jurors could be employed in criminal prosecutions in Utah. The Court held that this was permissible because the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the States to provide trial by jury at all. The Court seems to think this was dictum. As a technical matter, however, a statement that is critical to the chain of reasoning by which a result is in fact reached does not become dictum simply because a later court can imagine a totally different way of deciding the case. See Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225 U.S. 167 , 176, citing Maxwell for the proposition that "the requirement of due process does not deprive a State of the power to dispense with jury trial altogether." [25] E. g., Irvin v. Dowd, supra, at 721; Fay v. New York, 332 U.S. 261 , 288; Palko v. Connecticut, supra, at 325; Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97 , 105; Brown v. New Jersey, 175 U.S. 172 , 175; Missouri v. Lewis, supra, at 31. [26] E. g., Deady, Trial by Jury, 17 Am. L. Rev. 398, 399-400 (1883): "Still in these days of progress and experiment, when everything is on trial at the bar of human reason or conceit, it is quite the fashion to speak of jury trial as something that has outlived its usefulness. Intelligent and well-meaning people often sneer at it as an awkward and useless impediment to the speedy and correct administration of justice, and a convenient loop-hole for the escape of powerful and popular rogues. Considering the kind of jury trials we sometimes have in the United States, it must be admitted that this criticism is not without foundation."
