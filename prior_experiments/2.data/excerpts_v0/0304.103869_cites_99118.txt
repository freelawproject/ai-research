 It is unnecessary to consider the state's argument that Congress is without power to exempt these estates from taxation. This issue is not foreclosed by Board of Commissioners v. Seber, 18 U.S. 705, 63 S.Ct. 920, 87 L.Ed. —-, decided this term, since there we decided no more than that Congress might authorize the exemption of certain Indian lands from taxation because of an historic policy in respect to those lands. Cf. McCurdy v. United States, <targetCase>246 U.S. 263</targetCase>, 269, <targetCase>38 S.Ct. 289</targetCase>, 291, 62 L.Ed. 706.
Choate v. Trapp, 224 U.S. 665, 32 S.Ct. 565, 56 L.Ed. 941, holding that under certain circumstances the United States could not withdraw a tax exemption once assured, has no bearing on the instant problem since it is conceded that the question here is entirely one of what Congress has in fact directed.

 It must not be assumed that the Oklahoma Indians are all unable to pay estate taxes. The estates of the three Indians here involved, as has been noted, total well over $1,200,000. Oil  nd gas receipts of the Five Civilized Tribes from 1904 to 1937 were in excess of one hundred million dollars. Hearing on S. Res. 168, Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, 75th Cong., 3rd Sess., p. 36. The Osages in the same period received $261,000,000, p. 34. Annual per capita income for the Osage Tribe as shown by a careful study made in 1928 was $19,119. The Problem of Indian Administration, Institute for Government Research, Lewis Meriam, Director, chapter 10, General Economic Conditions, 430, 450. 2,826 Osage Indians are reported to own tribal and individual property valued at $31,968,000, p. 443. The economic status of the Osages is discussed in McCurdy v. United States, <targetCase>246 U.S. 263</targetCase>, 265, <targetCase>38 S.Ct. 289</targetCase>, 62 L.Ed. 706.
For a discussion of the respected position of Indians in Oklahoma, see the dissenting opinion of Judge Williams, Board of County Commissioners v. Seber, 10 Cir., 130 F.2d 663, 681—683. The 1933 Act discussed above was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Congressman Hastings of Oklahoma, who was himself of Indian descent.

 'The view of the survey staff is that the Indians must be educated to pay taxes just as they must be educated to do other things. The taxes imposed upon them must always be properly related to their capacity to pay. For them an income tax would be infinitely better than a general property tax because of its direct relationship to their capacity to pay. The returns from such a tax would obviously be extremely small at the outset, but they would increase with the increasing productivity of the Indians.'
