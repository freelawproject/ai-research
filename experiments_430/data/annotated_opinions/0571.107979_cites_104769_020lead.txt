 This rule rests upon the desirability of having magistrates rather than police officers determine when searches and seizures are permissible and what limitations should be placed upon such activities.  ... To provide the necessary security against unreasonable intrusions upon the private lives of *759 individuals, the framers of the Fourth Amendment required adherence to judicial processes wherever possible.  And subsequent history has confirmed the wisdom of that requirement.  “A search or seizure without a warrant as an incident to a lawful arrest has always been considered to be a strictly limited right.  It grows out of the inherent necessities of the situation at the time of the arrest.  But there must be something more in the way of necessity than merely a lawful arrest.” Id., at 705, 708 .  In 1950, two years after Trupiano, 3 came United States v. Rabinowitz, <citedDecision>339 U. S. 56</citedDecision> , the decision upon which California primarily relies in the case now before us.  In <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> , federal authorities had been informed that the defendant was dealing in stamps bearing forged overprints.  On the basis of that information they secured a warrant for his arrest, which they executed at his one-room business office.  At the time of the arrest, the officers “searched the desk, safe, and file cabinets in the office for about an hour and a half,” <citedDecision>id., at 59</citedDecision> , and seized 573 stamps with forged overprints.  The stamps were admitted into evidence at the defendant’s trial, and this Court affirmed his conviction, rejecting the contention that the warrantless search had been unlawful.  The Court held that the search in its entirety fell within the principle giving law enforcement authorities “[t]he right 'to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime ....’” <citedDecision>Id., at 61</citedDecision> .  Harris was regarded as “ample authority” for that conclusion.  Id., at 63.  The opinion rejected the rule of Trupiano that “in seizing goods and articles, law enforcement agents must secure and use search war *760 rants wherever reasonably practicable.” The test, said the Court, “is not whether it is reasonable to procure a search warrant, but whether the search was reasonable.” Id., at 66.  <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> has come to stand for the proposition, inter alia, that a warrantless search “incident to a lawful arrest” may generally extend to the area that is considered to be in the “possession” or under the “control” of the person arrested.  4 And it was on the basis of that proposition that the California courts upheld the search of the petitioner’s entire house in this case. That doctrine, however, at least in the broad sense in which it was applied by the California courts in this case, can withstand neither historical nor rational analysis.  Even limited to its own facts, the <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> decision was, as we have seen, hardly founded on an unimpeachable line of authority.  As Mr. Justice Frankfurter commented in dissent in that case, the “hint” contained in Weeks was, without persuasive justification, “loosely turned into dictum and finally elevated to a decision.” <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 76</citedDecision> .  And the approach taken in cases such as Go-Bart, Lefkowitz, and Trupiano was essentially disregarded by the <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> Court. Nor is the rationale by which the State seeks here to sustain the search of the petitioner’s house supported by a reasoned view of the background and purpose of the Fourth Amendment.  Mr. Justice Frankfurter wisely pointed out in his <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> dissent that the Amendment’s proscription of “unreasonable searches and sei *761 zures” must be read in light of “the history that gave rise to the words” — a history of “abuses so deeply felt by the Colonies as to be one of the potent causes of the Revolution .  .  .  .” <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 69</citedDecision> .  The Amendment was in large part a reaction to the general warrants and war-rantless searches that had so alienated the colonists and had helped speed the movement for independence.  5 In the scheme of the Amendment, therefore, the requirement that “no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause,” plays a crucial part.  As the Court put it in McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 : “We are not dealing with formalities.  The presence of a search warrant serves a high function.  Absent some grave emergency, the Fourth Amendment has interposed a magistrate between the citizen and the police.  This was done not to shield criminals nor to make the home a safe haven for illegal activities.

 But that argument is founded on little more than a subjective view regarding the acceptability of certain sorts of police *765 conduct, and not on considerations relevant to Fourth Amendment interests.  Under such an unconfined analysis, Fourth Amendment protection in this area would approach the evaporation point.  It is not easy to explain why, for instance, it is less subjectively “reasonable” to search a man’s house when he is arrested on his front lawn — or just down the street — than it is when he happens to be in the house at the time of arrest.  10 As Mr. Justice Frankfurter put it: “To say that the search must be reasonable is to require some criterion of reason.  It is no guide at all either for a jury or for district judges or the police to say that an 'unreasonable search’ is forbidden— that the search must be reasonable.  What is the test of reason which makes a search reasonable?  The test is the reason underlying and expressed by the Fourth Amendment: the history and the experience which it embodies and the safeguards afforded by it against the evils to which it was a response.” United States v. Rabinowitz, <citedDecision>339 U. S., at 83</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  Thus, although “[t]he recurring questions of the reasonableness of searches” depend upon “the facts and circumstances — -the total atmosphere of the case,” <citedDecision>id., at 63, 66</citedDecision> (opinion of the Court), those facts and circumstances must be viewed in the light of established Fourth Amendment principles.  *766 It would be possible, of course, to draw a line between <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> and Harris on the one hand, and this case on the other.  For <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> involved a single room, and Harris a four-room apartment, while in the case before us an entire house was searched.  But such a distinction would be highly artificial.  The rationale that allowed the searches and seizures in <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> and Harris would allow the searches and seizures in this case. No consideration relevant to the Fourth Amendment suggests any point of rational limitation, once the search is allowed to go beyond the area from which the person arrested might obtain weapons or evidentiary items.  11 The only reasoned distinction is one between a search of the person arrested and the area within his reach on the one hand, and more extensive searches on the other.  12 *767 The petitioner correctly points out that one result of decisions such as <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> and Harris is to give law enforcement officials the opportunity to engage in searches not justified by probable cause, by the simple expedient of arranging to arrest suspects at home rather than elsewhere.  We do not suggest that the petitioner is necessarily correct in his assertion that such a strategy was utilized here, 13 but the fact remains that had he been arrested earlier in the day, at his place of employment rather than at home, no search of his house could have been made without a search warrant.  In any event, even apart from the possibility of such police tactics, the general point so forcefully made by Judge Learned Hand in United States v. Kirschenblatt, 16 F. 2d 202 , remains: “After arresting a man in his house, to rummage at will among his papers in search of whatever will convict him, appears to us to be indistinguishable from what might be done under a general warrant; indeed, the warrant would give more protection, for presumably it must be issued by a magistrate.  True, by hypothesis the power would not exist, if the supposed offender were not found on the prem *768 ises; but it is small consolation to know that one’s papers are safe only so long as one is not at home.” Id., at 203 .  <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> and Harris have been the subject of critical commentary for many years, 14 and have been relied upon less and less in our own decisions.  15 It is time, for the reasons we have stated, to hold that on their own facts, and insofar as the principles they stand for are inconsistent with those that we have endorsed today, they are no longer to be followed.  Application of sound Fourth Amendment principles to the facts of this case produces a clear result.  The search here went far beyond the petitioner’s person and the area from within which he might have obtained either a weapon or something that could have been used as evidence against him.  There was no constitutional justification, in the absence of a search warrant, for extending the search beyond that area.  The scope of the search was, therefore, “unreasonable” under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, and the petitioner’s conviction cannot stand.  16 Reversed.  The affidavit supporting the warrant is set out in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, 61 Cal. Rptr., at 715-716, n. 1, and the State does not challenge its insufficiency under the principles of Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U. S. 108 , and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U. S. 410 .  The Court assumed that the arrests were lawful.  282 U. S., at 356 .  See also McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451 .  Decisions of this Court since <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> have applied the abstract doctrine of that case to various factual situations with divergent results.  Compare Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 42 ; Abel v. United States, 362 U. S. 217 ; and Draper v. United States, 358 U. S. 307 , with Kremen v. United States, 353 U. S. 346 (per curiam).  Cf. Chapman v. United States, 365 U. S. 610 ; Jones v. United States, 357 U. S. 493, 499-500 .  See generally Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616, 624-625 ; Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383, 389-391 ; Davis v. United States, 328 U. S. 582, 603-605 (dissenting opinion); Harris v. United States, 331 U. S. 145, 157-162 (dissenting opinion); Stanford v. Texas, 379 U. S. 476, 481-482 .  See also Davis v. Mississippi, 394 U. S. 721, 728 ; Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 356-358 ; Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 299 ; Preston v. United States, 376 U. S. 364, 367 .  Our Sibron opinion dealt with two cases. We refer here to No. 63, involving the appellant Sibron.  See infra, at 764.  See Katz v. United States, 389 U. S. 347, 357-358 .  Our holding today is of course entirely consistent with the recognized principle that, assuming the existence of probable cause, automobiles and other vehicles may be searched without warrants “where it is not practicable to secure a warrant because the vehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.” Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 153 ; see Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160 .  Some courts have carried the <citedDecision>Rabinowitz</citedDecision> approach to just such lengths.  See, e. g., Clifton v. United States, 224 F. 2d 329 (C. A. 4th Cir.), cert. denied, 350 U. S. 894 (purchaser of illicit whiskey arrested in back yard of seller; search of one room of house sustained); United States v. Jackson, 149 F. Supp. 937 (D. C. D. C.), rev’d on other grounds, 102 U. S. App. D. C. 109, 250 F. 2d 772 (suspect arrested half a block from his rented room; search of room upheld).  But see James v. Louisiana, 382 U. S. 36 (per curiam).  Cf. Mr. Justice Jackson’s dissenting comment in Harris : “The difficulty with this problem for me is that once the search is allowed to go beyond the person arrested and the objects upon him or in his immediate physical control, I see no practical limit short of that set in the opinion of the Court — and that means to me no limit at all.” 331 U. S., at 197 .  It is argued in dissent that so long as there is probable cause to search the place where an arrest occurs, a search of that place should be permitted even though no search warrant has been obtained.  This position seems to be based principally on two premises: first, that once an arrest has been made, the additional invasion of privacy stemming from the accompanying search is “relatively minor”; and second, that the victim of the search may “shortly thereafter” obtain a judicial determination of whether the search was justified by probable cause.  With respect to the second premise, one may initially question whether all of the States in fact provide the speedy suppression procedures the dissent assumes.
