**Lead Opinion**
 Cf. United States v. Carotene Products Co., 304 U. S. 144 , 152, n. 4 (1938).  Rather, South Carolina argues that the political process failed here because § 310(b)(1) was “imposed by the vote of an uninformed Congress relying upon incomplete information.” Brief for Plaintiff 101.  7 But nothing in Garcia or the Tenth Amendment authorizes courts to second-guess the substantive basis for congressional legislation.  Cf. Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 449 U. S. 456, 464 (1981).  Where, as here, the national political process did not operate in a defective manner, the Tenth Amendment is not implicated.  B The NGA argues that § 310 is invalid because it commandeers the state legislative and administrative process by coercing States into enacting legislation authorizing bond registration and into administering the registration scheme.  They cite FERC v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 742</citedDecision> (1982), which left open the possibility that the Tenth Amendment might set some limits on Congress’ power to compel States to regulate on behalf of federal interests, <citedDecision>id., at 761-764</citedDecision> .  The extent to which the Tenth Amendment claim left open in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> survives Garcia or poses constitutional limitations independent of those discussed in Garcia is far from clear.  We need not, however, address that issue because we find the claim discussed in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> inapplicable to § 310.  *514 The federal statute at issue in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> required state utility commissions to do the following: (1) adjudicate and enforce federal standards, (2) either consider adopting certain federal standards or cease regulating public utilities, and (3) follow certain procedures.  The Court in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> first distinguished National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), noting that the statute in National League of Cities presented questions concerning “the extent to which state sovereignty shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations,” whereas the statute in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> “attempts to use state regulatory machinery to advance federal goals.” FERC, <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 759</citedDecision> .  The Court in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> then concluded that, whatever constitutional limitations might exist on the federal power to compel state regulatory activity, Congress had the power to require that state adjudicative bodies adjudicate federal issues and to require that States regulating in a pre-emptible field consider suggested federal standards and follow federally mandated procedures.  <citedDecision>Id., at 759-767</citedDecision> .  Because, by hypothesis, § 310 effectively prohibits issuing unregistered bonds, it presents the very situation <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> distinguished from a commandeering of state regulatory machinery: the extent to which the Tenth Amendment “shields the States from generally applicable federal regulations.” <citedDecision>456 U. S., at 759</citedDecision> .  Section 310 regulates state activities; it does not, as did the statute in <citedDecision>FERC</citedDecision> , seek to control or influence the manner in which States regulate private parties.  The NGA nonetheless contends that § 310 has commandeered the state legislative and administrative process because many state legislatures had to amend a substantial number of statutes in order to issue bonds in registered form and because state officials had to devote substantial effort to determine how best to implement a registered bond system.  Such “commandeering” is, however, an inevitable consequence of regulating a state activity.  Any federal regulation demands compliance.  That a State washing to engage in cer *515 tain activity must take administrative and sometimes legislative action to comply with federal standards regulating that activity is a commonplace that presents no constitutional defect.  After Garcia , for example, several States and municipalities had to take administrative and legislative action to alter the employment practices or raise the funds necessary to comply with the wage and overtime provisions of the Federal Labor Standards Act.  8 Indeed, even the pre-Garcia line of Tenth Amendment cases recognized that Congress could constitutionally impose federal requirements on States that States could meet only by amending their statutes.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Justice Stevens, concurring. Although the Court properly finds support for its holding in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, *528 469 U. S. 528 (1985), the outcome of this case was equally clear well before that case was decided. See South Carolina v. Regan, 465 U. S. 367, 403-419 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It should be emphasized, however, that neither the Court’s decision today, nor what I have written in the past, expresses any opinion about the wisdom of taxing the interest on bonds issued by state or local governments.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice O’Connor, dissenting. The Court today overrules a precedent that it has honored for nearly 100 years and expresses a willingness to cancel the constitutional immunity that traditionally has shielded the interest paid on state and local bonds from federal taxation. Henceforth the ability of state and local governments to finance their activities will depend in part on whether Congress voluntarily abstains from tapping this permissible source of additional income tax revenue. I believe that state autonomy is an important factor to be considered in reviewing the National Government’s exercise of its enumerated powers. Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 581 (1985) (O’Connor, J., joined by Powell and Rehnquist, JJ., dissenting). I dissent from the decision to overrule Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429 (1895), and I would invalidate Congress’ attempt to regulate the sovereign States by threatening to deprive them of this tax immunity, which would increase their dependence on the National Government. Section 310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), 26 U. S. C. § 103 (j)(1), provides that the interest paid on state and local bonds will be subject to federal income tax unless the bonds are issued in registered form. The Court readily concludes that Congress could have prohibited outright the issuance of bearer bonds without violating the Tenth Amendment. Ante, at 511-513. But regardless of whether Congress could have required registration of the bonds directly under its commerce power, I agree with the Court that Congress may not accomplish the same end by an unconstitutional means. Ante, at 515-516. *531 In my view, the Tenth Amendment and principles of federalism inherent in the Constitution prohibit Congress from taxing or threatening to tax the interest paid on state and municipal bonds. It is also arguable that the States’ autonomy is protected from substantial federal incursions by virtue of the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution, Art. IV, § 4. See Merritt, The Guarantee Clause and State Autonomy: Federalism for a Third Century, 88 Colum. L. Rev. 1 , 70-78 (1988) (arguing that judicial enforcement of the Guarantee Clause is proper). The Court never expressly considers whether federal taxation of state and local bond interest violates the Constitution. Instead, the majority characterizes the federal tax exemption for state and local bond interest as an aspect of intergovernmental tax immunity, and it describes the decline of the intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine in this century. But constitutional principles do not depend upon the rise or fall of particular legal doctrines. This Court has a continuing responsibility “to oversee the Federal Government’s compliance with its duty to respect the legitimate interests of the States.” Garcia, supra, at 581 (O’Connor, J., joined by Powell and Rehnquist, JJ., dissenting). In my view, the Court shirks its responsibility because it fails to inquire into the substantial adverse effects on state and local governments that would follow from federal taxation of the interest on state and local bonds. Long-term debt obligations are an essential source of funding for state and local governments. In 1974, state and local governments issued approximately $23 billion of new municipal bonds; in 1984, they issued $102 billion of new bonds. Report of Special Master 20. State and local governments rely heavily on borrowed funds to finance education, road construction, and utilities, among other purposes. As the Court recognizes, States will have to increase the interest rates they pay on bonds by 28-35% if the interest is subject to the federal income tax. Ante, at 511. Governmental op *532 erations will be hindered severely if the cost of capital rises by one-third. If Congress may tax the interest paid on state and local bonds, it may strike at the very heart of state and local government activities. In the pivotal cases which first set limits to intergovernmental tax immunity, this Court paid close attention to the practical effects of its decisions. The Court limited the government’s immunity only after it determined that application of a tax would not substantially affect government operations. Thus in the first case to uphold federal income taxation of revenue earned by a state contractor, this Court observed that “neither government may destroy the other nor curtail in any substantial manner the exercise of its powers.” Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, 269 U. S. 514, 523-524 (1926). When this Court extended its holding to the case of a state tax on a federal contractor, it expressly noted that the tax “does not interfere in any substantial way with the performance of federal functions.” James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134, 161 (1937). In upholding the application of the federal income tax to income derived from a state lease, this Court decided that mere theoretical concerns about interference with the functions of government did not justify immunity, but that “[rjegard must be had to substance and direct effects.” Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376, 386 (1938). In Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S. 405 (1938), this Court upheld the application of the federal income tax to income earned by a state employee, because there is “[no] immunity when the burden on the state is so speculative and uncertain that if allowed it would restrict the federal taxing power without affording any corresponding tangible protection to the state government.” Id., at 419-420 . The instant case differs critically from the cases quoted above because the Special Master found that, if the interest on state and local bonds is taxed, the cost of borrowing by state and local governments would rise substantially. This *533 certainly would affect seriously state and local government operations. The majority is unconcerned with this difference because it is satisfied with the formal test of intergovernmental tax immunity that can be distilled from later cases. Under this test, if a tax is not imposed directly on the government, and does not discriminate against the government, then it does not violate intergovernmental tax immunity. See ante, at 523. I do not think the Court’s bipartite test adequately accommodates the constitutional concerns raised by the prospect of applying the federal income tax to the interest paid on state and local bonds. This Court has a duty to inquire into the devastating effects that such an innovation would have on state and local governments. Although Congress has taken a relatively less burdensome step in subjecting only income from bearer bonds to federal taxation, the erosion of state sovereignty is likely to occur a step at a time. “If there is any danger, it lies in the tyranny of small decisions —in the prospect that Congress will nibble away at state sovereignty, bit by bit, until someday essentially nothing is left but a gutted shell.” L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 381 (2d ed. 1988). Federal taxation of state activities is inherently a threat to state sovereignty. As Chief Justice Marshall observed long ago, “the power to tax involves the power to destroy.” McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431 (1819). Justice Holmes later qualified this principle, observing that “[t]he power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.” Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U. S. 218, 223 (1928) (Holmes, J., joined by Brandéis and Stone, JJ., dissenting). If this Court is the States’ sole protector against the threat of crushing taxation, it must take seriously its responsibility to sit in judgment of federal tax initiatives. • I do not think that the Court has lived up to its constitutional role in this case. The Court has failed to enforce the constitutional safeguards of state autonomy and *534 self-sufficiency that may be found in the Tenth Amendment and the Guarantee Clause, as well as in the principles of federalism implicit in the Constitution. I respectfully dissent.

 JUSTICE KENNEDY took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. JUSTICE STEVENS, concurring.  Although the Court properly finds support for its holding in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, *528 469 U. S. 528 (1985), the outcome of this case was equally clear well before that case was decided.  See South Carolina v. Regan, 465 U.

It should be emphasized, however, that neither the Court's decision today, nor what I have written in the past, expresses any opinion about the wisdom of taxing the interest on bonds issued by state or local governments.  JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  I join in the Court's judgment, and in its opinion except for Part II.  I do not join the latter because, as observed by THE CHIEF JUSTICE, post, at 529-530, it unnecessarily casts doubt upon FERC v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 742</citedDecision> (1982), and because it misdescribes the holding in Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985).  I do not read Garcia as adopting  in fact I read it as explicitly disclaiming  the proposition attributed to it in today's opinion, ante, at 512-513, that the "national political process" is the States' only constitutional protection, and that nothing except the demonstration of "some extraordinary defects" in the operation of that process can justify judicial relief.  We said in Garcia : "These cases do not require us to identify or define what affirmative limits the constitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce Clause.  See Coyle v. Oklahoma, 221 U. S. 559 (1911)." 469 U. S., at 556 (emphasis added).  I agree only that that structure does not prohibit what the Federal Government has done here.  CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, concurring in the judgment.
**Combined Opinion**
 Most notably, the Special Master found that the registration requirements have had no substantive effect on the abilities of States to raise debt capital, on the political processes by which States decide to issue debt, or on the power of the States to choose the purpose to which they will dedicate the proceeds of their tax-exempt borrowing.  After an exhaustive investigation, the Special Master summarized: "TEFRA has not changed how much the States borrow, for what purposes they borrow, how they decide to borrow, or any other obviously important aspect of the borrowing process." Report of Special Master 118.  This well-supported conclusion that § 310(b)(1) has had a de minimis impact on the States should end, rather than begin, the Court's constitutional inquiry.  Even the more expansive conception of the Tenth Amendment espoused in National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U. S. 833 (1976), recognized that only congressional action that "operate[s] to directly displace the States' freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions," runs afoul of the authority granted Congress.  Id., at 852 .  The Special Master determined that no such displacement has occurred through the implementation of the TEFRA requirements; I see no need to go further, as the majority does, to discuss the possibility of defects in the national political process that spawned TEFRA, nor to hypothesize that the Tenth Amendment *530 concerns voiced in FERC v. Mississippi, <citedDecision>456 U. S. 742</citedDecision> (1982), may not have survived Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985).  Those issues, intriguing as they may be, are of no moment in the present case and are best left unaddressed until clearly presented.  JUSTICE O'CONNOR, dissenting.  The Court today overrules a precedent that it has honored for nearly 100 years and expresses a willingness to cancel the constitutional immunity that traditionally has shielded the interest paid on state and local bonds from federal taxation.
