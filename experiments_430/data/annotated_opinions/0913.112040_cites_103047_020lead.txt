 .  .  .” Id., at 487 .  See also James v. Dravo Contracting Co., 302 U. S. 134, 160 (1937) (the fact that a tax on a Government contractor “may increase the cost to the Government.  .  .  would not invalidate the tax”); Helvering v. Gerhardt, <citedDecision>304 U. S. 405, 424</citedDecision> (1938).  The thoroughness with which the Court abandoned the burden theory was demonstrated most emphatically when the Court upheld a state sales tax imposed on a Government *521 contractor even though the financial burden of the tax was entirely passed on, through a cost-plus contract, to the Federal Government.  Alabama v. King & Boozer, 314 U. S. 1 (1941).  The Court stated: “The Government, rightly we think, disclaims any contention that the Constitution, unaided by Congressional legislation, prohibits a tax exacted from the contractors merely because it is passed on economically, by the terms of the contract or otherwise, as part of the construction cost to the Government.  So far as such a nondiscriminatory state tax upon the contractor enters into the cost of the materials to the Government, that is but a normal incident of the organization within the same territory of two independent taxing sovereignties.  The asserted right of the one to be free of taxation by the other does not spell immunity from paying the added costs, attributable to the taxation of those who furnish supplies to the Government and who have been granted no tax immunity.  So far as a different view has prevailed, we think it no longer tenable.” Id., at 8-9 (citations omitted).

 We see no reason, however, why *517 South Carolina cannot bring a facial challenge to § 310 rather than an as-applied challenge.  Income indirectly derived from a contract with the government was treated differently.  See, e. g., Willcuts v. Bunn, 282 U. S. 216, 227-230 (1931) (constitutional to tax capital gain on sale of state bond because State not a party to the sale contract); see also Greiner v. Lewellyn, 258 U. S. 384 (1922) (constitutional to tax transfer of estate even though state bonds are included in determining the value of the estate).  The sources of the state and federal immunities are, of course, different: the state immunity arises from the constitutional structure and a concern for protecting state sovereignty whereas the federal immunity arises from the Supremacy Clause.  The immunities have also differed somewhat in their underlying political theory and in their doctrinal contours.  Many of this Court’s opinions have suggested that the Constitution should be in *519 terpreted to confer a greater tax immunity on the Federal Government than on States because all the people of the States are represented in the Federal Government whereas all the people of the Federal Government are not represented in individual States.  Helvering v. Gerhardt, <citedDecision>304 U. S. 405, 412</citedDecision> (1938); McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 435-436 (1819); New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572, 577 , and n. 3 (1946) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  In fact, the federal tax immunity has always been greater than the States’ immunity.  The Federal Government, for example, possesses the power to enact statutes immunizing those with whom it deals from state taxation even if intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine would not otherwise confer an immunity.  See, e. g., Graves v. New York ex rel. O’Keefe, 306 U. S. 466, 478 (1939).  The States lack any such power.  Also, although the Federal Government has always enjoyed blanket immunity from any state tax considered to be “on” the Government under the prevailing methodology, the States have never enjoyed immunity from all federal taxes considered to be “on” a State.  See infra, at 523, and n. 14.  To some, Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528 (1985), may suggest further limitations on state tax immunity.  We need not, however, decide here the extent to which the scope of the federal and state immunities differ or the extent, if any, to which States are currently immune from direct nondiscriminatory federal taxation.  It is enough for our purposes that federal and state tax immunity cases have always shared the identical methodology for determining whether a tax is “on” a government, and that this identity has persisted even though the methodology for both federal and state immunities has changed as intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine shifted into the modern era.  See Graves, supra, at 485 .  Prior to that the Court had already confined Collector v. Day to its facts in Helvering v. Gerhardt, <citedDecision>304 U. S. 405</citedDecision> (1938), which upheld the constitutionality of a federal tax on the salaries of state employees involved in state construction projects.  South Carolina and the Government Finance Officers Association as amicus curiae argue that the legislative history of the Sixteenth Amendment, which authorizes Congress to “collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment,” manifests an intent to freeze into the Constitution the tax immunity for state bond interest that existed in 1913.  We disagree.  The legislative history merely shows that the words “from whatever source derived” of the Sixteenth Amendment were not affirmatively intended to authorize Congress to tax state bond interest or to have any other effect on which incomes were subject to federal taxation, and that the sole purpose of the Sixteenth Amendment was to remove the apportionment requirement for whichever incomes were otherwise taxable.  45 Cong. Rec. 2245-2246 (1910); id., at 2539; see also Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. Co., 240 U. S. 1, 17-18 (1916).  Indeed, if *523 the Sixteenth Amendment had frozen into the Constitution all the tax immunities that existed in 1913, then most of modern intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine would be invalid.  All federal activities are immune from direct state taxation, see Graves, 306 U. S., at 477 , but at least some state activities have always been subject to direct federal taxation.

 See n. 11, supra. For our purposes, the important principle New York reaffirms is that the issue whether a nondiscriminatory federal tax might nonetheless violate state tax immunity does not even arise unless the Federal Government seeks to collect the tax directly from a State.  South Carolina distinguishes the taxes by arguing that the interest paid to a State’s bondholders is more essential to the maintenance of a state government than the salaries paid to employees.  This strikes us as counterintuitive in fact.  More importantly, the essential/nonessential distinction it invokes is exactly the type of distinction we concluded was unworkable in Garcia, 469 U. S., at 542-547 (rejecting rules of state immunity turning on whether a governmental function is “essential,” “governmental” versus “proprietary,” “traditional,” “uniquely governmental,” “necessary,” or “integral”).  “ ‘There is not, and there cannot be, any unchanging line of demarcation between essential and non-essential governmental functions.  Many governmental functions of today have at some time in the past been nongovernmental.  The genius of our government provides that, within the sphere of constitutional action, the people — acting not through the courts but through their elected legislative representatives — have the power to determine as conditions demand, what services and functions the public welfare requires.’” Id., at 546 , quoting Gerhardt, <citedDecision>304 U. S., at 427</citedDecision> (Black, J., concurring).  Similarly, Justice O’Connor would have us judge the constitutionality of each tax imposing an indirect burden on state and local governments by determining whether the tax had “substantial” adverse effects on those governments.  Post, at 531-533.  We fail to see how this substantiality test distinguishes taxes on state bond interest from taxes on state employees’ salaries.  More importantly, we disagree -with Justice O’Connor’s apparent assumption that if this Court does not undertake the open-ended and administratively daunting inquiry required by her test, we leave *526 States at the mercy of a congressional power to destroy them via excessive taxation.  Post, at 533-534.  The nondiscrimination principle at the heart of modern intergovernmental tax immunity case law does not leave States unprotected from excessive federal taxation — it merely recognizes that the best safeguard against excessive taxation (and the most judicially manageable) is the requirement that the government tax in a nondiscriminatory fashion.
