**Combined Opinion**
 Petitioners pleaded not guilty and offered in evidence exemplified copies of the Nevada proceedings, contending that the divorce decrees and the Nevada marriage were valid in North Carolina as well as in Nevada.  The State contended that since neither of the defendants in the Nevada actions was served in Nevada nor entered an appearance there, the Nevada decrees would not be recognized as valid in North Carolina.  On this issue the court charged the jury in substance that *291 a Nevada divorce decree based on substituted service where the defendant made no appearance would not be recognized in North Carolina, under the rule of Pridgen v. Pridgen, 203 N.C. 533 , 166 S.E. 591 .  The State further contended that petitioners went to Nevada not to establish a bona fide residence but solely for the purpose of taking advantage of the laws of that State to obtain a divorce through fraud upon that court. On that issue the court charged the jury that, under the rule of State v. Herron, 175 N.C. 754 , 94 S.E. 698 , the defendants had the burden of satisfying the jury, but not beyond a reasonable doubt, of the bona fides of their residence in Nevada for the required time.  Petitioners excepted to these charges.  The Supreme Court of North Carolina in affirming the judgment held that North Carolina was not required to recognize the Nevada decrees under the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution (Art. IV, § 1) by reason of Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U.S. 562 .  The intimation in the majority opinion (220 N.C. pp. 460-464) that the Nevada divorces were collusive suggests that the second theory on which the State tried the case may have been an alternative ground for the decision below, adequate to sustain the judgment under the rule of Bell v. Bell, <citedDecision>181 U.S. 175</citedDecision>  a case in which this Court held that a decree of divorce was not entitled to full faith and credit when it had been granted on constructive service by the courts of a state in which neither spouse was domiciled.  But there are two reasons why we do not reach that issue in this case. In the first place, North Carolina does not seek to sustain the judgment below on that ground.  Moreover it admits that there probably is enough evidence in the record to require that petitioners be considered "to have been actually domiciled in Nevada." In the second place, the verdict against petitioners was a general one.  Hence, even though the doctrine of <citedDecision>Bell</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bell, supra</citedDecision> , were to be deemed applicable here, we cannot determine on this record *292 that petitioners were not convicted on the other theory on which the case was tried and submitted, viz. the invalidity of the Nevada decrees because of Nevada's lack of jurisdiction over the defendants in the divorce suits.  That is to say, the verdict of the jury for all we know may have been rendered on that ground alone, since it did not specify the basis on which it rested.  It therefore follows here as in Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 368 , that if one of the grounds for conviction is invalid under the Federal Constitution, the judgment cannot be sustained.  No reason has been suggested why the rule of the Stromberg case is inapplicable here.  Nor has any reason been advanced why the rule of the Stromberg case is not both appropriate and necessary for the protection of rights of the accused.  To say that a general verdict of guilty should be upheld though we cannot know that it did not rest on the invalid constitutional ground on which the case was submitted to the jury, would be to countenance a procedure which would cause a serious impairment of constitutional rights.  Accordingly, we cannot avoid meeting the Haddock v. Haddock issue in this case by saying that the petitioners acquired no bona fide domicil in Nevada.  If the case had been tried and submitted on that issue only, we would have quite a different problem, as <citedDecision>Bell</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bell</citedDecision> indicates.  We have no occasion to meet that issue now and we intimate no opinion on it.  However it might be resolved in another proceeding, we cannot evade the constitutional issue in this case on the easy assumption that petitioners' domicil in Nevada was a sham and a fraud.  Rather, we must treat the present case for the purpose of the limited issue before us precisely the same as if petitioners had resided in Nevada for a term of years and had long ago acquired a permanent abode there.  In other words, we would reach the question whether North Carolina could refuse to recognize the Nevada decrees because, in its view and contrary to *293 the findings of the Nevada court, petitioners had no actual, bona fide domicil in Nevada, if and only if we concluded that Haddock v. Haddock was correctly decided.  But we do not think it was.  The Haddock case involved a suit for separation and alimony, brought in New York by the wife on personal service of the husband.

 *308 MR. JUSTICE MURPHY: I dissent because the Court today introduces an undesirable rigidity in the application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause to a problem which is of acute interest to all the states of the Union and on which they hold varying and sharply divergent views, the problem of how they shall treat the marriage relation.  This case cannot be considered as one involving the Constitution alone; rather the case involves the interaction of public policy upon the Constitution.  This is not to say that our function is to become censors of public morals and decide this case in accordance with what we may think is the wisest rule for society with respect to divorce.  But the question of public policy enters to this degree  marriage and the family have generally been regarded as basic components of our national life, and the solution of the problems engendered by the marital relation, the formulation of standards of public morality in connection therewith, and the supervision of domestic (in the sense of family) affairs, have been left to the individual states.  Each state has the deepest concern for its citizens in those matters, and, concomitantly with that concern, it exercises the widest control over marriage, determining how it is to be solemnized, the attendant obligations, and how it may be dissolved.  When a conflict arises between the divergent policies of two states in this area of legitimate governmental concern, as here, this Court should give appropriate consideration to the interests of each state.  In recognition of the paramount interest of the state of domicile over the marital status of its citizens, this Court has held that actual good faith domicile of at least one party is essential to confer authority and jurisdiction on the courts of a state to render a decree of divorce that will be entitled to extraterritorial effect under the *309 Full Faith and Credit Clause, Bell v. Bell, <citedDecision>181 U.S. 175</citedDecision> , even though both parties personally appear, Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U.S. 14 .  When the doctrine of those cases is applied to the facts of this one, the question becomes a simple one: Did petitioners acquire a bona fide domicile in Nevada?  I agree with my brother Jackson that the only proper answer on the record is, no. North Carolina is the state in which petitioners have their roots, the state to which they immediately returned after a brief absence just sufficient to achieve their purpose under Nevada's requirements.  It follows that the Nevada decrees are entitled to no extraterritorial effect when challenged in another state.  <citedDecision>Bell</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bell, supra</citedDecision> ; Andrews v. Andrews, supra .  This is not to say that the Nevada decrees are without any legal effect in the State of Nevada.  That question is not before us.  It may be that for the purposes of that state the petitioners have been released from their marital vows, consistently with the procedural requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment, on the basis of compliance with its residential requirements and constructive service of process on the non-resident spouses.  But conceding the validity in Nevada of its decrees dissolving the marriages, it does not mechanically follow that the Full Faith and Credit Clause compels North Carolina to accept them.  We have recognized an area of flexibility in the application of the Clause to preserve and protect state policies in matters of vital public concern.  We have said that conflicts between such state policies should be resolved, "not by giving automatic effect to the full faith and credit clause, .

 [6]  A spouse who appears and contests the jurisdiction of the court of another state to grant a divorce may not collaterally attack its findings of domicile and jurisdiction made after such appearance.  Davis v. Davis, 305 U.S. 32 .  So also, a deserter from the matrimonial domicile may be bound by a divorce granted by a court of the state where the matrimonial domicile is situated.  Whether fault on the part of the deserter is an essential seems on the basis of our cases on jurisdiction for divorce to be an open question; Atherton v. Atherton, 181 U.S. 155 ; Haddock v. Haddock, supra, at 570, 572, 583 ; and Thompson v. Thompson, 226 U.S. 551 ; but our decisions on analogous problems might be found to afford adequate support for a decision that it is not.  Cf. Washington ex rel. Bond & Goodwin & Tucker v. Superior Court, 289 U.S. 361 ; Doherty & Co. v. Goodman, 294 U.S. 623 .  See, further, Restatement, Conflict of Laws, §§ 112, 113.  [7]  This was the decision in Bell v. Bell, <citedDecision>181 U.S. 175</citedDecision> ; And Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U.S. 14 .  Davis v. Davis, supra, note 6, in no way indicates that a finding of domicile after appearance of the absent spouse and litigation of the question would be conclusive upon the state of his domicile in litigation involving its interests and not merely those of the parties.  Cf. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165, 172, n. 13 .  [8]  1 Beale, Conflict of Laws (1935) § 10.3.  [9]  Compare Texas v. Florida, 306 U.S. 398 , with Massachusetts v. Missouri, 308 U.S. 1 .  And see Tweed and Sargent, Death and Taxation are Certain  But What of Domicile?, 53 Harvard Law Review 68, 76; " Texas v. Florida does not help the situation in the ordinary case because at the rates of tax prevailing in most of the states a controversy between the states of which the Supreme Court has jurisdiction can arise only if at least four states claim a tax and the estate consists of intangible property having a value of at least $30,000,000.  On no other state of facts will the assets be insufficient to meet the claims of all of the claimant states."
