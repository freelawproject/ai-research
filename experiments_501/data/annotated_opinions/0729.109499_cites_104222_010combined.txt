 392 U. S., at 196 .  Appellee Secretary in this case, both in his brief and upon oral argument, has agreed that our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.  See, e. g., Brief for Appellee 30-41; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-43.  In Fry, supra, the Court recognized that an express declaration of this limitation is found in the Tenth Amendment: "While the Tenth Amendment has been characterized as a `truism,' stating merely that `all is retained which has not been surrendered,' United States v. *843 Darby, 312 U. S. 100, 124 (1941), it is not without significance.  The Amendment expressly declares the constitutional policy that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States' integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system." 421 U. S., at 547 n. 7.  In New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572</citedDecision> (1946), Mr. Chief Justice Stone, speaking for four Members of an eight-Member Court [13] in rejecting the proposition that Congress could impose taxes on the States so long as it did so in a nondiscriminatory manner, observed: "A State may, like a private individual, own real property and receive income.  But in view of our former decisions we could hardly say that a general non-discriminatory real estate tax (apportioned), or an income tax laid upon citizens and States alike could be constitutionally applied to the State's capitol, its State-house, its public school houses, public parks, or its revenues from taxes or school lands, even though all real property and all income of the citizen is taxed." <citedDecision>Id., at 587-588</citedDecision> .  [14] *844 The expressions in these more recent cases trace back to earlier decisions of this Court recognizing the essential role of the States in our federal system of government.  Mr. Chief Justice Chase, perhaps because of the particular time at which he occupied that office, had occasion more than once to speak for the Court on this point.  In Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869), he declared that "[t]he Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States." In Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 (1869), his opinion for the Court said: "Both the States and the United States existed before the Constitution.  The people, through that instrument, established a more perfect union by substituting a national government, acting, with ample power, directly upon the citizens, instead of the Confederate government, which acted with powers, greatly restricted, only upon the States.  But in many articles of the Constitution the necessary existence of the States, and, within their proper spheres, the independent authority of the States, is distinctly recognized."

 There is nothing in the history of its adoption to suggest that it was more than declaratory of the relationship between the national and state governments as it had been established by the Constitution before the amendment or that its purpose was other than to allay fears that the new national government might seek to exercise powers not granted, and that the states might not be able to exercise fully their reserved powers.  .  .  .  "From the beginning and for many years the amendment has been construed as not depriving the national government of authority to resort to all means for the exercise of a granted power which are appropriate and plainly adapted to the permitted *863 end." United States v. Darby, 312 U. S., at 124 (emphasis added).  [5] My Brethren purport to find support for their novel state-sovereignty doctrine in the concurring opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Stone in New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572, 586</citedDecision> (1946).  That reliance is plainly misplaced.  That case presented the question whether the Constitution either required immunity of New York State's mineral water business from federal taxation or denied to the Federal Government power to lay the tax. The Court sustained the federal tax. Mr. Chief Justice Stone observed in his concurring opinion that "a federal tax which is not discriminatory as to the subject matter may nevertheless so affect the State, merely because it is a State that is being taxed, as to interfere unduly with the State's performance of its sovereign functions of government." <citedDecision>Id., at 587</citedDecision> .  But the Chief Justice was addressing not the question of a state-sovereignty restraint upon the exercise of the commerce power, but rather the principle of implied immunity of the States *864 and Federal Government from taxation by the other: "The counterpart of such undue interference has been recognized since Marshall's day as the implied immunity of each of the dual sovereignties of our constitutional system from taxation by the other." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> In contrast, the apposite decision that Term to the question whether the Constitution implies a state-sovereignty restraint upon congressional exercise of the commerce power is Case v. Bowles, 327 U. S. 92 (1946).  The question there was whether the Emergency Price Control Act could apply to the sale by the State of Washington of timber growing on lands granted by Congress to the State for the support of common schools.  The State contended that "there is a doctrine implied in the Federal Constitution that `the two governments, national and state, are each to exercise its powers so as not to interfere with the free and full exercise of the powers of the other' .  .  .  [and] that the Act cannot be applied to this sale because it was `for the purpose of gaining revenue to carry out an essential governmental functionthe education of its citizens.' " Id., at 101 .  The Court emphatically rejected that argument, in an opinion joined by Mr. Chief Justice Stone, reasoning: "Since the Emergency Price Control Act has been sustained as a congressional exercise of the war power, the [State's] argument is that the extent of that power as applied to state functions depends on whether these are `essential' to the state government.  The use of the same criterion in measuring the constitutional power of Congress to tax has proved to be unworkable, and we reject it as a guide in the field here involved.  Cf. United States v. California, .  .  .  297 U. S. at 183-185 ." Ibid. [6] *865 The footnote to this statement rejected the suggested dichotomy between essential and nonessential state governmental functions as having "proved to be unworkable" by referring to "the several opinions in New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572</citedDecision> ." <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 101 n. 7.  Even more significant for our purposes is the Court's citation of United States v. California , a case concerned with Congress' power to regulate commerce, as supporting the rejection of the State's contention that state sovereignty is a limitation on Congress' war power.  California directly presented the question whether any state-sovereignty restraint precluded application of the Federal Safety Appliance Act to a state owned and operated railroad.  The State argued "that as the state is operating the railroad without profit, for the purpose of facilitating the commerce of the port, and is using the net proceeds of operation for harbor improvement, .  .  .  it is engaged in performing a public function in its sovereign capacity and for that reason cannot constitutionally be subjected to the provisions of the federal Act."

 Thus, although my Brethren by fiat strike down the 1974 amendments without analysis of countervailing national considerations, Fry by contrary logic remains undisturbed because, on balance, countervailing national considerations override the interference with the State's freedom.  Moreover, it is sophistry to say the Economic Stabilization Act "displaced no state choices," ante, at 853, but that the 1974 amendments do, ante, at 848.  Obviously the Stabilization Actno less than every exercise of a national power delegated to Congress by the Constitution displaced the State's freedom.  It is absurd to suggest that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between curbs against increasing wages and curbs against paying wages lower than the federal minimum.  Today's holding patently is in derogation of the sovereign power of the Nation to regulate interstate commerce.  Can the States engage in businesses competing with the private sector and then come to the courts arguing that withdrawing the employees of those businesses from the private sector evades the power of the Federal Government to regulate commerce?  See <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> v. *873 United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 582</citedDecision> (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  No principle given meaningful content by my Brethren today precludes the States from doing just that.  Our historic decisions rejecting all suggestions that the States stand in a different position from affected private parties when challenging congressional exercise of the commerce power reflect that very concern.  Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183 (1968); United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936).  Fry only last Term emphasized "that States are not immune from all federal regulation under the Commerce Clause merely because of their sovereign status.  " 421 U. S., at 548 (emphasis added).  For "[b]y empowering Congress to regulate commerce.

 There is no reason whatever to suppose that in enacting the 1974 amendments Congress, even if it might extensively obliterate state sovereignty by fully exercising its plenary power respecting commerce, had any purpose to do so. Surely the presumption must be to the contrary.  Any realistic assessment of our federal political system, dominated as it is by representatives of the people elected from the States, yields the conclusion that it is highly unlikely that those representatives will ever be motivated to disregard totally the concerns of these States.  [13] The Federalist No. 46, supra, at 319.  Certainly this was the premise upon which the Constitution, as authoritatively explicated in Gibbons v. Ogden , was founded.  Indeed, though the States are represented in *878 the National Government, national interests are not similarly represented in the States' political processes.  Perhaps my Brethren's concern with the Judiciary's role in preserving federalism might better focus on whether Congress, not the States, is in greater need of this Court's protection.  See <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 582</citedDecision> (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); Helvering v. Gerhardt, 304 U. S., at 416 .  A sense of the enormous impact of States' political power is gained by brief reference to the federal budget.  The largest estimate by any of the appellants of the cost impact of the 1974 amendments$1 billionpales in comparison with the financial assistance the States receive from the Federal Government.  In fiscal 1977 the President's proposed budget recommends $60.5 billion in federal assistance to the States, exclusive of loans.  Office of Management and Budget, Special Analyses: Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 1977, p. 255.  Appellants complain of the impact of the amended FLSA on police and fire departments, but the 1977 budget contemplates outlays for law enforcement assistance of $716 million.  Id., at 258.

 In each of these cases, an even stronger argument than that made in the dissent could be made to the effect that since each of these bills had been signed by the President, the very officer who challenged them had consented to their becoming law, and it was therefore no concern of this Court that the law violated the Constitution.  Just as the dissent contends that "the States are fully able to protect their own interests .  .  .  ," post, at 876, it could have been contended that the President, armed with the mandate of a national constituency and with the veto power, was able to protect his own interests.  Nonetheless, in both cases the laws were held unconstitutional, because they trenched on the authority of the Executive Branch.  [13]  In quoting from the separate opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in <citedDecision>New York</citedDecision> v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 573</citedDecision> , MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN fails to add that this opinion attracted only one other adherent.  The separate opinion of Mr. Chief Justice Stone, on the other hand, was joined by three other Members of the Court. And the two dissenters advocated a position even more protective of state sovereignty than that advanced by Stone.  See <citedDecision>Id., at 590-598</citedDecision> (Douglas, J., dissenting).  [14]  MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN suggests that "the Chief Justice was addressing not the question of a state sovereignty restraint upon the exercise of the commerce power, but rather the principle of implied immunity of the States and Federal Government from taxation by the other .  .  .  ." Post, at 863-864.  The asserted distinction, however, escapes us.

 .  .  .  No other federal power was so universally assumed to be necessary, no other state power was so readily relinquished." H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond, 336 U. S. 525, 533-534 (1949); see id., at 532-535 .  [7]  Even in the tax area the States' immunity has not gone unchallenged.  The separate opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter in New York v. United States, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 572, 573</citedDecision> (1946), argued that the only limitation on the federal power to tax was that Congress not discriminate against the States.  There is no such discrimination in the 1974 amendments, since they apply to both public and private employers.  Mr. Justice Frankfurter noted a distinction between immunities claimed to invalidate state taxes on federal activities and those urged as a basis for rejecting federal taxes.  "The federal government is the government of all the States, and all the States share in the legislative process by which a tax of general applicability is laid." <citedDecision>Id., at 577</citedDecision> .  See M`Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 405-406 (1819).  He also recognized that immunity in this area had been significantly eroded since it was first used to protect state officials from a federal tax in Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113 (1871).  See, e. g., Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 (1939), overruling Collector v. Day, supra ; Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376 (1938); Fox Film Corp. v. Doyal, 286 U. S. 123 (1932).  Even more significantly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter pointed out that the existence of a state immunity from federal taxation, to the extent that it was based on any vague sovereignty notions, was inconsistent with the holding in United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), that state sovereignty does not restrict federal exercise of the commerce power.  <citedDecision>326 U. S., at 582</citedDecision> .  [8]  My Brethren's reliance on Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869), and Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869), is puzzling to say the least.  The Brethren make passing reference to the unique historical setting in which those cases were decided, ante, at 844, but pointedly ignore the significance of the events of those days.  During the tenure of Mr. Chief Justice Chase, the War Between the States, fought to preserve the supremacy of the Union, was won; Congress and the States then enacted three constitutional Amendments, the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth, enlarging federal power and concomitantly contracting the States' power, see Ex parte Virginia, 100 U. S. 339, 345 (1880); and Congress enacted a variety of laws during Reconstruction further restricting state sovereignty.  Texas v. White itself noted that the Constitution empowered Congress to form a new government in a State if the citizens of that State were being denied a republican form of government.  7 Wall., at 729.  And the Court recognized in Lane County that "[t]he people of the United States constitute one nation, under one government, and this government, within the scope of the powers with which it is invested, is supreme."
