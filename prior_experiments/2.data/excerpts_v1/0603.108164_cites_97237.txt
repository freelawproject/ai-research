." Price v. State, 224 Ga. 306 , 307, 161 S.E.2d 825 , 826 (1968). The Georgia Court of Appeals then heard the appeal and affirmed the second conviction, rejecting petitioner's argument, among others, that his retrial for murder constituted double jeopardy. Price v. State, 118 Ga. App. 207 , 163 S.E.2d 243 (1968). The Court of Appeals held that in Brantley v. State, 132 Ga. 573 , 64 S.E. 676 (1909), aff'd, 217 U.S. 284 (1910), the Georgia Supreme Court had decided this question adversely to petitioner. The Court of Appeals then quoted from the Brantley case's syllabus: "When a person has been indicted for murder and convicted of voluntary manslaughter, if he voluntarily seeks and obtains a new trial, he is subject to another trial generally for the offense charged in the indictment, and upon such trial he cannot successfully interpose a plea of former acquittal of the crime of murder, or former jeopardy in regard thereto." 118 Ga. App. , at 208 , 163 S. E. 2d, at 244. Petitioner sought a rehearing, contending, as he contends here, that Brantley was no longer controlling. He relied on Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184 (1957), and *326 United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F.2d 844 (C. A.
**Combined Opinion**
The rationale of the Green holding applies here. The concept of continuing jeopardy implicit in the Ball case [4] would allow petitioner's retrial for voluntary manslaughter after his first conviction for that offense had been reversed. But, as the Kepner and Green cases illustrate, this Court has consistently refused to rule that jeopardy for an offense continues after an acquittal, whether that acquittal is express or implied by a conviction on a lesser included offense when the jury was given a full opportunity [5] to return a verdict on the greater charge. There is no relevant factual distinction between this case and Green v. United States . Although the petitioner was not convicted of the greater charge on retrial, whereas Green was, the risk of conviction on the greater charge was the same in both cases, and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment is written in terms of potential or risk of trial and conviction, not punishment. The Georgia courts nonetheless rejected Green as a persuasive authority in favor of reliance on Brantley v. State, 132 Ga. 573 , 64 S.E. 676 (1909), aff'd, 217 U.S. 284 (1910). The Brantley case presented a situation where a defendant's appeal from a conviction for a *330 lesser included offense ultimately led to retrial and conviction on the greater offense. After the second conviction had been affirmed on appeal, the defendant sued out a writ of error to the Supreme Court of Georgia from this Court, contending "that the exemption from second jeopardy is one of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the United States, which the Fourteenth Amendment forbids a state to abridge", [6] that he had "been tried and acquitted by a jury of his country of the crime of murder", [7] and that "[h]e should never [ sic ] have been tried a second time only for the offense on which he obtained a new trial . . . ." [8] This Court tersely rejected these contentions as: "absolutely without merit.
