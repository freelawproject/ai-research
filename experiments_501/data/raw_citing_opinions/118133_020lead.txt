<p id="b242-7">In <em>Aguilar </em>v. Felton, <span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">473 U. S. 402</a></span> (1985), this Court held that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment barred the city of New York from sending public school teachers into parochial schools to provide remedial education to disadvantaged children pursuant to a congressionally mandated program. On remand, the District Court for the Eastern District of New York entered a permanent injunction reflecting our ruling. Twelve years later, petitioners— the parties bound by that injunction — seek relief from its operation. Petitioners maintain that <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

<p id="b243-5">I</p>
<p id="b243-6">In 1965, Congress enacted Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, <span class="citation no-link">79 Stat. 27</span>, as modified, <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 6301</span> <em>et seq., </em>to “provid[e] full educational opportunity to every child regardless of economic background.” S. Rep. No. 146, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1965) (hereinafter Title I). Toward that end, Title I channels federal funds, through the States, to “local educational agencies” (LEA’s). <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. §§ 6311</span>, 6312.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The LEA’s spend these funds to provide remedial education, guidance, and job counseling to eligible students. §§ 6315(c)(1)(A) (LEA’s must use funds to “help participating children meet... State student performance standards”), 6315(c)(1)(E) (LEA’s may use funds to provide “counseling, mentoring, and other pupil services”); see also §§6314(b)(l)(B)(i), (iv). An eligible student is one (i) who resides within the attendance boundaries of a public school located in a low-income area, § 6313(a)(2)(B); and (ii) who is failing, or is at risk of failing, the State’s student performance standards, § 6315(b)(1)(B). Title I funds must be made available to <em>all </em>eligible children, regardless of whether they attend public schools, § 6312(c)(1)(F), and the services provided to children attending private schools must <page-number citation-index="1" label="210">*210</page-number>be “equitable in comparison to services and other benefits for public school children,” § 6321(a)(3); see § 6321(a)(1); <span class="citation no-link">34 CFR §§ 200.10</span>(a), 200.11(b) (1996).</p>
<p id="b244-5">An LEA providing services to children enrolled in private schools is subject to a number of constraints that are not imposed when it provides aid to public schools. Title I services may be provided only to those private school students eligible for aid, and cannot be used to provide services on a “school-wide” basis. Compare <span class="citation no-link">34 CFR § 200.12</span>(b) (1996) with <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 6314</span> (allowing “school-wide” programs at public schools). In addition, the LEA must retain complete control over Title I funds; retain title to all materials used to provide Title I services; and provide those services through public employees or other persons independent of the private school and any religious institution. §§ 6321(c)(1), (2). The Title I services themselves must be “secular, neutral, and nonideological,” § 6321(a)(2), and must “supplement, and in no case supplant, the level of services” already provided by the private school, <span class="citation no-link">34 CFR § 200.12</span>(a) (1996).</p>
<p id="b244-6">Petitioner Board of Education of the City of New York (hereinafter Board), an LEA, first applied for Title I funds in 1966 and has grappled ever since with how to provide Title I services to the private school students within its jurisdiction. Approximately 10% of the total number of students eligible for Title I services are private school students. See App. 38, 620. Recognizing that more than 90% of the private schools within the Board’s jurisdiction are sectarian, <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed., </em><span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/F.%202d/739/48/">739 F. 2d 48</a></span>, 51 (CA2 1984), the Board initially arranged to transport children to public schools for after-school Title I instruction. But this enterprise was largely unsuccessful. Attendance was poor, teachers and children were tired, and parents were concerned for the safety of their children. <em>Ibid. </em>The Board then moved the after-school instruction onto private school <page-number citation-index="1" label="211">*211</page-number>campuses, as Congress had contemplated when it enacted Title I. See <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>Barrera, </em><span class="citation" data-id="9425750"><a href="/opinion/109062/wheeler-v-barrera/#422" aria-description="Citation for case: Wheeler v. Barrera">417 U. S. 402, 422</a></span> (1974). After this program also yielded mixed results, the Board implemented the plan we evaluated in <em>Aguilar </em>v. <em>Felton, </em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">473 U. S. 402</a></span> (1985).</p>
<p id="b245-5">That plan called for the provision of Title I services on private school premises during school hours. Under the plan, only public employees could serve as Title I instructors and counselors. <span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/#406" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton"><em>Id., </em>at 406</a></span>. Assignments to private schools were made on a voluntary basis and without regard to the religious affiliation of the employee or the wishes of the private school. <em>Ibid.; </em>739 F. 2d, at 53. As the Court of Appeals in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>observed, a large majority of Title I teachers worked in nonpublic schools with religious affiliations different from their own. <span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/#406" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">473 U. S., at 406</a></span>. The vast majority of Title I teachers also moved among the private schools, spending fewer than five days a week at the same school. <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Ibid.</a></span></em></p>
<p id="b245-6">Before any public employee could provide Title I instruction at a private school, she would be given a detailed set of written and oral instructions emphasizing the secular purpose of Title I and setting out the rules to be followed to ensure that this purpose was not compromised. Specifically, employees would be told that (i) they were employees of the Board and accountable only to their public school supervisors; (ii) they had exclusive responsibility for selecting students for the Title I program and could teach only those children who met the eligibility criteria for Title I; (iii) their materials and equipment would be used only in the Title I program; (iv) they could not engage in team teaching or other cooperative instructional activities with private school teachers; and (v) they could not introduce any religious matter into their teaching or become involved in any way with the religious activities of the private schools. <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Ibid.</a></span> </em>All religious symbols were to be removed from classrooms used <page-number citation-index="1" label="212">*212</page-number>for Title I services. <span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/#407" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton"><em>Id., </em>at 407</a></span>. The rules acknowledged that it might be necessary for Title I teachers to consult with a student’s regular classroom teacher to assess the student’s particular needs and progress, but admonished instructors to limit those consultations to mutual professional concerns regarding the student’s education. 739 F. 2d, at 53. To ensure compliance with these rules, a publicly employed field supervisor was to attempt to make at least one unannounced visit to each teacher’s classroom every month. <span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/#407" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">473 U. S., at 407</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b246-5">In 1978, six federal taxpayers — respondents here — sued the Board in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Respondents sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that the Board’s Title I program violated the Establishment Clause. The District Court permitted the parents of a number of parochial school students who were receiving Title I services to intervene as codefendants. The District Court granted summary judgment for the Board, but the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed. While noting that the Board’s Title I program had “done so much good and little, if any, detectable harm,” 739 F. 2d, at 72, the Court of Appeals nevertheless held that <em>Meek </em>v. <em>Pittenger, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">421 U. S. 349</a></span> (1975), and <em>Wolman </em>v. <em>Walter, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v. Walter">433 U. S. 229</a></span> (1977), compelled it to declare the program unconstitutional. In a 5-to-4 decision, this Court affirmed on the ground that the Board’s Title I program necessitated an “excessive entanglement of church and state in the administration of [Title I] benefits.” <span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/#414" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">473 U. S., at 414</a></span>. On remand, the District Court permanently enjoined the Board</p>
<blockquote id="b246-6">“from using public funds for any plan or program under [Title I] to the extent that it requires, authorizes or permits public school teachers and guidance counselors to provide teaching and counseling services on the premises of sectarian schools within New York City.” App. to Pet. for Cert, in No. 96-553, pp. A25-A26.</blockquote>
<p id="b247-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="213">*213</page-number>The Board, like other LEA’s across the United States, modified its Title I program so it could continue serving those students who attended private religious schools. Rather than offer Title I instruction to parochial school students at their schools, the Board reverted to its prior practice of providing instruction at public school sites, at leased sites, and in mobile instructional units (essentially vans converted into classrooms) parked near the sectarian school. The Board also offered computer-aided instruction, which could be provided “on premises” because it did not require public employees to be physically present on the premises of a religious school. App. 315.</p>
<p id="b247-5">It is not disputed that the additional costs of complying with Aguilar’s mandate are significant. Since the 1986-1987 school year, the Board has spent over $100 million providing computer-aided instruction, leasing sites and mobile instructional units, and transporting students to those sites. App. 333 ($93.2 million spent between 1986-1987 and 1993-1994 school years); <em>id., </em>at 336 (annual additional costs average around $15 million). Under the Secret&amp;ry of Education’s regulations, those costs “incurred as a result of implementing alternative delivery systems to comply with the requirements of <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>v. <em>Felton” </em>and not paid for with other state or federal funds are to be deducted from the federal grant before the Title I funds are distributed to <em>any </em>student. <span class="citation no-link">34 CFR § 200.27</span>(c) (1996). These <em>“Aguilar </em>costs” thus reduce the amount of Title I money an LEA has available for remedial education, and LEA’s have had to cut back on the number of students who receive Title I benefits. From Title I funds available for New York City children between the 1986-1987 and the 1993-1994 school years, the Board had to deduct $7.9 million “off-the-top” for compliance with <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span>. </em>App. 333. When <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>was handed down, it was estimated that some 20,000 economically disadvantaged children in the city of New York, see <span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/#431" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">473 U. S., at 431</a></span> <page-number citation-index="1" label="214">*214</page-number>(O’Connor, J., dissenting), and some 183,000 children nationwide, see L. Levy, The Establishment Clause 176 (1986), would experience a decline in Title I services. See also S. Rep. No. 100-222, p. 14 (1987) (estimating that <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>costs have “resulted in a decline of about 35 percent in the number of private school children who are served”).</p>
<p id="b248-5">In October and December of 1995, petitioners — the Board and a new group of parents of parochial school students entitled to Title I services — filed motions in the District Court seeking relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) from the permanent injunction entered by the District Court on remand from our decision in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

S. 367, 388</a></span> (1992), because the “decisional law [had] changed to make legal what the [injunction] was designed to prevent.” Specifically, petitioners pointed to the statements of five Justices in <em>Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. </em>v. <em>Grumet, </em><span class="citation" data-id="117870"><a href="/opinion/117870/board-of-ed-of-kiryas-joel-village-school-dist-v-grumet/" aria-description="Citation for case: Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v.

Felton">Aguilar</a></span>. </em>The District Court denied the motion. The District Court recognized that petitioners, “at bottom,” sought “a procedurally sound vehicle to get the [propriety of the injunction] back before the Supreme Court,” App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 96-553, p. A12, and concluded that “the Board ha[d] properly proceeded under Rule 60(b) to seek relief from the injunction.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

Despite its observations that “the landscape of Establishment* Clause decisions has changed,” <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 96-553, p. A5; judgt. order reported at <span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/F.%203d/101/1394/">101 F. 3d 1394</a></span> (1996).

<p id="b249-3">The question we must answer is a simple one: Are petitioners entitled to relief from the District Court’s permanent injunction under Rule 60(b)? Rule 60(b)(5), the subsection under which petitioners proceeded below, states:</p>
<blockquote id="b249-4">“On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party . . . from a final judgment [or] order . . . [when] it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.”</blockquote>

<p id="b251-5">We also agree with respondents that the statements made by five Justices in <em>Kiryas Joel </em>do not, in themselves, furnish a basis for concluding that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has changed. In <em>Kiryas Joel, </em>we considered the constitutionality of a New York law that carved out a public school district to coincide with the boundaries of the village of Kiryas Joel, which was an enclave of the Satmar Hasidic sect. Before the new district was created, Satmar children wishing to receive special educational services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. § 1400</span> <em>et seq., </em>could receive those services at public schools located outside the village. Because Satmar parents rarely permitted their children to attend those schools, New York created a new public school district within the boundaries of the village so that Satmar children could stay within the village but receive IDEA services on public school premises from publicly employed instructors. In the course of our opinion, we observed that New York had created the special school district in response to our decision in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

<p id="b251-6">In light of these conclusions, petitioners’ ability to satisfy the prerequisites of Rule 60(b)(5) hinges on whether our later Establishment Clause cases have so undermined <page-number citation-index="1" label="218">*218</page-number><em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

The district’s Shared Time program, the one most analogous to Title I, provided remedial and “enrichment” classes, at public expense, to students attending nonpublic schools. The classes were taught during regular school hours by publicly employed teachers, using materials purchased with public funds, on the premises of nonpublic schools. The Shared Time courses were in subjects designed to supplement the “core curriculum” of the nonpublic schools. <span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/#375" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball"><em>Id., </em>at 375-376</a></span>. Of the 41 nonpublic schools eligible for the program, 40 were “‘pervasively sectarian’” in character — that is, “‘the pur-pos[e] of [those] schools [was] to advance their particular religions.’” <span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/#379" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v.

<p id="b252-9">The Court conducted its analysis by applying the three-part test set forth in <em>Lemon </em>v. <em>Kurtzman, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108380"><a href="/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lemon v.

<blockquote id="b252-10">“First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.” 473 U. S., at 382-383 (quoting <span class="citation" data-id="108380"><a href="/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/#612" aria-description="Citation for case: Lemon v. Kurtzman"><em>Lemon, supra, </em>at 612-613</a></span>) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</blockquote>
<p id="b252-11">The Court acknowledged that, the Shared Time program served a purely secular purpose, thereby satisfying the first <page-number citation-index="1" label="219">*219</page-number>part of the so-called <em><span class="citation" data-id="108380"><a href="/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lemon v. Kurtzman">Lemon</a></span> </em>test. 473 U. S., at 383. Nevertheless, it ultimately concluded that the program had the impermissible effect of advancing religion. <em>Id., </em>at 385.</p>
<p id="b253-5">The Court found that the program violated the Establishment Clause’s prohibition against “government-financed or government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith” in at least three ways. <em>Ibid. </em>First, drawing upon the analysis in <em>Meek </em>v. <em>Pittenger, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">421 U. S. 349</a></span> (1975), the Court observed that “the teachers participating in the programs may become involved in intentionally or inadvertently inculcating particular religious tenets or beliefs.” 473 U. S., at 385. <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span> </em>invalidated a Pennsylvania program in which full-time public employees provided supplemental “auxiliary services” — remedial and accelerated instruction, guidance counseling and testing, and speech and hearing services — to nonpublic school children at their schools. 473 U. S., at 367-373. Although the auxiliary services themselves were secular, they were mostly dispensed on the premises of parochial schools, where “an atmosphere dedicated to the advancement of religious belief [was] constantly maintained.” <em>Meek, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/#371" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">421 U. S., at 371</a></span>. Instruction in that atmosphere was sufficient to create “[t]he potential for impermissible fostering of religion.” <span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/#372" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger"><em>Id., </em>at 372</a></span>. Cf. <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v.

S., at 248</a></span> (upholding programs employing public employees to provide remedial instruction and guidance counseling to nonpublic school children at sites away from the nonpublic school).</p>
<p id="b253-6">The Court concluded that Grand Rapids’ program shared these defects. 473 U. S., at 386. As in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span>, </em>classes were conducted on the premises of religious schools. Accordingly, a majority found a “‘substantial risk’” that teachers — even those who were not employed by the private schools — might “subtly (or overtly) conform their instruction to the [pervasively sectarian] environment in which they [taught].” 473 U. S., at 388. The danger of “state-sponsored indoctrination” was only exacerbated by the school district’s failure to <page-number citation-index="1" label="220">*220</page-number>monitor the courses for religious content. <em>Id., </em>at 387. Notably, the Court disregarded the lack of evidence of any specific incidents of religious indoctrination as largely irrelevant, reasoning that potential witnesses to any indoctrination — the parochial school students, their parents, or parochial school officials — might be unable to detect or have little incentive to report’ the incidents. <em>Id., </em>at 388-389.</p>
<p id="b254-5">The presence of public teachers on parochial school grounds had a second, related impermissible effect: It created a “graphic symbol of the 'concert or union or dependency’ of church and state,” <em>id., </em>at 391 (quoting <em>Zorach </em>v. <em>Clauson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105002"><a href="/opinion/105002/zorach-v-clauson/#312" aria-description="Citation for case: Zorach v. Clauson">343 U. S. 306, 312</a></span> (1952)), especially when perceived by “children in their formative years,” 473 U. S., at 390. The Court feared that this perception of a symbolic union between church and state would “convefy] a message of government endorsement ... of religion” and thereby violate a “core purpose” of the Establishment Clause. <em>Id., </em>at 389.</p>
<p id="b254-6">Third, the Court found that the Shared Time program im-permissibly financed religious indoctrination by subsidizing “the primary religious mission of the institutions affected.” <em>Id., </em>at 385. The Court separated its prior decisions evaluating programs that aided the secular activities of religious institutions into two categories: those in which it concluded that the aid resulted in an effect that was “indirect, remote, or incidental” (and upheld the aid); and those in which it concluded that the aid resulted in “a direct and substantial advancement of the sectarian enterprise” (and invalidated the aid). <em>Id., </em>at 393 (internal quotation marks omitted). In light of <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v. Walter">Wolman</a></span>, </em>Grand Rapids’ program fell into the latter category. In those cases, the Court ruled that a state loan of instructional equipment and materials to parochial schools was an impermissible form of “direct aid” because it “advanced the primary, religion-oriented educational function of the sectarian school,” 473 U. S., at 395 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted), by providing “in-<page-number citation-index="1" label="221">*221</page-number>kind” aid <em>(e. g., </em>instructional materials) that could be used to teach religion and by freeing up money for religious indoctrination that the school would otherwise have devoted to secular education. Given the holdings in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109722"><a href="/opinion/109722/wolman-v-walter/" aria-description="Citation for case: Wolman v. Walter">Wolman</a></span>, </em>the Shared Time program — which provided teachers as well as instructional equipment and materials — was surely invalid. 473 U. S., at 395. The <em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball">Ball</a></span> </em>Court likewise placed no weight on the fact that the program was provided to the student rather than to the school. Nor was the impermissible effect mitigated by the fact that the program only supplemented the courses offered by the parochial schools. <span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/#395" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v.

<p id="b255-5">The New York City Title I program challenged in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>closely resembled the Shared Time program struck down in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball">Ball</a></span>, </em>but the Court found fault with an aspect of the Title I program not present in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball">Ball</a></span>: </em>The Board had “adopted a system for monitoring the religious content of publicly funded Title I classes in the religious schools.” 473 U. S., at 409. Even though this monitoring system might prevent the Title I program from being used to inculcate religion, the Court concluded, as it had in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108380"><a href="/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lemon v. Kurtzman">Lemon</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span>, </em>that the level of monitoring necessary to be “certain” that the program had an exclusively secular effect would “inevitably resul[t] in the excessive entanglement of church and state,” thereby running afoul of <em>Lemon's </em>third prong. 473 U. S., at 409; see <em>Lemon, </em><span class="citation" data-id="108380"><a href="/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/#619" aria-description="Citation for case: Lemon v. Kurtzman">403 U.

Pittenger"><em>Meek, supra, </em>at 370</a></span> (invalidating Pennsylvania program on entanglement grounds because excessive monitoring would be required for the State to be certain that public school officials do not inculcate religion). In the majority’s view, New York City’s Title I program suffered from the “same critical elements of entanglement” present in <em><span class="citation" data-id="108380"><a href="/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/" aria-description="Citation for case: Lemon v. Kurtzman">Lemon</a></span> </em>and <em><span class="citation" data-id="109251"><a href="/opinion/109251/meek-v-pittenger/" aria-description="Citation for case: Meek v. Pittenger">Meek</a></span>: </em>the aid was provided “in a per<page-number citation-index="1" label="222">*222</page-number>vasively sectarian environment... in the form of teachers,” requiring “ongoing inspection ... to ensure the absence of a religious message.” 473 U. S., at 412. Such “pervasive monitoring by public authorities in the sectarian schools infringes precisely those Establishment Clause values at the root of the prohibition of excessive entanglement.” <em>Id., </em>at 413. The Court noted two further forms of entanglement inherent in New York City’s Title I program: the “administrative cooperation” required to implement Title I services and the “dangers of political divisiveness” that might grow out of the day-to-day decisions public officials would have to make in order to provide Title I services. <em>Id., </em>at 413-414.</p>
<p id="b256-5">Distilled to essentials, the Court’s conclusion that the Shared Time program in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball">Ball</a></span> </em>had the impermissible effect of advancing religion rested on three assumptions: (i) any public employee who works on the premises of a religious school is presumed to inculcate religion in her work; (ii) the presence of public employees on private school premises creates a symbolic union between church and state; and (iii) any and all public aid that directly aids the educational function of religious schools impermissibly finances religious indoctrination, even if the aid reaches such schools as a consequence of private decisionmaking. Additionally, in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>there was a fourth assumption: that New York City’s Title I program necessitated an excessive government entanglement with religion because public employees who teach on the premises of religious schools must be closely monitored to ensure that they do not inculcate religion.</p>
<p id="b256-6">B</p>
<p id="b256-7">Our more recent eases have undermined the assumptions upon which <em><span class="citation" data-id="111505"><a href="/opinion/111505/school-district-of-grand-rapids-v-ball/" aria-description="Citation for case: School District of Grand Rapids v.

Certainly, no evidence has ever shown that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in stu<page-number citation-index="1" label="227">*227</page-number>dents. <em>National Coalition for Public Ed. &amp; Religious Liberty </em>v. <em>Harris, </em><span class="citation" data-id="2394095"><a href="/opinion/2394095/national-coalition-for-public-education-religious-liberty-v-harris/#1262" aria-description="Citation for case: National Coalition for Public Education &amp; Religious...">489 F.

<p id="b261-5">As discussed above, <em><span class="citation" data-id="112887"><a href="/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-district/" aria-description="Citation for case: Zobrest v.

Justice Sou-TER maintains that <em><span class="citation" data-id="112887"><a href="/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-district/" aria-description="Citation for case: Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District">Zobrest</a></span> </em>is not dispositive on this point because <em>Aguilar’s </em>implicit conclusion that New York City’s Title I program created a “symbolic union” rested on more than the presence of Title I employees on parochial school grounds. <em>Post, </em>at 250. To him, Title I continues to foster a “symbolic union” between the Board and sectarian schools because it mandates “the involvement of public teachers in the instruction provided within sectarian schools,” <em>ibid., </em>and “fus[es] public and private faculties,” <em>post, </em>at 254. Justice Souter does not disavow the notion, uniformly adopted by lower courts, that Title I services may be provided to sectarian school students in off-campus locations, <em>post, </em>at 246-247, even though that notion necessarily presupposes that the danger of “symbolic union” evaporates once the services are provided off campus. Taking this view, the only difference between a constitutional program and an unconstitutional one is the location of the classroom, since the degree of cooperation between Title I instructors and parochial school faculty is the same no matter where the services are provided. We do not see any perceptible (let alone dispositive) difference in the degree of symbolic union between a student receiving remedial instruction in a classroom on his sectarian school’s campus and one receiving instruction in a van parked just at the school’s curbside. To draw this line based solely on <page-number citation-index="1" label="228">*228</page-number>the location of the public employee is neither “sensible” nor “sound,” <em>post, </em>at 247, and the Court in <em><span class="citation" data-id="112887"><a href="/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-district/" aria-description="Citation for case: Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District">Zobrest</a></span> </em>rejected it.</p>
<p id="b262-5">Nor under current law can we conclude that a program placing full-time public employees on parochial campuses to provide Title I instruction would impermissibly finance religious indoctrination. In all relevant respects, the provision of instructional services under Title I is indistinguishable from the provision of sign-language interpreters under the IDEA. Both programs make aid available only to eligible recipients. That aid is provided to students at whatever school they choose to attend. Although Title I instruction is provided to several students at once, whereas an interpreter provides translation to a single student, this distinction is not constitutionally significant. Moreover, as in <em><span class="citation" data-id="112887"><a href="/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-district/" aria-description="Citation for case: Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District">Zobrest</a></span>, </em>Title I services are by law supplemental to the regular curricula. <span class="citation no-link">34 CFR § 200.12</span>(a) (1996). These services do not, therefore, “reliev[e] sectarian schools of costs they otherwise would have borne in educating their students.” <span class="citation" data-id="112887"><a href="/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-district/#12" aria-description="Citation for case: Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District">509 U. S., at 12</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b262-6">Justice Souter finds our conclusion that the IDEA and Title I programs are similar to be “puzzling,” and points to three differences he perceives between the programs: (i) Title I services are distributed by LEA’s “directly to the religious schools” instead of to individual students pursuant to a formal application process; (ii) Title I services “necessarily reliev[e] a religious school of ‘an expense that it otherwise would have assumed' and (iii) Title I provides services to more students than did the programs in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111561"><a href="/opinion/111561/witters-v-washington-department-of-services-for-the-blind/" aria-description="Citation for case: Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind">Witters</a></span> </em>and <em>Zobrest. Post, </em>at 251-252. None of these distinctions is meaningful. While it is true that individual students may not directly apply for Title I services, it does not follow from this premise that those services are distributed “directly to the religious schools,” <em>post, </em>at 252. In fact, they are not. No Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools, cf. <em>Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty </em>v. <em>Regan, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110189"><a href="/opinion/110189/committee-for-public-education-religious-liberty-v-regan/#657" aria-description="Citation for case: Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Regan">444 U. S. 646, 657-659</a></span> (1980) (involving a program giving “direct cash <page-number citation-index="1" label="229">*229</page-number>reimbursement” to <em>religious schools </em>for performing certain state-mandated tasks), and Title I services may not be provided to religious schools on a schoolwide basis, <span class="citation no-link">34 CFR § 200.12</span>(b) (1996). Title I funds are instead distributed to a <em>public </em>agency (an LEA) that dispenses services directly to the eligible students within its boundaries, no matter where they choose to attend school. <span class="citation no-link">20 U. S. C. §§ 6311</span>, 6312. Moreover, we fail to see how providing Title I services directly to eligible students results in a greater financing of religious indoctrination simply because those students are not first required to submit a formal application.</p>
<p id="b263-5">We are also not persuaded that Title I services supplant the remedial instruction and guidance counseling already provided in New York City’s sectarian schools. Although Justice Soutee maintains that the sectarian schools provide such services and that those schools reduce those services once their students begin to receive Title I instruction, see <em>post, </em>at 244, 246, 251-252, 254, his claims rest on speculation about the impossibility of drawing any line between supplemental and general education, see <em>post, </em>at 246, and not on any evidence in the record that the Board is in fact violating Title I regulations by providing services that supplant those offered in the sectarian schools. See <span class="citation no-link">34 CFR § 200.12</span>(a) (1996). We are unwilling to speculate that all sectarian schools provide remedial instruction and guidance counseling to their students, and are unwilling to presume that the Board would violate Title I regulations by continuing to provide Title I services to students who attend a sectarian school that has curtailed its remedial instruction program in response to Title I. Nor are we willing to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid. <em><span class="citation" data-id="112887"><a href="/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-district/" aria-description="Citation for case: Zobrest v.

<p id="b264-5">What is most fatal to the argument that New York City’s Title I program directly subsidizes religion is that it applies with equal force when those services are provided off campus, and <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>implied that providing the services off campus is entirely consistent with the Establishment Clause. Justice Souter resists the impulse to upset this implication, contending that it can be justified on the ground that Title I services are “less likely to supplant some of what would otherwise go on inside [the sectarian schools] and to subsidize what remains” when those services are offered off campus. <em>Post, </em>at 247. But Justice Souter does not explain why a sectarian school would not have the same incentive to “make patently significant cutbacks” in its curriculum no matter where Title I services are offered, since the school would ostensibly be excused from having to provide the Title I-type services itself. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">ibid.</a></span> </em>Because the incentive is the same either way, we find no logical basis upon which to conclude that Title I services are an impermissible subsidy of religion when offered on campus, but not when offered off campus. Accordingly, contrary to our conclusion in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

<p id="b266-6">We turn now to <em>Aguilar’s </em>conclusion that New York City’s Title I program resulted in an excessive entanglement between church and state.

Regardless of how we have characterized the issue, however, the factors we use to assess whether an entanglement is “excessive” are similar to the factors we use to examine “effect.” That is, to assess entanglement, we have looked to “the character and purposes of the institutions that are benefited, the nature of the aid that the State provides, and the resulting relationship between the government and religious authority.” <span class="citation" data-id="108380"><a href="/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/#615" aria-description="Citation for case: Lemon v.

<p id="b267-5">Not all entanglements, of course, have the effect of advancing or inhibiting religion.

Kurtzman">403 U. S., at 614</a></span>, and we have always tolerated some level of involvement between the two. Entanglement must be “excessive” before it runs afoul of the Establishment Clause. See, <em>e. g., Bowen </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112138"><a href="/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/#615" aria-description="Citation for case: Bowen v. Kendrick">487 U.

<p id="b267-6">The <em>pre-Aguilar </em>Title I program does not result in an “excessive” entanglement that advances or inhibits religion. As discussed previously, the Court’s finding of “excessive” entanglement in <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span> </em>rested on three grounds: (i) the program would require “pervasive monitoring by public authorities” to ensure that Title I employees did not inculcate religion; (ii) the program required “administrative cooperation” between the Board and parochial schools; and (iii) the program might increase the dangers of “political divisiveness.” 473 U. S., at 413-414. Under our current understanding of the Establishment Clause, the last two considerations are insufficient by themselves to create an “excessive” <page-number citation-index="1" label="234">*234</page-number>entanglement. They are present no matter where Title I services are offered, and no court has held that Title I services cannot be offered off campus. <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v.

In <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span>, </em>the Court presumed that full-time public employees on parochial school grounds would be tempted to inculcate religion, despite the ethical standards they were required to uphold. Because of this risk <em>pervasive </em>monitoring would be required. But after <em><span class="citation" data-id="112887"><a href="/opinion/112887/zobrest-v-catalina-foothills-school-district/" aria-description="Citation for case: Zobrest v.

Since we have abandoned the assumption that properly instructed public employees will fail to discharge their duties faithfully, we must also discard the assumption that <em>pervasive </em>monitoring of Title I teachers is required. There is no suggestion in the record before us that unannounced monthly visits of public supervisors are insufficient to prevent or to detect inculcation of religion by public employees. Moreover, we have not found excessive entanglement in cases in which States imposed far more onerous burdens on religious institutions than the monitoring system at issue here. See <span class="citation" data-id="112138"><a href="/opinion/112138/bowen-v-kendrick/#615" aria-description="Citation for case: Bowen v. Kendrick"><em>Bowen, supra, </em>at 615-617</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b268-5">To summarize, New York City’s Title I program does not run afoul of any of three primary criteria we currently use to evaluate whether government aid has the effect of advancing religion: It does not result in governmental indoctrination; define its recipients by reference to religion; or create an excessive entanglement. We therefore hold that a federally funded program providing supplemental, remedial instruction to disadvantaged children on a neutral basis is not invalid under the Establishment Clause when such instruc<page-number citation-index="1" label="235">*235</page-number>tion is given on the premises of sectarian schools by government employees pursuant to a program containing safeguards such as those present here. The same considerations that justify this holding require us to conclude that this carefully constrained program also cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.

See <em>Browder </em>v. <em>Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill., </em><span class="citation" data-id="109761"><a href="/opinion/109761/browder-v-director-dept-of-corrections-of-ill/#263" aria-description="Citation for case: Browder v. Director, Dept. of Corrections of Ill.">434 U. S. 257, 263, n. 7</a></span> (1978). It is true that the trial court has discretion, but the exercise of discretion cannot be permitted to stand if we find it rests upon a legal principle that can no longer be sustained. See <em>Cooter &amp; Gell </em>v. <em>Hartmarx Corp., </em><span class="citation" data-id="112457"><a href="/opinion/112457/cooter-gell-v-hartmarx-corp/#405" aria-description="Citation for case: Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.">496 U. S. 384, 405</a></span> (1990). The standard of review we employ in this litigation does not therefore require us to depart from our general practice. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="117947"><a href="/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/" aria-description="Citation for case: Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena">Adarand, supra;</a></span> <span class="citation" data-id="117931"><a href="/opinion/117931/hubbard-v-united-states/" aria-description="Citation for case: Hubbard v. United States">Hubbard, supra.</a></span></em></p>
<p id="b272-6">Respondents nevertheless contend that we should not grant Rule 60(b)(5) relief here, in spite of its propriety in other contexts. They contend that petitioners have used Rule 60(b)(5) in an unprecedented way — not as a means of <em>recognizing </em>changes in the law, but as a vehicle for <em>effecting </em>them. If we were to sanction this use of Rule 60(b)(5), respondents argue, we would encourage litigants to burden the federal courts with a deluge of Rule 60(b)(5) motions premised on nothing more than the claim that various judges or Justices have stated that the law has changed. See also <em>post, </em>at 260 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (contending that granting Rule 60(b)(5) relief in this litigation will encourage “invitations to reconsider old cases based on ‘speculations] on chances from changes in [the Court’s membership]”). We think their fears are overstated. As we noted above, a judge’s stated belief that a case should be overruled does not make it so. See <em>supra, </em>at 217.</p>
<p id="b272-7">Most importantly, our decision today is intimately tied to the context in which it arose. This litigation involves a <page-number citation-index="1" label="239">*239</page-number>party’s request under Rule 60(b)(5) to vacate a continuing injunction entered some years ago in light of a bona fide, significant change in subsequent law. The clause of Rule 60(b)(5) that petitioners invoke applies by its terms only to “judgment^] hav[ing] prospective application.” Intervening developments in the law by themselves rarely constitute the extraordinary circumstances required for relief under Rule 60(b)(6), the only remaining avenue for relief on this basis from judgments lacking any prospective component. See 12 J. Moore et al., Moore’s Federal Practice § 60.48[5][b], p. 60-181 (3d ed. 1997) (collecting cases). Our decision will have no effect outside the context of ordinary civil litigation where the propriety of continuing prospective relief is at issue. Cf. <em>Teague </em>v. <em>Lane, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112206"><a href="/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/" aria-description="Citation for case: Teague v. Lane">489 U. S. 288</a></span> (1989) (applying a more stringent standard for recognizing changes in the law and “new rules” in light of the “interests of comity” present in federal habeas corpus proceedings). Given that Rule 60(b)(5) specifically contemplates the grant of relief in the circumstances presented here, it can hardly be said that we have somehow warped the Rule into a means of “allowing an ‘anytime’ rehearing.” See <em>post, </em>at 259 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>
<p id="b273-5">Respondents further contend that “[petitioners’ [proposed [u]se of Rule 60(b) [w]ill [e]rode the [institutional [integrity of the Court.” Brief for Respondents 26. Respondents do not explain how a proper application of Rule 60(b)(5) undermines our legitimacy. Instead, respondents focus on the harm occasioned if we were to overrule <em><span class="citation" data-id="111506"><a href="/opinion/111506/aguilar-v-felton/" aria-description="Citation for case: Aguilar v. Felton">Aguilar</a></span>. </em>But as discussed above, we do no violence to the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>when we recognize bona fide changes in our decisional law. And in those circumstances, we do no violence to the legitimacy we derive from reliance on that doctrine. <em>Casey, </em><span class="citation" data-id="112786"><a href="/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/#865" aria-description="Citation for case: Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey">505 U. S., at 865-866</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b273-6">As a final matter, we see no reason to wait for a “better vehicle” in which to evaluate the impact of subsequent cases on Aguilar’s continued vitality. To evaluate the Rule <page-number citation-index="1" label="240">*240</page-number>60(b)(5) motion properly before us today in no way undermines “integrity in the interpretation of procedural rules” or signals any departure from “the responsive, non-agenda-setting character of this Court.” <em>Post, </em>at 260 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting). Indeed, under these circumstances, it would be particularly inequitable for us to bide our time waiting for another case to arise while the city of New York labors under a continuing injunction forcing it to spend millions of dollars on mobile instructional units and leased sites when it could instead be spending that money to give economically disadvantaged children a better chance at success in life by means of a program that is perfectly consistent with the Establishment Clause.</p>
<p id="b274-5">For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the cases to the District Court with instructions to vacate its September 26, 1985, order.</p>
<p id="b274-6">
<em>It is so ordered.</em>
