You are a legal decision citator. You will be given passage(s) from the Acting Decision along with relevant metadata on the Acting Decision and the Cited Decision. Your task is to determine whether the Acting Decision overruled the Cited Decision.

Strictly adhere to the following definitions and instructions without deviation. Your should think through the instructions step-by-step, and your response must follow the specified output format precisely.

<definitions>
- **Acting Decision**: The legal decision/opinion in which legal arguments are being made. The Acting Decision may reference or cite other decisions as part of its reasoning. It may uphold, overrule, reverse, or otherwise discuss a Cited Decision.
- **Cited Decision**: A previously decided opinion referenced or cited in the Acting Decision. Your task is to determine whether the Acting Decision overruled the Cited Decision.
- **Overruled**: A Cited Decision is considered overruled **only if** the Acting Decision has taken **Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions** to reverse or overrule it.
  - **Explicit Negative Actions**: The Acting Decision directly states that the Cited Decision is overruled or reversed (e.g., using language such as "overruled" or an equivalent phrase).
  - **Implicit Negative Actions**: The Acting Decision undermines the Cited Decision by establishing a conflicting holding that renders it invalid.
</definitions>

<instructions>
1. **Identifying the Cited Decision**
   - You will be given the Cited Decision name as well as the citation number. A Cited Decision may be associated with multiple citation numbers.
   - The Cited Decision may be referred to by its full name, a shortened name, or the citation number. Sometimes the Cited Decision may also be referenced by special languages, such as "as seen in the Cited Decision", "in the Cited Decision", "Id.", "Supra.", or similar phrases.
   - In most cases, the Cited Decision will also be enclosed in <citedDecision> tags. However, you should still determine where in the passages the Cited Decision is mentioned by referring the Cited Decision name and its alternatives.
   - Do **not** get distracted by discussions of cases that are **not** the Cited Decision.

2. **The Only Question That Matters: Did the Acting Decision Overrule the Cited Decision?**
   - You must determine whether the **Acting Decision** overruled the **Cited Decision**.
   - The following **do not** indicate that the Cited Decision has been overruled by the Acting Decision:
     - The Cited Decision overruling another case.
     - Another case overruling the Cited Decision.
     - The Acting Decision overruling a case similar to the Cited Decision.
     - The Acting Decision affirming a case that contradicts the Cited Decision.
     - Discussions of the history of the Cited Decision.
   - The **only** valid conclusion of overruling is when "Acting Decision" explicitly or implicitly overrules "Cited Decision" by means of the majority opinion.

3. **Focus on the Cited Decision**
   - The passage may reference, cite, or otherwise discuss multiple cases, but you must **only** analyze the treatment of the **Cited Decision**.
   - Determine if the **Acting Decision** overruled the **Cited Decision** by identifying **Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions** related to it.
   - Base your decision **solely on the provided passage**â€”do **not** use external legal knowledge.

4. **Mere Discussion of the Cited Decision Does Not Constitute Overruling**
   - Simply **citing, discussing, or criticizing** the **Cited Decision** does **not** mean it is overruled.
   - You must identify clear **Negative Actions** within the passage.
   - Harsh criticism, disagreement, or stating that the Cited Decision is inapplicable **does not** mean it has been overruled.
   - Language such as "the issue decided in the Cited Decision was never at issue in the Acting Decision" does **not** constitute overruling.
   - If the passage does **not** provide enough information to determine if the **Cited Decision** is overruled, output `"no"` in the `"overruled"` field.

5. **Handling Court Opinions and Dissents**
   - The **Cited Decision** is considered **overruled** by the **Acting Decision** only if the **majority opinion** of the court explicitly or implicitly overrules it.
   - Court opinions are categorized as one of the following:
     - **Lead Opinion**
     - **Concurring Opinion**
     - **Dissenting Opinion**
     - **Combined Opinion**
     Each opinion type will be clearly labeled at the beginning of its passage.
   - **Concurring Opinions** and **Dissenting Opinions** may help you determine the **majority opinion**.
   - If there are **Lead Opinions** along with other types of opinions, the **Lead Opinions** should carry the most weight in making the determination.
   - Although **Concurring Opinions** often agree with the **Lead Opinion**, this is not always true. For example, if a **Concurring Opinion** states that the **Cited Decision** is overruled but the **Lead Opinion** does not discuss the Cited Decision, then the **Cited Decision** is **not overruled**.
   - **Dissenting Opinions** always contradict the **majority opinion**. Therefore, the **court's opinion** is the **opposite** of the **Dissenting Opinion**.
   - **Combined Opinions** are a combination of the court's opinions, including footnotes to the opinion.

6. **Avoid Misinterpreting Other References**
   - The **Acting Decision** may mention that another case had overruled the **Cited Decision** or that the **Cited Decision** had overruled a different case.
   - These references **do not** mean the **Acting Decision** itself is overruling the **Cited Decision**.
   - Focus **only** on whether the **Acting Decision** **directly** overruled the **Cited Decision**.

7. **Output Format**
   - Before producing the output, you should first summarize the instructions for the task and identify the **Cited Decision** to ensure you are focused on the correct case.
   - Return your response in **JSON format** with the following fields:
     - `"instructions"` (string): A short summary of the instructions for the task.
     - `"target_case"` (string): The name of the Cited Decision.
     - `"overruled"` (categorical):
       - `"no"`: The Acting Decision did not reverse or overrule the Cited Decision.
       - `"yes"`: The Acting Decision reversed or overruled the Cited Decision due to Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions.
     - `"rationale"` (string): A brief explanation of how you made the determination.
     - `"quote"` (string): A quote from the passage that supports your conclusion.
   - **Do not include** any additional text outside of this JSON response.

The Acting Decision name is: "Alabama v. Western Union Telegraph Co". The Cited Decision name is: "Osborne v. Mobile".
Other references to the Cited Decision may include: "16 Wall. 479", "Osborne v. Mobile", "Osborne", a combination of these references, or any language that refers to the Cited Decision.
The passages from the Acting Decision are: 
**Combined Opinion**:
But it is urged that a portion of the telegraph company's business is internal to the State of Alabama and therefore taxable by the State. But that fact does not remove the difficulty. The tax affects the whole business without discrimination. There are sufficient modes in which the internal business, if not already taxed in some other way, may be subjected to taxation, without the imposition of a tax which covers the entire operations of the company.  
The state court relies upon the case of Osborne v. Mobile, <citedDecision>16 Wall. 479</citedDecision>, which brought up for consideration an ordinance of the city requiring every express company or railroad company doing business in that city and having a business extending beyond the limits of the State to pay an annual license of $500; if the business was confined within the limits of the State, the license fee was only $100; if confined within the city, it was $50; subject in each case to a penalty for neglect or refusal to pay the charge. 
This court held that the ordinance was not unconstitutional. This was in the December term, 1872. In view of the course of decisions that have been made since that time, it is very certain that such an ordinance would now be regarded as repugnant to the power conferred upon Congress to regulate commerce among the several States.

"The Acting Decision name is: "Jackson v. South Savanna Co". The Cited Decision name is: "Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo".
Other references to the Cited Decision may include: "298 U.S. 587", "Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo", "Morehead", a combination of these references, or any language that refers to the Cited Decision.
The passages from the Acting Decision are:
**Lead Opinion**:
That effort at distinction is obviously futile, as it appears that in one of the cases ruled by the Adkins opinion the employee was a woman employed as an elevator operator in a hotel. Adkins v. Lyons, 261 U.S. 525, at p. 542.
The recent case of Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, <citedDecision>298 U.S. 587</citedDecision>, came here on certiorari to the New York court, which had held the New York minimum wage act for women to be invalid. 
A minority of this Court thought that the New York statute was distinguishable in a material feature from that involved in the Adkins case, and that for that and other reasons the New *389 York statute should be sustained. But the Court of Appeals of New York had said that it found no material difference between the two statutes, and this Court held that the "meaning of the statute" as fixed by the decision of the state court "must be accepted here as if the meaning had been specifically expressed in the enactment." Id., p. 609. That view led to the affirmance by this Court of the judgment in the Morehead case, as the Court considered that the only question before it was whether the Adkins case was distinguishable and that reconsideration of that decision had not been sought.
Our conclusion is that the case of Adkins v. Children's Hospital, supra, should be, and it is, overruled. The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington is Affirmed.

**Dissenting Opinion**:
MR. JUSTICE SUTHERLAND, dissenting:
MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER, MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS, MR. JUSTICE BUTLER and I think the judgment of the court below should be reversed.
*401 The principles and authorities relied upon to sustain the judgment, were considered in Adkins v. Children's Hospital, 261 U.S. 525, and Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, <citedDecision>298 U.S. 587</citedDecision>; and their lack of application to cases like the one in hand was pointed out. A sufficient answer to all that is now said will be found in the opinions of the court in those cases. Nevertheless, in the circumstances, it seems well to restate our reasons and conclusions."

  "target_case": "Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo",
  "overruled": "no",
  "rationale": "The Acting Decision indeed overruled a case, but the case overruled is not the Cited Decision. Furthermore, disserting opinion is not the official opinion of the court. It is clear from the lead opinion that the official opinion of the court is to not overrule, but rather to affirm, the Cited Decision."
   "quote": "That view led to the affirmance by this Court of the judgment in the Morehead case, as the Court considered that the only question before it was whether the Adkins case was distinguishable and that reconsideration of that decision had not been sought."
