 .  .  the trial by jury ever has been, and I trust ever will be, looked upon as the glory of the English law. And if it has so great an advantage over others in regulating civil property, how much must that advantage be heightened when it is applied to criminal cases!  ... [I]t is the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy, or wish for, that he cannot be affected either in his property, his *10 liberty, or his person, but by the unanimous consent of twelve of his neighbours and equals.” 13 Trial by jury in a court of law and in accordance with traditional modes of procedure after an indictment by grand jury has served and remains one of our most vital barriers to governmental arbitrariness.  These elemental procedural safeguards were embedded in our Constitution to.  secure their inviolateness and sanctity against the passing demands of expediency or convenience.  The keystone of supporting authorities mustered by the Court’s opinion last June to justify its holding that Art. Ill, § 2, and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments did not apply abroad was In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> .  The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case is one of those cases that cannot be understood except in its peculiar setting; even then, it seems highly unlikely that a similar result would be reached today.  Ross was serving as a seaman on an American ship in Japanese waters.  He killed a ship’s officer, was seized and tried before a consular “court” in Japan.  At that time, statutes authorized American consuls to try American citizens charged with committing crimes in Japan and certain other “non-Christian” countries.  14 These *11 statutes provided that the laws of the United States were to govern the trial except: “.  .  .  where such laws are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies, the common law and the law of equity and admiralty shall be extended in like manner over such citizens and others in those countries; and if neither the common law, nor the law of equity or admiralty, nor the statutes of the United States, furnish appropriate and sufficient remedies, the ministers in those countries, respectively, shall, by decrees and regulations which shall have the force of law, supply such defects and deficiencies.” 15 The consular power approved in the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case was about as extreme and absolute as that of the potentates of the “non-Christian” countries to which the statutes applied.  Under these statutes consuls could and did make the criminal laws, initiate charges, arrest alleged offenders, try them, and after conviction take away their liberty or their life — sometimes at the American consulate.  Such a blending of executive, legislative, and judicial powers in one person or even in one branch of the Government is ordinarily regarded as the very acme of absolutism.  16 Nevertheless, the Court sustained Ross’ conviction by the consul.  It stated that constitutional *12 protections applied “only to citizens and others within the United States, or who are brought there for trial for alleged offences committed elsewhere, and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad.” 17 Despite the fact that it upheld Ross’ conviction under United States laws passed pursuant to asserted constitutional authority, the Court went on to make a sweeping declaration that “[t]he Constitution can have no operation in another country.” 18 The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> approach that the Constitution has no applicability abroad has long since been directly repudiated by numerous cases. 19 That approach is obviously erroneous if the United States Government, which has no power except that granted by the Constitution, can and does try citizens for crimes committed abroad.  20 Thus the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case rested, at least in substantial part, on a fundamental misconception and the most that can be said in support of the result reached there is that the consular court jurisdiction had a long history antedating the adoption of the Constitution.  The Congress has recently buried the consular system of trying Americans.  21 We are not willing to jeopardize the lives and liberties of Americans by disinterring it.  At best, the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case should be left as a relic from a different era.  The Court’s opinion last Term alsp relied on the “Insular Cases” to support its conclusion that Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were not applicable *13 to the trial of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert.  22 We believe that reliance was misplaced.  The “Insular Cases,” which arose at the turn of the century, involved territories which had only recently been conquered or acquired by the United States.  These territories, governed and regulated by Congress under Art. IV, § 3, 23 had entirely different cultures and customs from those of this country.  This Court, although closely divided, 24 ruled that certain constitutional safeguards were not applicable to these territories since they had not been “expressly or impliedly incorporated” into the Union by Congress.  While conceding that “fundamental” constitutional rights applied everywhere, 25 the majority found that it would disrupt long-established practices and would be inexpedient to require a jury trial after an indictment by a grand jury in the insular possessions.

The Government makes the final argument that these civilian dependents are part of the United States military contingent abroad in the eyes of the foreign nations concerned and that their conduct may have a profound effect on our relations with these countries, with a consequent effect on the military establishment there.  But the argument that military court-martials in capital cases are necessitated by this factor assumes either that a military court-martial constitutes a stronger deterrent to this sort of conduct or that, in the absence of such a trial, no punishment would be meted out and our foreign policy thereby injured.  The reasons why these considerations carry no conviction have already been indicated.  I therefore conclude that, in capital cases, the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over civilian dependents in time of peace cannot be justified by Article I, considered in connection with the specific protections of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  Since the conclusion thus reached differs from what the Court decided last Term, a decent respect for the judicial process calls for re-examination of the two grounds that then prevailed.  The Court sustained its action on the *50 authority of the cases dealing with the power of Congress to “make all needful Rules and Regulations” for the Territories, reinforced by In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> , in which this Court, in 1891, sustained the criminal jurisdiction of a consular court in Japan.  5 These authorities grew out of, and related to, specific situations very different from those now here.  They do not control or even embarrass the problem before us.  Legal doctrines are not self-generated abstract categories.  They do not fall from the sky; nor are they pulled out of it.  They have a specific juridical origin and etiology.  They derive meaning and content from the circumstances that gave rise to them and from the purposes they were designed to serve.  To these they are bound as is a live tree to its roots.  Doctrines like those expressed by the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case and the series of cases beginning with American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511 , must be placed in their historical setting.  They cannot be wrenched from it and mechanically transplanted into an alien, unrelated context without suffering mutilation or distortion.  “If a precedent involving a black horse is applied to a case involving a white horse, we are not excited.  If it were an elephant or an animal ferae naturae or a chose in action, then we would venture into thought.  The difference might make a difference.  We really are concerned about precedents chiefly when their facts differ somewhat from the facts in the case at bar.  Then there is a gulf or hiatus that has to be bridged by a concern for principle and a concern for practical results and practical wisdom.” Thomas Reed Powell, Vagaries and Varieties in Constitutional Interpretation, *51 36.

 The process of decision appropriate to the problem led to a detailed examination of the relation of the specific “Territory” to the United States.  This examination, in its similarity to analysis in terms of “due process,” is essentially the same as that to be made in the present cases in weighing congressional power to make “Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces” against the safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  The results in the cases that arose by reason of the acquisition of exotic “Territory” do not control the present cases, for the territorial cases rest specifically on Art. IV, § 3, which is a grant of power to Congress to deal with “Territory” and other Government property.  Of course the power sought to be exercised in Great Britain and Japan does not relate to “Territory.” 7 The Court’s *54 opinions in the territorial cases did not lay down a broad principle that the protective provisions of the Constitution do not apply outside the continental limits of the United States.  This Court considered the particular situation in each newly acquired territory to determine whether the grant to Congress of power to govern “Territory” was restricted by a specific provision of the Constitution.  The territorial cases, in the emphasis put by them on the necessity for considering the specific circumstances of each particular case, are thus relevant in that they provide an illustrative method for harmonizing constitutional provisions which appear, separately considered, to be conflicting.  The Court last Term relied on a second source of authority, the consular court case, In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> .  Pursuant to a treaty with Japan, Ross, a British subject but a member of the crew of a United States ship, was tried and convicted in a consular court in Yokohama for murder of a fellow seaman while the ship was in Yokohama harbor.  His application for a writ of habeas corpus to a United States Circuit Court was denied, 44 F. 185 , and on appeal here, the judgment was affirmed.  This Court set forth the ground of the Circuit Court, “the long and uniform acquiescence by the executive, administrative and legislative departments of the government in the validity of the legislation,” 140 U. S., at. 461, and then stated: “The Circuit Court might have found an additional ground for not calling in question the legislation of Congress, in the uniform practice of civilized governments for centuries to provide consular tribunals in other than Christian countries .  .  .  for the *55 trial of their own subjects or citizens for offences committed in those countries, as well as for the settlement of civil disputes between them; and in the uniform recognition, down to the time of the formation of our government, of the fact that the establishment of such tribunals was among the most important subjects for treaty stipulations.

 .  The Constitution can have no operation in another country.  When, therefore, the representatives or officers of our government are permitted to exercise authority of any kind in another country, it must be on such conditions as the two countries may agree, the laws of neither one being obligatory upon the other.  The deck of a private *56 American vessel, it is true, is considered for many purposes constructively as territory of the United States, yet persons on board of such vessels, whether officers, sailors, or passengers, cannot invoke the protection of the provisions referred to until brought within the actual territorial boundaries of the United States.  .  .  <citedDecision>140 U. S., at 462-464</citedDecision> .  One observation should be made at the outset about the grounds for decision in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> .  Insofar as the opinion expressed a view that the Constitution is not operative outside the United States — and apparently Mr. Justice Field meant by “United States” all lands over which the United States flag flew, see John W. Burgess, How May the United States Govern Its Extra-Continental Territory?, 14 Pol. Sci. Q. 1 (1899) — it expressed a notion that has long since evaporated.  Governmental action abroad is performed under both the authority and the restrictions of the Constitution — for example, proceedings before American military tribunals, whether in Great Britain or in the United States, are subject to the applicable restrictions of the Constitution.  See opinions in Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137 .  The significance of the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case and its relevance to the present cases cannot be assessed unless due regard is accorded the historical context in which that case was decided.  <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> is not rooted in any abstract principle or comprehensive theory touching constitutional power or its restrictions.  It was decided with reference to a very particular, practical problem with a long history.  To be mindful of this does not attribute to Mr. Justice Field’s opinion some unavowed historical assumption.  On behalf of the whole Court, he spelled out the considerations that controlled it: “The practice of European governments to send officers to reside in foreign countries, authorized to *57 exercise a limited jurisdiction over vessels and seamen of their country, to watch the interests of their countrymen and to assist in adjusting their disputes and protecting their commerce, goes back to a very early period, even preceding what are termed the Middle Ages.  ... In other than Christian countries they were, by treaty stipulations, usually clothed with authority to hear complaints against their countrymen and to sit in judgment upon them when charged with public offences.  After the rise of Islamism, and the spread of its followers over eastern Asia and other countries bordering on the Mediterranean, the exercise of this judicial authority became a matter of great concern.  The intense hostility of the people of Moslem faith to all other sects, and particularly to Christians, affected all their intercourse, and all proceedings had in their tribunals.  Even the rules of evidence adopted by them placed those of different faith on unequal grounds in any controversy with them.  For this cause, and by reason of the barbarous and cruel punishments inflicted in those countries, and the frequent use of torture to enforce confession from parties accused, it was a matter of deep interest to Christian governments to withdraw the trial of their subjects, when charged with the commission of a public offence, from the arbitrary and despotic action of the local officials.  Treaties conferring such jurisdiction upon these consuls were essential to the peaceful residence of Christians within those countries and the successful prosecution of commerce with their people.” <citedDecision>140 U. S., at 462-463</citedDecision> .  “It is true that the occasion for consular tribunals in Japan may hereafter be less than at present, as every year that country progresses in civilization and in the assimilation of its system of judicial pro *58 cedure to that of Christian countries, as well as in the improvement of its penal statutes; but the system of consular tribunals ... is of the highest importance, and their establishment in other than Christian countries, where our people may desire to go in pursuit of commerce, will often be essential for the protection of their persons and property.” <citedDecision>Id., at 480</citedDecision> .  8 It is important to have a lively sense of this background before attempting to draw on the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case. Historians have traced grants of extraterritorial rights as far back as the permission given by Egypt in the 12th or 13th century B. C. to the merchants of Tyre to establish factories on the Nile and to live under their own law and practice their own religion.  Numerous other instances of persons living under their own law in foreign lands existed in the later pre-Christian era and during the Roman Empire and the so-called Dark and Middle Ages — Greeks in *59 Egypt, all sorts of foreigners in Rome, inhabitants of Christian cities and states in the Byzantine Empire, the Latin kingdoms of the Levant, and other Christian cities and states, Mohammedans in the Byzantine Empire and China, and many others lived in foreign lands under their own law. While the origins of this extraterritorial jurisdiction may have differed in each country, the notion that law was for the benefit of the citizens of a country and its advantages not for foreigners appears to have been an important factor.  Thus, there existed a long-established custom of extraterritorial jurisdiction at the beginning of the 15th century when the complete conquest of the Byzantine Empire by the Turks and the establishment of the Ottoman Empire substantially altered political relations between Christian Europe and the Near East.  But commercial relations continued, and in 1535 Francis I of France negotiated a treaty with Suleiman I of Turkey that provided for numerous extraterritorial rights, including criminal and civil jurisdiction over all disputes among French subjects.  1 Ernest Char-riére, Négociations de la France dans le Levant 283.  Other nations and eventually the United States in 1830, 8 Stat. 408 , later negotiated similar treaties with the Turks.  (For a more complete history of the development of extraterritorial rights and consular jurisdiction see 1 Calvo, Le Droit International Théorique et Pratique (5th ed., Rousseau, 1896), 2-18, 2 id., 9-12; Hinckley, American Consular Jurisdiction in the Orient, 1-9; 1 Mil-titz, Manuel des Consuls passim; Ravndal, The Origin of the Capitulations and of the Consular Institution, S. Doc. No. 34, 67th Cong., 1st Sess. 5-45, 56-96; Shih Shun Liu, Extraterritoriality, 23-66, 118 Studies in History, Economics and Public Law, Columbia University (1925); Twiss, The Law of Nations (Rev. ed. 1884), 443-457.) *60 The emergence of the nation-state in Europe and the growth of the doctrine of absolute territorial sovereignty changed the nature of extraterritorial rights.  No longer were strangers to be denied the advantages of local law. Indeed, territorial sovereignty meant the exercise of sovereignty over all residents within the borders of the state, and the system of extraterritorial consular jurisdiction tended to die out among Christian nations in the 18th and 19th centuries.  But a new justification was found for the continuation of that jurisdiction in those countries whose systems of justice were considered inferior, and it was this strong feeling with respect to Moslem and Far Eastern countries that was reflected, as we have seen, in the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> opinion.  Until 1842, China had asserted control over all foreigners within its territory, Shih Shun Liu, op. cit. supra, 76-89, but, as a result of the Opium War, Great Britain negotiated a treaty with China whereby she obtained consular offices in five open ports and was granted extraterritorial rights over her citizens.  On July 3, 1844, Caleb Cushing negotiated a similar treaty on behalf of the United States.  8 Stat. 592 .  In a letter to Secretary of State Calhoun, he explained: “I entered China with the formed general conviction that the United States ought not to concede to any foreign state, under any circumstances, jurisdiction over the life and liberty of a citizen of the United States, unless that foreign state be of our own family of nations, — in a word, a Christian state.” Quoted in 7 Op. Atty. Gen. 495, 496-497.  Later treaties continued the extraterritorial rights of the United States, and the Treaty of 1903 contained the following article demonstrating the purpose of those rights: “The Government of China having expressed a strong desire to reform its judicial system and to bring it into accord with that of Western nations, the *61 United States agrees to give every assistance to such reform and will also be prepared to relinquish extraterritorial rights when satisfied that the state of the Chinese laws, the arrangements for their administration, and other considerations warrant it in doing so.” 33 Stat. 2208 , 2215.  The first treaty with Japan was negotiated by Commodore Perry in 1854.

 .” (Appendix, p. 353.) The Statesman's Yearbook of 1890 shows: China at the end of 1888: 1,020 Americans (p. 411); Japan in 1887: 711 Americans (p. 709); Morocco, 1889 estimate: “The number of Christians is very small, not exceeding 1,500.” (P. 739.) The Statesman’s Yearbook of 1901 shows: China at the end of 1899: 2,335 Americans (p. 484); Japan, December 31,1898, just before the termination of our extraterritorial rights: 1,165 Americans (p. 809); Morocco: “The number of Christians does not exceed 6,000; the Christian population of Tangier alone probably amounts to 5,000.” (P. 851.) These figures of course do not include those civilians temporarily in the country coming within consular jurisdiction.  *64 The consular court jurisdiction, then, was exercised in countries whose legal systems at the time were considered so inferior that justice could not be obtained in them by our citizens.  The existence of these courts was based on long-established custom and they were justified as the best possible means for securing justice for the few Americans present in those countries.  The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case, therefore, arose out of, and rests on, very special, confined circumstances, and cannot be applied automatically to the present situation, involving hundreds of thousands of American citizens in countries with civilized systems of justice.  If Congress had established consular courts or some other non-military procedure for trial that did not contain all the protections afforded by Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments for the trial of civilian dependents of military personnel abroad, we would be forced to a detailed analysis of the situation of the civilian dependent population abroad in deciding whether the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case should be extended to cover such a case. It is not necessary to do this in the present cases in view of our decision that the form of trial here provided cannot constitutionally be justified.  The Government, apparently recognizing the constitutional basis for the decision in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> , has, on rehearing, sought to show that civilians in general and civilian dependents in particular have been subject to military order and discipline ever since the colonial period.  The materials it has submitted seem too episodic, too meager, to form a solid basis in history, preceding and contemporaneous with the framing of the Constitution, for constitutional adjudication.  What has been urged on us falls far too short of proving a well-established practice — to be deemed to be infused into the Constitution — of court-martial jurisdiction, certainly not in capital cases, over such civilians in time of peace.  “No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces .  .  .  .” Article 2 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice provides: “The following persons are subject to this code: .

The Court today releases two women from prosecution though the evidence shows that they brutally killed their husbands, both American soldiers, while stationed with them in quarters furnished by our armed forces on its military installations in foreign lands.  In turning these women free, it declares unconstitutional an important section of an Act of Congress governing our armed forces.  Furthermore, four of my brothers would specifically overrule and two would impair the long-recognized vitality of an old and respected precedent in our law, the case of In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U.

And, finally, the Court reverses, sets aside, and overrules two majority opinions and judgments of this Court in these same cases, reported in 351.U.  S., at 470 and 487, and entered on June 11,1956, less than 12 months ago.  In substitute therefor it enters no opinion whatever for the Court. It is unable to muster a majority.  Instead, there are handed down three opinions.  But, worst of all, it gives no authoritative guidance as to what, if anything, the Executive or the Congress may do to remedy the distressing situation in which they now find themselves.  *79 MR. Justice Burton and I remain convinced that the former opinions of the Court are correct and that they set forth valid constitutional doctrine under the long-recognized cases of this Court. The opinions were neither written nor agreed to in haste and they reflect the consensus of the majority reached after thorough discussion at many conferences.

 Upon attack by an enemy they would be so treated; all foreign governments so recognized them at all times; and, in addition, it has been clearly shown, unlike in Toth, that “the discipline of the Army is going to be disrupted, its morale impaired, or its orderly processes disturbed” by excluding them from the provisions of the Uniform Code. Every single one of our major military commanders over the world has filed a statement to this effect in this case. We should not substitute our views as to this necessity for the views of those charged with the responsibility of the protection of such far-flung outposts of the free world.  The former minority, however, repudiates this underlying basis of the opinion in Toth, namely, that where disciplinary measures are necessary to the regulation of the armed forces the Congress does have constitutional power to make rules.  In my opinion the rules it has made are necessary to the regulation of the land and naval forces and the means chosen, the Uniform Code, is in no way an unreasonable one.  There remains the further consideration of whether this provision is “ ‘the least possible power adequate to the end proposed.’ ” United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles, supra, at 23 .  This is the strict standard by which we determine the scope of constitutional power of Congress to authorize trial by court-martial.  A study of the problem clearly indicates that the use of the Uniform Code of Military Justice was really the only practicable alternative available.  While it was conceded before this Court that Congress could have established a system of territorial or consular *87 courts to try offenses committed by civilian .dependents abroad, the action of four of my brothers who would overrule and two who would impair the vitality of In re <citedDecision>Ross, supra,</citedDecision> places this alternative in jeopardy.  Territorial courts have been used by our Government for over a century and have always received the sanction of this Court until today.  However, in the light of all of the opinions of the former minority here, the use of a system of territorial or consular courts is now out of the question.  Moreover, Congress probably had concluded to abandon this system before the Uniform Code was adopted, since a short time thereafter the jurisdiction of the last of our territorial or consular courts was terminated.  70 Stat. 773 .  Another alternative the Congress might have adopted was the establishment of federal courts pursuant to Article III of the Constitution.  These constitutional courts would have to sit in each of the 63 foreign countries where American troops are stationed at the present time.

These elemental procedural safeguards were embedded in our Constitution to secure their inviolateness and sanctity against the passing demands of expediency or convenience.

The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case is one of those cases that cannot be understood except in its peculiar setting; even then, it seems highly unlikely that a similar result would be reached today.  Ross was serving as a seaman on an American ship in Japanese waters.  He killed a ship's officer, was seized and tried before a consular "court" in Japan.  At that time, statutes authorized American consuls to try American citizens charged with committing crimes in Japan and certain other "non-Christian" countries.  [14] These *11 statutes provided that the laws of the United States were to govern the trial except: ".  .  .  where such laws are not adapted to the object, or are deficient in the provisions necessary to furnish suitable remedies, the common law and the law of equity and admiralty shall be extended in like manner over such citizens and others in those countries; and if neither the common law, nor the law of equity or admiralty, nor the statutes of the United States, furnish appropriate and sufficient remedies, the ministers in those countries, respectively, shall, by decrees and regulations which shall have the force of law, supply such defects and deficiencies." [15] The consular power approved in the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case was about as extreme and absolute as that of the potentates of the "non-Christian" countries to which the statutes applied.  Under these statutes consuls could and did make the criminal laws, initiate charges, arrest alleged offenders, try them, and after conviction take away their liberty or their lifesometimes at the American consulate.  Such a blending of executive, legislative, and judicial powers in one person or even in one branch of the Government is ordinarily regarded as the very acme of absolutism.  [16] Nevertheless, the Court sustained Ross' conviction by the consul.  It stated that constitutional *12 protections applied "only to citizens and others within the United States, or who are brought there for trial for alleged offences committed elsewhere, and not to residents or temporary sojourners abroad." [17] Despite the fact that it upheld Ross' conviction under United States laws passed pursuant to asserted constitutional authority, the Court went on to make a sweeping declaration that "[t]he Constitution can have no operation in another country." [18] The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> approach that the Constitution has no applicability abroad has long since been directly repudiated by numerous cases. [19] That approach is obviously erroneous if the United States Government, which has no power except that granted by the Constitution, can and does try citizens for crimes committed abroad.  [20] Thus the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case rested, at least in substantial part, on a fundamental misconception and the most that can be said in support of the result reached there is that the consular court jurisdiction had a long history antedating the adoption of the Constitution.  The Congress has recently buried the consular system of trying Americans.  [21] We are not willing to jeopardize the lives and liberties of Americans by disinterring it.  At best, the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case should be left as a relic from a different era.  The Court's opinion last Term also relied on the "Insular Cases" to support its conclusion that Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments were not applicable *13 to the trial of Mrs. Smith and Mrs. Covert.  [22] We believe that reliance was misplaced.  The "Insular Cases," which arose at the turn of the century, involved territories which had only recently been conquered or acquired by the United States.  These territories, governed and regulated by Congress under Art. IV, § 3, [23] had entirely different cultures and customs from those of this country.  This Court, although closely divided, [24] ruled that certain constitutional safeguards were not applicable to these territories since they had not been "expressly or impliedly incorporated" into the Union by Congress.  While conceding that "fundamental" constitutional rights applied everywhere, [25] the majority found that it would disrupt long-established practices and would be inexpedient to require a jury trial after an indictment by a grand jury in the insular possessions.

I therefore conclude that, in capital cases, the exercise of court-martial jurisdiction over civilian dependents in time of peace cannot be justified by Article I, considered in connection with the specific protections of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  Since the conclusion thus reached differs from what the Court decided last Term, a decent respect for the judicial process calls for re-examination of the two grounds that then prevailed.  The Court sustained its action on the *50 authority of the cases dealing with the power of Congress to "make all needful Rules and Regulations" for the Territories, reinforced by In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> , in which this Court, in 1891, sustained the criminal jurisdiction of a consular court in Japan.  [5] These authorities grew out of, and related to, specific situations very different from those now here.  They do not control or even embarrass the problem before us.  Legal doctrines are not self-generated abstract categories.  They do not fall from the sky; nor are they pulled out of it.  They have a specific juridical origin and etiology.  They derive meaning and content from the circumstances that gave rise to them and from the purposes they were designed to serve.  To these they are bound as is a live tree to its roots.  Doctrines like those expressed by the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case and the series of cases beginning with American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 511 , must be placed in their historical setting.  They cannot be wrenched from it and mechanically transplanted into an alien, unrelated context without suffering mutilation or distortion.  "If a precedent involving a black horse is applied to a case involving a white horse, we are not excited.  If it were an elephant or an animal ferae naturae or a chose in action, then we would venture into thought.  The difference might make a difference.  We really are concerned about precedents chiefly when their facts differ somewhat from the facts in the case at bar.  Then there is a gulf or hiatus that has to be bridged by a concern for principle and a concern for practical results and practical wisdom."
**Combined Opinion**
 This examination, in its similarity to analysis in terms of "due process," is essentially the same as that to be made in the present cases in weighing congressional power to make "Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces" against the safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  The results in the cases that arose by reason of the acquisition of exotic "Territory" do not control the present cases, for the territorial cases rest specifically on Art. IV, § 3, which is a grant of power to Congress to deal with "Territory" and other Government property.  Of course the power sought to be exercised in Great Britain and Japan does not relate to "Territory." [7] The Court's *54 opinions in the territorial cases did not lay down a broad principle that the protective provisions of the Constitution do not apply outside the continental limits of the United States.  This Court considered the particular situation in each newly acquired territory to determine whether the grant to Congress of power to govern "Territory" was restricted by a specific provision of the Constitution.  The territorial cases, in the emphasis put by them on the necessity for considering the specific circumstances of each particular case, are thus relevant in that they provide an illustrative method for harmonizing constitutional provisions which appear, separately considered, to be conflicting.  The Court last Term relied on a second source of authority, the consular court case, In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> .  Pursuant to a treaty with Japan, Ross, a British subject but a member of the crew of a United States ship, was tried and convicted in a consular court in Yokohama for murder of a fellow seaman while the ship was in Yokohama harbor.  His application for a writ of habeas corpus to a United States Circuit Court was denied, 44 F. 185 , and on appeal here, the judgment was affirmed.  This Court set forth the ground of the Circuit Court, "the long and uniform acquiescence by the executive, administrative and legislative departments of the government in the validity of the legislation," <citedDecision>140 U. S., at 461</citedDecision> , and then stated: "The Circuit Court might have found an additional ground for not calling in question the legislation of Congress, in the uniform practice of civilized governments for centuries to provide consular tribunals in other than Christian countries .  .  .  for the *55 trial of their own subjects or citizens for offences committed in those countries, as well as for the settlement of civil disputes between them; and in the uniform recognition, down to the time of the formation of our government, of the fact that the establishment of such tribunals was among the most important subjects for treaty stipulations.  .  .  .

 The Constitution can have no operation in another country.  When, therefore, the representatives or officers of our government are permitted to exercise authority of any kind in another country, it must be on such conditions as the two countries may agree, the laws of neither one being obligatory upon the other.  The deck of a private *56 American vessel, it is true, is considered for many purposes constructively as territory of the United States, yet persons on board of such vessels, whether officers, sailors, or passengers, cannot invoke the protection of the provisions referred to until brought within the actual territorial boundaries of the United States.  .  .  ." <citedDecision>140 U. S., at 462-464</citedDecision> .  One observation should be made at the outset about the grounds for decision in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> .  Insofar as the opinion expressed a view that the Constitution is not operative outside the United Statesand apparently Mr. Justice Field meant by "United States" all lands over which the United States flag flew, see John W. Burgess, How May the United States Govern Its Extra-Continental Territory?, 14 Pol. Sci. Q.1 (1899)it expressed a notion that has long since evaporated.  Governmental action abroad is performed under both the authority and the restrictions of the Constitutionfor example, proceedings before American military tribunals, whether in Great Britain or in the United States, are subject to the applicable restrictions of the Constitution.  See opinions in Burns v. Wilson, 346 U. S. 137 .  The significance of the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case and its relevance to the present cases cannot be assessed unless due regard is accorded the historical context in which that case was decided.  <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> is not rooted in any abstract principle or comprehensive theory touching constitutional power or its restrictions.  It was decided with reference to a very particular, practical problem with a long history.  To be mindful of this does not attribute to Mr. Justice Field's opinion some unavowed historical assumption.  On behalf of the whole Court, he spelled out the considerations that controlled it: "The practice of European governments to send officers to reside in foreign countries, authorized to *57 exercise a limited jurisdiction over vessels and seamen of their country, to watch the interests of their countrymen and to assist in adjusting their disputes and protecting their commerce, goes back to a very early period, even preceding what are termed the Middle Ages.  .  .  .  In other than Christian countries they were, by treaty stipulations, usually clothed with authority to hear complaints against their countrymen and to sit in judgment upon them when charged with public offences.  After the rise of Islamism, and the spread of its followers over eastern Asia and other countries bordering on the Mediterranean, the exercise of this judicial authority became a matter of great concern.  The intense hostility of the people of Moslem faith to all other sects, and particularly to Christians, affected all their intercourse, and all proceedings had in their tribunals.  Even the rules of evidence adopted by them placed those of different faith on unequal grounds in any controversy with them.  For this cause, and by reason of the barbarous and cruel punishments inflicted in those countries, and the frequent use of torture to enforce confession from parties accused, it was a matter of deep interest to Christian governments to withdraw the trial of their subjects, when charged with the commission of a public offence, from the arbitrary and despotic action of the local officials.  Treaties conferring such jurisdiction upon these consuls were essential to the peaceful residence of Christians within those countries and the successful prosecution of commerce with their people." <citedDecision>140 U. S., at 462-463</citedDecision> .  "It is true that the occasion for consular tribunals in Japan may hereafter be less than at present, as every year that country progresses in civilization and in the assimilation of its system of judicial procedure *58 to that of Christian countries, as well as in the improvement of its penal statutes; but the system of consular tribunals .  .  .  is of the highest importance, and their establishment in other than Christian countries, where our people may desire to go in pursuit of commerce, will often be essential for the protection of their persons and property." <citedDecision>Id., at 480</citedDecision> .  [8] It is important to have a lively sense of this background before attempting to draw on the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case. Historians have traced grants of extraterritorial rights as far back as the permission given by Egypt in the 12th or 13th century B. C. to the merchants of Tyre to establish factories on the Nile and to live under their own law and practice their own religion.  Numerous other instances of persons living under their own law in foreign lands existed in the later pre-Christian era and during the Roman Empire and the so-called Dark and Middle AgesGreeks in *59 Egypt, all sorts of foreigners in Rome, inhabitants of Christian cities and states in the Byzantine Empire, the Latin kingdoms of the Levant, and other Christian cities and states, Mohammedans in the Byzantine Empire and China, and many others lived in foreign lands under their own law. While the origins of this extraterritorial jurisdiction may have differed in each country, the notion that law was for the benefit of the citizens of a country and its advantages not for foreigners appears to have been an important factor.  Thus, there existed a long-established custom of extraterritorial jurisdiction at the beginning of the 15th century when the complete conquest of the Byzantine Empire by the Turks and the establishment of the Ottoman Empire substantially altered political relations between Christian Europe and the Near East.  But commercial relations continued, and in 1535 Francis I of France negotiated a treaty with Suleiman I of Turkey that provided for numerous extraterritorial rights, including criminal and civil jurisdiction over all disputes among French subjects.  1 Ernest Charriere, Negociations de la France dans le Levant 283.  Other nations and eventually the United States in 1830, 8 Stat. 408 , later negotiated similar treaties with the Turks.  (For a more complete history of the development of extraterritorial rights and consular jurisdiction see 1 Calvo, Le Droit International Theorique et Pratique (5th ed., Rousseau, 1896), 2-18, 2 id., 9-12; Hinckley, American Consular Jurisdiction in the Orient, 1-9; 1 Miltitz, Manuel des Consuls passim; Ravndal, The Origin of the Capitulations and of the Consular Institution, S. Doc. No. 34, 67th Cong., 1st Sess. 5-45, 56-96; Shih Shun Liu, Extraterritoriality, 23-66, 118 Studies in History, Economics and Public Law, Columbia University (1925); Twiss, The Law of Nations (Rev. ed. 1884), 443-457.) *60 The emergence of the nation-state in Europe and the growth of the doctrine of absolute territorial sovereignty changed the nature of extraterritorial rights.  No longer were strangers to be denied the advantages of local law. Indeed, territorial sovereignty meant the exercise of sovereignty over all residents within the borders of the state, and the system of extraterritorial consular jurisdiction tended to die out among Christian nations in the 18th and 19th centuries.  But a new justification was found for the continuation of that jurisdiction in those countries whose systems of justice were considered inferior, and it was this strong feeling with respect to Moslem and Far Eastern countries that was reflected, as we have seen, in the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> opinion.  Until 1842, China had asserted control over all foreigners within its territory, Shih Shun Liu, op. cit. supra, 76-89, but, as a result of the Opium War, Great Britain negotiated a treaty with China whereby she obtained consular offices in five open ports and was granted extraterritorial rights over her citizens.  On July 3, 1844, Caleb Cushing negotiated a similar treaty on behalf of the United States.  8 Stat. 592 .  In a letter to Secretary of State Calhoun, he explained: "I entered China with the formed general conviction that the United States ought not to concede to any foreign state, under any circumstances, jurisdiction over the life and liberty of a citizen of the United States, unless that foreign state be of our own family of nations,in a word, a Christian state." Quoted in 7 Op. Atty. Gen. 495, 496-497.  Later treaties continued the extraterritorial rights of the United States, and the Treaty of 1903 contained the following article demonstrating the purpose of those rights: "The Government of China having expressed a strong desire to reform its judicial system and to bring it into accord with that of Western nations, the *61 United States agrees to give every assistance to such reform and will also be prepared to relinquish extraterritorial rights when satisfied that the state of the Chinese laws, the arrangements for their administration, and other considerations warrant it in doing so." 33 Stat. 2208 , 2215.
**Combined Opinion**
(P. 739.) The Statesman's Yearbook of 1901 shows: China at the end of 1899: 2,335 Americans (p. 484); Japan, December 31, 1898, just before the termination of our extraterritorial rights: 1,165 Americans (p. 809); Morocco: "The number of Christians does not exceed 6,000; the Christian population of Tangier alone probably amounts to 5,000." (P. 851.) These figures of course do not include those civilians temporarily in the country coming within consular jurisdiction.  *64 The consular court jurisdiction, then, was exercised in countries whose legal systems at the time were considered so inferior that justice could not be obtained in them by our citizens.  The existence of these courts was based on long-established custom and they were justified as the best possible means for securing justice for the few Americans present in those countries.  The <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case, therefore, arose out of, and rests on, very special, confined circumstances, and cannot be applied automatically to the present situation, involving hundreds of thousands of American citizens in countries with civilized systems of justice.  If Congress had established consular courts or some other non-military procedure for trial that did not contain all the protections afforded by Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments for the trial of civilian dependents of military personnel abroad, we would be forced to a detailed analysis of the situation of the civilian dependent population abroad in deciding whether the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> case should be extended to cover such a case. It is not necessary to do this in the present cases in view of our decision that the form of trial here provided cannot constitutionally be justified.  The Government, apparently recognizing the constitutional basis for the decision in <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> , has, on rehearing, sought to show that civilians in general and civilian dependents in particular have been subject to military order and discipline ever since the colonial period.  The materials it has submitted seem too episodic, too meager, to form a solid basis in history, preceding and contemporaneous with the framing of the Constitution, for constitutional adjudication.  What has been urged on us falls far too short of proving a well-established practiceto be deemed to be infused into the Constitutionof court-martial jurisdiction, certainly not in capital cases, over such civilians in time of peace.  *65 MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the result.  I concur in the result, on the narrow ground that where the offense is capital, Article 2 (11) [1] cannot constitutionally be applied to the trial of civilian dependents of members of the armed forces overseas in times of peace.  Since I am the only one among today's majority who joined in the Court's opinions of June 11, 1956, which sustained the court-martial jurisdiction in these cases, 351 U. S. 470, 487 , I think it appropriate to state the reasons which led to my voting, first, to rehear these cases, 352 U. S. 901 , and, now, to strike down that jurisdiction.  I.  The petitions for rehearing which were filed last summer afforded an opportunity for a greater degree of reflection upon the difficult issues involved in these cases than, at least for me, was possible in the short interval between the argument and decision of the cases in the closing days of last Term. [2] As a result I became satisfied that this court-martial jurisdiction could in any event not be sustained upon the reasoning of our prior opinion.  In essence, that reasoning was this: (1) Under In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> , and the Insular Cases, [3] the requirement of a trial by an Article III court and the other specific safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments are not applicable to the trial of American citizens outside the United States; (2) there is thus no express constitutional prohibition against the use of courts-martial *66 for such trials abroad; (3) the choice of a court-martial in cases such as these was "reasonable," because of these women's connection with the military, and therefore satisfied due process; (4) the court-martial jurisdiction was thus constitutional.  I have since concluded that this analysis was not sound, for two reasons: (1) The underlying premise of the prior opinion, it seems to me, is that under the Constitution the mere absence of a prohibition against an asserted power, plus the abstract reasonableness of its use, is enough to establish the existence of the power.  I think this is erroneous.  The powers of Congress, unlike those of the English Parliament, are constitutionally circumscribed.  Under the Constitution Congress has only such powers as are expressly granted or those that are implied as reasonably necessary and proper to carry out the granted powers.  Hence the constitutionality of the statute here in question must be tested, not by abstract notions of what is reasonable "in the large," so to speak, but by whether the statute, as applied in these instances, is a reasonably necessary and proper means of implementing a power granted to Congress by the Constitution.  To say that the validity of the statute may be rested upon the inherent "sovereign powers" of this country in its dealings with foreign nations seems to me to be no more than begging the question.  As I now see it, the validity of this court-martial jurisdiction must depend upon whether the statute, as applied to these women, can be justified as an exercise of the power, granted to Congress by Art. I, § 8, cl. 14 of the Constitution, "To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." I can find no other constitutional power to which this statute can properly be related.  I therefore think that we were wrong last Term in considering that we need not decide *67 the case in terms of the Article I power.  In my opinion that question squarely confronts us.  (2) I also think that we were mistaken in interpreting <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases as standing for the sweeping proposition that the safeguards of Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments automatically have no application to the trial of American citizens outside the United States, no matter what the circumstances.  Aside from the questionable wisdom of mortgaging the future by such a broad pronouncement, I am satisfied that our prior holding swept too lightly over the historical context in which this Court upheld the jurisdiction of the old consular and territorial courts in those cases. I shall not repeat what my brother FRANKFURTER has written on this subject, with which I agree.  But I do not go as far as my brother BLACK seems to go on this score.  His opinion, if I understand it correctly, in effect discards <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases as historical anomalies.  I believe that those cases, properly understood, still have vitality, and that, for reasons suggested later, which differ from those given in our prior opinions, they have an important bearing on the question now before us.  II.  I come then to the question whether this court-martial jurisdiction can be justified as an exercise of Congress' Article I power to regulate the armed forces.  At the outset, I cannot accept the implication of my brother BLACK'S opinion that this Article I power was intended to be unmodified by the Necessary and Proper Clause of the Constitution, [4] and that therefore this power *68 is incapable of expansion under changing circumstances.  The historical evidence, in fact, shows quite the opposite.  True, the records of the time indicate that the Founders shared a deep fear of an unchecked military branch.
**Combined Opinion**
 In the absence of a supporting judicial system responsive to the same government as the military, such as is the case existing in the United States and overseas possessions, and as the law enforcement requirement stems primarily from the immediate unalterable responsibilities of the overseas commander and his subordinate commanders, it is essential that the commander be vested with the law enforcement authority commensurate with his responsibilities." It seems to me clear on such a basis that these dependents, when sent overseas by the Government, become pro tanto a part of the military community.  I cannot say, therefore, that it is irrational or arbitrary for Congress to subject them to military discipline.  I do not deal now, of course, with the problem of alternatives to court-martial jurisdiction; all that needs to be established at this stage is that, viewing Art. I, § 8, cl. 14 in isolation, subjection of civilian dependents overseas to court-martial jurisdiction can in no wise be deemed unrelated to the power of Congress to make all necessary and proper laws to insure the effective governance of our overseas land and naval forces.  *74 B. I turn now to the other side of the coin.  For no matter how practical and how reasonable this jurisdiction might be, it still cannot be sustained if the Constitution guarantees to these army wives a trial in an Article III court, with indictment by grand jury and jury trial as provided by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  We return, therefore, to the <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> question: to what extent do these provisions of the Constitution apply outside the United States?  As I have already stated, I do not think that it can be said that these safeguards of the Constitution are never operative without the United States, regardless of the particular circumstances.  On the other hand, I cannot agree with the suggestion that every provision of the Constitution must always be deemed automatically applicable to American citizens in every part of the world.  For <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases do stand for an important proposition, one which seems to me a wise and necessary gloss on our Constitution.  The proposition is, of course, not that the Constitution "does not apply" overseas, but that there are provisions in the Constitution which do not necessarily apply in all circumstances in every foreign place.  In other words, it seems to me that the basic teaching of <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases is that there is no rigid and abstract rule that Congress, as a condition precedent to exercising power over Americans overseas, must exercise it subject to all the guarantees of the Constitution, no matter what the conditions and considerations are that would make adherence to a specific guarantee altogether impracticable and anomalous.  To take but one example: Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 U. S. 298 , is not good authority for the proposition that jury trials need never be provided for American citizens tried by *75 the United States abroad; but the case is good authority for the proposition that there is no rigid rule that jury trial must always be provided in the trial of an American overseas, if the circumstances are such that trial by jury would be impractical and anomalous.  In other words, what <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases hold is that the particular local setting, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives are relevant to a question of judgment, namely, whether jury trial should be deemed a necessary condition of the exercise of Congress' power to provide for the trial of Americans overseas.  I think the above thought is crucial in approaching the cases before us.  Decision is easy if one adopts the constricting view that these constitutional guarantees as a totality do or do not "apply" overseas.  But, for me, the question is which guarantees of the Constitution should apply in view of the particular circumstances, the practical necessities, and the possible alternatives which Congress had before it.  The question is one of judgment, not of compulsion.  And so I agree with my brother FRANKFURTER that, in view of <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases, we have before us a question analogous, ultimately, to issues of due process; one can say, in fact, that the question of which specific safeguards of the Constitution are appropriately to be applied in a particular context overseas can be reduced to the issue of what process is "due" a defendant in the particular circumstances of a particular case. On this basis, I cannot agree with the sweeping proposition that a full Article III trial, with indictment and trial by jury, is required in every case for the trial of a civilian dependent of a serviceman overseas.  The Government, it seems to me, has made an impressive showing that at least for the run-of-the-mill offenses committed by dependents overseas, such a requirement would *76 be as impractical and as anomalous as it would have been to require jury trial for Balzac in Porto Rico.  [12] Again, I need not go into details, beyond stating that except for capital offenses, such as we have here, to which, in my opinion, special considerations apply, I am by no means ready to say that Congress' power to provide for trial by court-martial of civilian dependents overseas is limited by Article III and the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.  *77 Where, if at all, the dividing line should be drawn among cases not capital, need not now be decided.  We are confronted here with capital offenses alone; and it seems to me particularly unwise now to decide more than we have to.  Our far-flung foreign military establishments are a new phenomenon in our national life, and I think it would be unfortunate were we unnecessarily to foreclose, as my four brothers would do, our future consideration of the broad questions involved in maintaining the effectiveness of these national outposts, in the light of continuing experience with these problems.  So far as capital cases are concerned, I think they stand on quite a different footing than other offenses.  In such cases the law is especially sensitive to demands for that procedural fairness which inheres in a civilian trial where the judge and trier of fact are not responsive to the command of the convening authority.  I do not concede that whatever process is "due" an offender faced with a fine or a prison sentence necessarily satisfies the requirements of the Constitution in a capital case. The distinction is by no means novel, compare Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45 , with Betts v. Brady, 316 U. S. 455 ; nor is it negligible, being literally that between life and death.  And, under what I deem to be the correct view of <citedDecision>Ross</citedDecision> and the Insular Cases, it is precisely the kind of distinction which plays a large role in the process of weighing the competing considerations which lead to sound judgment upon the question whether certain safeguards of the Constitution should be given effect in the trial of an American citizen abroad.  In fact, the Government itself has conceded that one grave offense, treason, presents a special case: "The gravity of this offense is such that we can well assume that, whatever difficulties may be involved in trial far from the scene of the offense .  .  .  the trial should be in our courts." I see no reason for not applying the same principle to any case where a civilian *78 dependent stands trial on pain of life itself.  The number of such cases would appear to be so negligible that the practical problems of affording the defendant a civilian trial would not present insuperable problems.  On this narrow ground I concur in the result in these cases. MR. JUSTICE CLARK, with whom MR. JUSTICE BURTON joins, dissenting.  The Court today releases tow women from prosecution though the evidence shows that they brutally killed their husbands, both American soldiers, while stationed with them in quarters furnished by our armed forces on its military installations in foreign lands.  In turning these women free, it declares unconstitutional an important section of an Act of Congress governing our armed forces.  Furthermore, four of my brothers would specifically over-rule and two would impair the long-recognized vitality of an old and respected precedent in our law, the case of In re Ross, <citedDecision>140 U. S. 453</citedDecision> (1891), cited by this Court with approval in many opinions and as late as 1929 by a unanimous Court [1] in Ex parte Bakelite Corp., 279 U. S. 438, 451 .  And, finally, the Court reverses, sets aside, and overrules two majority opinions and judgments of this Court in these same cases, reported in 351 U. S., at 470 and 487, and entered on June 11, 1956, less than 12 months ago.  In substitute therefor it enters no opinion whatever for the Court. It is unable to muster a majority.  Instead, there are handed down three opinions.  But, worst of all, it gives no authoritative guidance as to what, if anything, the Executive or the Congress may do to remedy the distressing situation in which they now find themselves.  *79 MR. JUSTICE BURTON and I remain convinced that the former opinions of the Court are correct and that they set forth valid constitutional doctrine under the long-recognized cases of this Court. The opinions were neither written nor agreed to in haste and they reflect the consensus of the majority reached after thorough discussion at many conferences.  In fact, the cases were here longer both before and after argument than many of the cases we decide.
