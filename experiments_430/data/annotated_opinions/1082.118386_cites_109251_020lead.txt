 B Respondents filed suit in December 1985, alleging, among other things, that Chapter 2, as applied in Jefferson Parish, *804 violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution.  The ease’s tortuous history-over the next 15 years indicates well the degree to which our Establishment Clause jurisprudence has shifted in recent times, while nevertheless retaining anomalies with which the lower courts have had to struggle.  In 1990, after extended discovery, Chief Judge Heebe of the District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana granted summary judgment in favor of respondents.  Helms v. Cody, Civ. A. No. 85-5533, 1990 WL 36124 (Mar. 27), App. to Pet. for Cert. 137a.  He held that Chapter 2 violated the Establishment Clause because, under the second part of our three-part test in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U. S. 602, 612-613 (1971), the program had the primary effect of advancing religion.  Chapter 2 had sueh effect, in his view, because the materials and equipment loaned to the Catholic schools were direct aid to those schools and because the Catholic schools were, he concluded after detailed inquiry into their doctrine and curriculum, “pervasively sectarian.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 151a.  Chief Judge Heebe relied primarily on Meek v. Pittenger, <citedDecision>421 U. S. 349</citedDecision> (1975), and Wolman v. Walter, 433 U. S. 229 (1977), in which we held unconstitutional programs that provided many of the same sorts of materials and equipment as does Chapter 2.  In 1994, after having resolved the numerous other issues in the ease, he issued an order permanently excluding pervasively sectarian schools in Jefferson Parish from receiving any Chapter 2 materials or equipment.  Two years later, Chief Judge Heebe having retired, Judge Livaudais received the ease.  Ruling in early 1997 on post-judgment motions, he reversed the decision of former Chief Judge Heebe and upheld Chapter 2, pointing to several significant changes in the legal landscape over the previous seven years.  Helms v. Cody, 1997 WL 35283 (Jan. 28), App. to Pet. for Cert. 79a.  In particular, Judge Livaudais cited our 1993 decision in Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dish, 509 U. S. 1 , in which we held that a State could, as part *805 of a federal program for the disabled, provide a sign-language interpreter to a deaf student at a Catholic high school.  Judge Livaudais also relied heavily on a 1995 decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, Walker v. San Francisco Unified School Dist., 46 F. 3d 1449 , upholding Chapter 2 on facts that he found “virtually indistinguishable.” The Ninth Circuit acknowledged in Walker, as Judge Heebe had in his 1990 summary judgment ruling, that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman appeared to erect a constitutional distinction between providing textbooks (permissible) and providing any other in-kind aid (impermissible).  46 F. 3d, at 1464-1465; see Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen, 392 U. S. 236 (1968) (upholding textbook program).  The Court of Appeals viewed this distinction, however, as “thin” and “unmoored from any Establishment Clause principles,” and, more importantly, as “rendered untenable” by subsequent cases, particularly Zobrest.  46 F. 3d, at 1465-1466.  These cases, in the Ninth Circuit’s view, revived the principle of Allen and of Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing; 3 that “state benefits provided to all citizens without regard to religion are constitutional.” 46 F. 3d, at 1465.  The Ninth Circuit also relied, id., at 1467, on our observation in Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U. S. 687 (1994), that “we have frequently relied explicitly on the general availability of any benefit provided religious groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges,” id., at 704 .  The Ninth Circuit purported to distinguish <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman based on the percentage of schools receiving aid that were parochial (a large percentage in those cases and a moderate percentage in Walker), 46 F. 3d, at 1468, but that court undermined this distinction when it observed that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> also upheld “the massive provision of text *806 books to parochial schools.” 46 F. 3d, at 1468, n. 16.  Thus, although the Ninth Circuit did not explicitly hold that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman were no longer good law, its reasoning seemed to require that conclusion.  Finally, in addition to relying on our decision in Zobrest and the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Walker, Judge Livaudais invoked Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 615 U. S. 819 (1995), in which, a few months after Walker, we held that the Establishment Clause does not require a public university to exclude a student-run religious publication from assistance available to numerous other student-run publications.  Following Judge Livaudais’ ruling, respondents appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  While that appeal was pending, we decided Agostini , in which we approved a program that, under Title I of the ESEA, provided public employees to teach remedial classes at private schools, including religious schools.  In so holding, we overruled Aguilar v. Felton, 473 U. S. 402 (1985), and partially overruled School Dish of Grand Rapids v. Ball, 473 U. S. 373 (1985), both of which had involved such a program.  The Fifth Circuit thus faced a dilemma between, on the one hand, the Ninth Circuit’s holding and analysis in Walker and our subsequent decisions in Rosenberger and Agostini , and, on the other hand, our holdings in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman .  To resolve the dilemma, the Fifth Circuit abandoned any effort to find coherence in our ease law or to divine the future course of our decisions and instead focused on our particular holdings.  Helms v. Picard, 151 F. 3d 347, 371 (1998).  It thought such an approach required not only by the lack of coherence but also by Agostini’s admonition to lower courts to abide by any applicable holding of this Court even though that holding might seem inconsistent with our subsequent decisions, see Agostini, 521 U. S., at 237 .  The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that Agostini , by recognizing our rejection of the rule that “all government aid that directly assists the *807 educational function of religious schools is invalid,” id., at 225 , had rejected a premise of <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , hut that court nevertheless concluded that Agostini had neither directly overruled <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman nor rejected their distinction between textbooks and other in-kind aid.  The Fifth Circuit therefore concluded that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman controlled, and thus it held Chapter 2 unconstitutional.  We granted certiorari.  527 U. S. 1002 (1999).  II The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment dictates that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.” In the over 50 years since Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U. S. 1 (1947), we have consistently struggled to apply these simple words in the context of governmental aid to religious schools.  4 As we admitted in Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U. S. 672 (1971), “candor compels the acknowledgment that we can only dimly perceive the boundaries of permissible government activity in this sensitive area.” Id., at 678 (plurality opinion); see Lemon, 403 U. S., at 671 (White, J., concurring in judgment).  In Agostini , however, we brought some clarity to our ease law, by overruling two anomalous precedents (one in whole, the other in part) and by consolidating some of our previously disparate considerations under a revised test.  Whereas in Lemon we had considered whether a statute (1) has a secular purpose, (2) has a primary effect of advancing or inhibiting religion, or (3) creates an excessive entanglement between government and religion, see 403 U. S., at 612-613, in Agostini we modified Lemon for purposes of evaluating aid to schools and examined only the first and second factors, see 521 U. S., at 222-223 .

 509 U. S., at 13, n. 11 .) We rejected the dissent’s objection that we had never before allowed “a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination.” See id., at 18 (opinion of Blaekmun, J.).  Finally, in Agostini itself, we used the reasoning of Witters and Zobrest to conclude that remedial classes provided under Title I of the ESEA by public employees did not impermissibly finance religious indoctrination.  521 U. S., at 228 ; see id., at 230-232 .  We found it insignificant that students did not have to direetly apply for Title I services, that Title I instruction was provided to students in groups rather than individually, and that instruction was provided in the facilities of the private schools.  Id., at 226-229 .  To the extent that respondents intend their direct/indireet distinction to require that any aid be literally placed in the hands of schoolchildren rather than given directly to the school for teaching those same children, the very cases on which respondents most rely, <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman , demonstrate the irrelevance of such formalism.  In <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , we justified our rejection of a program that loaned instructional materials and equipment by, among other things, pointing out that the aid was loaned to the schools, and thus was “direct *818 aid.” <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 362-363</citedDecision> .  The materials-and-equipment program in Wolman was essentially identical, except that the State, in an effort to comply with <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , see Wolman, 433 U. S., at 233, 250 , loaned the aid to the students.  (The revised program operated much like the one we upheld in Allen.  Compare Wolman, supra, at 248 , with Allen, 392 U. S., at 243-245 .) Yet we dismissed as “technical” the difference between the two programs: “[I]t would exalt form over substance if this distinction were found to justify a result different from that in Meek.” 433 U. S., at 250 .  Wol-man thus, although purporting to reaffirm <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , actually undermined that decision, as is evident from the similarity between the reasoning of Wolman and that of the <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> dissent.  Compare Wolman, supra, at 250 (The “technical change in legal bailee” was irrelevant), with <citedDecision>Meek, supra, at 391</citedDecision> (Rehnquist, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (“Nor can the fact that the school is the bailee be regarded as constitutionally determinative”).  That <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman reached the same result, on programs that were indistinguishable but for the direct/indirect distinction, shows that that distinction played no part in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> .  Further, respondents’ formalistic line breaks down in the application to real-world programs.  In Allen, for example, although we did recognize that students themselves received and owned the textbooks, we also noted that the books provided were those that the private schools required for courses, that the schools eould collect students’ requests for books and submit them to the board of education, that the schools could store the textbooks, and that the textbooks were essential to the schools’ teaching of secular subjects.  See 392 U. S., at 243-245 .  Whether one chooses to label this program “direct” or “indirect” is a rather arbitrary choice, one that does not further the constitutional analysis.  Of course, we have seen “special Establishment Clause dangers,” Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842, when money is *819 given to religious schools or entities directly rather than, as in Witters and Mueller , indirectly.  See 515 U. S., at 842 (collecting cases); id., at 846-847 (O’Connor, J., concurring); see also Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589, 608-609 (1988); compare Committee for Public Ed. and Religious Liberty v. Regan, 444 U. S. 646 (1980), with Levitt v. Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty, 413 U. S. 472 (1973).

 Had such things mattered to the Court in Zobrest , we would have found the case to be quite easy — for striking down rather than, as we did, upholding the program — whieh is just how the dissent saw the case. See, e. g., 509 U. S., at 18 (Black-mun, J., dissenting) (“Until now, the Court never has authorized a public employee to participate directly in religious indoctrination”); id., at 22 (“[government crosses the boundary when it furnishes the medium for communication of a religious message.  ... [A] state-employed sign-language interpreter would serve as the conduit for James’ religious education, thereby assisting Salpointe [High School] in its mission of religious indoctrination”); id., at 23 (interpreter *821 “is likely to place the imprimatur of governmental approval upon the favored religion”); see generally id., at 18-23 .  Quite clearly, then, we did not, as respondents do, think that the use of governmental aid to further religious indoctrination was synonymous with religious indoctrination by the government or that such use of aid created any improper incentives.  Similarly, had we, in Witters , been concerned with diverti-bility or diversion, we would have unhesitatingly, perhaps summarily, struck down the tuition-reimbursement program, because it was certain that Witters sought to participate in it to acquire an education in a religious career from a sectarian institution.  Diversion was guaranteed.  Mueller took the same view as Zobrest and Witters , for we did not in Mueller require the State to show that the tax deductions were only for the costs of education in secular subjects.  We declined to impose any such segregation requirement for either the tuition-expense deductions or the deductions for items strikingly similar to those at issue in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman , and here.  See Mueller, 463 U. S., at 391, n. 2 ; see also id., at 414 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (“The instructional materials which are subsidized by the Minnesota tax deduction plainly may be used to inculcate religious values and belief”).  Justice O’Connor acknowledges that the Court in Zo-brest and Witters approved programs that involved actual diversion.  See post, at 841 (opinion concurring in judgment).  The dissent likewise does not deny that Witters involved actual diversion.  See post, at 895-896, n. 16.  The dissent does claim that the aid in Zobrest “was not considered divertible,” post, at 895, n. 16, but the dissent in Zobrest , which the author of today’s dissent joined, understood the case otherwise.  See supra, at 820.  As that dissent made clear, diversion is the use of government aid to further a religious message.  See Zobrest, supra, at 21-22 (Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also post, at 842, 857 (O’Con-nor, J., concurring in judgment).  By that definition, the *822 government-provided interpreter in Zobrest was not only divertible, but actually diverted.  Respondents appear to rely on <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman to establish their rule against “divertible” aid.  But those cases offer little, if any, support for respondents.  <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> mentioned divertibility only briefly in a concluding footnote, see <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 366, n. 16</citedDecision> , and that mention was, at most, peripheral to the Court’s reasoning in striking down the lending of instructional materials and equipment.  The aid program in Wolman explicitly barred divertible aid, 433 U. S., at 248-249 , so a concern for divertibility could not have been part of our reason for finding that program invalid.  The issue is not divertibility of aid but rather whether the aid itself has an impermissible content.  Where the aid would be suitable for use in a public school, it is also suitable for use in any private school.  Similarly, the prohibition against the government providing impermissible content resolves the Establishment Clause concerns that exist if aid is actually diverted to religious uses.  9 In Agostini , we explained Zobrest by making just this distinction between the content of aid and the use of that aid: “Because the only government aid in Zobrest was the interpreter, who was herself not inculcating any religious messages, no government indoctrination took place.” 521 U. S., at 224 (second emphasis added).  Agostini also acknowledged that what the dissenters in Zobrest had charged was essentially true: Zobrest did effect a “shift ... in our Establishment Clause law.” 521 U. S., at 225 .

 We are unwilling to elevate scattered de minimis statutory violations, discovered and remedied by the relevant authorities themselves prior to any litigation, to such a level as to convert an otherwise unobjectionable parishwide program into a law that has the effect of advancing religion.  IV In short, Chapter 2 satisfies both the first and second primary criteria of Agostini .  It therefore does not have the effect of advancing religion.  For the same reason, Chapter 2 also “cannot reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion,” Agostini, 521 U. S., at 235 .  Accordingly, we hold that Chapter 2 is not a law respecting an establishment of religion.  Jefferson Parish need not exclude religious schools from its Chapter 2 program.  19 To the extent that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman conflict with this holding, we overrule them.  Our conclusion regarding <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman should come as no surprise.  The Court as early as Wolman itself left no doubt that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Allen were irreconcilable, see 433 U. S., at 251, n. 18 , and we have repeatedly reaffirmed Allen since then, see, e. g., Agostini, supra, at 231 .  (In fact, <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> , in *836 discussing the materials-and-equipment program, did not even cite Allen.  See Meek, <citedDecision>421 U. S., at 368-366</citedDecision> .) Less than three years after Wolman , we explained that <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> did not, despite appearances, hold that “all loans of secular instructional material and equipment inescapably have the effect of direct advancement of religion.” Regan, 444 U. S., at 661-662 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Then, in Mueller , we conceded that the aid at issue in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman did “resembl[e], in many respects,” the aid that we had upheld in Everson and Allen.  463 U. S., at 393 , and n. 3; see id., at 402, n. 10 ; see also id., at 415 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (viewing Allen as incompatible with <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman , and the distinction between textbooks and other instructional materials as “simply untenable”).  Most recently, Agostini , in rejecting Ball's assumption that “all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid,” Agostini, supra, at 225 , necessarily rejected a large portion (perhaps all, see Ball, 473 U. S., at 395 ) of the reasoning of <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman in invalidating the lending of materials and equipment, for Ball borrowed that assumption from those cases. See 521 U. S., at 220-221 (Shared Time program at issue in Ball was “surely invalid ... [g]iven the holdings in <citedDecision>Meek</citedDecision> and Wolman” regarding instructional materials and equipment).  Today we simply acknowledge what has long been evident and was evident to the Ninth and Fifth Circuits and to the District Court. The judgment of the Fifth Circuit is reversed.  It is so ordered.  Chapter 2 is now technically Subchapter VI of Chapter 70 of 20 U. S. C., where it was codified by the Improving America’s Schools Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103-382, 108 Stat. 3707.  For convenience, we will use the term "Chapter 2,” as the lower courts did.  Prior to 1994, Chapter 2 was codified at 20 U. S. C. §§2911-2976 (1988 ed.).  Congress in 1988 amended the section governing the sorts of materials and equipment available under Chapter 2.
