 The question in these cases is whether the privilege is fully applicable during a period of custodial interroga *461 tion.  In this Court, the privilege has consistently been accorded a liberal construction.  Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70, 81 (1965); Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S.. 479, 486 (1951); Arndstein v. McCarthy, 254 U. S. 71, 72-73 (1920); Counselman v. Hitchock, 142 U. S. 547, 562 (1892).  We are satisfied that all the principles embodied in the privilege apply to informal compulsion exerted by law-enforcement officers during in-custody questioning.  An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak.  As a practical matter, the compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the police station may well be greater than in courts or other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery.  30 This question, in fact, could have been taken as settled in federal courts almost 70 years ago, when, in Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532, 542</citedDecision> (1897), this Court held: “In criminal trials, in the courts of the United States, wherever a question arises whether a confession is incompetent because not voluntary, the issue is controlled by that portion of the Fifth Amendment .  .  .  commanding that no person ‘shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.’ ” In <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> , the Court reviewed the British and American history and case law and set down the Fifth Amendment standard for compulsion which we implement today: “Much of the confusion which has resulted from the effort to deduce from the adjudged cases what *462 would be a sufficient quantum of proof to show that a confession was or was not voluntary, has arisen from a misconception of the subject to which the proof must address itself.  The rule is not that in order to render a statement admissible the proof must be adequate to establish that the particular communications contained in a statement were voluntarily made, but it must be sufficient to establish that the making of the statement was voluntary; that is to say, that from the causes, which the law treats as legally sufficient to engender in the mind of the accused hope or fear in respect to the crime charged, the accused was not involuntarily impelled to make a statement, when but for the improper influences he would have remained silent.  .  .  .” <citedDecision>168 U. S., at 549</citedDecision> .  And see, <citedDecision>id., at 542</citedDecision> .  The Court has adhered to this reasoning.  In 1924, Mr. Justice Brandéis wrote for a unanimous Court in reversing a conviction resting on a compelled confession, Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1 .  He stated: “In the federal courts, the requisite of voluntariness is not satisfied by establishing merely that the confession was not induced by a promise or a threat.  A confession is voluntary in law if, and only if, it was, in fact, voluntarily made.  A confession may have been given voluntarily, although it was made to police officers, while in custody, and in answer to an examination conducted by them.  But a confession obtained by compulsion must be excluded whatever may have been the character of the compulsion, and whether the compulsion was applied in a judicial proceeding or otherwise.  Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532</citedDecision> .” 266 U. S., at 14-15 .  In addition to the expansive historical development of the privilege and the sound policies which have nurtured *463 its evolution, judicial precedent thus clearly establishes its application to incommunicado interrogation.  In fact, the Government concedes this point as well established in No. 761, Westover v. United States, stating: “We have no doubt .  .  .  that it is possible for a suspect’s Fifth Amendment right to be violated during in-custody questioning by a law-enforcement officer.” 31 Because of the adoption by Congress of Rule 5 (a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, and this Court’s effectuation of that Rule in McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943), and Mallory v. United States, 354 U. S. 449 (1957), we have had little occasion in the past quarter century to reach the constitutional issues in dealing with federal interrogations.  These supervisory rules, requiring production of an arrested person before a commissioner “without unnecessary delay” and excluding evidence obtained in default of that statutory obligation, were nonetheless responsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment policy that unavoidably face us now as to the States.

 To the same effect, see Brief for the United States, pp. 40-49, n. 44, Anderson v. United States, 318 U. S. 350 (1943); Brief for the United States, pp. 17-18, McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943).  Our decision today does not indicate in any manner, of course, that these rules can be disregarded.  When federal officials arrest an individual, they must as always comply with the dictates of the congressional legislation and cases thereunder.  See generally, Hogan & Snee, The McNabb-Mallory Rule: Its Rise, Rationale and Rescue, 47 Geo. L. J. 1 (1958).  The decisions of this Court have guaranteed the same procedural protection for the defendant whether his confession was used in a federal or state court. It is now axiomatic that the defendant’s constitutional rights have been violated if his conviction is based, in whole or in part, on an involuntary confession, regardless of its truth or falsity.  Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 544 (1961); Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1 (1924).  This is so even if there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction, e. g., Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401, 404 (1945); Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532, 540-542</citedDecision> (1897).  Both state and federal courts now adhere to trial procedures which seek to assure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession offered at trial, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964); United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 38 (1951); see also Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 624 (1896).  Appellate review is exacting, see Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199 (1960).  Whether his conviction was in a federal or state court, the defendant may secure a post-conviction hearing based on the alleged involuntary character of his confession, provided he meets the procedural requirements, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963).  In addition, see Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n, 378 U. S. 52 (1964).  See Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 241 (1941); Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 (1944); Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401 (1945); Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315 (1959); Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 (1963); Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963).  The police also prevented the attorney from consulting with his client.

In accord with our decision today, it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation.  The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.  Cf. Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965); Malloy v.

**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 It is urged that the confession was also inadmissible because not voluntary even measured by due process standards and because federal-state cooperation brought the McNabb-Mallory rule into play under Anderson v. United States, 318 U. S. 350 .  However, the facts alleged fall well short of coercion in my view, and I believe the involvement of federal agents in petitioner’s arrest and detention by the State too slight to invoke Anderson .  I agree with the Government that the admission of the evidence now protested by petitioner was at most harmless error, and two final contentions — one involving weight of the evidence and another improper prosecutor comment — seem to me without merit.  I would thérefore affirm Westover’s conviction.  In conclusion: Nothing in the letter or the spirit of the Constitution or in the precedents squares with the heavy-handed and one-sided action that is so precipi *526 tously taken by the Court in the name of fulfilling its constitutional responsibilities.  The foray which the Court makes today brings to mind the wise and farsighted words of Mr. Justice Jackson in Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157, 181 (separate opinion): “This Court is forever adding new stories to the temples of constitutional law, and the temples have a way of collapsing when one story too many is added.” E. g., Inbau & Reid, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions (1962); O’Hara, Fundamentals of Criminal Investigation (1956); Dienstein, Technics for the Crime Investigator (1952); Mulbar, Interrogation (1951); Kidd, Police Interrogation (1940).  As developed by my Brother Harlan, post, pp. 506-514, such cases, with the exception of the long-discredited decision in Brarn v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532</citedDecision> (1897), were adequately treated in terms of due process.  The Court points to England, Scotland, Ceylon and India as having equally rigid rules.  As my Brother Harlan points out, post, pp. 521-523, the Court is mistaken in this regard, for it overlooks counterbalancing prosecutorial advantages.  Moreover, the requirements of the Federal Bureau of Investigation do not appear from the Solicitor General’s letter, ante, pp. 484-486, to be as strict as *501 those imposed today in at least two respects: (1) The offer of counsel is articulated only as “a right to counsel”; nothing is said about a right to have counsel present at the custodial interrogation.  (See also the examples cited by the Solicitor General, Westover v. United States, 342 F. 2d 684, 685 (1965) (“right to consult counsel”); Jackson v. United States, 337 F. 2d 136, 138 (1964) (accused “entitled to an attorney”).) Indeed, the practice is that whenever the suspect “decides that he wishes to consult with counsel before making a statement, the interview is terminated at that point .... When counsel appears in person, he is permitted to confer with his client in private.” This clearly indicates that the FBI does not warn that counsel may be present during custodial interrogation.  (2) The Solicitor General’s letter states: “[T]hose who have been arrested for an offense under FBI jurisdiction, or whose arrest is contemplated following the interview, [are advised] of a right to free counsel if they are unable to pay, and the availability of such counsel from the Judge.” So phrased, this warning does not indicate that the agent will secure counsel.  Rather, the statement may well be interpreted by the suspect to mean that the burden is placed upon himself and that he may have counsel appointed only when brought before the judge or at trial — but not at custodial interrogation.  As I view the FBI practice, it is not as broad as the one laid down today by the Court. In my view there is “no significant support” in our cases for the holding of the Court today that the Fifth Amendment privilege, in effect, forbids custodial interrogation.  For a discussion of this point see the dissenting opinion of my Brother White, post, pp. 526-531.  My discussion in this opinion is directed to the main questions decided by the Court and necessary to its decision; in ignoring some of the collateral points, I do not mean to imply agreement.  The case was Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532</citedDecision> (quoted, ante, p. 461).  Its historical premises were afterwards disproved by Wigmore, who concluded “that no assertions could be more unfounded.” 3 Wigmore, Evidence § 823, at 250, n. 5 (3d ed. 1940).  The Court in United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 41 , declined to choose between <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> and Wigmore, and Stein v. New York, 346 U. S. 156, 191, n. 35 , cast further doubt on <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> .  There are, however, several Court opinions which assume in dicta the relevance of the.  Fifth Amendment privilege to confessions.  Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U. S. 465, 475 ; see Shotwell Mfg. Co. v. United States, 371 U. S. 341, 347 .  On Bram and the federal confession cases generally, see Developments in the Law — Confessions, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 935 , 959-961 (1966).  Comment, 31 U. Chi. L. Rev. 313 & n. 1 (1964), states that by the 1963 Term 33 state coerced-confession cases had been decided by this Court, apart from per curiams.  Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 321, n. 2 , collects 28 cases. Bator & Vorenberg, Arrest, Detention, Interrogation and the Right to Counsel, 66 Col. L. Rev. 62, 73 (1966): “In fact, the concept of involuntariness seems to be used by the courts as a shorthand to refer to practices which are repellent to civilized standards of decency or which, under the circumstances, are thought to apply a degree of pressure to an individual which unfairly impairs his capacity to make a rational choice.” See Herman, The Supreme Court and Restrictions on Police Interrogation, 25 Ohio St. L. J. 449, 452-458 (1964); Developments, supra, n. 2, at 964-984.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 And there is very little in the surrounding circumstances of the adoption of the Fifth Amendment or in the provisions of the then existing state constitutions or in state practice which would give the constitutional provision any broader meaning.  Mayers, The Federal Witness’ Privilege Against Self-Incrimination: Constitutional or Common-Law?  4 American Journal of Legal History 107 (1960).  Such a construction, however, was considerably narrower than the privilege at common law, and when eventually faced with the issues, the Court extended the constitutional privilege to the compulsory production of books and papers, to the ordinary witness before the grand jury and to witnesses generally.  Boyd v. United States, 116 U. S. 616 , and Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547 .  Both rules had solid support in common-law history, if not in the history of our own constitutional provision.  A few years later the Fifth Amendment privilege was similarly extended to encompass the then well-established rule against coerced confessions: “In criminal trials, in the courts of the United States, wherever a question arises whether a confession is incompetent because not voluntary, the issue is controlled by that portion of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, commanding that no person ‘shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.’ ” Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532, 542</citedDecision> .  Although this view has found approval in other cases, Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U. S. 465, 475 ; Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303, 313 ; Shotwell v. United States, 371 U. S. 341, 347 , it has also been questioned, see Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U. S. 278, 285 ; United States v. Carignan, *528 342 U. S. 36, 41 ; Stein v. New York, 346 U. S. 156, 191, n. 35 , and finds scant support in either the English or American authorities, see generally Regina v. Scott, Dears.  & Bell 47; 3 Wigmore, Evidence § 823 (3d ed. 1940), at 249 (“a confession is not rejected because of any connection with the privilege against self-crimination”), and 250, n. 5 (particularly criticizing Bram); 8 Wigmore, Evidence § 2266, at 400-40.1 (McNaughton rev. 1961).  Whatever the source of the rule excluding coerced confessions, it is clear that prior to the application of the privilege itself to state courts, Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 , the admissibility of a confession in a state criminal prosecution was tested by the same standards as were applied in federal prosecutions.  Id., at 6-7, 10 .  <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> , however, itself rejected the proposition which the Court now espouses.  The question in <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> was whether a confession, obtained during custodial interrogation, had been compelled, and if such interrogation was to be deemed inherently vulnerable the Court’s inquiry could have ended there.  After examining the English and American authorities, however, the Court declared that: “In this court also it has been settled that the mere fact that the confession is made to a police officer, while the accused was under arrest in or out of .prison, or was drawn out by his questions, does not necessarily render the confession involuntary, but, as one of the circumstances, such imprisonment or interrogation may be taken into account in determining whether or not the statements of the prisoner were voluntary.” <citedDecision>168 U. S., at 558</citedDecision> .  In this respect the Court was wholly consistent with prior and subsequent pronouncements in this Court. Thus prior to <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> the Court, in Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 583-587 , had upheld the admissibility of a *529 confession made to police officers following arrest, the record being silent concerning what conversation had occurred between the officers and the defendant in the short period preceding the confession.  Relying on Hopt , the Court ruled squarely on the issue in Sparf and Hansen v. United States, 156 U. S. 51 , 55: “Counsel for the accused insist that there cannot be a voluntary statement, a free open confession, while a defendant is confined and in irons under an accusation of having committed a capital offence.  We have not been referred to any authority in support of that position.  It is true that the fact of a prisoner being in custody at the time he makes a confession is a circumstance not to be overlooked, because it bears upon the inquiry whether the confession was voluntarily made or was extorted by threats or violence or made under the influence of fear.  But confinement or imprisonment is not in itself sufficient to justify the exclusion of a confession, if it appears to have been voluntary, and was not obtained by putting the prisoner in fear or by promises.  Wharton’s Cr. Ev. 9th ed. §§ 661, 663, and authorities cited.” Accord, Pierce v. United States, 160 U. S. 355, 357 .  And in Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 623 , the Court had considered the significance of custodial interrogation without any antecedent warnings regarding the right to remain silent or the right to counsel.  There the defendant had answered questions posed by a Commissioner, who had failed to advise him of his rights, and his answers were held admissible over his claim of involuntariness.  “The fact that [a defendant] is in custody and manacled does not necessarily render his statement involuntary, nor is that necessarily the effect of popular excitement shortly preceding.  .  .  .  And it is laid down *530 that it is not essential to the admissibility of a confession that it should appear that the person was warned that what he said would be used against him, but on the contrary, if the confession was voluntary, it is sufficient though it appear that he was not so warned.” Since <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> , the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation has been frequently reiterated.  Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303 , cited Wilson approvingly and held admissible as voluntary statements the accused’s testimony at a preliminary hearing even though he was not warned that what he said might be used against him.  Without any discussion of the presence or absence of warnings, presumably because such discussion was deemed unnecessary, numerous other cases have declared that “[t]he mere fact that a confession was made while in the custody of the police does not render it inadmissible,” McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, 346 ; accord, United States v. Mitchell, 322 U. S. 65 , despite its having been elicited by police examination, Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14 ; United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 39 .  Likewise, in Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 437 , the Court said that “the bare fact of police ‘detention and police examination in private of one in official state custody’ does not render involuntary a confession by the one so detained.” And finally, in Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , a confession obtained by police interrogation after arrest was held voluntary even though the authorities refused to permit the defendant to consult with his attorney.  See generally Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 587-602 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); 3 Wigmore, Evidence § 851, at 313 (3d ed. 1940); see also Joy, Admissibility of Confessions 38, 46 (1842).  Only a tiny minority of our judges who have dealt with the question, including today’s majority, have considered in-custody interrogation, without more, to be a violation of the Fifth Amendment.  And this Court, as *531 every member knows, has left standing literally thousands of criminal convictions that rested at least in part on confessions taken in the course of interrogation by the police after arrest.
**Combined Opinion**
 The question in these cases is whether the privilege is fully applicable during a period of custodial interrogation.  *461 In this Court, the privilege has consistently been accorded a liberal construction.  Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70, 81 (1965); Hoffman v. United States, 341 U. S. 479, 486 (1951); Arndstein v. McCarthy, 254 U. S. 71, 72-73 (1920); Counselman v. Hitchock, 142 U. S. 547, 562 (1892).  We are satisfied that all the principles embodied in the privilege apply to informal compulsion exerted by law-enforcement officers during in-custody questioning.  An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak.  As a practical matter, the compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the police station may well be greater than in courts or other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery.  [30] This question, in fact, could have been taken as settled in federal courts almost 70 years ago, when, in Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532, 542</citedDecision> (1897), this Court held: "In criminal trials, in the courts of the United States, wherever a question arises whether a confession is incompetent because not voluntary, the issue is controlled by that portion of the Fifth Amendment.  .  .  commanding that no person `shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.' " In <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> , the Court reviewed the British and American history and case law and set down the Fifth Amendment standard for compulsion which we implement today: "Much of the confusion which has resulted from the effort to deduce from the adjudged cases what *462 would be a sufficient quantum of proof to show that a confession was or was not voluntary, has arisen from a misconception of the subject to which the proof must address itself.  The rule is not that in order to render a statement admissible the proof must be adequate to establish that the particular communications contained in a statement were voluntarily made, but it must be sufficient to establish that the making of the statement was voluntary; that is to say, that from the causes, which the law treats as legally sufficient to engender in the mind of the accused hope or fear in respect to the crime charged, the accused was not involuntarily impelled to make a statement, when but for the improper influences he would have remained silent.  .  .  ." <citedDecision>168 U. S., at 549</citedDecision> .  And see, <citedDecision>id., at 542</citedDecision> .  The Court has adhered to this reasoning.  In 1924, Mr. Justice Brandeis wrote for a unanimous Court in reversing a conviction resting on a compelled confession, Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1 .  He stated: "In the federal courts, the requisite of voluntariness is not satisfied by establishing merely that the confession was not induced by a promise or a threat.  A confession is voluntary in law if, and only if, it was, in fact, voluntarily made.  A confession may have been given voluntarily, although it was made to police officers, while in custody, and in answer to an examination conducted by them.  But a confession obtained by compulsion must be excluded whatever may have been the character of the compulsion, and whether the compulsion was applied in a judicial proceeding or otherwise.  Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532</citedDecision> ." 266 U. S., at 14-15 .  In addition to the expansive historical development of the privilege and the sound policies which have nurtured *463 its evolution, judicial precedent thus clearly establishes its application to incommunicado interrogation.  In fact, the Government concedes this point as well established in No. 761, Westover v.

The question in <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> was whether a confession, obtained during custodial interrogation, had been compelled, and if such interrogation was to be deemed inherently vulnerable the Court's inquiry could have ended there.  After examining the English and American authorities, however, the Court declared that: "In this court also it has been settled that the mere fact that the confession is made to a police officer, while the accused was under arrest in or out of prison, or was drawn out by his questions, does not necessarily render the confession involuntary, but, as one of the circumstances, such imprisonment or interrogation may be taken into account in determining whether or not the statements of the prisoner were voluntary." <citedDecision>168 U. S., at 558</citedDecision> .  In this respect the Court was wholly consistent with prior and subsequent pronouncements in this Court. Thus prior to <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> the Court, in Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 583-587 , had upheld the admissibility of a *529 confession made to police officers following arrest, the record being silent concerning what conversation had occurred between the officers and the defendant in the short period preceding the confession.  Relying on Hopt , the Court ruled squarely on the issue in Sparf and Hansen v. United States, 156 U. S. 51 , 55: "Counsel for the accused insist that there cannot be a voluntary statement, a free open confession, while a defendant is confined and in irons under an accusation of having committed a capital offence.  We have not been referred to any authority in support of that position.  It is true that the fact of a prisoner being in custody at the time he makes a confession is a circumstance not to be overlooked, because it bears upon the inquiry whether the confession was voluntarily made or was extorted by threats or violence or made under the influence of fear.  But confinement or imprisonment is not in itself sufficient to justify the exclusion of a confession, if it appears to have been voluntary, and was not obtained by putting the prisoner in fear or by promises.  Wharton's Cr. Ev. 9th ed. §§ 661, 663, and authorities cited." Accord, Pierce v. United States, 160 U. S. 355, 357 .
**Combined Opinion**
 There the defendant had answered questions posed by a Commissioner, who had failed to advise him of his rights, and his answers were held admissible over his claim of involuntariness.  "The fact that [a defendant] is in custody and manacled does not necessarily render his statement involuntary, nor is that necessarily the effect of popular excitement shortly preceding.  .  .  .  And it is laid down *530 that it is not essential to the admissibility of a confession that it should appear that the person was warned that what he said would be used against him, but on the contrary, if the confession was voluntary, it is sufficient though it appear that he was not so warned." Since <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> , the admissibility of statements made during custodial interrogation has been frequently reiterated.  Powers v. United States, 223 U. S. 303 , cited Wilson approvingly and held admissible as voluntary statements the accused's testimony at a preliminary hearing even though he was not warned that what he said might be used against him.  Without any discussion of the presence or absence of warnings, presumably because such discussion was deemed unnecessary, numerous other cases have declared that "[t]he mere fact that a confession was made while in the custody of the police does not render it inadmissible," McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332, 346 ; accord, United States v. Mitchell, 322 U. S. 65 , despite its having been elicited by police examination, Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1, 14 ; United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 39 .  Likewise, in Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433, 437 , the Court said that "the bare fact of police `detention and police examination in private of one in official state custody' does not render involuntary a confession by the one so detained." And finally, in Cicenia v. Lagay, 357 U. S. 504 , a confession obtained by police interrogation after arrest was held voluntary even though the authorities refused to permit the defendant to consult with his attorney.  See generally Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U. S. 568, 587-602 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.); 3 Wigmore, Evidence § 851, at 313 (3d ed. 1940); see also Joy, Admissibility of Confessions 38, 46 (1842).  Only a tiny minority of our judges who have dealt with the question, including today's majority, have considered in-custody interrogation, without more, to be a violation of the Fifth Amendment.

 To the same effect, see Brief for the United States, pp. 40-49, n. 44, Anderson v. United States, 318 U. S. 350 (1943); Brief for the United States, pp. 17-18, McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943).  [32]  Our decision today does not indicate in any manner, of course, that these rules can be disregarded.  When federal officials arrest an individual, they must as always comply with the dictates of the congressional legislation and cases thereunder.  See generally, Hogan & Snee, The McNabb-Mallory Rule: Its Rise, Rationale and Rescue, 47 Geo. L. J. 1 (1958).  [33]  The decisions of this Court have guaranteed the same procedural protection for the defendant whether his confession was used in a federal or state court. It is now axiomatic that the defendant's constitutional rights have been violated if his conviction is based, in whole or in part, on an involuntary confession, regardless of its truth or falsity.  Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U. S. 534, 544 (1961); Wan v. United States, 266 U. S. 1 (1924).  This is so even if there is ample evidence aside from the confession to support the conviction, e. g., Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401, 404 (1945); Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532, 540-542</citedDecision> (1897).  Both state and federal courts now adhere to trial procedures which seek to assure a reliable and clear-cut determination of the voluntariness of the confession offered at trial, Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964); United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 38 (1951); see also Wilson v. United States, 162 U. S. 613, 624 (1896).  Appellate review is exacting, see Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963); Blackburn v. Alabama, 361 U. S. 199 (1960).  Whether his conviction was in a federal or state court, the defendant may secure a post-conviction hearing based on the alleged involuntary character of his confession, provided he meets the procedural requirements, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391 (1963); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293 (1963).  In addition, see Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U. S. 52 (1964).  [34]  See Lisenba v. California, 314 U. S. 219, 241 (1941); Ashcraft v. Tennessee, 322 U. S. 143 (1944); Malinski v. New York, 324 U. S. 401 (1945); Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315 (1959); Lynumn v. Illinois, 372 U. S. 528 (1963); Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503 (1963).  [35]  The police also prevented the attorney from consulting with his client.

[37]  See p. 454, supra. Lord Devlin has commented: "It is probable that even today, when there is much less ignorance about these matters than formerly, there is still a general belief that you must answer all questions put to you by a policeman, or at least that it will be the worse for you if you do not." Devlin, The Criminal Prosecution in England 32 (1958).  In accord with our decision today, it is impermissible to penalize an individual for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege when he is under police custodial interrogation.  The prosecution may not, therefore, use at trial the fact that he stood mute or claimed his privilege in the face of accusation.  Cf. Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 8 (1964); Comment, 31 U. Chi. L. Rev. 556 (1964); Developments in the Law Confessions, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 935 , 1041-1044 (1966).  See also Bram v.

**Combined Opinion**
 [70]  Because of this disposition of the case, the California Supreme Court did not reach the claims that the confession was coerced by police threats to hold his ailing wife in custody until he confessed, that there was no hearing as required by Jackson v. Denno, 378 U. S. 368 (1964), and that the trial judge gave an instruction condemned by the California Supreme Court's decision in People v. Morse, 60 Cal. 2d 631 , 388 P. 2d 33 , 36 Cal. Rptr. 201 (1964).  [71]  After certiorari was granted in this case, respondent moved to dismiss on the ground that there was no final judgment from which the State could appeal since the judgment below directed that he be retried.  In the event respondent was successful in obtaining an acquittal on retrial, however, under California law the State would have no appeal.  Satisfied that in these circumstances the decision below constituted a final judgment under 28 U. S. C. § 1257 (3) (1964 ed.), we denied the motion.  383 U. S. 903 .  [1] E. g., Inbau & Reid, Criminal Interrogation and Confessions (1962); O'Hara, Fundamentals of Criminal Investigation (1956); Dienstein, Technics for the Crime Investigator (1952); Mulbar, Interrogation (1951); Kidd, Police Interrogation (1940).  [2]  As developed by my Brother HARLAN, post, pp. 506-514, such cases, with the exception of the long-discredited decision in Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532</citedDecision> (1897), were adequately treated in terms of due process.  [3]  The Court points to England, Scotland, Ceylon and India as having equally rigid rules.  As my Brother HARLAN points out, post, pp. 521-523, the Court is mistaken in this regard, for it overlooks counterbalancing prosecutorial advantages.  Moreover, the requirements of the Federal Bureau of Investigation do not appear from the Solicitor General's letter, ante, pp. 484-486, to be as strict as those imposed today in at least two respects: (1) The offer of counsel is articulated only as "a right to counsel"; nothing is said about a right to have counsel present at the custodial interrogation.  (See also the examples cited by the Solicitor General, Westover v. United States, 342 F. 2d 684, 685 (1965) ("right to consult counsel"); Jackson v. United States, 337 F. 2d 136, 138 (1964) (accused "entitled to an attorney").) Indeed, the practice is that whenever the suspect "decides that he wishes to consult with counsel before making a statement, the interview is terminated at that point .  .
**Combined Opinion**
This clearly indicates that the FBI does not warn that counsel may be present during custodial interrogation.  (2) The Solicitor General's letter states: "[T]hose who have been arrested for an offense under FBI jurisdiction, or whose arrest is contemplated following the interview, [are advised] of a right to free counsel if they are unable to pay, and the availability of such counsel from the Judge." So phrased, this warning does not indicate that the agent will secure counsel.  Rather, the statement may well be interpreted by the suspect to mean that the burden is placed upon himself and that he may have counsel appointed only when brought before the judge or at trialbut not at custodial interrogation.  As I view the FBI practice, it is not as broad as the one laid down today by the Court. [4]  In my view there is "no significant support" in our cases for the holding of the Court today that the Fifth Amendment privilege, in effect, forbids custodial interrogation.  For a discussion of this point see the dissenting opinion of my Brother WHITE, post, pp. 526-531.  [1]  My discussion in this opinion is directed to the main questions decided by the Court and necessary to its decision; in ignoring some of the collateral points, I do not mean to imply agreement.  [2]  The case was Bram v. United States, <citedDecision>168 U. S. 532</citedDecision> (quoted, ante, p. 461).  Its historical premises were afterwards disproved by Wigmore, who concluded "that no assertions could be more unfounded." 3 Wigmore, Evidence § 823, at 250, n. 5 (3d ed. 1940).  The Court in United States v. Carignan, 342 U. S. 36, 41 , declined to choose between <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> and Wigmore, and Stein v. New York, 346 U. S. 156, 191, n. 35 , cast further doubt on <citedDecision>Bram</citedDecision> .  There are, however, several Court opinions which assume in dicta the relevance of the Fifth Amendment privilege to confessions.  Burdeau v. McDowell, 256 U. S. 465, 475 ; see Shotwell Mfg. Co. v. United States, 371 U. S. 341, 347 .  On Bram and the federal confession cases generally, see Developments in the LawConfessions, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 935 , 959-961 (1966).  [3]  Comment, 31 U. Chi. L. Rev. 313 & n. 1 (1964), states that by the 1963 Term 33 state coerced-confession cases had been decided by this Court, apart from per curiams.  Spano v. New York, 360 U. S. 315, 321, n. 2 , collects 28 cases. [4]  Bator & Vorenberg, Arrest, Detention, Interrogation and the Right to Counsel, 66 Col. L. Rev. 62, 73 (1966): "In fact, the concept of involuntariness seems to be used by the courts as a shorthand to refer to practices which are repellent to civilized standards of decency or which, under the circumstances, are thought to apply a degree of pressure to an individual which unfairly impairs his capacity to make a rational choice." See Herman, The Supreme Court and Restrictions on Police Interrogation, 25 Ohio St. L. J. 449, 452-458 (1964); Developments, supra, n. 2, at 964-984.
