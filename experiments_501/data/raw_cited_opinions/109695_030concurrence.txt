<p id="b196-7">I join the Court’s opinion, but in any event would reverse on the ground, not addressed by the Court, that the State did not prosecute petitioner in a single proceeding. I adhere to the view that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, applied to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, requires the prosecution in one proceeding, except in extremely limited circumstances not present here, of “all the charges against a defendant that grow out of a single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction.” <em>Ashe </em>v. <em>Swenson, </em>397 U. S. 436, 453-454, and n. 7 (1970) (Brennan, J., concurring). See <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Oklahoma, </em>429 U. S. 1053 (1977) (Brennan, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), and cases collected therein. In my view the Court’s suggestion, <em>ante, </em>at 169 n. 8, that the Ohio Legislature might be free to make joyriding a separate and distinct offense for each day a motor vehicle is operated without the owner’s consent would not affect the applicability of the single-transaction test. Though under some circumstances a legislature may divide a continuing course of conduct into discrete offenses, I would nevertheless hold that all charges growing out of conduct constituting a “single criminal act, occurrence, episode, or transaction” must be tried in a single proceeding.</p>
