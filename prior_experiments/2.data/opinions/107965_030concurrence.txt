<p id="b523-8">I agree with the views expressed by Mr. Justice Douglas in his concurring opinion in this case that the “clear and present danger” doctrine should have no place <page-number citation-index="1" label="450">*450</page-number>in the interpretation of the First Amendment. I join the Court’s opinion, which, as I understand it, simply cites <em>Dennis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U. S. 494 (1951), but does not indicate any agreement on the Court’s part with the “clear and present danger” doctrine on which <em>Dennis </em>purported to rely.</p>
