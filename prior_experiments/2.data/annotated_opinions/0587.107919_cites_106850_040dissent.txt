**Dissenting Opinion**
The legislative apportionment cases, upon which the Court places its entire reliance, were decided on the theory that voters residing in “underrepresented” electoral districts were denied equal protection. “Overweighting and overvaluation of the votes of those living here has the certain effect of dilution and undervaluation of the votes of those living there.” Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533, 563. In this case, by contrast, the appellants have sued merely as prospective candidates for office. They claim no impairment whatever of any interests they might have as voters; indeed, their complaint contains no allegation that any of them is in fact a qualified Illinois voter. Undeterred by the appellants’ failure to explain how or as against whom they themselves are denied equal protection, however, the Court reaches out to hold that this statute “discriminates against the residents of the populous counties of the State in favor of rural sections.” But since no “residents of the populous counties of the State” have asserted any rights, the Court’s decision represents at best an advisory vindication of interests not involved in this case. Even if the interests of voters in Illinois’ “populous counties” were actually represented here, the Court’s conclusion would still be completely unjustified. Reynolds v. <targetCase>Sims, supra</targetCase>, and its offspring at least involved situations in which the “debasement” or “dilution” of voting power found by the Court was the “certain” result of population variations among electoral districts. Under the Illinois statute now before us, however, no injury whatever is suffered by voters in heavily populated areas so long as their favored candidates are able to secure places on the ballot. And there is absolutely no indication in the record that the appellants could not, if they had made *821 the effort, have easily satisfied Illinois’ 50-county, 200-signature requirement. Indeed, there is no suggestion that the counties from which the appellants drew their support were “populous” rather than “rural.” The rationale of Reynolds v. Sims simply does not control this case. Any reliance by the Court on Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U. S. 23, would also be misplaced. That case involved an Ohio requirement that new political parties secure the support of over 433,000 persons — 15% of the electorate— before their candidates could appear on the ballot. Here, the 25,000 signatures required by Illinois represent only about one-half of one percent of the total number of Illinois voters — a percentage requirement permissible, one would hope, under any view of the Rhodes case.

That conclusion seems to me to be no less sound today than it was at the time of the MacDougall decision. 2 Illinois’ policy is, in fact, not at *822 all unlike that upheld by the Court only two Terms ago in Dusch v. Davis, 387 U. S. 112, in which a district-residence requirement imposed upon municipal officers despite population variations among districts was nevertheless held proper as reasonably “reflect [ing] a detente between urban and rural communities . . . .” Id., at 117. Cf. Lucas v. Forty-Fourth General Assembly, 377 U. S. 713, 744 (Stewart, J., dissenting); Reynolds v. <targetCase>Sims, supra</targetCase>, at 689 (Harlan, J., dissenting). I respectfully dissent. MacDougall involved Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 46, § 10-2, relating to ballot position for candidates of new political parties; Ill. Rev. Stat., c. 46, § 10-3, involved here, imposes identical signature requirements for independent candidates. While MacDougall involved candidates for various offices, the appellants here all sought election as presidential electors. See U. S.
