Mr. Justice Rebcnquist delivered the opinion of the Court. Nearly 40 years ago Congress enacted the Fair Labor Standards Act, 1 and required employers covered by the Act to pay their employees a minimum hourly wage 2 and to pay them at one and one-half times their regular *836 rate of pay for hours worked in excess of 40 during a workweek.  3 By this Act covered employers were required to keep certain records to aid in the enforcement of the Act, 4 and to comply with specified child labor standards.  5 This Court unanimously upheld the Act as a valid exercise of congressional authority under the commerce power in United States v. Darby, <citedDecision>312 U. S. 100</citedDecision> (1941), observing: "Whatever their motive and purpose, regulations of commerce which do not infringe some constitutional prohibition are within the plenary power conferred on Congress by the Commerce Clause.” <citedDecision>Id., at 115</citedDecision> .  The original Fair Labor Standards Act passed in 1938 specifically excluded the States and their political subdivisions from its coverage.  6 In 1974, however, Congress enacted the most recent of a series of broadening amendments to the Act.  By these amendments Congress has extended the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions to almost all public employees employed by the States and by their various political subdivisions.  Appellants in these cases include individual cities and States, the National League of Cities, and the National Governors' Conference; 7 they brought an action in the District *837 Court for the District of Columbia which challenged the validity of the 1974 amendments.  They asserted in effect that when Congress sought to apply the Fair Labor Standards Act provisions virtually across the board to employees of state and municipal governments it “infringed a constitutional prohibition” running in favor of the States as States.  The gist of their complaint was not that the conditions of employment of such public employees were beyond the scope of the commerce power had those employees been employed in the private sector but that the established constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental immunity consistently recognized in a long series of our cases affirmatively prevented the exercise of this authority in the manner which Congress chose in the 1974 amendments.

 .  .  'the utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity/ ” which they feared.  392 U. S., at 196 .  Appellee Secretary in this case, both in his brief and upon oral argument, has agreed that our federal system of government imposes definite limits upon the authority of Congress to regulate the activities of the States as States by means of the commerce power.  See, e. g., Brief for Appellee 30-41; Tr. of Oral Arg. 39-43.  In Fry, supra, the Court recognized that an express declaration of this limitation is found in the Tenth Amendment: “While the Tenth Amendment has been characterized as a 'truism/ stating merely that 'all is retained which has not been surrendered,' United States v. *843 Darby, <citedDecision>312 U. S. 100, 124</citedDecision> (1941), it is not without significance.  The Amendment expressly declares the constitutional policy that Congress may not exercise power in a fashion that impairs the States’ integrity or their ability to function effectively in a federal system.” 421 U. S., at 547 n. 7.  In New York v. United States, 326 U. S. 572 (1946), Mr. Chief Justice Stone, speaking for four Members of an eight-Member Court 13 in rejecting the proposition that Congress could impose taxes on the States so long as it did so in a nondiscriminatory manner, observed: “A State may, like a private individual, own real property and receive income.  But in view of our former decisions we could hardly say that a general non-discriminatory real estate tax (apportioned), or an income tax laid upon citizens and States alike could be constitutionally applied to the State’s capitol, its State-house, its public school houses, public parks, or its revenues from taxes or school lands, even though all real property and all income of the citizen .is taxed.” Id., at 587-588 .  14 *844 The expressions in these more recent cases trace back to earlier decisions of this Court recognizing the essential role of the States in our federal system of government.  Mr. Chief Justice Chase, perhaps because of the particular time at which he occupied that office, had occasion more than once to speak for the Court on this point.  In Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 725 (1869), he declared that “[t]he Constitution, in all its provisions, looks to an indestructible Union, composed of indestructible States.” In Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71 (1869), his opinion for the Court said: “Both the States and the United States existed before the Constitution.
