This is not a situation in which a State has merely sought to exert such power over a domiciliary. This is, rather, a case involving inconsistent assertions of power by courts of two States of the Federal Union and thus presents considerations which go beyond the interests of local policy, however vital. In resolving the issues here presented, we do not conceive it to be a part of our function to weigh the relative merits of the policies of Florida and Massachusetts with respect to divorce and related matters. Nor do we understand the decisions of this Court to support the proposition that the obligation imposed by Article IV, § 1 of the Constitution and the Act of Congress passed thereunde, amounts to something less than the duty to accord full faith and credit to decrees of divorce entered by courts of sister States. 23 The full faith and credit clause is one of the provisions incorporated into the Constitution by its framers for the purpose of transforming an aggregation of independent, sovereign States into a nation. 24 If in its application local policy must at times be required to give way, such 'is part of the price of our federal system.' Williams v. North Carolina, 1942, 317 U.S. 287 , 302, 63 S.Ct. 207 , 215. 25 21 This is not to say that in no case may an area be recognized in which reasonable accommodations of interest may properly be made. But as this Court has heretofore made clear, that area is of limited extent. 26 We believe that in permitting an attack on the Florida divorce decree which again put in issue petitioner's Florida domicile and in refusing to recognize the validity of that decree, the Massachusetts courts have asserted a power which cannot be reconciled with the requirements of due faith and credit. We believe that assurances that such a power will be exercised sparingly and wisely render it no less repugnant to the constitutional commands. 22 It is one thing to recognize as permissible the judicial reesamination of findings of jurisdictional fact where such findings have been made by a court of a sister State which has entered a divorce decree in ex parte proceedings. 27 It is quite another thing to hold that the vital rights and interests involved in divorce litigation may be held in suspense pending the scrutiny by courts of sister States of findings of jurisdictional fact made by a competent court in proceedings conducted in a manner consistent with the highest requirements of due process and in which the defendant has participated.

20 Thus, in the Andrews case, before the divorce decree was entered by the South Dakota court, the defendant withdrew her appearance in accordance with a consent agreement. 21 See note 14 supra. 22 But cf.

26 , 118 A.L.R. 1518 , as contrary authority. That case did not depend for its result on the fact that there had been an adjudication of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the divorce enforced, inasmuch as this Court found that the State granting the divorce was in fact that of the domicile. 305 U.S. at page 41, 59 S.Ct. at pages 6, 7. Moreover this Court's citation therein of Andrews v. Andrews, supra, indicates an absence of intention to overrule the holding of that case that opportunity to litigate the issue of domicile does not foreclose inquiry as to the true facts. Andrews v. Andrews has since been cited with respect, as recently as Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287 , 309, 320, n. 7, 63 S.Ct. 207 , 218, 223, 87 L.Ed. 279 , 143 A.L.R. 1273 , and Id., 325 U.S. 226 , 229, 240, 242, 65 S.Ct. 1092 , 1094, 1095, 1100. 2 Compare the English laws providing for a King's Proctor to represent the interests of the Crown in divorce proceedings. Sections 5—7, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1860, 23 & 24 Vict., c. 44; § 1, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1873, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 31; § 181, The Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, 15 § 16 Geo. 5, c. 49, 9 Halsbury's Statutes of England 393, 394.

Nev.Comp.Laws § 9488. 16 It is by no means clear that the issue before the Massachusetts courts in either of these cases was or could have been litigated in Florida or Nevada. All that the Florida or Nevada courts could have determined was whether the jurisdictional requisites of State law and of the due process clause of the Constitution, Amend. 14, were met. And if a direct attack on these decrees had been made in this Court, all that we could have decided would have been the due process point. A divorce may satisfy due process requirements, and be valid where rendered, and still lack the jurisdictional requisites for full faith and credit to be mandatory. Compare Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287 , 307, 63 S.Ct. 207 , 217 (concurring opinion), with Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U.S. 226 , 65 S.Ct. 1092 . This is true even though the Florida and Nevada courts appear to characterize the jurisdictional prerequisites under their respective laws as domicile, Wade v. Wade, 93 Fla. 1004 , 1007, 113 So. 374 ; Latterner v. Latterner, 51 Nev. 285 , 274 P. 194 ; since we may be unwilling to apply as loose a test of 'domicile,' in determining whether extrastate enforcement is mandatory, as those States might properly choose to use in determining what divorces might be granted and effective within their own borders. Thus, at no point in the proceedings in Florida or Nevada in the instant cases was there an opportunity to litigate whether Mrs. Sherrer or Mr. Coe had acquired Florida or Nevada domicile, respectively, sufficient to entitle their divorces to extraterritorial recognition. 17 North Carolina appears to be the only other State allowing divorce on less than a year's residence, but it does not allow divorce for many of the usual causes. The Williams cases attest that its laws are not lax.
