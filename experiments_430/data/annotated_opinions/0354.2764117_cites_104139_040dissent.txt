 Whether or not in a particular situation a person is domiciled in a given State depends on circumstances, and circumstances have myriad diversities.  But there is a consensus of opinion among English-speaking courts the world over that domicile requires some sense of permanence of connection between the individual who claims it and the State which he asks to recognize it.  ^ _ It would certainly have been easier if from the beginning the Full Faith and Credit Clause had been construed to mean that the assumption of jurisdiction by the courts of a State would be conclusive, so that every other State would have to respect it.  But such cer *358 tainly has not been the law since 1873.  Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457 .  Nor was it the law when this Court last considered the divorce problem, in 1945.  Williams v. North Carolina, <citedDecision>325 U. S. 226</citedDecision> .  A State that is asked to enforce the action of another State may appropriately ascertain whether that other State had power to do what it purported to do.  And if the enforcing State has an interest under our Constitution in regard to the subject-matter that is vital and intimate, it should not be within the power of private parties to foreclose that interest by their private arrangement.  Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U. S. 14 ; cf. Fall v. Eastin, 215 U. S. 1 ; Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Commission, 294 U. S. 532 .  .~-"íf the marriage contract were no different from a contract to sell an automobile, the parties thereto might well be permitted to bargain away all interests involved, in or out of court. But the State has an interest in the family relations of its citizens vastly different from the interest it has in an ordinary commercial transaction.  That interest cannot be bartered or bargained away by the immediate parties to the controversy by a default or an arranged contest in a proceeding for divorce in a State to which the parties are strangers.  Therefore, the constitutional power of a State to determine the marriage status of two of its citizens should not be deemed foreclosed by a proceeding between the parties in another State, even though in other types of controversy considerations making it desirable to put an end to litigation might foreclose the parties themselves from reopening the dispute.

 Cf. Hanover v. Turner, 14 Mass. 227 ; Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Revise the General Statutes of the Commonwealth, pt. II, p. 123; 2 Kent, Commentaries, Lect.  27, *108-* 109.  The Uniform Annulment of Marriages and Divorce Act, 4 passed by Delaware, 5 New Jersey, 6 and Wisconsin, 7 is almost identical, as is a Maine statute 8 on the same subject.  Massachusetts says through this statute that a person who enjoys its other institutions but is irked by its laws concerning the severance of the marriage tie, must either move his home to some other State with more congenial laws, or remain and abide by the laws of Massachusetts.  He cannot play ducks and drakes with the State, by leaving it just long enough to take advantage of a proceeding elsewhere, devised in the interests of a quick divorce, intending all the time to retain Massachusetts as his home, and then return there, resume taking advantage of such of its institutions as he finds congenial but assert his freedom from the restraints of its policies concerning severance of the marriage tie.  Massachusetts has a right to define the terms on which it will grant divorces, and to refuse to recognize divorces granted by other States to parties who at the time are still Massachusetts domicil-iarles.  Has it not also the right to frustrate evasion of its policies by those of its permanent residents who leave the State to change their spouses rather than to change their homes, merely because they go through a lukewarm or feigned contest over jurisdiction?- The nub of the <citedDecision>Williams</citedDecision> decision was that the State of domicile has an independent interest in the marital *362 status of its citizens that neither they nor any other State with which they may have a transitory connection may abrogate against its will. Its interest is not less because both parties to the marital relationship instead of one sought to evade its laws.  In the <citedDecision>Williams</citedDecision> case, it was not the interest of Mrs. Williams, or that of Mr. Hendryx, that North Carolina asserted.  It was the interest of the people of North Carolina.  The same is true here of the interest of Massachusetts.  9 While the State's interest may be expressed in criminal prosecutions, with itself formally a party as in the <citedDecision>Williams</citedDecision> case, the State also expresses its sovereign power when it speaks through its courts in a civil litigation between private parties.  Cf. Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U. S. 1 .  Surely there is involved here an exercise by Massachusetts of its policy concerning the termination of marriage by its own citizens.  The Framers left that power over domestic relations in the several States, and every effort to withdraw it from the States within the past sixty years has failed.  10 An American citizen may change his domicile from one State to another.  And so, a State must respect another State’s valid divorce decree even though it concerns its former citizens.  But the real question here is whether the Full Faith and Credit Clause can be used as a limitation on the power of a State over its citizens who do not change their domicile, who do not remove to another State, but who leave the State only long enough to escape the rigors of its laws, obtain a divorce, and then *363 scurry back.

 Others may have moved to those States, intending to make their permanent homes there, and have since remained.  They were amply protected by the Full Faith and Credit Clause even before today’s decision.  The only persons at all insecure are that small minority who temporarily left their home States for a State — one of the few — offering quick and easy divorce, obtained one, and departed.  Is their security so important to the Nation that we must safeguard it even at the price of depriving the great majority of States which do not offer bargain-counter divorces of the right to determine the laws of domestic relations applicable to their citizens?  Even to a believer in the desirability of easier divorce— an issue that is not our concern — this decision should bring little solace.  It offers a way out only to that small portion of those unhappily married who are sufficiently wealthy to be able to afford a trip to Nevada or Florida, and a six-week or three-month stay there.  18 '’"" Óf course, Massachusetts may not determine the question of domicile in disregard of what her sister States have found. A trial de novo of this issue would not satisfy the requirements which we laid down in the second <citedDecision>Williams</citedDecision> case, <citedDecision>325 U. S. at 236</citedDecision> .  Nor can Massachusetts make find *371 ings on this issue which preclude reexamination by this Court, nor may it, through prejudice in favor of its own policies, strain the facts to find continuance of the tie between the parties and itself.  But the records in these cases do not justify the conclusion that Massachusetts has been remiss in its duty of respect.  It is true that its courts did not employ a formal legal jargon and say that there was a presumption in favor of the findings of'Florida or Nevada and that this presumption had been overcome by the evidence.  But the Constitution demands compliance, not a form of words.  To ascertain whether in fact there is a real basis for saying that Massachusetts did not accord proper recognition to Nevada’s and Florida’s findings, we must turn to the records and discover for ourselves just how much warrant there was for their findings of domicile.  The petitioner and respondent in Sherrer v. Sherrer were married in New Jersey in 1930, and moved to Mon-terey, Massachusetts, in 1932, where they lived together until 1944.

 I cannot bring myself to believe that the Full Faith and Credit Clause gave to the few States which offer bargain-counter divorces constitutional power to control the social policy governing domestic relations of the many States which do not.  [This is also a dissent to Coe v. Coe, post, p. 378.] Nor do I regard Davis v. Davis, 305 U. S. 32 , as contrary authority.  That case did not depend for its result on the fact that there had been an adjudication of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the divorce enforced, inasmuch as this Court found that the State granting the divorce was in fact that of the domicile.  305 U. S. at 41.  Moreover this Court’s citation therein of Andrews v. Andrews, *359 supra, indicates an absence of intention to overrule the holding of that case that opportunity to litigate the issue of domicile does not foreclose inquiry as to the true facts.  Andrews v. Andrews has since been cited with respect, as recently as Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 309, 320, n. 7 , and <citedDecision>325 U. S. 226, 229, 240, 242</citedDecision> .  Compare the English laws providing for a King’s Proctor to represent the interests of the Crown in divorce proceedings.  Sections 5-7, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1860, 23 & 24 Vict., c. 144; § 1, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1873, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 31; § 181, The Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, 15 & 16 Geo. 5, c. 49, 9 Halsbury’s Statutes of England 393-94.  Rev. L. 1835, c. 76: § 39.  “When any inhabitant of this state shall go into any other state or country, in order to obtain a divorce for any cause, which had occurred here, and whilst the parties resided here, or for any cause, which would not authorize a divorce, by the laws of this state, a divorce so obtained shall be of no force or effect in this state.” § 40.  “In all other cases, a divorce decreed in any other state or country, according to the law of the place, by a court having jurisdiction of the cause and of both of the parties, shall be valid and effectual in this state.” See note 13, infra.  Del. Rev. Code, c. 86, § 29 (1935).

 Prob. 302; cf. Bergeson, The Divorce Mill Advertises, id. at 348.  Quaere, whether today’s decision applies to ex parte Nevada decrees by default, where the defendant later files a general appearance and the record is made to show jurisdiction nunc pro tunc.  Nev. Comp. Laws (1931-1941 Supp.) § 9488.  It is by no means clear that the issue before the Massachusetts courts in either of these cases was or could have been litigated in Florida or Nevada.  All that the Florida or Nevada courts could have determined was whether the jurisdictional requisites of State law and of the due process clause of the Constitution were met. And if a direct attack on these decrees had been made in this Court, all *368 that we could have decided would have been the due process point.  A divorce may satisfy due process requirements, and be valid where rendered, and still lack the jurisdictional requisites for full faith and credit to be mandatory.  Compare Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U. S. 287, 307 (concurring opinion), with Williams v. North Carolina, <citedDecision>325 U. S. 226</citedDecision> .  This is true even though the Florida and Nevada courts appear to characterize the jurisdictional prerequisites under their respective laws as domicile, Wade v. Wade, 93 Fla. 1004, 1007 ; Latterner v. Latterner, 51 Nev. 285 ; since we may be unwilling to apply as loose a test of “domicile,” in determining whether extrastate enforcement is mandatory, as those States might properly choose to use in determining what divorces might be granted and effective within their own borders.  Thus, at no point in the proceedings in Florida or Nevada in the instant cases was there an opportunity to litigate whether Mrs. Sherrer or Mr. Coe had acquired Florida or Nevada domicile, respectively, sufficient to entitle their divorces to extraterritorial recognition.  North Carolina appears to be the only other State allowing divorce on less than a year’s residence, but it does not allow divorce for many of the usual causes.  The Williams cases attest that its laws are not lax.  The easier it is made for those who through affluence are able to exercise disproportionately large influence on legislation, to obtain migratory divorces, the less likely it is that the divorce laws of their home States will be liberalized, insofar as that is deemed desirable, so as to affect all. See Groves, Migratory Divorces, 2 Law & Con-temp.  Prob. 293, 298.
