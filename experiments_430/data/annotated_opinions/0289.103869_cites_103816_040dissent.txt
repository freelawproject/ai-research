 Normally it is true that strong considerations of fiscal and social policy view tax exemptions with a hostile eye.  Such exemptions are not to be lightly implied, and every reasonable implication in construing legislation is to be *613 made against their grant.  But this general doctrine against tax exemption is irrelevant in considering the taxing power of a state in relation to Indians.  For as to them a totally different principle comes into operation, namely, the special status of Indians during the whole course of our constitutional and legal history.  There can be no doubt of Congress’ plenary power to exempt Indians and their property from all forms of state taxation.  Such power exists to prevent impairment of the manner in, or means by which Congress effectuates its Indian policy, at least so long as Congress has not determined that the interests of the Indians require their complete release from tutelage or the final termination of the United States’ guardianship over them.  Board of Commissioners v. Seber, <citedDecision>318 U. S. 705</citedDecision> ; cf. Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 315-16 ; Brader v. James, 246 U. S. 88, 96 ; United States v. McGowan, 302 U. S. 535, 538 .  See United States v. Sandoval, 231 U. S. 28, 45-47 .  To deny such constitutional power is to deny the presupposition of all legislation relating to Indians as well as an unbroken line of decisions on Indian law in this Court and all that underlies them.  This course of legislation and adjudication may be fairly summarized as recognizing the special relation of Indians toward the United States and the exclusion of state power with relation to them, except in so far as the federal government has actually released to the state governments its constitutional supremacy over this special field.  Therefore, so far as the power of a state to tax Indian property is concerned, the ordinary rule of tax exemption is reversed; a state must make an affirmative showing of a grant by Congress of the withdrawal of the immunity of Indian property from state taxation.  This is so because it is Indian property and because Indians stand in a special relation to the federal government from which the states are excluded unless the Congress has manifested *614 a clear purpose to terminate such an immunity and allow states to treat Indians as part of the general community.  Congress has manifested no such purpose with regard to the estates of the deceased Indians before us.

 In all those cases a non-Indian lessee of restricted Indian lands was held immune from state taxation of various kinds because, and only because, the lands themselves and the leasing of them were held to be immune from taxation, and this in turn because they were the lands of Indians held in Government tutelage, who were permitted to lease the lands only with the approval of the Secretary of the Interior.  This immunity for lessees was withdrawn by Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp., 303 U. S. 376 , which overruled Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra. Cf. the dissenting opinions in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 .  In neither the Coronado case nor in the Mountain Producers case was there any contention that the land in the hands of the lessors was subject to taxation.  That was recognized and accepted as correct.  The point was that even though the land was tax immune in the hands of the lessor, the lessor’s immunity did not extend to the lessee who had no personal immunity and who acquired the land for his own purposes and made a profit from it.  In other words, the withdrawal of immunity from a non-Indian lessee of restricted Indian land rests upon the remoteness of the effect of that taxation upon such Indian property, cf. Graves v. New York ex rel. O’Keefe, 306 U. S. 466 , not upon a notion that Congress did not intend by imposing restrictions to prohibit state taxation of the interest of Indians in their restricted property, nor upon the supposition that Congress lacks power to do so. Congress plainly has power to implement its Indian policy by forbidding state taxation to burden the interest of an Indian in his property.  Cf. Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., 276 *616 U. S. 575 ; Board of Commissioners v. Seber, <citedDecision>318 U. S. 705</citedDecision> .  It exercises that power simply by imposing the restrictions.  That Congress has considered the restriction of Indian property against alienation and encumbrance as carrying with it immunity from state taxation for the period of the restriction is clear not only from statements of Congress itself to that effect, 5 but also from the long history of such restrictions and the purpose sought to be achieved, the protection of a dependent people from their own improvidence and the exploitation of others.  Congress early established the complete and exclusive control of the federal government over the purchase and disposition of Indian lands, both tribal and individual.  6 The protection afforded by those and subsequent restrictive acts and treaties extended to trespasses, transfers, tax sales, tax liens, and other attempted interferences by the state governments with federal control over Indian lands.  See Worcester v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515 ; The Kansas Indians, 5 Wall. 737; The New York Indians, 5 Wall. 761 .  The United States was unable, however, to prevent state interference with the Creeks and the Seminóles in their domains east of the Mississippi, and accordingly proposed removal west of the Mississippi, guaranteeing that there no State or Territory should “ever have a right to pass laws for the government of such Indians, but they shall be allowed to govern themselves, so far as may be compatible with the general jurisdiction which Congress may think proper to exercise over them.” Article XIV, Treaty of March 24, 1832 ( 7 Stat. 366 ).  Long after the removal this guarantee was reaffirmed.  Article IV, Treaty of August 7, 1856 ( 11 Stat. 699 ).  Nothing in the subsequent *617 treaties and allotment acts relating specifically to the Creeks and the Seminóles was inconsistent with this guarantee of freedom from state control.  7 And Congress was careful to provide that nothing in the creation of the State of Oklahoma should qualify this promise.  Thus the Oklahoma Enabling Act ( 34 Stat. 267 ) provided that the Oklahoma Constitution should not “limit or affect the authority of the Government of the United States to make any law or regulation respecting such Indians, their lands, property, or other rights by treaties, agreement, law, or otherwise, which it would have been competent to make if this Act had never been passed.” The constitution adopted by the people of Oklahoma renounced any claims to Indian lands (Art. 1, § 3), and exempted from taxation “such property as may be exempt by reason of treaty stipulations, existing between the Indians and the United States Government, or by Federal laws, during the force and effect of such treaties or Federal laws” (Art. X, § 6).  See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286, 309 ; Ex parte Webb, 226 U. S. 663 , 682-83; Ward v. Love County, 253 U. S. 17 ; Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363, 366 .  As we recently said in <citedDecision>Board of Commissioners</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Seber, supra,</citedDecision> Congress in 1887 turned from a policy of protecting Indian tribes in the possession of their domains to a program, now discontinued, of assimilating the Indians through dissolution of their tribal governments and the compulsory individualization of their lands.  This allotment program evolved out of the historical background sketched above, and took its cue from the previous protection and freedom from state control accorded Indians and their lands.  The Indian surrendered tribal land, pro *618 tected against state taxation as well as against all other forms of voluntary and involuntary encumbrance and alienation.  Cf. The Kansas Indians, supra; The New York Indians, supra. Under the various allotment acts he received in return land which was intended to have the same measure of protection for a temporary period, generally subject to extension.  Thus the General Allotment Act of 1887 ( 24 Stat. 388 ) provided for the issuance to allottees of trust patents which were to declare: “the United States does .  .  .  hold the land thus allotted, for the period of twenty-five years, in trust.. .  and that at the expiration of said period the United States will convey the same by patent to said Indian ... in fee, discharged of said trust and free of all charge or incumbrance whatsoever.” 8 Lands so held in trust are immune from state taxation.  United States v. Rickert, 188 U. S. 432 .  The lands here involved were not allotted under “trust patents”; they were grants in fee subject to restrictions against alienation and encumbrance.  9 But there are no differences of substance between the two forms of tenure which suggest that while the one is exempt from state taxation, the other is not, or that Congress intended to favor Indians holding under “trust patents” over those holding restricted fees.  ‘ Cf. The Kansas Indians, supra, at p. 755.  The power of Congress over “trust” and “restricted” lands is the same, <citedDecision>Board of Commissioners</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Seber, supra,</citedDecision> and in practice the terms have been used interchangeably.  See United States v. Bowling, 256 U. S. 484 ; cf. Minnesota v. United States, 305 U. S. 382 .  Both devices had a common purpose, to protect a dependent *619 people against loss of their property through their own improvidence or the greed of others during the period of transition in which they began to assume the responsibilities of citizenship.  To achieve this purpose the protection afforded by Congress was not niggardly.  See Tiger v. Western Investment Co., 221 U. S. 286 ; Heckman v. United States, 224 U. S. 413 ; Brader v. James, 246 U. S. 88 .  State taxation of “restricted” lands as well as taxation of “trust” lands, in the absence of Congressional authorization, is a possible cause of the loss which Congress has said shall not occur.  The restrictions are not limited to voluntary sale — consistently with their purpose they extend to all forms of transfer or encumbrance, involuntary as well as voluntary.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 It is immaterial that the legislative history of the Act is silent with regard to the tax status of Indian funds.  We are dealing not with a word, nor with an act, but with a course of history.  That course makes it clear that the restricted funds in these estates were beyond the taxing power of Oklahoma.  21 It is not our function to speculate whether it is wise at this late day to relieve from the ordinary burden of taxation Indians who enjoy the privileges of citizenship and who in some instances are persons of substantial means.  Nor is it our legitimate concern that grants of tax exemption to Indian inhabitants may create serious fiscal problems in some states or in their local govern *624 mental subdivisions.  Those matters, as well as the character, extent and duration of tax exemptions for the Indians, are questions of policy for the consideration of Congress, not the courts.  <citedDecision>Board of Commissioners</citedDecision> v. Beber, supra. Our inquiry is not with what Congress might or should have done, but with what it has done.  That inquiry can be answered here only by holding that the restricted funds in these estates, as well as the lands which the Court holds immune, were not subject to Oklahoma’s estate tax. The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Reed and Mr. Justice Frankfurter join in this dissent.  The deceased Indians in these three cases were enrolled full-blood Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes.  Two were Seminóles and one was a Creek.  Congress has not terminated the guardianship relation with respect to these tribes.  They still exist (§ 28 of Act of April 26,1906, 34 Stat. 137 ), and have recently been authorized to resume some of their former powers (Act of June 26, 1936, 49 Stat. 1967 ).  Congress has regarded their members of the half Indian blood or more, whether enrolled or not, as restricted tribal Indians subject to federal control.  The fact that these Indians are citizens is not inconsistent with their restricted status or the exercise of federal supervision over them.  See <citedDecision>Board of Commissioners</citedDecision> v. deber, supra; Glenn v. Lewis, 105 F. 2d 398 .  See Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567 ; Act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861 ; Act of June 30, 1902, 32 Stat. 500 ; § 19 of Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; § 4 of Act of May 10,1928, 45 Stat. 495 and 733.  The fact that the exemptions do not mention inheritance or estate taxes is unimportant.  As pointed out before, contrary to the general rule Indian tax exemptions are to be liberally construed.  See Carpenter v. Shaw, 280 U. S. 363, 366-67 .  For that reason decisions, such as U. S. Trust Co. v. Helvering, 307 U. S. 57 , that statutory exemptions from taxation do not include an exemption from estate taxes, have no application here.  In addition to the statutes cited in Note 2, supra, see also Act of May 27,1908, 35 Stat. 312 ; and Act of January 27, 1933, 47 Stat. 777 .
