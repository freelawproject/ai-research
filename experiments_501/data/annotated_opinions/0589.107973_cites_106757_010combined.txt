**Combined Opinion**
 While the court recognized that generally a manufacturer is free to challenge the validity of an inventor's patent, it held that "one of the oldest doctrines in the field of patent law establishes that so long as a licensee is operating under a license agreement he is estopped to deny the validity of his licensor's patent in a suit for royalties under the agreement.  The theory underlying this doctrine is that a licensee should not be permitted to enjoy the benefit afforded by the agreement while simultaneously urging that the patent which forms the basis of the agreement is void." 67 Cal. 2d 882, 891 , 435 P. 2d 321, 325-326 (1967).  Almost 20 years ago, in its last consideration of the doctrine, this Court also invoked an estoppel to deny a licensee the right to prove that his licensor was demanding royalties for the use of an idea which was in reality a part of the public domain.  Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 339 U. S. 827, 836 (1950).  We granted certiorari in the present case, 391 U. S. 912 , to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule in the light of our recent decisions emphasizing the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas which do not merit patent protection.  Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co., <citedDecision>376 U. S. 225</citedDecision> (1964); Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U. S. 234 (1964).  *657 I.  At the very beginning of the parties' relationship, Lear and Adkins entered into a rudimentary one-page agreement which provided that although "[a]ll new ideas, discoveries, inventions, etc., related to .  .  .  vertical gyros become the property of Mr. John S. Adkins," the inventor promised to grant Lear a license as to all ideas he might develop "on a mutually satisfactory royalty basis." [1] As soon as Adkins' labors yielded tangible results, it quickly became apparent to the inventor that further steps should be taken to place his rights to his ideas on a firmer basis.

 Note, The Doctrine of Licensee Repudiation in Patent Law, 63 Yale L. J. 125 (1953); R. Ellis, Patent Licenses § 328 (3d ed., A. Deller 1958).  And even in the 19th century, state courts had held that if the licensee had not actually sold products incorporating the patent's ideas, he could challenge the validity of the patent.  See Forkosch, Licensee *668 Estoppel in Patent Law, 20 Temp. L. Q. 515, 529, n. 45 (1947).  [13] III. The uncertain status of licensee estoppel in the case law is a product of judicial efforts to accommodate the competing demands of the common law of contracts and the federal law of patents.  On the one hand, the law of contracts forbids a purchaser to repudiate his promises simply because he later becomes dissatisfied with the bargain he has made.  [14] On the other hand, federal law requires that all ideas in general circulation be dedicated to the common good unless they are protected by a valid patent.  <citedDecision>Sears, Roebuck</citedDecision> v. Stiffel Co., supra ; Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., supra .  When faced with this basic conflict in policy, both this Court and courts throughout the land have naturally sought to develop an intermediate position which somehow would remain responsive to the radically different concerns of the two different worlds of contract and patent.  The result has been a failure.  Rather than creative compromise, there has been a chaos of conflicting case law, proceeding on inconsistent premises.  Before renewing the search for an acceptable middle ground, we must reconsider on their own merits the arguments which may properly be advanced on both sides of the estoppel question.  *669 A. It will simplify matters greatly if we first consider the most typical situation in which patent licenses are negotiated.  In contrast to the present case, most manufacturers obtain a license after a patent has issued.

 In this context, we believe that Lear must be required to address its arguments attacking the validity of the underlying patent to the California courts in the first instance.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of California is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.  I concur in the judgment and opinion of the Court, except for what is said in Part III, C, of the Court's opinion.  What the Court does in this part of its opinion is to reserve for future decision the question whether the States have power to enforce contracts under which someone claiming to have a new discovery can obtain payment for disclosing it while his patent application is pending, even though the discovery is later held to be unpatentable.  This reservation is, as I see it, directly *677 in conflict with what this Court held to be the law in Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co., <citedDecision>376 U. S. 225</citedDecision> (1964), and Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc., 376 U. S. 234 (1964).  Brother HARLAN concurred in the result in those cases, sayingcontrary to what the Court held"I see no reason why the State may not impose reasonable restrictions on the future `copying' itself." Compco, supra, at 239 .  Consequently the Court is today joining in the kind of qualification that only MR. JUSTICE HARLAN was willing to make at the time of our Stiffel and Compco decisions.  I still entertain the belief I expressed for the Court in Stiffel and Compco that no State has a right to authorize any kind of monopoly on what is claimed to be a new invention, except when a patent has been obtained from the Patent Office under the exacting standards of the patent laws.  One who makes a discovery may, of course, keep it secret if he wishes, but private arrangements under which self-styled "inventors" do not keep their discoveries secret, but rather disclose them, in return for contractual payments, run counter to the plan of our patent laws, which tightly regulate the kind of inventions that may be protected and the manner in which they may be protected.  The national policy expressed in the patent laws, favoring free competition and narrowly limiting monopoly, cannot be frustrated by private agreements among individuals, with or without the approval of the State.
