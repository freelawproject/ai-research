 14 At the time the allotments to the members of the Five Civilized Tribes were made there was no State of Oklahoma.  It had been held that Congress had power to lay taxes upon Indian property within Indian Territory, Cherokee Tobacco, 11 Wall. 616 , and its creature, the Territorial government, was agitating for the taxation of Indian property.  15 Restrictions, designed to protect the Indians from themselves and the actions of third parties, including state governments, did not bar taxation by the federal government which was the guardian of their interests.  16 Accordingly, specific tax exemptions were written into the allotment acts.  17 Express provisions as to the taxable status of restricted property in the later legislation appear only where the immunity is being limited and expressly waived in part or the restrictions are being changed.  18 All of the lands which the opinion of the Court holds immune from Oklahoma’s estate tax because of express exemptions were therefore also exempt at the moment of death on the additional ground that they were then subject to restrictions imposed by Congress and the concomitant tax immunity had not been waived.  The other restricted lands in the estates are lands to whose taxation Congress has specifically consented, or else were of the type *622 to be taxable at the time of death under the decision in Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., <citedDecision>276 U. S. 575</citedDecision> .  The origin of restrictions upon the fund of members of the Five Civilized Tribes is somewhat different from that upon the lands, but the effect of the restrictions upon the taxability of the cash and securities in the three estates with which we are dealing is the same.  Proceeds from sales or leases of restricted lands have always been regarded as “trust” or “restricted” funds by the Secretary of the Interior, who by regulations has required them to be paid to him or his representatives and held for the benefit of the Indian owner.  19 The validity of those administrative restrictions and the power of the United States to enforce them have been recognized.  Parker v. Richard, 250 U. S. 235 ; Mott v. United States, 283 U. S. 747 .  And it has been held that funds so restricted by departmental regulation are exempt from state and local taxation.  See United States v. Thurston County, 143 F. 287 ; United States v. Hughes, 6 F. Supp. 972 .

 For example, among the statutes applicable to the Creeks and Seminóles, see §§ 3 and 4 of the Act of May 10, 1928, 45 Stat. 495 and 733.  See generally the statutes collected in Note 11, supra. Act of July 1, 1898, 30 Stat. 567 ; Act of March 1, 1901, 31 Stat. 861 ; Act of June 30,1902, 32 Stat. 500 ; § 19 of Act of April 26, 1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; § 4 of the Act of May 10,1928, 45 Stat. 495 and 733.  See Sen. Doc. 169, 58th Cong., 2d Sess. It is for this historical reason that cases such as Superintendent v. Commissioner, 295 U. S. 418 , and Landman v. Commissioner, 123 F. 2d 787 , have no bearing upon a consideration of the effect of restrictions upon the power of a state to tax. See Act of July 1,1898, 30 Stat. 567 ; Act of March 1,1901, 31 Stat. 861 ; Act of June 30,1902, 32 Stat. 500 .  Act of April 26,1906, 34 Stat. 137 ; Act of May 10,1928, 45 Stat. 495 .  Since 1908 the regulations prescribed by the Secretary under § 2 of the Act of 1908, 35 Stat. 312 and related statutes governing oil, gas and other mining leases of restricted lands, have recognized that proceeds from such leases are restricted and have required that all such money be paid to a representative of the Secretary.  See 25 C. F. R. §§ 183.18 , 183.20; see also § 20 of the regulations approved April 20, 1908.  In Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., <citedDecision>276 U. S. 575</citedDecision> , the interest of an oil lessee in land purchased for an Indian by the Secretary of the Interior with the Indian’s restricted funds and conveyed to the Indian by a restricted form of deed pursuant to conditions imposed by the Secretary, was held subject to an Oklahoma oil production tax. The opinion emphasized the difference between “a mere conveyancer’s restriction” and action by Congress.  Two of the decedents died before the Act was passed.  The House Committee report, however, makes it clear that the restriction on funds was intended to be declaratory and retroactive.  H. Rep. No. 1015, 72d Cong., 1st Sess. In view of this there is no reason why the restricted funds in the estates of those decedents, held by the Secretary, should not be deemed covered by that Act, and hence tax exempt by virtue of the restrictions.
