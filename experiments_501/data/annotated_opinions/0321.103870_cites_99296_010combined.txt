**Combined Opinion**
 In passing it deserves to be noted that the four cases which unanimously *663 sustained the power of states to utilize such an educational measure arose and were all decided before the present World War.  But to measure the state's power to make such regulations as are here resisted by the imminence of national danger is wholly to misconceive the origin and purpose of the concept of "clear and present danger." To apply such a test is for the Court to assume, however unwittingly, a legislative responsibility that does not belong to it.  To talk about "clear and present danger" as the touchstone of allowable educational policy by the states whenever school curricula may impinge upon the boundaries of individual conscience, is to take a felicitous phrase out of the context of the particular situation where it arose and for which it was adapted.  Mr. Justice Holmes used the phrase "clear and present danger" in a case involving mere speech as a means by which alone to accomplish sedition in time of war.  By that phrase he meant merely to indicate that, in view of the protection given to utterance by the First Amendment, in order that mere utterance may not be proscribed, "the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent." Schenck v. United States, <citedDecision>249 U.S. 47, 52</citedDecision> .  The "substantive evils" about which he was speaking were inducement of insubordination in the military and naval forces of the United States and obstruction of enlistment while the country was at war.  He was not enunciating a formal rule that there can be no restriction upon speech and, still less, no compulsion where conscience balks, unless imminent danger would thereby be wrought "to our institutions or our government." The flag salute exercise has no kinship whatever to the oath tests so odious in history.  For the oath test was one of the instruments for suppressing heretical beliefs.  *664 Saluting the flag suppresses no belief nor curbs it.  Children and their parents may believe what they please, avow their belief and practice it.
