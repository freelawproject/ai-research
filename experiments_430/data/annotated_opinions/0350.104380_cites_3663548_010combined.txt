 .  .  ." The Superior Court overruled the demurrer, and an appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina followed.  Bullington supported his Superior Court judgment on the ground that the United States Constitution precluded North Carolina from shutting the doors of its courts to him.  The North Carolina Supreme Court, holding that the North Carolina Act of 1933 barred Bullington's suit against Angel, reversed the Superior Court and dismissed the action.  <citedDecision>220 N.C. 18</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>16 S.E.2d 411</citedDecision> .  Bullington did not seek to review this judgment here.  Instead, he sued Angel for the deficiency in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina.  Angel pleaded in bar the judgment in the North Carolina action.  The District Court gave judgment for Bullington, 56 F. Supp. 372 , and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  150 F.2d 679 .  We granted certiorari, 326 U.S. 713 , because the failure *186 to dismiss this action, on the ground that the judgment in the North Carolina court precluded the right thereafter to recover on the same cause of action in the federal court, presented an important question in the administration of justice.

 Angel, by demurrer, resisted on the ground that a North Carolina statute precluded a deficiency judgment.  The North Carolina Supreme Court, reversing the trial court, found the North Carolina statute a bar to such a suit.  It said that "the limitation created by the statute is upon the jurisdiction of the court in that it is declared that the holder of notes given to secure the purchase price of real property `shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account' thereof.  This closes the courts of this State to one who seeks a deficiency judgment on a note given for the purchase price of real property.  The statute operates upon the adjective law of the State, which pertains to the practice and procedure, *188 or legal machinery by which the substantive law is made effective, and not upon the substantive law itself.  It is a limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts of this State." <citedDecision>220 N.C. 18, 20</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>16 S.E. 2d 411, 412</citedDecision> .  But the allowable "limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts" of North Carolina presents more than a question of local law for determination by the North Carolina Supreme Court. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Mr. Justice Brandeis thus expressed the subordination to the requirements of the Constitution of the power of a State to withdraw jurisdiction from its courts: "The power of a State to determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the controversies which shall be heard in them is, of course subject to the restrictions imposed by the Federal Constitution." McKnett v. St. Louis & S.F. Ry. Co., 292 U.S. 230, 233 .  The Contract Clause, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the Privileges or Immunities Clause, all fetter the freedom of a State to deny access to its courts howsoever much it may regard such withdrawal of jurisdiction "the adjective law of the State," or the exercise of its right to regulate "the practice and procedure" of its courts.  Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U.S. 629, 642 .  A State "cannot escape its constitutional obligations by the simple device of denying jurisdiction in such cases to courts otherwise competent." Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 252 U.S. 411, 415 ; and see White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646 .

 But, if so, why speak also of res judicata?  The law should not be made into such a merry-go-round.  Bullington is entitled to one full day in court on the substance of his claim.  This he has not had.  I hardly need add that I agree with the views expressed by MR. JUSTICE REED.  MR. JUSTICE JACKSON joins in this opinion.  NOTES [1] <citedDecision>220 N.C. at 20-21</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>16 S.E.2d at 412</citedDecision> : "The statute operates upon the adjective law of the State, which pertains to the practice and procedure, or legal machinery by which the substantive law is made effective, and not upon the substantive law itself.  It is a limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts of this State.  "The Legislature, within constitutional limitations, can fix and circumscribe the jurisdiction of the courts of this State.  The Legislature has exercised its prerogative to so limit the jurisdiction of the courts of this State that holders of notes given for purchase price of real estate are not entitled to a deficiency judgment thereon in such courts.  We cannot hold that this action upon part of the legislative branch of our government impinged the full faith and credit clause of the Constitution of the United States or the general doctrine that the validity of a contract is determined by the law of the place where made, the lex loci contractus as distinguished from the lex fori.  Both the constitutional provision urged and the general doctrine invoked by the appellee are substantive law and the statute involved, as aforesaid, relates solely to the adjective law. No denial of the full force and credit of the Virginia contract is made, and no interpretation or construction of the contract involved is attempted.  The court, being deprived of its jurisdiction, has no power to render a judgment for the plaintiff in the cause of action alleged.
