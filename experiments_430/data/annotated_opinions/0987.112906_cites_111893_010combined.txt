Id. , at 547.  Marshall thus suggests that application of the Double Jeopardy Clause, like that of other constitutional guarantees, is a function of the type of contempt proceeding at issue.  Chapman , it follows, cannot be said to control this case. Rather, whatever application Chapman (and, by implication, Jurney ) might have in the context of judicial contempt is limited to cases of in-court contempts that constitute direct obstructions of the judicial process and for which summary *723 proceedings remain acceptable.  Cf. Marshall, supra, at 543 .  Neither Dixon nor Foster is such a case. [1] The United States' second, more powerful, argument is that contempt and the underlying substantive crime constitute two separate offenses for they involve injuries to two distinct interests, the one the interest of the court in preserving its authority, the other the public's interest in being protected from harmful conduct.  This position finds support in Justice Blackmun's partial dissent, see post, at 743, and is bolstered by reference to numerous decisions acknowledging the importance and role of the courts' contempt power.  See, e. g., Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., <citedDecision>481 U. S. 787, 800</citedDecision> (1987); Michaelson v. United States ex rel. Chicago, St. P., M. & O. R. Co., 266 U. S. 42, 65 (1924); Gompers v. Bucks Stove & Range Co., 221 U. S. 418, 450 (1911).  It cannot lightly be dismissed.  Indeed, we recognized in <citedDecision>Young, supra,</citedDecision> that contempt "proceedings are not intended to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws.  Rather, they are designed to serve the limited purpose of vindicating the authority of the court. In punishing contempt, the Judiciary is sanctioning conduct that *724 violates specific duties imposed by the court itself, arising directly from the parties' participation in judicial proceedings." <citedDecision>Id.</citedDecision> , at 800.  The fact that two criminal prohibitions promote different interests may be indicative of legislative intent and, to that extent, important in deciding whether cumulative punishments imposed in a single prosecution violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U. S. 359, 366-368 (1983).  But the cases decided today involve instances of successive prosecutions in which the interests of the defendant are of paramount concern.  To subject an individual to repeated prosecutions exposes him to "embarrassment, expense and ordeal," Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 187 (1957), violates principles of finality, United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 343 (1975), and increases the risk of a mistaken conviction.  That one of the punishments is designed to protect the court rather than the public is, in this regard, of scant comfort to the defendant.  [2] It is true that the Court has not always given primacy to the defendant's interest.

 It is past dispute, in other words, that "the two tribunals that tried the accused exert all their powers under and by the authority of the same governmentthat of the United States," Grafton, supra, at 355 , and, therefore, that the dual *727 sovereignty doctrine poses no problem.  Cf. Heath, supra, at 88 .  [3] B Both the Government and amici submit that application of the Double Jeopardy Clause in this context carries grave practical consequences.  See also post, at 742-743 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  Itwould, it is argued, cripple the power to enforce court orders or, alternatively, allow individuals to escape serious punishment for statutory criminal offenses.  The argument, an offshoot of the principle of necessity familiar to the law of contempt, see, e. g., United States v. Wilson, 421 U. S. 309, 315-318 (1975), is that, just as we have relaxed certain procedural requirements in contempt proceedings where time is of the essence and an immediate remedy is needed to "prevent a breakdown of the proceedings," id. , at 319, so too should we exclude double jeopardy protections from this setting lest we do damage to the courts' authority.  In other words, "[t]he ability to punish disobedience to judicial orders [being] regarded as essential to ensuring that the Judiciary has a means to vindicate its own authority," Young, <citedDecision>481 U. S., at 796</citedDecision> , its exercise should not be inhibited by fear that it might immunize defendants from subsequent criminal prosecution.  Adherence to double jeopardy principles in this context, however, will not seriously deter the courts from taking appropriate steps to ensure that their authority is not flouted.  *728 Courts remain free to hold transgressors in contempt and punish them as they see fit.  The Government counters that this possibility will prove to be either illusoryif the prosecuting authority declines to initiate proceedings out of fear that they could jeopardize more substantial punishment for the underlying crimeor too costlyif the prosecuting authority, the risk notwithstanding, chooses to go forward.  But it is not fanciful to imagine that judges and prosecutors will select a third option, which is to ensure, where necessary or advisable, that the contempt and the substantive charge be tried at the same time, in which case the double jeopardy issue "would be limited to ensuring that the total punishment did not exceed that authorized by the legislature." United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435, 450 (1989).  Indeed, the Court recently exercised its supervisory power to suggest that a federal court "ordinarily should first request the appropriate prosecuting authority to prosecute contempt actions, and should appoint a private prosecutor only if that request is denied." Young, <citedDecision>481 U. S., at 801</citedDecision> .  Just as "[i]n practice, courts can reasonably expect that the public prosecutor will accept the responsibility for prosecution," ibid., so too can the public prosecutor reasonably anticipate that the court will agree to some delay ifneeded to bring the two actions together.  Against this backdrop, the appeal of the principle of necessity loses much of its force.  Ultimately, the urgency of punishing such contempt violations is no less, but by the same token no more, than that of punishing violations of criminal laws of general applicationin which case, we simply do not question the defendant's right to the "protections worked out carefully over the years and deemed fundamental to our system of justice," Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U. S., at 208 , including the protection of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  "Perhaps to some extent we sacrifice efficiency, expedition, and economy, but the choice .  .  .

 II If, as the Court agrees, the Double Jeopardy Clause cannot be ignored in this context, my view is that the subsequent prosecutions in both Dixon and Foster were impermissible as to all counts.  I reach this conclusion because the offenses at issue in the contempt proceedings were either identical to, or lesser included offenses of, those charged in the subsequent prosecutions.  Justice Scalia's contrary conclusion as to some of Foster's counts, which he reaches by exclusive focus on the formal elements of the relevant crimes, is divorced from the purposes of the constitutional provision he purports to apply.  Moreover, the results to which this approach would lead are indefensible.  A The contempt orders in Foster and Dixon referred in one case to the District's laws regarding assaults and threats, and, in the other, to the criminal code in its entirety.  The prohibitions imposed by the court orders, in other words, *732 duplicated those already in place by virtue of the criminal statutes.  Aside from differences in the sanctions inflicted, the distinction between being punished for violation of the criminal laws and being punished for violation of the court orders, therefore, is simply this: Whereas in the former case "the entire population" is subject to prosecution, in the latter such authority extends only to "those particular persons whose legal obligations result from their earlier participation in proceedings before the court." Young, <citedDecision>481 U. S., at 800, n. 10</citedDecision> .  But the offenses that are to be sanctioned in either proceeding must be similar, since the contempt orders incorporated, in full or in part, the criminal code. [7] *733 Thus, in this case, the offense for which Dixon was held in contempt was possession with intent to distribute drugs.  Since he previously had been indicted for precisely the same offense, the double jeopardy bar should apply.  In Foster's contempt proceeding, he was acquitted with respect to threats allegedly made on November 12, 1987, and March 26 and May 17, 1988.  He was found in contempt of court for having committed the following offenses: Assaulting his wife on November 6, 1987, and May 21, 1988, and threatening her on September 17, 1987.  598 A. 2d, at 727 ; App. 42.  The subsequent indictment charged Foster with simple assault on November 6, 1987 (Count I); threatening to injure another on or about November 12, 1987, and March 26 and May 17, 1988 (Counts II, III, and IV); and assault with intent to kill on or about May 21, 1988 (Count V).

 I write separately to emphasize two interrelated points.  I I agree with Justice Souter that "the Blockburger test is not the exclusive standard for determining whether the rule against successive prosecutions applies in a given case." Post, at 756.  I also share both his and Justice White's dismay that the Court so cavalierly has overruled a precedent that is barely three years old and that has proved neither unworkable nor unsound.  I continue to believe that Grady v. Corbin, 495 U. S. 508 (1990), was correctly decided, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits a subsequent criminal prosecution where the proof required to convict on the later offense would require proving conduct that constitutes an offense for which a defendant already has been prosecuted.  If this were a case involving successive prosecutions under the substantive criminal law (as was true in Harris v. Oklahoma, 433 U. S. 682 (1977), Illinois v. Vitale, 447 U. S. 410 (1980), and Grady ), I would agree that the Double Jeopardy *742 Clause could bar the subsequent prosecution.  But we are concerned here with contempt of court, a special situation.  We explained in Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., <citedDecision>481 U. S. 787</citedDecision> (1987): "The fact that we have come to regard criminal contempt as `a crime in the ordinary sense,' [ Bloom v. Illi- nois, 391 U. S. 194, 201 (1968)], does not mean that any prosecution of contempt must now be considered an execution of the criminal law in which only the Executive Branch may engage.  .  .  .  That criminal procedure protections are now required in such prosecutions should not obscure the fact that these proceedings are not intended to punish conduct proscribed as harmful by the general criminal laws.  Rather, they are designed to serve the limited purpose of vindicating the authority of the court. In punishing contempt, the Judiciary is sanctioning conduct that violates specific duties imposed by the court itself, arising directly from the parties' participation in judicial proceedings." Id., at 799-800.

 See D. C. Code Ann. § 11-944 (Supp. 1992); see also Caldwell v. United States, 595 A. 2d 961, 964-966 (D. C. 1991).  Significantly, some courts have found no bar to the imposition of a prison sentence for contempt even where the court order that was transgressed was an injunction against violation of a statute that itself did not provide for imprisonment as a penalty.  See, e. g., United States v. Quade, 563 F. 2d 375, 379 (CA8 1977), cert. denied, 434 U. S. 1064 (1978); Mitchell v. Fiore, 470 F. 2d 1149, 1154 (CA3 1972), cert. denied, 411 U. S. 938 (1973); United States v. Fidanian, 465 F. 2d 755, 757-758 (CA5), cert. denied, 409 U. S. 1044 (1972).  [4]  That the contempt proceeding was brought and prosecuted by a private party in Foster is immaterial.  For "[p]rivate attorneys appointed to prosecute a criminal contempt action represent the United States, not the party that is the beneficiary of the court order allegedly violated.As we said in Gompers , criminal contempt proceedings arising out of civil litigation `arebetween the public and the defendant ... .' 221 U. S.,at 445." Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A., <citedDecision>481 U. S. 787, 804</citedDecision> (1987).  [5]  Like Justice Scalia, I take no positions to the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause to conduct warranting summary contempt proceedings.  See ante, at 697, n. 1.  In different circumstances, the Court has recognized exceptions to the policy of avoiding multiple trials where "`there is a manifest necessity.' " United States v. Wilson, 420 U. S. 332, 344 (1975) (quoting United States v. Perez, 9 Wheat. 579, 580 (1824)).  [6]  The laws of different jurisdictions make such alternatives more or less available but that, ofcourse, can have no bearing on the constitutional requirements we recognize today.  In the District of Columbia, D. C. Code Ann. § 23-1329 (1989) contemplates both revocation of release and an order of detention in the event a condition of release has been violated.
