**Combined Opinion**
 Respondent participated in the Florida proceedings by entering a general appearance, filing pleadings placing in issue the very matters he sought subsequently to contest in the Massachusetts courts, personally appearing before the Florida court and giving testimony in the case, and by retaining attorneys who represented him throughout the entire proceedings.  It has not been contended that respondent was given less than a full opportunity to contest the issue of petitioner's domicile or any other issue relevant to the litigation.  There is nothing to indicate that the Florida court would not have evaluated fairly and in good faith all relevant evidence submitted to it.  Respondent does not even contend that on the basis of the evidence introduced in the Florida proceedings, that court reached an erroneous result on the issue of petitioner's domicile.  If respondent failed to take advantage of the opportunities afforded him, the responsibility is his own.  We do not believe that the dereliction of a defendant under such circumstances should be permitted to provide a basis for subsequent attack in the courts of a sister State on a decree valid in the State in which it was rendered.  17 It is suggested, however, that Andrews v. Andrews, 1903, <citedDecision>188 U.S. 14</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>23 S.Ct. 237</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>47 L.Ed. 366</citedDecision> , militates against the result we have reached.  In that case a husband, who had been domiciled in Ms sachusetts, instituted divorce proceedings in a South Dakota court after having satisfied the residence requirements of that State.  The wife appeared by counsel and filed pleadings challenging the husband's South Dakota domicile.  Before the decree of divorce was granted, however, the wife, pursuant to a consent agreement between the parties, withdrew her appearance from the proceedings.  Following the entry of the decree, the husband returned to Massachusetts and subsequently remarried.  After his death a contest developed between his first and second wives as to the administration of the husband's estate.  The Massachusetts court concluded that the South Dakota decree of divorce was void on the ground that the husband had not been domiciled in that State and that under the applicable statutes of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts courts were not required to give recognition to such a decree.

 But such certainly has not been the law since 1873.  Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457 , 21 L.Ed. 897 .  Nor was it the law when this Court last considered the divorce problem, in 1945.  Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U.S. 226 , 65 S.Ct. 1092 , 89 L.Ed. 1577 , 157 A.L.R. 1366 .  A State that is asked to enforce the action of another State may appropriately ascertain whether that other State had power to do what it purported to do.  And if the enforcing State has an interest under our Constitution in regard to the subject-matter that is vital and intimate, it should not be within the power of private parties to foreclose that interest by their private arrangement.  Andrews v. Andrews, <citedDecision>188 U.S. 14</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>23 S.Ct. 237</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>47 L.Ed. 366</citedDecision> ; cf. Fall v. Eastin, 215 U.S. 1 , 30 S.Ct. 3 , 54 L.Ed. 65 , 23 L.R.A.,N.S., 924, 17 Ann.Cas. 853; Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Commission, 294 U.S. 532 , 55 S.Ct. 518 , 79 L.Ed. 1044 .  29 If the marriage contract were no different from a contract to sell an automobile, the parties thereto might well be permitted to bargain away all interests involved, in or out of court. But the State has an interest in the family relations of its citizens vastly different from the interest it has in an ordinary commercial transaction.  That interest cannot be bartered or bargained away by the immediate parties to the controversy by a default or an arranged contest n  a proceeding for divorce in a State to which the parties are strangers.  Therefore, the constitutional power of a State to determine the marriage status of two of its citizens should not be deemed foreclosed by a proceeding between the parties in another State, even though in other types of controversy considerations making it desirable to put an end to litigation might foreclose the parties themselves from reopening the dispute.  1 I cannot agree that the Constitution forbids a state from insisting that it is not bound by any such proceedings in a distant State wanting in the power that domicile alone gives, and that its courts need not honor such an intrinsically sham proceeding, no matter who brings the issue to their attention.  30 That society has a vital interest in the domestic relations of its members will be almost impatiently conceded.  2 But it is not enough to pay lip-service to the commonplace as an abstraction.

 26 Broderick v. Rosner, 1935, 294 U.S. 629, 642 , 55 S.Ct. 589, 592 , 79 L.Ed. 1100 , 100 A.L.R. 1133 ; Williams v. North Carolina, 1942, 317 U.S. 287, 294, 295 , 63 S.Ct. 207, 210, 211 .  27 Williams v. North Carolina, 1945, 325 U.S. 226 , 65 S.Ct. 1092 .  28 Cf. Stoll v. Gottlieb, 1938, 305 U.S. 165, 172 , 59 S.Ct. 134, 137 .  1 Nor do I regard Davis v. Davis, 305 U.S. 32 , 59 S.Ct. 3 , 83 L.Ed. 26 , 118 A.L.R. 1518 , as contrary authority.  That case did not depend for its result on the fact that there had been an adjudication of the jurisdiction of the court rendering the divorce enforced, inasmuch as this Court found that the State granting the divorce was in fact that of the domicile.  305 U.S. at page 41, 59 S.Ct. at pages 6, 7.  Moreover this Court's citation therein of Andrews v. <citedDecision>Andrews, supra,</citedDecision> indicates an absence of intention to overrule the holding of that case that opportunity to litigate the issue of domicile does not foreclose inquiry as to the true facts.  Andrews v. Andrews has since been cited with respect, as recently as Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287, 309, 320, n. 7 , 63 S.Ct. 207, 218, 223 , 87 L.Ed. 279 , 143 A.L.R. 1273 , and Id., 325 U.S. 226, 229, 240, 242 , 65 S.Ct. 1092, 1094, 1095, 1100 .  2 Compare the English laws providing for a King's Proctor to represent the interests of the Crown in divorce proceedings.  Sections 5—7, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1860, 23 & 24 Vict., c. 44; § 1, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1873, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 31; § 181, The Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, 15 § 16 Geo. 5, c. 49, 9 Halsbury's Statutes of England 393, 394.  3 Rev.L.  1835, c. 76: § 39.  When any inhabitant of this state shall go into any other state or country, in order to obtain a divorce for any cause which had occurred here, and whilst the parties resided here, or for any cause which would not authorize a divorce by the laws of this state, a divorce so obtained shall be of no force or effect in this state.
