<p id="b123-5">I find myself in disagreement with the majority opinion, not because of its interpretation of the scope of the immunity provisions here in question, but because it sanctions the procedure used below to convict petitioner summarily of criminal contempt and to sentence him to 15 months’ imprisonment under Rule 42 (a) when the proceedings should have been in accordance with Rule 42 (b). The denial of even the minimal protections accorded by Rule 42 (b) deprived petitioner of an opportunity to prepare a legal defense, or to demonstrate extenuating circumstances,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and satisfied neither the plain intent of Rule 42 nor the principles of fair play.</p>
<p id="b123-7">Rule 42 (b) prescribes that criminal contempts “shall” be prosecuted on notice allowing a “reasonable time for the preparation of the defense” and other protections, except in those instances wherein Rule 42 (a) provides that contempts committed in the presence of the court “may” be punished summarily. This demonstrates that the general mode of procedure was to be that prescribed by Rule 42 (b). On the other hand, Rule 42 (a) covers <page-number citation-index="1" label="54">*54</page-number>only specific situations and even then the contempt procedure need not be summary. In the light of the concern long demonstrated by both Congress <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and this Court<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> over the possible abuse of the contempt power, ■ it is obvious that Rule 42, (a) was reserved for exceptional circumstances. These might include threatening the judge, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>176 F. 2d 163, or other acts disrupting,court proceedings, and obstructing the administration of the court’s business. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Landes, </em>97 F. 2d 378.</p>
<p id="b124-4">Rule 42 (a) was not inserted in the Rules in order to ease the difficulties of prosecuting contempts. It was not meant to authorize the practice of having government prosecutors force persons who had already committed con-tempts outside of the presence of the court to repeat the action before the court and thus subject themselves to deprivation of'their rights under Rule 42 (b). Given the purpose of Rule 42 (a) with its admittedly precipitous character and extremely harsh consequences, this Court should not countenance a procedure whereby a contempt already completed out of the .court’s presence may be reproduced in a command pérformance before the court to justify summary disposition. That is not to say the Government could not properly bring the petitioner before the court a second time. Of course, both the Government and the grand jury could use such additional persuasion to obtain answers to the questions. But that second refusal should not constitute a second contempt. Nor should this procedure alone justify imposing a more <page-number citation-index="1" label="55">*55</page-number>severe penalty than would have been appropriate for contempt of the grand jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b125-5">After petitioner refused to answer the questions the judge might very properly have summarily committed the petitioner to jail for civil contempt until he answered the questions. <em>Oriel </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>278 U. S. 358, 363. See <em>Gompers </em>v <em>Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co., </em>221 U. S. 418, 442. This is not disputed. • In such a proceeding the recalcitrant witness although summarily committed is said to carry the keys to the jail in his own pocket. See <em>In re Nevitt, </em>117 F. 448, 461. Or, upon presentment, the judge might have given notice in open court of a criminal contempt proceeding to be commenced under the procedures set forth in Rule 42 (b), and the Government so concedes. That is the normal manner of proceeding in these cases. See <em>Wong Gim Ying </em>v. <em>United States, </em>98 U. S. App. D. C. 23, 27, 231 F. 2d 776, 780; <em>Carlson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>209 F. 2d 209, 216.</p>
<p id="b125-6">But the Government was not satisfied with such a procedure. On April 8, though., ostensibly seeking the court’s assistance in obtaining the answers to the questions, the prosecutor never even faintly suggested any coercive remedy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Rather, from thé outset he spoke in terms assuming that petitioner would continue his refusal to testify and made known to the court that he would seek a summary disposition under Rule 42 (a) immediately. After the finding of contempt, he asked the judge to. <page-number citation-index="1" label="56">*56</page-number>give petitioner a substantial sentence and the judge complied — with 15 months in the penitentiary. He then asked the judge to omit a purge clause which the judge did.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thereafter he urged the judge to deny bail and the judge promptly acceded to that request.</p>
<p id="b126-4">Beyond a short statement, nothing was offered by the Assistant United States Attorney to show the seriousness of the contempt.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The offense the grand jury was investigating was punishable by no more than a fine. 71 Stat. 352, 49 U. S. C. (Supp. V) § 322 (a).</p>
<p id="b126-5">I do not assert that the contempt could not be more serious than the offense under investigation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but where there is a disparity such as exists in this case, a hearing should be held to demonstrate, subject to rebuttal, at least the purpose and significance of the grand jury ■investigation, the witness’ relationship to the subject matter under investigation, and the effect of the witness’ recalcitrance on the future of the investigation.</p>
<p id="b126-6">The Court’s opinion observes that the judge may reduce the sentence within 60 days of the termination of these proceedings under Rule 35. But that power has been held to be discretionary, <em>Flores </em>v. <em>United States, </em>238 F. <page-number citation-index="1" label="57">*57</page-number>2d <em>758; Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>224 F. 2d 561, and does not in any sense make-a term in the penitentiary comparablevto a jail commitment for civil contempt. Exercise of Rule 35 power does not make petitioner any less a convicted criminal. Also, the failure to invoke civil contempt indicates that the judge intended the sentence to be punitive and not coercive.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b127-4">It is asserted that only a legal issue is involved here— the scope of immunity — so. that there was no need to give petitioner time to.'prepare a defense under Rule 42 (b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But this overlooks the right of petitioner to .present evidence in extenuation and to show what other courts had done in similar circumstances. This argument also neglects the importance of affording the judge an opportunity for reflection. A judge should not be forced — or goaded— into spur-of-the-moment decisions where the imprisonment of a person is in the balance. There is no indication that the district judge expected the grand jury to return on the afternoon of April 8. Yet, within a short time after its return, the judge had convicted the petitioner and séntenced him to 15 months in prison for his conduct and had denied bail. Neither counsel discussed the sentences given, in comparable cases and, from the severity of the sentence here, it is clear that the judge was not <page-number citation-index="1" label="58">*58</page-number>advised how othér judges were treating similar offenses.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is no statutory limit for the length of sentence in contempts of this character. Apparently, the 15-month sentence in this-case is the longest contempt sentence ever <page-number citation-index="1" label="59">*59</page-number>sustained by any appellate court in the federal system for a refusal to answer questions of a court or grand jury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Even a short delay might have given the judge, enough time for research to establish that the Government’s reason for seeking omission of the purge clause was groundless.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Also, the judge took no time to consider the bail <page-number citation-index="1" label="60">*60</page-number>question. After a minimum of argument by counsel, the judge denied bail pending appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b130-4">Shortcuts in criminal procedure are always confusing<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and dangerous, but they aré particularly so here, because if sanctioned by this Court, prosecutors throughout the federal system will be tempted to do all they can to make Rule 42 (b) a dead letter. The contempt power traditionally has been utilized sparingly and only when necessary to uphold the dignity of the courts. Early in our history, the limits of the power to punish, for contempt were said to be “the least possible power adequate to the end proposed!” <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Dunn, </em>6 Wheat. 204, 231. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter has said in <em>Sacher </em>v. <em>United States, </em>343 U. S. 1, 24-25 (dissenting opinion):</p>
<blockquote id="b130-5">“To dispense with indictment by grand jury and trial by a jury of twelve does not mean the right to disregard reason and fairness. Reason and fairness demand, even in punishing contempt, procedural safeguards within which the needs for the effective administration of justice can be amply satisfied while at the same time the reach of so drastic a power is <page-number citation-index="1" label="61">*61</page-number>kept within limits that will minimize abuse. While experience has shown the necessity of recognizing that courts possess this authority, experience has also proven that restrictions appropriate to the purposes of the power must fence in its exercise. Hence Congress, by legislation dating back more than a hundred years, has put geographic and procedural restrictions upon the power of the United States courts to punish summarily for contempt. . . .</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b131-5">“The Court did so for a reason deeply imbedded in our legal system and by that very fact too often neglected. Times of tension, which are usually periods of war and their aftermath, bring it to the surface. Reflecting no doubt their concern over untoward events in law enforcement arising out of the First World War, Mr. Justice Brandéis and Mr. Justice Holmes gave quiet warning when they observed that ‘in the development of our liberty insistence upon procedural regularity has been a large factor.’ <em>Burdeau </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>256 U. S. 465, 477. It is not for nothing that most of the provisions of our Bill of Rights are concerned with matters of procedure.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b131-6">“That is what this case is about — ‘procedural regularity.’ Not whether these petitioners have been guilty of conduct professionally inexcusable, but what tribunal should sit in judgment; not whether they should be punished, but who shoiild mete out the appropriate punishment; not whether a Federal court has authority to prevent its proceedings from being subverted, but how that authority should be exercised so as to assure the rectitude of legal proceedings and at the same time not detract from the authority of law itself.”</blockquote>
<p id="b131-7">And, shortly thereafter, the Court adopted this viewpoint. See <em>Offutt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>348 U. S. 11. The importance of procedural regularity often lies in advising <page-number citation-index="1" label="62">*62</page-number>the defendant of the procedure he must expect and giving him time to prepare. Also, judicial reflection is an invaluable by-product of procedures that are designed to be no more precipitous than necessary to meet the demands of the situation. Here, there was no demonstrated need for haste and no resultant benefit (except in saving the United States Attorney’s office the-time and effort of preparing for a hearing on notice). There had already been a fully committed contempt before the grand jury which might have been prosecuted within a short time giving petitioner only “a reasonable time for the preparation of the defense.” This Court with its supervisory power over the administration of criminal justice in. the federal courts, <em>McNabb </em>v. <em>United States, </em>318 U. S. 332, 340, should not permit the utilization of summary contempt procedures where immediate action is not necessary'for the preservation of the respect and dignity of the federal courts. Improvident use of summary procedures only weakens that respect.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b132-4">In the light of the sentences given in this type of case, I doubt if any judge in the federal system would summarily send a witness to the penitentiary for 15 months' for merely refusing to testify in a grand jury investigation of whether a trucker is operating without an ICC certificate. It is quite obvious that much of the sentence was for some reason collateral to that investigation. It is not sufficient for the purpose of increasing punishment to act on the suspicion that the refusal of the witness to testify may redound to the interest of a racketeer, and on that basis deny him the protections that Congress has seen fit to accord to all witnesses before grand juries. If such factors are to play a part in the sentence the witness is entitled to a hearing on notice.</p>
<p id="b133-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="63">*63</page-number>Unfortunately, the failure to adhere to procedural regularity may be glossed over in the investigation of matters of burning public interest, but it should be remembered that the deprivation of the rights of a witness in such an investigation must apply as a precedent to people in all walks of life, both good and bad. I suggest that the full import of the decision -in this case will not be recognized until it is applied at some future time in other types of investigations and to other people.</p>
<p id="b133-5">I would reverse the conviction.</p>
<footnote label="1">
<p id="b123-8"> The prosecutor indicated to the court that the inquiry, though directed toward minor .violations of the Interstate Commerce Act, was really, part of an effort to discover facts concerning notorious gangsters suspected of complicity in the Victor Riesel acid-throwing incident and general racketeering in the Southern District of New York. In view of the total absence of any intimation that petitioner had violated the Interstate Commerce Act or was himself guilty of criminal conduct, the actual basis for his refusal to testify may well have been fear of gangster reprisals, a not unreasonable fear in such circumstances. Regardless.of the legal significance of such a defense, see <em>Widger </em>v. <em>United States, </em>244 F. 2d 103, a hearing .would have provided an opportunity for presentation of such facts to the judge and might well have affected the length of sentence.</p>

There is no indication of any change in this situation after the refusal to answer and before the actual contempt proceeding.
