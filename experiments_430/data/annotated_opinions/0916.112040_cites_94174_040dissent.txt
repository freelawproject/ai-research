**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice O’Connor, dissenting.  The Court today overrules a precedent that it has honored for nearly 100 years and expresses a willingness to cancel the constitutional immunity that traditionally has shielded the interest paid on state and local bonds from federal taxation.  Henceforth the ability of state and local governments to finance their activities will depend in part on whether Congress voluntarily abstains from tapping this permissible source of additional income tax revenue.  I believe that state autonomy is an important factor to be considered in reviewing the National Government’s exercise of its enumerated powers.  Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U. S. 528, 581 (1985) (O’Connor, J., joined by Powell and Rehnquist, JJ., dissenting).  I dissent from the decision to overrule Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., <citedDecision>157 U. S. 429</citedDecision> (1895), and I would invalidate Congress’ attempt to regulate the sovereign States by threatening to deprive them of this tax immunity, which would increase their dependence on the National Government.  Section 310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), 26 U. S. C. § 103 (j)(1), provides that the interest paid on state and local bonds will be subject to federal income tax unless the bonds are issued in registered form.  The Court readily concludes that Congress could have prohibited outright the issuance of bearer bonds without violating the Tenth Amendment.  Ante, at 511-513.  But regardless of whether Congress could have required registration of the bonds directly under its commerce power, I agree with the Court that Congress may not accomplish the same end by an unconstitutional means.  Ante, at 515-516.  *531 In my view, the Tenth Amendment and principles of federalism inherent in the Constitution prohibit Congress from taxing or threatening to tax the interest paid on state and municipal bonds.
