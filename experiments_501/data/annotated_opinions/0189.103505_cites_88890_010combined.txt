 Frankfurter & Landis, Power of Congress Over Procedure in Criminal Contempts in "Inferior" Federal Courts ย A Study in Separation of Powers, 37 Harv. L. Rev. 1010 .  Congress was responding to grievances arising out of the exercise of judicial power as dramatized by the Peck impeachment proceedings.  Congress was intent on curtailing that power.  The two sections of the Act of March 2, 1831 when read together, as they must be clearly indicate that the category of criminal cases which could be tried without a jury was narrowly confined.  That the previously undefined power of the courts was *48 substantially curtailed by that Act was early recognized by lower federal courts.  United States v. Holmes, Fed. Cas. No. 15,383, at p. 363; Ex parte Poulson, Fed. Cas. No. 11,350; United States v. New Bedford Bridge, Fed. Cas. No. 15,867, at p. 104; United States v. Seeley, Fed. Cas. No. 16,248a; United States v. Emerson, 4 Cranch (C.C.) 188; Fed. Cas. No. 15,050; Kent's Commentaries (3rd ed. 1836) pp. 300-301.  And when the Act came before this Court in Ex parte Robinson, <citedDecision>19 Wall. 505, 511</citedDecision> , Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the Court, acknowledged that it had limited the power of those courts.  And see Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364, 374 .  So far as the decisions of this Court are concerned, that view persisted to the time when Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra , was decided.  See Ex parte Wall, 107 U.S. 265 ; Savin, Petitioner, 131 U.S. 267, 276 ; Cuddy, Petitioner, 131 U.S. 280, 285 ; Eilenbecker v. District Court, 134 U.S. 31, 38 .  Mindful of that history, we come to the construction of ยง 268 of the Judicial Code in light of the specific facts of this case. The question is whether the words "so near thereto" have a geographical or a causal connotation.  Read in their context and in the light of their ordinary meaning, we conclude that they are to be construed as geographical terms.  In <citedDecision>Ex parte Robinson, supra, at p. 511</citedDecision> , it was said that as a result of those provisions the power to punish for contempts "can only be exercised to insure order and decorum" in court. "Misbehavior of any person in their presence" plainly falls in that category.  Ex parte Terry, 128 U.S. 289 .  And in Savin, Petitioner, supra, it was also held to include attempted bribes of a witness, one in the jury room and within a few feet of the court room and one in the hallway immediately adjoining the court room.  See Cooke v. United States, 267 U.S. 517 .  The phrase "so near thereto as to obstruct the administration of justice" likewise connotes *49 that the misbehavior must be in the vicinity of the court. Nelles & King, Contempt by Publication in the United States, 28 Col. L. Rev. 525, 530.  It is not sufficient that the misbehavior charged has some direct relation to the work of the court. "Near" in this context, juxtaposed to "presence," suggests physical proximity not relevancy.  In fact, if the words "so near thereto" are not read in the geographical sense, they come close, as the government admits, to being surplusage.
