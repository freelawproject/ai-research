 Appellants brought this action for declaratory and in-junctive relief, alleging that the state program violated the Federal Constitution in various respects.  A three- *593 judge federal court held that the program was constitutional.  255 F. Supp. 981 .  2 We noted probable jurisdiction of appellants’ appeal, 384 U. S. 998 .  We reverse.  I.  We considered some aspects of the constitutionality of the New York plan 15 years ago in Adler v. Board of Education, <citedDecision>342 U. S. 485</citedDecision> .  That litigation arose after New York passed the Feinberg Law which added § 3022 to the Education Law. 3 The Feinberg Law was enacted to implement and enforce two earlier statutes.  The first was a 1917 law, now § 3021 of the Education Law, under which “the utterance of any treasonable or seditious word or words or the doing of any treasonable or seditious act” is a ground for dismissal from the public school system.  The second was a 1939 law which was § 12-a of the Civil Service Law when <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> was decided and, as amended, is now § 105 of that law. This law disqualifies from the civil service and from employment in the educational system any person who advocates the overthrow of government by force, violence, or any unlawful means, or publishes material advocating such overthrow or organizes or joins any society or group of persons advocating such doctrine.  The Feinberg Law charged the State Board of Regents with the duty of promulgating rules and regulations providing procedures for the disqualification or removal of persons in the public school system who violate the 1917 law or who are ineligible for appointment to or *594 retention in the public school system under the 1939 law. The Board of Regents was further directed to make a list, after notice and hearing, of “subversive” organizations, defined as organizations which advocate the doctrine of overthrow of government by force, violence, or any unlawful means.  Finally, the Board was directed to provide in its rules and regulations that membership in any listed organization should constitute prima facie evidence of disqualification for appointment to or retention in any office or position in the public schools of the State.  The Board of Regents thereupon promulgated rules and regulations containing procedures to be followed by appointing authorities to discover persons ineligible for appointment or retention under the 1939 law, or because of violation of the 1917 law. The Board also announced its intention to list “subversive” organizations after requisite notice and hearing, and provided that membership in a listed organization after the date of its listing should be regarded as constituting prima facie evidence of disqualification, and that membership prior to listing should be presumptive evidence that membership has continued, in the absence of a showing that such membership was terminated in good faith.  Under the regulations, an appointing official is forbidden to make an appointment until after he has first inquired of an applicant’s former employers and other persons to ascertain whether the applicant is disqualified or ineligible for appointment.  In addition, an annual inquiry must be made to determine whether an appointed employee has ceased to be qualified for retention, and a report of findings must be filed.  <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> was a declaratory judgment suit in which the Court held, in effect, that there was no constitutional infirmity in former § 12~a or in the Feinberg Law on their faces and that they were capable of constitutional application.  But the contention urged in this case that *595 both § 3021 and § 105 are unconstitutionally vague was not heard or decided.  Section 3021 of the Education Law was challenged in <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> as unconstitutionally vague, but because the challenge had not been made in the pleadings or in the proceedings in the lower courts, this Court refused to consider it.  <citedDecision>342 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> .  Nor was any challenge on grounds of vagueness made in <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> as to subdivisions 1 (a) and (b) of § 105 of the Civil Service Law." 4 Subdivision 3 of § 105 was not added until 1958.  Appellants in this case timely asserted below the unconstitutionality of all these sections on grounds of vagueness and that question is now properly before us for decision.  Moreover, to the extent that <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> sustained the provision of the Feinberg Law constituting membership in an organization advocating forceful overthrow of government a ground for disqualification, pertinent constitutional doctrines have since rejected the premises upon which that conclusion rested.  <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> is therefore not dispositive of the constitutional issues we must decide in this case. II.  A 1953 amendment extended the application of the Feinberg Law to personnel of any college or other institution of higher education owned and operated by the State or its subdivisions.  In the same year, the Board of Regents, after notice and hearing, listed the Communist Party of the United States and of the State of New York as “subversive organizations.” In 1956 each applicant for an appointment or the renewal of an appointment was required to sign the so-called “Feinberg Certificate” declaring that he had read the Regents Rules and understood that the Rules and the statutes *596 constituted terms of employment, and declaring further that he was not a member of the Communist Party, and that if he had ever been a member he had communicated that fact to the President of the State University.  This was the certificate that appellants Hochfield, Maud, Keyishian, and Garver refused to sign.  In June 1965, shortly before the trial of this case, the Feinberg Certificate was rescinded and it was announced that no person then employed would be deemed ineligible for continued employment “solely” because he refused to sign the certificate.  In lieu of the certificate, it was provided that each applicant be informed before assuming his duties that the statutes, §§ 3021 and 3022 of the Education Law and § 105 of the Civil Service Law, constituted part of his contract.  He was particularly to be informed of the disqualification which flowed from membership in a listed “subversive” organization.

 .  .” Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 367 .  Vagueness of wording is aggravated by prolixity and profusion of statutes, regulations, and administrative machinery, and by manifold cross-references to interrelated enactments and rules.  We therefore hold that § 3021 of the Education Law and subdivisions 1 (a), 1 (b) and 3 of § 105 of the Civil Service Law as implemented by the machinery created pursuant to § 3022 of the Education Law are unconstitutional.  *605 IY. Appellants have also challenged the constitutionality of the discrete provisions of subdivision 1 (c) of § 105 and subdivision 2 of the Feinberg Law, which make Communist Party membership, as such, prima facie evidence of disqualification.  The provision was added to subdivision 1 (c) of § 105 in 1958 after the Board of Regents, following notice and hearing, listed the Communist Party of the United States and the Communist Party of the State of New York as “subversive” organizations.  Subdivision 2 of the Feinberg Law was, however, before the Court in <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> and its constitutionality was sustained.  But constitutional doctrine which has emerged since that- decision has rejected its major premise.  That premise was that public employment, including academic employment, may be conditioned upon the surrender of constitutional rights which could not be abridged by direct government action.  Teachers, the Court said in <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> , “may work for the school system upon the reasonable terms laid down by the proper authorities of New York. If they do not choose to work on such terms, they are at liberty to retain their beliefs and associations and go elsewhere.” <citedDecision>342 U. S., at 492</citedDecision> .  The Court also stated that a teacher denied employment because of membership in a listed organization “is not thereby denied the right of free speech and assembly.  Hir freedom of choice between membership in the organization and employment in the school system might be limited, but not his freedom of speech or assembly, except in the remote sense that limitation is inherent in every choice.” <citedDecision>Id., at 493</citedDecision> .  However, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit correctly said in an earlier stage of this case, “... the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless *606 'of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected.” Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 345 F. 2d 236, 239 .  Indeed, that theory was expressly rejected in a series of decisions following <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> .  See Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U. S. 183 ; Slochower v. Board of Education, 350 U. S. 551 ; Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction, supra; Baggett v. Bullitt, supra; Shelton v. Tucker, supra; Speiser v. Randall, supra; see also Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners, 353 U. S. 232 ; Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U. S. 488 .  In Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U. S. 398, 404 , we said: “It is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of.  or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege.” We proceed then to the question of the validity of the provisions of subdivision 1 (c) of § 105 and subdivision 2 of § 3022, barring employment to members of listed organizations.  Here again constitutional doctrine has developed since <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> .  Mere knowing membership without a specific intent to further the unlawful aims of an organization is not a constitutionally adequate basis for exclusion from such positions as those held by appellants.  In Elfbrandt v. Russell, 384 U. S. 11 , we said, “Those who join an organization but do not share its unlawful purposes and who do not participate in its unlawful activities surely pose no threat, either as citizens or as public employees.” Id., at 17 .  We there struck down a statutorily required oath binding the state employee not to become a member of the Communist Party with knowledge of its unlawful purpose, on threat of discharge and perjury prosecution if the oath were violated.  We found that “[a]ny lingering doubt that proscription of mere knowing membership, without any showing of ‘specific intent,’ would run afoul of the Constitution was set at rest by our decision in Aptheker v. Secretary of State, 378 U. S. 500 .” Elfbrandt v. Russell, supra, at 16 .  In Aptheker we held that Party membership, without knowl *607 edge of the Party’s unlawful purposes and specific intent to further its unlawful aims, could not constitutionally warrant deprivation of the right to travel abroad.  As we said in Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U. S. 118, 136 , “[U]nder our traditions beliefs are personal and not a matter of mere association, and .

 Further Resolved that this resolution shall become effective July 1, 1965, provided, however, that this resolution shall become effective immediately with respect to appointments made or recommended prior to July 1, 1965 to take effect on or after that date.  Resolved that any person presently employed or heretofore employed by the University who has failed to sign the certificate required by the Procedure on New Academic Appointments adopted on October 11, 1956, shall not be deemed disqualified or ineligible solely by reason of such failure, for appointment or reappointment in the professional service of the University in the manner provided in new Section 3 of Title B of Article XI of the Policies of the Board of Trustees as adopted by resolution this day; and Further Resolved that any person presently employed by the University shall not be deemed ineligible or disqualified for continuance in his employment during the prescribed term thereof, nor be subject to charges of misconduct, solely by reason of such failure, provided he is found qualified for such continuance by the Chief Administrative officer of the institution at which he is employed in accordance with the procedures prescribed in said new Section 3 of Title B of Article XI of the Policies of the Board of Trustees.  The text of the pertinent statutes and administrative regulations in effect at the time of trial appears in the Appendix to the opinion.  The District Court initially refused to convene a three-judge court, 233 F. Supp. 752 , and was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  345 F. 2d 236 .  For the history of New York loyalty-security legislation, including the Feinberg Law, see Chamberlain, Loyalty and Legislative Action, and that author’s article in Gellhorn, The States and Subversion 231.  The solo “vagueness” contention in <citedDecision>Adler</citedDecision> concerned the word “subversive,” appearing in the preamble to and caption of § 3022.  <citedDecision>342 U. S., at 496</citedDecision> .  There is no merit in the suggestion advanced by the Attorney General of New York for the first time in his brief in this Court that § 3021 of the Education Law and § 105, subd. 3, of- the Civil Service Law are not “pertinent to our inquiry.” Section 3022 of the Education Law incorporates by reference the provisions of both, thereby rendering them applicable to faculty members of all colleges and institutions of higher education.  One of the reasons why the Court of Appeals ordered the convening of a three-judge court was that a substantial federal question was presented by the fact that “Adler .  .  .  refused to pass upon the constitutionality of section 3021 .  .
