 No less than an individual in a business office, [10] in a friend's apartment, [11] or in a taxicab, [12] a person in a telephone booth may rely upon the protection of the Fourth Amendment.  One who occupies it, shuts the door behind him, and pays the toll that permits him to place a call is surely entitled to assume that the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world.  To read the Constitution more narrowly is to ignore the vital role that the public telephone has come to play in private communication.  The Government contends, however, that the activities of its agents in this case should not be tested by Fourth Amendment requirements, for the surveillance technique they employed involved no physical penetration of the telephone booth from which the petitioner placed his calls.  It is true that the absence of such penetration was at one time thought to foreclose further Fourth Amendment inquiry, Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 457, 464, 466 ; Goldman v. United States, 316 U. S. 129, 134-136 , for that Amendment was thought to limit only searches and seizures of tangible *353 property.  [13] But "[t]he premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited." Warden v. Hayden, <citedDecision>387 U. S. 294, 304</citedDecision> .  Thus, although a closely divided Court supposed in Olmstead that surveillance without any trespass and without the seizure of any material object fell outside the ambit of the Constitution, we have since departed from the narrow view on which that decision rested.  Indeed, we have expressly held that the Fourth Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral statements, over-heard without any "technical trespass under .  .  .  local property law." Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505, 511 .  Once this much is acknowledged, and once it is recognized that the Fourth Amendment protects people and not simply "areas"against unreasonable searches and seizures, it becomes clear that the reach of that Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure.

 .  .  eroded by our subsequent decisions .  .  .  ." But the only cases cited as accomplishing this "eroding" are Silverman v. United States, 365 U. S. 505 , and Warden v. Hayden, <citedDecision>387 U. S. 294</citedDecision> .  Neither of these cases "eroded" Olmstead or Goldman.  Silverman is an interesting choice since there the Court expressly refused to re-examine the rationale of Olmstead or Goldman although such a re-examination was strenuously urged upon the Court by the petitioners' counsel.  Also it is significant that in Silverman , as the Court described it, "the eavesdropping was accomplished by means of an unauthorized physical penetration into the premises occupied by the petitioners," 365 U. S., at 509 , thus calling into play the supervisory exclusionary rule of evidence.  As I have pointed out above, where there is an unauthorized intrusion, this Court has rejected admission of evidence obtained regardless of whether there has been an unconstitutional search and seizure.  The majority's decision here relies heavily on the statement in the opinion that the Court "need not pause to consider whether or not there was a technical trespass under the local property law relating to party walls." (At 511.)

 had I thought that the result depended on finding a violation of the Fourth Amendment .  .  .  ." 388 U. S., at 79-80 .  In light of this and the fact that the Court expressly refused to re-examine Olmstead and Goldman , I cannot read Silverman as overturning the interpretation stated very plainly in Olmstead and followed in Goldman that eavesdropping is not covered by the Fourth Amendment.  The other "eroding" case cited in the Court's opinion is Warden v. Hayden, <citedDecision>387 U. S. 294</citedDecision> .  It appears that this case is cited for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment applies to "intangibles," such as conversation, and the following ambiguous statement is quoted from the opinion: "The premise that property interests control the right of the Government to search and seize has been discredited." <citedDecision>387 U. S., at 304</citedDecision> .  But far from being concerned *372 with eavesdropping, <citedDecision>Warden</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Hayden</citedDecision> upholds the seizure of clothes, certainly tangibles by any definition.  The discussion of property interests was involved only with the common-law rule that the right to seize property depended upon proof of a superior property interest.  Thus, I think that although the Court attempts to convey the impression that for some reason today Olmstead and Goldman are no longer good law, it must face up to the fact that these cases have never been overruled or even "eroded." It is the Court's opinions in this case and Berger which for the first time since 1791, when the Fourth Amendment was adopted, have declared that eavesdropping is subject to Fourth Amendment restrictions and that conversations can be "seized." [*] I must align myself with all those judges who up to this year have never been able to impute such a meaning to the words of the Amendment.  *373 Since I see no way in which the words of the Fourth Amendment can be construed to apply to eavesdropping, that closes the matter for me. In interpreting the Bill of Rights, I willingly go as far as a liberal construction of the language takes me, but I simply cannot in good conscience give a meaning to words which they have never before been thought to have and which they certainly do not have in common ordinary usage.  I will not distort the words of the Amendment in order to "keep the Constitution up to date" or "to bring it into harmony with the times."

 Rule 41 (d) does require federal officers to serve upon the person searched a copy of the warrant and a receipt describing the material obtained, but it does not invariably require that this be done before the search takes place.  Nordelli v. United States, 24 F. 2d 665, 666-667 .  Thus the fact that the petitioner in Osborn was unaware that his words were being electronically transcribed did not prevent this Court from sustaining his conviction, and did not prevent the Court in Berger from reaching the conclusion that the use of the recording device sanctioned in Osborn was entirely lawful.  388 U. S. 41, 57 .  [17] Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 464 (dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN).  [18]  See, e. g., Jones v. United States, 357 U. S. 493, 497-499 ; Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253, 261 ; Chapman v. United States, 365 U. S. 610, 613-615 ; Stoner v. California, 376 U. S. 483, 486-487 .  [19]  See, e. g., Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 153, 156 ; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 454-456 ; Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 174-177 ; Cooper v. California, 386 U. S. 58 ; Warden v. Hayden, <citedDecision>387 U. S. 294, 298-300</citedDecision> .  [20]  In Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20, 30 , the Court stated: "The right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by which it was committed, as well as weapons and other things to effect an escape from custody, is not to be doubted." Whatever one's view of "the long-standing practice of searching for other proofs of guilt within the control of the accused found upon arrest," United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56, 61 ; cf. id., at 71-79 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter), the concept of an "incidental" search cannot readily be extended to include surreptitious surveillance of an individual either immediately before, or immediately after, his arrest.  [21]  Although "[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others," Warden v. Hayden, <citedDecision>387 U. S. 294, 298-299</citedDecision> , there seems little likelihood that electronic surveillance would be a realistic possibility in a situation so fraught with urgency.  [22]  A search to which an individual consents meets Fourth Amendment requirements, Zap v. United States, 328 U. S. 624 , but of course "the usefulness of electronic surveillance depends on lack of notice to the suspect." Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 463 (dissenting opinion of MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN).  [23]  Whether safeguards other than prior authorization by a magistrate would satisfy the Fourth Amendment in a situation involving the national security is a question not presented by this case. [24]  See Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323, 330 .  [*]  I also think that the course of development evinced by Silverman, supra, Wong Sun, supra, Berger, supra, and today's decision must be recognized as overruling Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 , which essentially rested on the ground that conversations were not subject to the protection of the Fourth Amendment.  [*]  In previous cases, which are undisturbed by today's decision, the Court has upheld, as reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, admission at trial of evidence obtained (1) by an undercover police agent to whom a defendant speaks without knowledge that he is in the employ of the police, Hoffa v. United States, 385 U. S. 293 (1966); (2) by a recording device hidden on the person of such an informant, Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427 (1963); Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323 (1966); and (3) by a policeman listening to the secret micro-wave transmissions of an agent conversing with the defendant in another location, On Lee v. United States, 343 U. S. 747 (1952).  When one man speaks to another he takes all the risks ordinarily inherent in so doing, including the risk that the man to whom he speaks will make public what he has heard.
