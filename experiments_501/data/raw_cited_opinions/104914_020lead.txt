<author id="b571-14">Mr. Chief Justice Vinson</author>
<p id="AMZ">announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion in which Mr. Justice Reed, Mr. Justice Burton and Mr. Justice Minton join.</p>
<p id="b571-15">Petitioners were indicted in July, 1948, for violation of the conspiracy provisions of the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 671, 18 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) § 11, during the period of April, 1945, to July, 1948. The pretrial motion to quash the indictment on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the statute was unconstitutional was denied, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>80 F. Supp. 479, and the case was set for trial on January 17, 1949. A verdict of guilty as to all the petitioners was returned by the jury on October 14, 1949. The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions. 183 F. 2d 201. We granted certiorari, 340 U. S. 863, limited to the following two questions: (1) Whether either § 2 or § 3 of the Smith <page-number citation-index="1" label="496">*496</page-number>Act, inherently or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First'Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights; (2) whether either § 2 or § 3 of the Act, inherently or as construed and applied in the instant case, violates the First and Fifth Amendments because of indefiniteness.</p>
<p id="b572-4">Sections 2 and 3 of the Smith Act, 54 Stat. 671, 18 U. S. C. (1946 ed.) §§ 10, 11 (see present 18 U. S. C. § 2385), provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b572-6">“Sec. 2. (a) It shall be unlawful for any person— “(1) to knowingly or willfully advocate, abet, advise, or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence, or by the assassination of-any officer of any such government;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b572-8">“(2) with intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States, to print, publish, edit, issue, circulate,.sell, distribute, or publicly display any written or printed matter advocating, advising, or teaching the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence;</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b572-9">“(3) to organize or help to .organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow or destruction of any government in the United States by force or violence; or to be or become a member of, or affiliate with, any such society, group, or assembly of persons, knowing the purposes thereof.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b572-10">“(b) For the purposes of this section, the term ‘government in the United States’ means the Government of the United States, the government of any State, Territory, or possession of the United States, the government of the District of Columbia, or the <page-number citation-index="1" label="497">*497</page-number>government of any political subdivision of any of them.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b573-5">“Sec. 3. It shall be unlawful for any person to attempt to commit, or to conspire to commit, any of the acts prohibited by the provisions of this title.”</blockquote>
<p id="b573-6">The indictment charged the petitioners with wilfully and knowingly conspiring (1) to organize as the Communist Party of the United States of America a society, group and assembly of persons who teach and advocate the overthrow and destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence, and (2) knowingly and wilfully to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing and destroying the Government of the United States by force and violence. The indictment further alleged that § 2 of the Smith Act proscribes these acts and that any conspiracy to take such action is a violation of § 3 of the Act.</p>
<p id="b573-7">The trial of the case extended over nine months, six of which were devoted to the taking of evidence, resulting in a record of 16,000 pages. Our limited grant of the writ of certiorari has removed from our consideration any question as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s determination that petitioners are guilty of the offense charged. Whether on this record petitioners did in fact advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence is not before us, and we must base any discussion of this point upon the conclusions stated in the opinion of the Court of Appeals, which treated the issue in great detail. That court held that the record in this case amply supports the necessary finding of the jury that petitioners, the leaders of the Communist Party in this country, were unwilling to work within our framework of democracy, but intended to initiate a violent revolution whenever the propitious occasion appeared. Petitioners dispute the meaning to be drawn from the evidence, contending that the Marxist-<page-number citation-index="1" label="498">*498</page-number>Leninist doctrine they advocated taught that force and violence to achieve a Communist form of government in an existing democratic state would be necessary only because the ruling classes of that state would never permit the transformation to be accomplished peacefully, but would use force and violence to defeat any peaceful political and economic gain the Communists could achieve. But the Court of Appeals held that the record supports the following broad conclusions: By virtue of their control over the political apparatus of the Communist Political Association,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> petitioners were able to transform that organization into the Communist Party; that the policies of the Association were changed from peaceful cooperation with the United States and its economic and political structure to a policy which had existed before the United States and the Soviet Union were fighting a common enemy, namely, a policy which worked for the overthrow of the Government by force and violence; that the Communist Party is a highly disciplined organization, adept at infiltration into strategic positions, use of aliases, and double-meaning language; that the Party is rigidly controlled; that Communists, unlike other political parties, tolerate no dissension from the policy laid down by the guiding forces, but that the approved program is slavishly followed by the members of the Party; that the literature of the Party and the statements and activities of its leaders, petitioners here, advocate, and the general goal of the Party was, during the period in question, to achieve a successful overthrow of the existing order by force and violence.</p>
<p id="b575-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="499">*499</page-number>I.</p>
<p id="b575-5">It will be helpful in clarifying the issues to treat next the contention that the trial judge improperly interpreted the statute by charging that the statute required an unlawful intent before the jury could convict. More specifically, he charged that the jury could not find the petitioners guilty under the indictment unless they found that petitioners had the intent to “overthrow . . . the Government of the United States by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit.”</p>
<p id="b575-6">Section 2 (a) (1) makes it unlawful “to knowingly or willfully advocate-, ... or teach the duty, necessity, desirability, or propriety of overthrowing or destroying any government in the United States by force or violence ....”; Section 2 (a) (3), “to organize or help to organize any society, group, or assembly of persons who teach, advocate, or encourage the overthrow . . . .” Because of the fact that § 2 (a) (2) expressly requires a specific intent to overthrow the Government, and because of the absence of precise language in the foregoing subsections, it is claimed that Congress deliberately omitted any such requirement. We do not agree. It would require a far greater indication of congressional desire that intent not be made an element of the crime than the use of the disjunctive “knowingly <em>or </em>willfully” in § 2 (a) (1), or the omission of exact language in § 2 (a) (3). The structure and purpose of the statute demand the inclusion of intent as an element of the crime. Congress was concerned with those who advocate and organize for the overthrow of the Government. Certainly those who recruit and combine for the purpose of advocating overthrow intend to bring about that overthrow. We hold that the statute requires as an essential element of the crime proof of the intent of those who are charged with its violation to overthrow the Government by force and violence. See <page-number citation-index="1" label="500">*500</page-number><em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U. S. 97, 101-102 (1951); <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U. S. 91, 101-105 (1945); <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U. S. 1, 31 (1945).</p>
<p id="b576-4">Nor does the fact that there must be an investigation of a state of mind under this interpretation afford any basis for rejection of that meaning. A survey of Title 18 of the U. S. Code indicates that the vast majority of the crimes designated by that Title require, by express language, proof of the existence of a certain mental state, in words such as “knowingly,” “maliciously,” “wilfully,” “with' the purpose of,” “with intent to,” or combinations or permutations of these and synonymous terms. The existence of a <em>mens rea </em>is the rule of, rather than the exception to, the principles of Anglo-American criminal jurisprudence. See <em>American Communications Assn. </em>v. <em>Douds, </em>339 U. S. 382, 411 (1950).</p>
<p id="b576-5">It has been suggested that the presence of intent makes a difference in the law when an “act otherwise excusable or carrying minor penalties” is'accompanied by such an evil intent. Yet the existence of such an intent made the killing condemned in <em>Screws, supra, </em>and the beating in <em>Williams, supra, </em>both clearly and severely punishable under state law, offenses constitutionally punishable by the Federal Government. In those cases, the Court required the Government to prove that the defendants <em>intended </em>to deprive the victim of a constitutional right. If that precise mental state may be an essential element of a crime, surely an intent to overthrow the Government of the United States, by advocacy thereof is equally susceptible of proof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b577-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="501">*501</page-number>II.</p>
<p id="b577-5">The obvious purpose of the statute is to protect existing Government, not from change by peaceable, lawful and constitutional means, but from change by violence, revolution and terrorism. That it is within the <em>power </em>of the Congress to protect the Government of the United States from armed rebellion is a proposition which requires little discussion. Whatever theoretical merit there may be to the argument that there is a “right” to rebellion against dictatorial governments is without force where the existing structure of the government provides for peaceful and orderly change. We reject any principle of governmental helplessness in the face of preparation for revolution, which principle, carried to its logical conclusion, must lead to anarchy. No one could conceive that it is not within the power of Congress to prohibit acts intended to overthrow the Government by force and violence. The question with which we are concerned here is not whether Congress has such <em>power, </em>but whether the <em>means </em>which it has employed conflict with the First and Fifth Amendments to' the Constitution.</p>
<p id="b577-6">One of the bases for the contention that the means which Congress has employed are invalid takes the form of an attack on the face of the statute on the grounds that by its terms it prohibits academic discussion of the merits of Marxism-Leninism, that it stifles ideas and is contrary to all concepts of a free speech and a free press. Although we do not agree that the language itself has that significance, we must bear in mind that it is the duty of the federal courts to interpret federal legislation in a manner not inconsistent with the demands of the Constitution. <em>American Communications </em>Assn. v. <em>Douds, </em>339 U. S. 382, 407 (1950). We are not here confronted with cases similar to <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>310 U. S. 88 (1940); <em>Herndon </em>v. <em>Lowry, </em>301 U. S. 242 (1937); and <em>De Jonge </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>299 U. S. 353 (1937), <page-number citation-index="1" label="502">*502</page-number>where a state court had given a meaning to a state statute which was inconsistent with the Federal Constitution. This is a federal statute which we must interpret as well as judge. Herein lies the fallacy of reliance upon the manner in which this Court has treated judgments of state courts. Where the statute as construed by the state court transgressed the First Amendment, we could not but invalidate the judgments of conviction.</p>
<p id="b578-4">The very language of the Smith Act negates the interpretation which petitioners would have us impose on that Act. It is directed at advocacy, not discussion. Thus, the trial judge properly charged the jury that they could not convict if they found that petitioners did “no more than pursue peaceful studies and discussions or teaching and advocacy in the realm of ideas.” He further charged that it was not unlawful “to conduct in an American college or university a course explaining the philosophical theories set forth in the books which have been placed in evidence.” Such a charge is in strict accord with the statutory language, and illustrates the meaning to be placed on those words. Congress did not intend to eradicate the free discussion of political theories, to destroy the traditional rights of Americans to discuss and evaluate ideas without fear of governmental sanction. Rather Congress was concerned with the very kind of activity in which the evidence showed .these petitioners engaged.</p>
<p id="b578-5">III.</p>
<p id="b578-6">But although the statute is not directed at the hypothetical cases which petitioners have conjured, its application in this case has resulted in convictions for the teaching and advocacy of the overthrow of the Government by force and violence, which, even though coupled with the intent to accomplish that overthrow, contains an element of speech. For this reason, we must pay special <page-number citation-index="1" label="503">*503</page-number>heed to the demands of the First Amendment marking out the boundaries of speech.</p>
<p id="b579-5">We pointed out in <em>Douds, supra, </em>that the basis of the First Amendment is the hypothesis that speech can rebut speech, propaganda will answer propaganda, free debate of ideas will result in the wisest governmental policies. It is for this reason that this Court has recognized the inherent value of free discourse. An analysis of the leading cases in this Court which have involved direct limitations on speech, however, will demonstrate that both the majority of the Court and the dissenters in particular cases have recognized that this is not an unlimited, unqualified right, but that the societal value of speech must, on occasion, be subordinated to other values and considerations.</p>
<p id="b579-6">No important case involving free speech was decided by this Court prior to <em>Schenck </em>v. <em>United States, </em>249 U. S. 47 (1919). Indeed, the summary treatment accorded an argument based upon an individual’s claim that the First Amendment protected certain utterances indicates that the Court at earlier dates placed no unique emphasis upon that right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It was not until the classic dictum of Justice Holmes in the <em>Schenck </em>case that speech <em>per se </em>received that emphasis in a majority opinion. That case involved a conviction under the Criminal Espionage Act, 40 Stat. 217. The question the Court faced was whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain the conviction. Writing for a unanimous Court, Justice Holmes stated that the “question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right <page-number citation-index="1" label="504">*504</page-number>to prevent.” 249 U. S. at 52. But the force of even this expression is considerably weakened by the reference at the end of the opinion to <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>245 U. S. 474 (1918), a prosecution under the same statute. Said Justice Holmes, “Indeed [Goldman] might be said to dispose of the present contention if the precedent covers all <em>media concludendi. </em>But as the right to free speech was not referred to specially, we have thought fit to add a few words.” 249 U. S. at 52. The fact is inescapable, too, that the phrase bore no connotation that the danger was to be any threat to the safety of the Republic. The charge was causing and attempting to cause insubordination in the military forces and obstruct recruiting. The objectionable document denounced conscription and its most inciting sentence was, “You must do your share to maintain, support and uphold the rights of the people of this country.” 249 U. S. at 51. Fifteen thousand copies were printed and some circulated. This insubstantial gesture toward insubordination in 1917 during war was held to be a clear and present danger of bringing about the evil of military insubordination.</p>
<p id="b580-4">In several later cases involving convictions under the Criminal Espionage Act; the nub of the evidence the Court held sufficient to meet the “clear and present danger” test enunciated in <em>Schenck </em>was as follows: <em>Frohwerk </em>v. <em>United States, </em>249 U. S. 204 (1919) — publication of twelve newspaper articles attacking the war; <em>Debs </em>v. <em>United States, </em>249 U. S. 211 (1919) — one speech attacking United States’ participation in the war; <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>250 U. S. 616 (1919) — circulation of copies of two different socialist circulars attacking the war; <em>Schaefer </em>v. <em>United States, </em>251 U. S. 466 (1920) — publication of a German-language newspaper with allegedly false articles, critical of capitalism and the war; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>United States, </em>252 U. S. 239 (1920) — circulation of copies of a four-page pamphlet written by a clergyman, attack<page-number citation-index="1" label="505">*505</page-number>ing the purposes of the war and United States’ participation therein. Justice Holmes wrote the opinions for a unanimous Court in <em>Schenck, Frohwerk </em>and <em>Debs. </em>He and Justice Brandéis dissented in <em>Abrams, Schaefer </em>and <em>Pierce. </em>The basis of these dissents was that, because of the protection which the First Amendment gives to speech, the evidence in each case was insufficient to show that the defendants had created the requisite danger under <em>Schenck. </em>But these dissents did not mark a change of principle. The dissenters doubted only the probable effectiveness of the puny efforts toward subversion. In <em>Abrams, </em>they wrote, “I do not doubt for a moment that by the same reasoning that would justify punishing persuasion to murder, the United States constitutionally may punish speech that produces or is intended to produce a clear and imminent danger that it will bring about forthwith certain substantive evils that the United States constitutionally may seek to prevent.” 250 U. S. at 627. And in <em>Schaefer </em>the test was said to be one of “degree,” 251 U. S. at 482, although it is not clear whether “degree” refers to clear and present danger or evil. Perhaps both were meant.</p>
<p id="b581-5">The rule we deduce from these cases is that where an offense is specified by a statute in nonspeech or nonpress terms, a conviction relying upon speech or press as evidence of violation may be sustained only when the speech or publication created a “clear and present danger” of attempting or accomplishing the prohibited crime, <em>e. g., </em>interference with enlistment. The dissents, we repeat, in emphasizing the value of speech, were addressed to the argument of the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>
<p id="b581-6">The next important case<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> before the Court in which free speech was the crux of the conflict was <em>Gitlow </em>v. <em>New York, </em>268 U. S. 652 (1925). There New York had <page-number citation-index="1" label="506">*506</page-number>made it a crime to advocate “the necessity or propriety of overthrowing . . . organized government by force . . . .” The evidence of violation of the statute was that the defendant had published a Manifesto attacking the Government and capitalism. The convictions were sustained, Justices Holmes and Brandéis dissenting. The majority refused to apply the “clear and present danger” test to the specific utterance. Its reasoning was as follows: The “clear and present danger” test was applied to the utterance itself in <em>Schenck </em>because the question was merely one of sufficiency of evidence under an admittedly constitutional statute. <em>Gitlow, </em>however, presented a different question. There a legislature had found that a certain kind of speech was, itself, harmful and unlawful. The constitutionality of such a state statute had to be adjudged by this Court just as it determined the constitutionality of any state statute, namely, whether the statute was “reasonable.” Since it was entirely reasonable for a state to attempt to protect itself from violent overthrow, the statute was perforce reasonable. The only question remaining in .the case became whether there was evidence to support the conviction, a question which gave the majority no difficulty. Justices Holmes and Brandéis refused to accept this approach, but insisted that wherever speech was the evidence of the violation, it was necessary to show that the speech created the “clear and present danger” of the substantive evil which the legislature had the right to prevent. Justices Holmes and Brandéis, then, made no distinction between a federal statute which made certain acts unlawful, the evidence to support the conviction being speech, and a statute which made speech itself the crime. This approach was emphasized in <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>California, </em>274 U. S. 357 (1927), where the Court was confronted with a conviction under the California Criminal Syndicalist statute. The Court sustained the conviction, Justices Brandéis and Holmes <page-number citation-index="1" label="507">*507</page-number>concurring in the result. In their concurrence they repeated that even though the legislature had designated certain speech as criminal, this could not prevent the defendant from showing that there was no danger that the substantive evil would be brought about.</p>
<p id="b583-5">Although no case subsequent to <em>Whitney </em>and <em>Gitlow </em>has expressly overruled the majority opinions in those cases, there is little doubt that subsequent opinions have inclined toward the Holmes-Brandeis rationale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And in <em>American Communications Assn. </em>v. <em>Douds, supra, </em>we were called upon to decide the validity of § 9 (h) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947. That section required officials of unions which desired to avail themselves of the facilities of the National Labor Relations Board to take oaths that they did not belong to the Communist Party and that they did not believe in the overthrow of the Government by force and violence. We pointed out that Congress did not intend to punish belief, but rather intended to regulate the conduct of union affairs. We therefore held that any indirect sanction on speech which might arise from the oath requirement did not present a proper case for the “clear and present danger” test, for the regulation was aimed at conduct rather than speech. In discussing the proper measure of evaluation of this kind of legislation, we suggested that the Holmes-Brandeis philosophy insisted that where <page-number citation-index="1" label="508">*508</page-number>there was a direct restriction upon speech, a “clear and present danger” that the substantive evil would be caused was necessary before the statute in question could be constitutionally applied. And we stated, “[The First] Amendment requires that one be permitted to believe what he will. It requires that one be permitted to advocate what he will unless there is a clear and present danger that a substantial public evil will result therefrom.” 339 U. S. at 412. But we further suggested that neither Justice Holmes nor Justice Brandéis ever envisioned that a shorthand phrase should be crystallized into a rigid rule to be applied inflexibly without regard to the circumstances of each case. Speech is not an absolute, above and beyond control by the legislature when its judgment, subject to review here, is that certain kinds of speech are so undesirable as to warrant criminal sanction. Nothing is more certain in modern society than the principle that there are no absolutes, that a name, a phrase, a standard has meaning only when associated with the considerations which gave birth to the nomenclature. See <em>American Communications Assn. </em>v. <em>Douds, </em>339 U. S. at 397. To those who would paralyze our Government in the face of impending threat by encasing it in a semantic straitjacket we must reply that all concepts are relative.</p>
<p id="b584-5">In this case we are squarely presented with the application of the “clear and present danger” test, and must decide what that phrase imports. We first note that many of the cases in which this Court has reversed convictions by use of this or similar tests have been based on the fact that the interest which the State was attempting to protect was itself too insubstantial to warrant restriction of speech. In this category we may put such cases as <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>State, </em>308 U. S. 147 (1939); <em>Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>310 U. S. 296 (1940); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Struthers, </em>319 U. S. 141 (1943); <em>West Virginia Board of Educa</em><page-number citation-index="1" label="509">*509</page-number><em>tion </em>v. <em>Barnette, </em>319 U. S. 624 (1943); <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>323 U. S. 516 (1945); <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>326 U. S. 501 (1946); but cf. <em>Prince </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>321 U. S. 158 (1944); <em>Cox </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>312 U. S. 569 (1941). Overthrow of the Government by force and violence is certainly a substantial enough interest for the Government to limit speech. Indeed, this is the ultimate value of any society, for if a society cannot protect its very structure from armed internal attack, it must follow that no subordinate value can be protected. If, then, this interest may be protected, the literal problem which is presented is what has been meant by the use of the phrase “clear and present danger” of the utterances bringing about the evil within the power of Congress to punish.</p>
<p id="b585-5">Obviously, the words .cannot mean that before the Government may act, ii5 must wait until the <em>putsch </em>is about to be executed, the plans have been laid and the signal is awaited. If Government is aware that a group aiming at its overthrow is attempting to indoctrinate its members and to commit them to a course whereby they will strike when the leaders feel the circumstances permit, action by the Government is required.. The argument that there is no need for Government to concern itself, for Government is strong, it possesses ample powers to put down a rebellion, it may defeat the revolution with ease needs no answer. For that is not the question. Certainly an attempt to overthrow the Government by force, even though doomed from the outset because of inadequate numbers or power of the revolutionists, is a sufficient evil for Congress to prevent. The damage which such attempts create both physically and politically to a nation makes it impossible to measure the validity in terms of the probability of success, or the immediacy of a successful attempt. In the instant case the trial judge charged the jury that they could not convict unless they found that petitioners intended to overthrow the Gov<page-number citation-index="1" label="510">*510</page-number>ernment “as speedily as circumstances would permit.” This does not mean, and could not properly mean, that they would not strike until there was certainty of success. What was meant was that the revolutionists would strike when they thought the time was ripe. We must therefore reject the contention that success or probability of success is the criterion.</p>
<p id="APt">The situation with which Justices Holmes and Brandéis were concerned in <em>Gitlow </em>was a comparatively isolated event, bearing little relation in their minds to any substantial threat to the safety of the community. Such also is true of cases like <em>Fiske </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>274 U. S. 380 (1927), and <em>De Jonge </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>299 U. S. 353 (1937); but cf. <em>Lazar </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania, </em>286 U. S. 532 (1932).( They. were not confronted with any situation comparable to the instant one — the development of an apparatus designed and dedicated to the overthrow of the Government, in the context of world crisis after crisis.</p>
<p id="b586-6">Chief Judge Learned Hand, writing for the majority below, interpreted the phrase as follows: “In each case [courts] must ask whether the gravity of the ‘evil,’ discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.” 183 F. 2d at 212. We adopt this statement of the rule. As articulated by Chief Judge Hand, it is as succinct and inclusive as any other we might devise at this time. It takes into consideration those factors which we deem relevant, and relates their significances. More we cannot expect from words.</p>
<p id="b586-7">Likewise, we are in accord with the court below, which affirmed the trial court’s finding that the requisite danger existed. The mere fact that from the period 1945 to 1948 petitioners’ activities did not result in an attempt to overthrow the Government by force and violence is of course no answer to the fact that there was a group that was ready to make the attempt. The formation <page-number citation-index="1" label="511">*511</page-number>by petitioners of such a highly organized conspiracy, with rigidly disciplined members subject to call when the leaders, these petitioners, felt that the time had come for action, coupled with the inflammable nature of world conditions, similar uprisings in other countries, and the touch-and-go nature of our relations with countries with whom petitioners were in the very least ideologically attuned, convince us that their convictions were justified on this score. And this analysis disposes of the contention that a conspiracy to advocate, as distinguished from the advocacy itself, cannot be constitutionally restrained, because it comprises only the preparation. It is the existence of the conspiracy which creates the danger. Cf. <em>Pinkerton </em>v. <em>United States, </em>328 U. S. 640 (1946); <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>245 U. S. 474 (1918); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rabinowich, </em>238 U. S. 78 (1915). If the ingredients of the reaction are present, we cannot bind the Government to wait until the catalyst is added.</p>
<p id="b587-5">IV.</p>
<p id="b587-6">Although we have concluded that the finding that there was a sufficient danger to warrant the application of the statute was justified on the merits, there remains the problem of whether the trial judge’s treatment of the issue was correct. He charged the jury, in relevant part, as follows:</p>
<blockquote id="b587-7">“In further construction and interpretation of the statute I charge you that it is not the abstract doctrine of overthrowing or destroying organized government by unlawful means which is denounced by this law, but the teaching and advocacy of action for the accomplishment of that purpose, by language reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to such action. Accordingly, you cannot find the defendants or any of them guilty of the crime charged <page-number citation-index="1" label="512">*512</page-number>unless you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that they conspired to organize a society, group and assembly of persons who teach and advocate the overthrow or destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence and to advocate and teach the duty and necessity of overthrowing or destroying the Government of the United States by force and violence, with the intent that such teaching and advocacy be of a rule or principle of action and by language reasonably and ordinarily calculated to incite persons to such action, all with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction of the Government of the United States by force and violence as speedily as circumstances would permit.</blockquote>
<blockquote id="b588-5">“If you are satisfied that the evidence establishes beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants, or any of them, are guilty of a violation of the statute, as I have interpreted it to you, I find as matter of law that there is sufficient danger of a substantive evil that the Congress has a right to prevent to justify the application of the statute under the First Amendment of the Constitution.</blockquote>

<p id="b588-7">It is thus clear that he reserved the question of the existence of the danger for his own determination, and the question becomes whether the issue is of such a nature that it should have been submitted to the jury.</p>
<p id="b588-8">The first paragraph of the quoted instructions calls for the jury to find the facts essential to establish the substantive crime, violation of §§ 2 (a) (1) and 2 (a) (3) of <page-number citation-index="1" label="513">*513</page-number>the Smith Act, involved in the conspiracy charge. There can be no doubt that if the jury found those facts against the petitioners violation of the Act would be established. The argument that the action of the trial court is erroneous, in declaring as a matter of law that such violation shows sufficient danger to justify the punishment despite the First Amendment, rests on the theory that a jury must decide a question of the application of the First Amendment. We do not agree.</p>
<p id="b589-5">When facts are found that establish the violation of a statute, the protection against conviction afforded by the First Amendment is a matter of law. The doctrine that there must be a clear and present danger of a substantive evil that Congress has a right to prevent is a judicial rule to be applied as a matter of law by the courts. The guilt is established by proof of facts. Whether the First Amendment protects the activity which constitutes the violation of the statute must depend upon a judicial determination of the scope of the First Amendment applied to the circumstances of the case.</p>
<p id="b589-6">Petitioners’ reliance upon Justice Brandéis’ language in his concurrence in <em>Whitney, supra, </em>is misplaced. In that case Justice Brandéis pointed out that the defendant could have made the existence of the requisite danger the important issue at her trial, but that she had not done so. In discussing this failure, he stated that the defendant could have had the issue determined by the court <em>or </em>the jury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> No realistic construction of this disjunctive lan<page-number citation-index="1" label="514">*514</page-number>guage could arrive at the conclusion that he intended to state that the question was <em>only </em>determinable by a jury. Nor is the incidental statement of the majority in <em>Pierce, supra, </em>of any more persuasive effect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There the issue of the probable effect of the publication had been submitted to the jury, and the majority was apparently addressing its remarks to the contention of the dissenters that the jury could not reasonably have returned a verdict of guilty on the evidence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Indeed, in the very case in which the phrase was born, <em>Schenck, </em>this Court itself examined the record to find whether the requisite danger appeared, and the issue was not submitted to a jury. And in every later case in which the Court has measured the validity of a statute by the “clear and present danger” test, that determination has been by the court, the question of the danger not being submitted to the jury.</p>
<p id="b590-4">The question in this case is whether the statute which the legislature has enacted may be constitutionally applied. In other words, the Court must examine judicially <page-number citation-index="1" label="515">*515</page-number>the application of the statute to the particular situation, to ascertain if the Constitution prohibits the conviction. We hold that the statute may be applied where there is a “clear and present danger” of the substantive evil which the legislature had the right to prevent. Bearing, as it does, the marks of a “question of law,” the issue is properly one for the judge to decide.</p>
<p id="b591-5">V.</p>
<p id="b591-6">There remains to be discussed the question of vagueness — whether the statute as we have interpreted it is too vague, not sufficiently advising those who would speak of the limitations upon their activity. It is urged that such vagueness contravenes the First and Fifth Amendments. This argument is particularly nonpersuasive when presented by petitioners, who, the jury found, intended to overthrow the Government as speedily as circumstances would permit. See <em>Abrams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>250 U. S. 616, 627-629 (1919) (dissenting opinion); <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>California, </em>274 U. S. 357, 373 (1927) (concurring opinion); <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Mississippi, </em>319 U. S. 583, 589 (1943). A claim of guilelessness ill becomes those with evil intent. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U. S. 97, 101-102 (1951); <em>Jordan </em>v. <em>De George, </em>341 U. S. 223, 230-232 (1951); <em>American Communications Assn. </em>v. <em>Douds, </em>339 U. S. at 413; <em>Screws </em>v. <em>United States, </em>325 U. S. 91, 101 (1945).</p>
<p id="b591-7">We agree that the standard as defined is not a neat, mathematical formulary. Like all verbalizations it is subject to criticism on the score of indefiniteness. But petitioners themselves contend that the verbalization “clear and present danger” is the proper standard. We see no difference, from the standpoint of vagueness, whether the standard of “clear and present danger” is one contained <em>in haec verba </em>within the statute, or whether it is the judicial measure of constitutional applicability. We <page-number citation-index="1" label="516">*516</page-number>have shown the indeterminate standard the phrase necessarily connotes. We do not think we have rendered that standard any more indefinite by our attempt to sum up the factors which are included within its scope. We think it well serves to indicate to those who would advocate constitutionally prohibited conduct that there is a line beyond which they may not go — a line which they, in full knowledge of what they intend and the circumstances in which their activity takes place, will well appreciate and understand. <em>Williams, supra, </em>at 101-102; <em>Jordan, supra, </em>at 230-232; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Petrillo, </em>332 U. S. 1, 7 (1948); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wurzbach, </em>280 U. S. 396, 399 (1930); <em>Nash </em>v. <em>United States, </em>229 U. S. 373, 376-377 (1913). Where there is doubt as to the intent of the defendants, the nature of their activities, or their power to bring about the evil, this Court will review the convictions with the scrupulous care demanded by our Constitution. But we are not convinced that because there may be borderline cases at some time in the future, these convictions should be reversed because of the argument that these petitioners could not know that their activities were constitutionally proscribed by the statute.</p>
<p id="b592-4">We have not discussed many of the questions which could be extracted from the record, although they were treated in detail by the court below. Our limited grant of the writ of certiorari has withdrawn from our consideration at this date those questions, which include, <em>inter alia, </em>sufficiency of the evidence, composition of jury, and conduct of the trial.</p>
<p id="b592-5">We hold that §§ 2 (a) (1), 2 (a) (3) and 3 of the Smith Act do not inherently, or as construed or applied in the instant case, violate the First Amendment and other provisions of the Bill of Rights, or the First and Fifth Amendments because of indefiniteness. Petitioners intended to overthrow the Government of the United States as speedily as the circumstances would permit. Their conspiracy <page-number citation-index="1" label="517">*517</page-number>to organize the Communist Party and to teach and advocate the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force and violence created a “clear and present danger” of an attempt to overthrow the Government by force and violence. They were properly and constitutionally convicted for violation of the Smith Act. The judgments of conviction are</p>
