And, while a State may require payment of an occupation tax by one engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce, the exaction in order to be valid must be imposed solely on account of the intrastate business without enhancement because of the interstate business done, and it must appear that one engaged exclusively in interstate business would not be subject to the imposition and that the taxpayer could discontinue the intrastate business without withdrawing also from the interstate business. Sprout v. South Bend, 277 U.S. 163 , 170-171, and cases cited. The transportation of gas from wells outside Ohio by the lines of the producing companies to the state line and thence by means of appellant's high pressure transmission lines to their connection with its local systems is essentially national  not local  in character and is interstate commerce within as well as without that State. The mere fact that the title or the custody of the gas passes while it is en route from State to State is not determinative of the question where interstate commerce ends. Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, 249 U.S. 239 , 245. Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., 265 U.S. 298 , 307-309. Peoples Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 270 U.S. 550 , 554. Public Util. Comm. v. Attleboro Co., 273 U.S. 83 , 89.

It follows that the furnishing of gas to consumers in Ohio municipalities by means of distribution plants to supply the gas suitably for the service for which it is intended is not interstate commerce but a business of purely local concern exclusively within the jurisdiction of the State. Appellant relies on Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., 252 U.S. 23 . There the question was whether the New York commission had jurisdiction to prescribe the rates to be charged local consumers of gas transported to that State from Pennsylvania. This court, following the findings of the highest court of New York ( 225 N.Y. 397 , 403-404; 122 N.E. 260 ), held that the entire movement of the gas was interstate commerce and that, in the absence of contrary regulation by the Congress, the state commission had jurisdiction to prescribe such rates. The theory on which that conclusion was reached is not wholly consistent with the views expressed in Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, supra , and in Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., supra . In the former the court *472 said (p. 245): "Interstate movement [of natural gas being transported from State to State] ended when the gas passed into local mains." In the latter, it was said (p. 308): "With the delivery of the gas [transported from one State to another] to the distributing companies . . . the interstate movement ends. Its subsequent sale and delivery by these companies to their customers at retail is intrastate business and subject to state regulation.
