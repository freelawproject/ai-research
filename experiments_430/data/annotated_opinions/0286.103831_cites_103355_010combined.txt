 Thus, it may not exact a license tax for the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce ( McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co., 309 U.S. 33 , 56-58), although it may tax the property used in, or the income derived from, that commerce, so long as those taxes are not discriminatory.  Id., p. 47 and cases cited.  A license tax applied to activities guaranteed by the First Amendment would have the same destructive effect.  It is true that the First Amendment, like the commerce clause, draws no distinction between license taxes, fixed sum taxes, and other kinds of taxes.  But that is no reason why we should shut our eyes to the nature of the tax and its destructive influence.  The power to impose a license tax on the exercise of these freedoms is indeed as potent as the power of censorship which this Court has repeatedly struck down.  Lovell v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 444 ; Schneider v. State, supra ; Cantwell v. Connecticut, <citedDecision>310 U.S. 296, 306</citedDecision> ; Largent v. Texas, 318 U.S. 418 ; Jamison v. Texas, supra .  It was for that reason that the dissenting opinions in Jones v. Opelika, supra , stressed the nature of this type of tax. 316 U.S. pp. 607-609, 620, 623.  In that case, as in the present ones, we have something very different from a registration system under which those going from house to house are required to give their names, addresses and other marks of identification to the authorities.  In all of these cases the issuance of the permit or license is dependent on the payment of a license tax. And the license tax is fixed in amount and unrelated to the scope of the activities of petitioners or to their realized revenues.  It is not a nominal fee *114 imposed as a regulatory measure to defray the expenses of policing the activities in question.  [8] It is in no way apportioned.  It is a flat license tax levied and collected as a condition to the pursuit of activities whose enjoyment is guaranteed by the First Amendment.

 It does not cover, and petitioners are not charged with, breaches of the peace.  They are pursuing their solicitations peacefully and quietly.  Petitioners, moreover, are not charged with or prosecuted for the use of language which is obscene, abusive, or which incites retaliation.  Cf. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra .  Nor do we have here, as we did in Cox v. New Hampshire, supra , and Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra , state regulation of the streets to protect and insure the safety, comfort, or convenience of the public.  Furthermore, the present ordinance is not narrowly drawn to safeguard the people of the community in their homes against the evils of solicitations.  See <citedDecision>Cantwell</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Connecticut, supra, 306</citedDecision> .  As we have said, it is not merely a registration ordinance calling for an identification of the solicitors so as to give the authorities some basis for investigating strangers coming into the community.  And the fee is not a nominal one, imposed as a regulatory measure and calculated to defray the expense of protecting those on the streets and at home against the abuses of solicitors.  See Cox v. New Hampshire, *117 supra, pp. 576-577.  Nor can the present ordinance survive if we assume that it has been construed to apply only to solicitation from house to house.  [10] The ordinance is not narrowly drawn to prevent or control abuses or evils arising from that activity.  Rather, it sets aside the residential areas as a prohibited zone, entry of which is denied petitioners unless the tax is paid.

 The Witness sells books to raise money for propagandizing his faith, just as other religious groups might sponsor bazaars, or peddle tickets to church suppers, or sell Bibles or prayer books for the same object.  However high the purpose or noble the aims of the Witness, the transaction has been found by the state courts to be a sale under their ordinances and, though our doubt was greater than it is, the state's conclusion would influence us to follow its determination.  [1] *120 In the opinion in Jones v. Opelika, 316 U.S. 584 , on the former hearing, attention was called to the differentiation between these cases of taxation and those of forbidden censorship, prohibition or discrimination.  There is no occasion to repeat what has been written so recently as to the constitutional right to tax the money-raising activities of religious or didactic groups.  There are, however, other reasons, not fully developed in that opinion, that add to our conviction that the Constitution does not prohibit these general occupational taxes.  The real contention of the Witnesses is that there can be no taxation of the occupation of selling books and pamphlets because to do so would be contrary to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, which now is held to have drawn the contents of the First Amendment into the category of individual rights protected *121 from state deprivation.  Gitlow v. New York, 268 U.S. 652, 666 ; Near v. Minnesota, 283 U.S. 697, 707 ; Cantwell v. Connecticut, <citedDecision>310 U.S. 296, 303</citedDecision> .  Since the publications teach a religion which conforms to our standards of legality, it is urged that these ordinances prohibit the free exercise of religion and abridge the freedom of speech and of the press.  The First Amendment reads as follows: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." It was one of twelve proposed on September 25, 1789, to the States by the First Congress after the adoption of the Constitution.  Ten were ratified.  They were intended to be and have become our Bill of Rights.  By their terms, our people have a guarantee that so long as law as we know it shall prevail, they shall live protected from the tyranny of the despot or the mob.

 .  .  we do not accede to his contention on the oral argument that the federal decisions relied upon by him go so far as to rule that the constitutional guaranty of a free press forbids dealers in books and printed matter being subjected to our State mercantile license tax or the federal income tax as to such sales, along with dealers in other merchandise." Pittsburgh v. Ruffner, 134 Pa. Super. Ct. 192, 199, 202 , 4 A.2d 224 .  And after further discussion of selling, the conviction of the Witnesses was affirmed.  It can hardly be said, we think, that the state court did not treat the Jeannette canvassers as engaged in a commercial activity or occupation at the time of their arrests.  [2] Whitney v.
