 See, e.g., Woods v. Nierstheimer, 328 U.S. 211 .  Had that been the case, a suit for the same cause of action could have been initiated in a North Carolina federal district court, just as another suit could have been brought in the proper North Carolina State court. But that is not the present situation.  A quite different situation is before us.  Being somewhat unusual, it calls for a critical consideration of the scope and purpose of the doctrine of res judicata.  2.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina would clearly bar this suit had it been brought anew *187 in a state court. For purposes of diversity jurisdiction a federal court is, "in effect, only another court of the State." Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, <citedDecision>326 U.S. 99, 108</citedDecision> ; see Traction Company v. Mining Company, 196 U.S. 239 , 253; Ex parte Schollenberger, 96 U.S. 369, 377 .  Of course, Bullington could not have succeeded in the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina after an adverse judgment in the State courts, had the decision in this case involved no federal ground.  That is equally true where a federal question was decided in the State courts.  That the adjudication of federal questions by the North Carolina Supreme Court may have been erroneous is immaterial for purposes of res judicata.  Baltimore S.S. Co. v. Phillips, 274 U.S. 316, 325 .  A higher court was available for an authoritative adjudication of the federal questions involved.  And so the question is whether federal rights were necessarily involved and adjudicated in the litigation in the State courts.

 The withdrawal of jurisdiction surely does not make a judgment one upon the merits.  The state court cited Ex parte McCardle, 7 Wall. 506 , to emphasize what it meant.  If there was a suit on this note in a federal court on an allegation of diversity of citizenship and the federal court dismissed the suit with an opinion saying that the case was dismissed because of lack of jurisdiction, e.g. proof of non-diversity of citizenship, no state court would hold that there had been a decision upon the merits.  Where there is no jurisdiction of the subject of the action the judgment is not upon the merits.  Stoll v. Gottlieb, 305 U.S. 165, 171-172 .  Of course, if there is a judgment upon the merits that judgment would be binding on both federal and state courts.  Even if the North Carolina decision is not upon the merits it is conclusive on North Carolina courts and upon federal courts in North Carolina, *197 if those federal courts are courts of the State of North Carolina in the sense that they must follow state decisions upon the power of state courts, under the rule of Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, <citedDecision>326 U.S. 99</citedDecision> .  I do not think that the Guaranty rule applies.  See subdivision IV. III. If the two preceding numbered divisions of this opinion are sound, there was no occasion for Bullington to seek a review of the first judgment in this Court. He was in the position of the owner of a cause of action, dismissed because prematurely brought or brought in the wrong county.  The judgment that the Supreme Court of North Carolina ordered was "dismissed," not on the merits, not with prejudice, and not judgment for the defendant, but a simple dismissal.  North Carolina might have declared, by statute, that no cause of action would be recognized in North Carolina for the recovery of a deficiency on a mortgage indebtedness.  Instead of this, we are told, authoritatively, by the Supreme Court of North Carolina that North Carolina has withdrawn the jurisdiction of its courts from such a cause of action.  This produces quite a different situation.  IV. The pith of the problem, as I see it, is laid bare by the foregoing differentiations.  It consists of the question whether the North Carolina decision establishes a controlling rule of law upon the constitutionality of the state statute as tested by the federal Constitution or adjudicates that the statute merely withdraws jurisdiction from state courts over a type of action.  This Court concludes that the state decision determined the constitutionality of the statute and that its holding was binding on all federal courts in North Carolina, as well as state courts.  This idea is comprehended in the Court's opinion by the statements that the federal courts are courts of the state in diversity cases and that a litigant cannot stop with an intermediate court decision against him and begin a new litigation on the same cause of action.  *198 The Court reaches the conclusion that res judicata should apply by an application of Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 , and Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, <citedDecision>326 U.S. 99</citedDecision> .  The teaching of those cases is accepted by me. They lead to the conclusion that in diversity cases, legal or equitable, and this proceeding is a diversity case, the federal courts in a state apply the law of that state in matters of substantive law. In matters of procedure and jurisdiction, I take it, no one would contend that the doctrine of Erie Railroad is applicable.  One may regret that the line of the Great Divide between substance and procedure cannot be clearly marked so that all may agree as to its location in any one case. But that line exists.  We have said that federal courts must follow the law of the state as to burden of proof.  Cities Service Co. v. Dunlap, 308 U.S. 208 ; Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 117 ; as to conflict of laws, Griffin v. McCoach, 313 U.S. 498 ; Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Co., 313 U.S. 487 , and as to state statutes of limitation in equity cases, Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, supra .  The reason for these conclusions is to gain the desirable end of a symmetry of law within each state.  The momentum of the opinions, just cited, and of the desire for uniformity should not cause us to disregard the rule that state law, statutory or judicial, directed at remedies or powers of courts, cannot affect the federal system.

 But the very multiplicity of the constitutional questions enumerated in the Court's opinion which were or might have been pertinent made that chance slim indeed.  What is more important is that if the judgment had been thus reversed and remanded, it would have been *208 wiped out and he then would have been free to dismiss the suit and start over again in the federal courts sitting in the state or in the state courts.  Bucher v. Cheshire R.R. Co., 125 U.S. 555, 578-579 .  [15] On the other hand, if the case had gone against him here, then his right to start over in the federal court in North Carolina would depend upon whether one of two grounds were accepted for this Court's decision, namely, on the one hand, that North Carolina had power to bar his substantive claim and had done so in effect though not in words, thus closing the doors of the federal court to it under the Erie rule; on the other, that the state had power to close its courts against his claim without adjudicating its substantive validity, thus leaving him free to go to the federal court under the Erie rule.  Either result was a conceivable one, depending on whether the Court should conclude that a "right without a remedy" remains a right, for this purpose, or becomes none at all. But the only chance for Bullington's ultimate success in the event of adverse decision *209 here, would have been for the decision to have turned out on the latter ground.  That chance was hardly worth the gamble.  For this Court has declared in Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, <citedDecision>326 U.S. 99, 108-109</citedDecision> , that a right without a remedy is no right at all for purposes of enforcement by a diversity suit in a federal court sitting in the state.  [16] And the nature of the North Carolina statute as construed by the state court reaches exactly the result which the <citedDecision>York</citedDecision> case says precludes resort to the federal court on the same cause in a diversity suit.  [17] Indeed this seems to be an alternative basis for the present decision.  [18] Bullington's chance to get to the federal court on such a basis was therefore practically nil.  Should he now be barred because he did not take the extremely remote chance of securing a favorable decision, reversing the state court's judgment and forcing the state to hear his case on the merits?  Not, I think, unless we continue say he then would have been forced, if successful, to continue the litigation in the state courts and could not withdraw to start over in the North Carolina federal court. This we could not say unless we were to overrule the Bucher case, which Bullington had a right to assume we would not do.  Why he should be barred from doing now, because he did not take his almost hopeless appeal, what he would have been at liberty to do if he had taken it successfully, I am not able to understand.  No sound policy of ending litigation, conserving judicial time or litigants' rights or in any other respect can possibly be served by *210 such a ruling.  [19] Moreover, the very difficulties in his way for securing a successful determination here, which would give him some certain remedy either in the state or in the federal courts, were sufficient reason, in my opinion, to justify his foregoing that dubious procedure and starting over again in the federal court. The real trouble here is not with the law of res judicata, for that law has no valid application to these facts.  It is that the doctrine is used as an escape from facing squarely the real question presented.  This is whether North Carolina's decision made the Erie doctrine applicable.  The Court's opinion does state expressly that the effect of the North Carolina decision was to create a policy of the state against the validity of all claims for deficiency judgments, and comes almost but not quite to saying this requires the case to go off on application of the <citedDecision>York</citedDecision> rule.  That issue is inescapable here.  The Erie rule did not purport to change the law of federal jurisdiction in diversity cases, taking it out of the hands of Congress and the federal courts and putting it within the states' power to determine.  It purported only to prescribe the rule federal courts should follow in applying the substantive law. If the North Carolina decision was exclusively a jurisdictional *211 one, it had no effect on the power of the federal courts in that state to hear controversies excluded by it from the state courts, and the decision neither reached the merits of the controversy "in the sense of the ultimate substantive issues of a litigation" nor barred Bullington from going to the federal court. See Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club, 225 U.S. 489 .  If on the other hand the decision was in effect, although not in words, a determination of the merits in that sense, it both adjudicated Bullington's substantive rights and barred him from maintaining the later suit successfully in the federal court. That question is here and until it is resolved he is deprived of any day in court except to go from one to another without securing decision either on the merits substantially or "on the merits" jurisdictionally.  From the Court's opinion I cannot say whether the question has been resolved.  Its discussion of North Carolina's "policy" and its overruling of the Lupton's Sons case, supra, would seem to indicate that it is applying <citedDecision>York</citedDecision> , though without saying so frankly.  But, if so, why speak also of res judicata?  The law should not be made into such a merry-go-round.  Bullington is entitled to one full day in court on the substance of his claim.  This he has not had.  I hardly need add that I agree with the views expressed by MR. JUSTICE REED.  MR. JUSTICE JACKSON joins in this opinion.

Shell Petroleum Corp. v. Shore, 80 F.2d 785, 786 .  This is the general rule.  89 A.L.R. 109 ; 126 A.L.R. 305 .  It would seem to apply in North Carolina.  North Carolina follows both the doctrine that the trial court, upon remand by an appellate court, is to proceed as if there had been no previous trial and the doctrine that Judgments not on the merits do not constitute an estoppel to subsequent actions.  Hickory v. Railroad, 138 N.C. 311, 318 ; Grimes v. Andrews, 170 N.C. 515 ; cf. Gen. Stat. N.C. (1943) § 1-25, as interpreted in Grimes v. Andrews, 170 N.C. at 522 .  [16]  The <citedDecision>York</citedDecision> case however did not support to apply or extend the rule to a cause of action arising under and governed by the laws of another state than that in which the federal court was sitting.  But cf. Klaxon Co. v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., 313 U.S. 487 .  [17]  Except for the factor noted in note 16.  [18]  See text infra.  [19]  "The application of the principle of res judicata has not in any way been made to depend upon whether the judgment in question is subject to review in another tribunal.  Except in so far as it may affect the question of its finality, as in the case of orders on motions, the fact that a judgment may or may not be appealable should have no bearing upon its effect as res judicata." 2 Freeman, Judgments (5th ed.) 1339.
