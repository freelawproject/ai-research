In Passage 3, the Court states 'We therefore hold that the requirements of the Constitution are not violated where, as here, a court-martial is convened to try a serviceman who was a member of the Armed Services at the time of the offense charged' and then affirms the judgment. This directly overrules the service connection requirement established in Relford. Justice Stevens' concurrence confirms this by explicitly stating 'Today's unnecessary overruling of precedent' and referring to the Court 'reaching out to reexamine the decisions in O'Callahan v. Parker and Relford v. Commandant.'""

See United States v. Winans.' This indicates Winans rejected certain foundations of Race Horse, not that Winans itself was overruled.
