 .  .  was not increased (but actually decreased), and the elements of the offense or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt were not changed,” there was no ex post facto violation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C-6.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Youngblood v. Lynaugh, 882 F. 2d 956 (CA5 1989).  It relied on the statement in this Court’s decision in Thompson v. Utah, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 343</citedDecision> (1898), that retroactive procedural statutes violate the Ex Post Facto Clause unless they ‘“leave untouched all the substantial-protections with which existing law surrounds the person accused of crime,’” Lynaugh, supra, at 959 (quoting <citedDecision>170 U. S., at 352</citedDecision> ).  It held that Youngblood’s right to a new trial under the Bogany decision was such a “substantial protection,” and therefore ordered that a writ of habeas corpus be issued.  We granted certiorari.  493 U. S. 1001 (1989).  Because respondent is before us on collateral review, we are faced with a threshold question whether the relief sought by Youngblood would constitute a “new rule,” which would not apply retroactively under our decisions in Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288 (1989), and Butler v. McKellar, 494 U. S. 407 (1990).  Generally speaking, “[rjetroactivity is *41 properly treated as a threshold question, for, once a new rule is applied to the defendant in the case announcing the rule, evenhanded justice requires that it be applied retroactively to all who are similarly situated.” Teague, supra, at 300 .  The State of Texas, however, did not address retroactivity in its petition for certiorari or its briefs on the merits, and when asked about the issue at oral argument, counsel answered that the State had chosen not to rely on Teague .

 But the prohibition which may not be evaded is the one defined by the Calder categories.  See Duncan, supra, at 382 ; Malloy, supra, at 183-184 .  The references in Duncan and Malloy to “substantial protections” and “personal rights” should not be read to adopt without explanation an undefined enlargement of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  *47 Two decisions of this Court, relied upon by respondent, do not fit into this analytical framework.  In Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221 (1883), the Court said “it is not to be supposed that the opinion in [Calder v. Bull] undertook to define, by way of exclusion, all the cases to which the constitutional provision would be applicable.” Id., at 228 .  It defined an ex post facto law, inter alia, as one which, “ ‘in relation to the offence or its consequences, alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.”’ Id., at 228-229 (quoting United States v. Hall, 26 F. Cas. 84, 86 (No. 15,285) (D Pa. 1809)) (emphasis deleted).  And in Thompson v. Utah, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 343</citedDecision> (1898), the Court held that a change in Utah law reducing the size of juries in criminal cases from 12 persons to 8 deprived Thompson of “a substantial right involved in his liberty” and violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.  <citedDecision>Id., at 352</citedDecision> .  Neither of these decisions, in our view, is consistent with the understanding of the term “ex post facto law” at the time the Constitution was adopted.  Nor has their reasoning been followed by this Court since <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> was decided in 1898.  These cases have caused confusion in state and lower federal courts about the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause, as exemplified by the opinions of the District Court and Court of Appeals in this case. See also Murphy v. Kentucky, 465 U. S. 1072, 1073 (1984) (White, J., dissenting from denial of certio-rari) (noting “the evident confusion among lower courts concerning the application of the Ex Post Facto Clause to changes in rules of evidence and procedure”); United States v. Kowal, 596 F. Supp. 375, 377 (Conn. 1984) (Supreme Court jurisprudence applying ex post facto prohibition to retroactive procedural changes “is not all of one piece”); L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 638 (2d ed. 1988) (procedural changes upheld by the Court “can hardly be distinguished in any functional way from those invalidated”).  The earlier decision, Kring v. Missouri, was a capital case with a lengthy procedural history.  Kring was charged with first-degree murder, but pursuant to a plea agreement, he *48 pleaded guilty to second-degree murder.  The plea was accepted by the prosecutor and the trial court, and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison.  He appealed the judgment, however, on the ground that his plea agreement provided for a sentence of no more than 10 years.  The State Supreme Court reversed the judgment and remanded for further proceedings.

 His jury charge should not be read to mean that the Constitution prohibits retrospective *50 laws, other than those encompassed by the Calder categories, which “alte[r] the situation of a party to his disadvantage.” Nothing in the Hall case supports the broad construction of the ex post facto provision given by the Court in Kring .  It is possible to reconcile Kring with the numerous cases which have held that “procedural” changes do not result in ex post facto violations by saying that the change in Missouri law did take away a “defense” available to the defendant under the old procedure.  But this use of the word “defense” carries a meaning quite different from that which appears in the quoted language from Beazell , where the term was linked to the prohibition on alterations in “the legal definition of the offense” or “the nature or amount of the punishment imposed for its commission.” Beazell, 269 U. S., at 169-170 .  The “defense” available to Kring under earlier Missouri law was not one related to the definition of the crime, but was based on the law regulating the effect of guilty pleas.  Missouri had not changed any of the elements of the crime of murder, or the matters which might be pleaded as an excuse or justification for the conduct underlying such a charge; it had changed its law respecting the effect of a guilty plea to a lesser included offense.  The holding in Kring can only be justified if the Ex Post Facto Clause is thought to include not merely the Calder categories, but any change which “alters the situation of a party to his disadvantage.” We think such a reading of the Clause departs from the meaning of the Clause as it was understood at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, and is not supported by later cases. We accordingly overrule Kring .  The second case, <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Utah</citedDecision> , must be viewed in historical context.  Thompson was initially charged with his crime — grand larceny committed by stealing a calf — in 1895, when Utah was a Territory.  He was tried by a jury of 12 persons and convicted.  A new trial was subsequently granted, however, and in the meantime Utah was admitted *51 into the Union as a State.  The Constitution of the State of Utah provided that juries in noncapital cases would consist of 8 persons, not 12, and Thompson was retried and convicted by a panel of 8.  This Court reversed the conviction.  It reasoned first that while Utah was a Territory, the Sixth Amendment applied to actions of the territorial government and guaranteed Thompson a right to a 12-person jury.  <citedDecision>170 U. S., at 349-350</citedDecision> .  The Court then held that “the State did not acquire upon its admission into the Union the power to provide, in respect of felonies committed within its limits while it was a Territory, that they should be tried otherwise than by a jury such as is provided by the Constitution of the United States.” <citedDecision>Id., at 350-351</citedDecision> .  Because the State Constitution “deprive[d] him of a substantial right involved in his liberty” and “materially altered] the situation to his disadvantage,” the Court concluded that Thompson’s conviction was prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause.  <citedDecision>Id., at 352-353</citedDecision> .  The result in <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Utah</citedDecision> foreshadowed our decision in Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U. S. 145 (1968), which held that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury — then believed to mean a jury of 12, see, e. g., Patton v. United States, 281 U. S. 276, 288-289 (1930) — was incorporated and made applicable by the Fourteenth Amendment against the States.  The Court held that since Utah was a Territory when Thompson’s crime was committed, and therefore obligated to provide a 12-person jury by the Sixth Amendment, the Ex Post Facto Clause prevented the State from taking away that substantial right from him when it became a State and was no longer bound by the Sixth Amendment as then interpreted.  The right to jury trial provided by the Sixth Amendment is obviously a “substantial” one, but it is not a right that has anything to do with the definition of crimes, defenses, or punishments, which is the concern of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  To the extent that <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Utah</citedDecision> *52 rested on the Ex Post Facto Clause and not the Sixth Amendment, we overrule it.  4 The Texas statute allowing reformation of improper verdicts does not punish as a crime an act previously committed, which was innocent when done; nor make more burdensome the punishment for a crime, after its commission; nor deprive one charged with crime of any defense available according to law at the time when the act was committed.  Its application to respondent therefore is not prohibited by the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. I, § 10.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.  In Bogany , the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals held that a jury verdict which included a punishment unauthorized by law was void at its inception and had to be set aside.  It concluded that Texas law at that time did not give appellate courts authority to reform such verdicts.  Although there has been some debate within the Court about the accuracy of the historical discussion in Calder v. Bull , see Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380, 381 (1829) (note by Johnson, J.), the Court has consistently adhered to the view expressed by Justices Chase, Paterson, and Iredell in Calder that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies only to penal statutes.  The Beazell definition omits the reference by Justice Chase in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798), to alterations in the “legal rules of evidence.” See also Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 590 (1884) (approving procedural changes “leaving untouched the nature of the crime and the amount or degree of proof essential to conviction”).  As cases subsequent to Calder make clear, this language was not intended to prohibit the application of new evidentiary rules in trials for crimes committed before the changes.  Thompson v. Missouri, 171 U. S. 380, 386-387 (1898) (rejecting e.r post facto challenge to retroactive application of statute making admissible handwritten documents as handwriting exemplars): Hopt, supra, at 588-590 (upholding retroactive application of statute making felons competent to testify).  The Court’s holding in Thompson v. Utah, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 343</citedDecision> (1898), that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury panel of 12 persons is also obsolete.  Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970).
**Concurrence Opinion**
 It is sufficient now to say that a statute belongs to that class which by its necessary operation and ‘in its relation to the offence, or its consequences, alters the situation of the accused to his disadvantage.’ United States v. Hall, 2 Wash. C. C. 366 ; Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221, 228 ; Medley, Petitioner, 134 U. S. *57 160, 171 .  Of course, a statute is not of that class unless it materially impairs the right of the accused to have the question of his guilt determined according to the law as it was when the offence was committed.” Id., at 350-351.  In Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925), we made it clear that the question whether a particular procedural change has a sufficiently drastic impact on a defendant to be characterized as “substantial” is a matter of degree.  In that case we held that the rule applied in Kring and Thompson did not preclude the retrospective application of a rule allowing two codefendants to be tried jointly for a noncapital offense.  We summarized our earlier cases construing the Ex Post Facto Clause and explained: “The constitutional prohibition and the judicial interpretation of it rest upon the notion that laws, whatever their form, which purport to make innocent acts criminal after the event, or to aggravate an offense, are harsh and oppressive, and that the criminal quality attributable to an act, either by the legal definition of the offense or by the nature or amount of the punishment imposed for its commission, should not be altered by legislative enactment, after the fact, to the disadvantage of the accused.” 269 U. S., at 170 .  “And there may be procedural changes which operate to deny to the accused a defense available under the laws in force at the time of the commission of his offense, or which otherwise affect him in such a harsh and arbitrary manner as to fall within the constitutional prohibition.  Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221 ; Thompson v. Utah, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 343</citedDecision> .  But it is now well settled that statutory changes in the mode of trial or the rules of evidence, which do not deprive the accused of a defense and which operate only in a limited and unsubstantial manner to his disadvantage, are not prohibited.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> *58 “Just what alterations of procedure will be held to be of sufficient moment to transgress the constitutional prohibition cannot be embraced within a formula or stated in a general proposition.  The distinction is one of degree.  But the constitutional provision was intended to secure substantial personal rights against arbitrary and oppressive legislation, see Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 183 , and not to limit the legislative control of remedies and modes of procedure which do not affect matters of substance.” Id., at 171.  h — I » — I The foregoing cases make it clear that the mere fact that this case involves a procedural change in Texas law is not sufficient to exclude it from the coverage of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  But it is equally clear that our analysis should focus on the impact of the change upon the “right belonging to [the defendant] when the offense was committed.” Thompson, <citedDecision>170 U. S., at 351</citedDecision> .  In this case, neither the defendant’s right to a fair trial nor his right to be protected against unauthorized or excessive punishment has been impaired in the slightest by the new Texas rule.  This conclusion follows immediately from an observation which is both sensible and evident from precedent: A procedural protection is likely to be substantial, when viewed from the time of the commission of the offense, only if it affects the modes of procedure by which a valid conviction or sentence may be imposed.  The claims in Kring and Thompson both satisfy this threshold test.  In Kring, the procedural change — which deprived Kring of a defense based upon an earlier trial or plea — made it easier for the State to obtain a first-degree murder charge against a defendant who had never been subject to any valid conviction for the crime in question, much less a valid conviction for first-degree murder.  In Thompson, the reduction in the size of the jury made it easier for the State to obtain a unanimous verdict *59 against a defendant who, before the verdict, likewise had not been convicted.  Mallett v. North Carolina, 181 U. S. 589 (1901), is, however, distinguishable from Kring and Thompson because it fails to meet the threshold test.
**Combined Opinion**
 Article 37.10(b), as of June 11, 1985, allows an appellate court to reform an improper verdict that assesses a punishment not authorized by law. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.10(b) (Vernon Supp. 1990); see Ex parte Johnson, 697 S. W. 2d 605 (Tex. Crim. App. 1985).  Relying on that statute, the Court of Criminal Appeals reformed the verdict in Youngblood's case by ordering deletion of the $10,000 fine and denied his request for a new trial. Youngblood then sought a writ of habeas corpus from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, arguing that the retroactive application of Art. 37.10(b) violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of Art. I, § 10, of the Federal Constitution.  The District Court concluded that since Youngblood's "punishment ... was not increased (but actually decreased), and the elements of the offense or the ultimate facts necessary to establish guilt were not changed," there was no ex post facto violation.  App. to Pet. for Cert. C-6.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  Youngblood v. Lynaugh, 882 F. 2d 956 (CA5 1989).  It relied on the statement in this Court's decision in Thompson v.

JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE MARSHALL join, concurring in the judgment.  The "Ex Post Facto" Clause of the Constitution [1] has been construed to embrace any law that deprives a person accused of crime of a "substantial protection" that the law afforded at the time of the alleged offense.  Thus, the Clause prohibits not only the retroactive creation of new criminal offenses and more harsh penalties, but also substantial changes in procedure that are designed to protect the defendant from a wrongful conviction.
**Combined Opinion**
 [3] This Court's reversal of that holding demonstrates that the Clause applies to some procedural changes, but our decision rested on the fact that the change had deprived the defendant of a complete defense to the charge of first-degree murder and to the imposition of the death penalty.  We wrote: "Whatever may be the essential nature of the change, it is one which, to the defendant, involves the difference between life and death, and the retroactive character of the change cannot be denied." Id., at 224 .  "In the case before us the Constitution of Missouri so changes the rule of evidence, that what was conclusive evidence of innocence of the higher grade of murder when the crime was committed, namely, a judicial conviction for a lower grade of homicide, is not received as evidence at all, or, if received, is given no weight in behalf of the offender.  It also changes the punishment, for, whereas the law as it stood when the homicide was committed was that, when convicted of murder in the second degree, he could never be tried or punished by death for murder in the first degree, the new law enacts *56 that he may be so punished, notwithstanding the former conviction." Id., at 228 .  Thompson v. Utah, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 343</citedDecision> (1898), involved an offense committed while Utah was a Territory, but the case was tried after Utah became a State.  At the time of the offense, the defendant was entitled to a trial by a 12-person jury, but under the new State's law only 8 jurors were required.  We held that this retrospective procedural change deprived Thompson of "a substantial right belonging to him when the offense was committed," and therefore violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.  "We are of opinion that the State did not acquire upon its admission into the Union the power to provide, in respect of felonies committed within its limits while it was a Territory, that they should be tried otherwise than by a jury such as is provided by the Constitution of the United States.  When Thompson's crime was committed, it was his constitutional right to demand that his liberty should not be taken from him except by the joint action of the court and the unanimous verdict of a jury of twelve persons.  To hold that a State could deprive him of his liberty by the concurrent action of a court and eight jurors, would recognize the power of the State not only to do what the United States in respect of Thompson's crime could not, at any time, have done by legislation, but to take from the accused a substantial right belonging to him when the offence was committed.  "It is not necessary to review the numerous cases in which the courts have determined whether particular statutes come within the constitutional prohibition of ex post facto laws.  It is sufficient now to say that a statute belongs to that class which by its necessary operation and `in its relation to the offence, or its consequences, alters the situation of the accused to his disadvantage.' United States v. Hall, 2 Wash. C. C. 366 ; Kring v. Missouri, 107 U. S. 221, 228 ; Medley, Petitioner, 134 U. S. *57 160, 171.  Of course, a statute is not of that class unless it materially impairs the right of the accused to have the question of his guilt determined according to the law as it was when the offence was committed." Id., at 350-351 .  In Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925), we made it clear that the question whether a particular procedural change has a sufficiently drastic impact on a defendant to be characterized as "substantial" is a matter of degree.

The claims in Kring and <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> both satisfy this threshold test.  In Kring , the procedural changewhich deprived Kring of a defense based upon an earlier trial or pleamade it easier for the State to obtain a first-degree murder charge against a defendant who had never been subject to any valid conviction for the crime in question, much less a valid conviction for first-degree murder.  In <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> , the reduction in the size of the jury made it easier for the State to obtain a unanimous verdict *59 against a defendant who, before the verdict, likewise had not been convicted.  Mallett v. North Carolina, 181 U. S. 589 (1901), is, however, distinguishable from Kring and <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> because it fails to meet the threshold test.  In Mallett , a valid conviction had been obtained against the defendant.  Under the defendant's theory in that case, however, the State would have been prohibited from relying upon this conviction because it had been vacated by an intermediate appellate court. Although the North Carolina Supreme Court reinstated the conviction, Mallett claimed that it lacked power to do so. At the time Mallett committed his crime, the State was prohibited by state law from appealing the adverse decisions of intermediate appellate courts in criminal cases. This restriction had been removed, but Mallett contended that the State had thereby enacted an ex post facto law. As the case came to this Court, it was conceded that Mallett was convicted after a trial which afforded him all the procedural and substantive protections guaranteed by North Carolina law at the time he committed his offense.  Nevertheless, according to Mallett's theory, the State was prohibited from relying upon his conviction because of the combination of an intervening  and, for this Court's purposes, erroneous appellate decision and a restriction upon the State's access to the appellate processes.  Not surprisingly, we rejected this claim.  This case is comparable to Mallett .  Respondent does not claim that he was denied any procedural protections relevant to the determination of his guilt or innocence.  Nor does he claim that his life sentence was unauthorized by law or that it was the consequence of improper procedures.  Finally, he does not argue that he has been deprived of any avenue of review for correcting errors that may have vitiated the validity of his conviction or sentence.  For example, respondent does not contendand we do not see how he could plausibly contendthat the State has deprived him of any opportunity to challenge his conviction on the ground that the improper *60 sentencing instruction somehow infected the jury's deliberations about his guilt or about the propriety of life imprisonment.  Respondent instead claims, as did the defendant in Mallett , that an unrelated error must bar the State from relying upon his concededly valid conviction, and predicates this claim solely on a restriction upon the State's access to appellate or, more precisely in this case, postconviction remedies.  [4] Unlike the defendants in <citedDecision>Thompson</citedDecision> and Kring , Youngblood wishes to have a new trial according to the same procedures, regulated by the same laws, open to the same evidence, and capped by the same sentencing limitations that resulted in his conviction and his life sentence.  [5] Obviously, as our decision in Beazell itself makes clear, a procedural protection does not become substantial merely because it meets the low threshold that I have discussed.  It does, however, become insubstantial by failing to do so. Whatever else may be said of the factors that determine whether a procedural protection affects substantial rights, it is difficult to imagine how a retroactive law could, when viewed from the standpoint of the date the offense was committed, implicate substantial rights of any defendant if the law does no more than expand the flexibility of postconviction processes available to the State with respect to a defendant *61 who is subject to a valid conviction and sentence.  Indeed, respondent has barely even attempted to articulate any justification for the Texas procedure that the legislature abolished.  The mere possibility of a capricious and unlikely windfall is not the sort of procedural protection that could reasonably be judged substantial from the perspective of the defendant at the time the offense was committed.  Accordingly, I concur in the Court's judgment, but not in its opinion.  NOTES [*] Solicitor General Starr, Assistant Attorney General Dennis, Deputy Solicitor General Bryson, and James A.

**Combined Opinion**
 It concluded that Texas law at that time did not give appellate courts authority to reform such verdicts.  [2]  Although there has been some debate within the Court about the accuracy of the historical discussion in Calder v. Bull , see Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380, 381 (1829) (note by Johnson, J.), the Court has consistently adhered to the view expressed by Justices Chase, Paterson, and Iredell in Calder that the Ex Post Facto Clause applies only to penal statutes.  [3]  The Beazell definition omits the reference by Justice Chase in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 390 (1798), to alterations in the "legal rules of evidence." See also Hopt v. Utah, 110 U. S. 574, 590 (1884) (approving procedural changes "leaving untouched the nature of the crime and the amount or degree of proof essential to conviction").  As cases subsequent to Calder make clear, this language was not intended to prohibit the application of new evidentiary rules in trials for crimes committed before the changes.  Thompson v. Missouri, 171 U. S. 380, 386-387 (1898) (rejecting ex post facto challenge to retroactive application of statute making admissible handwritten documents as handwriting exemplars); Hopt, supra, at 588-590 (upholding retroactive application of statute making felons competent to testify).  [4]  The Court's holding in Thompson v. Utah, <citedDecision>170 U. S. 343</citedDecision> (1898), that the Sixth Amendment requires a jury panel of 12 persons is also obsolete.  Williams v. Florida, 399 U. S. 78 (1970).  [1]  Art. I, § 10, of the Constitution provides in part: "No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility." [2]  At the time of respondent's offense, it apparently was well established under Texas law that, as a general proposition, when a criminal jury rendered a verdict not authorized by law the verdict was void at its inception.  See, e. g., Ex parte McIver, 586 S. W. 2d 851, 854 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979); Ocker v. State, 477 S. W. 2d 288, 290 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972).  However, until the Court of Criminal Appeals decided Bogany , there was some doubt both as to whether that general rule would apply to the error in this case and as to whether the sentence imposed by the jury in this case was in fact unlawful.  See, e. g., Adams v. State, 642 S. W. 2d 211, 213-214 (Tex. App. 1982) (reforming jury's sentence); Bogany v. State, 646 S. W. 2d 663, 664-665 (Tex. App.) (stating that jury's sentence could be reformed), rev'd, 661 S. W. 2d 957 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983); id., at 960 (McCormick, J., dissenting) (contending that supplementary fine was authorized by law).
