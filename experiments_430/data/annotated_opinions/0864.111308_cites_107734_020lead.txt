 Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1961, §§ 2(c), 9, 75 Stat. 65 , 71.  Five years later, Congress extended FLSA coverage to state and local-government employees for the first time by withdrawing the minimum-wage and overtime exemptions from public hospitals, schools, and mass-transit carriers whose rates and services were subject to state regulation.  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1966, §§ 102(a) and (b), 80 Stat. 831 .  At the same time, Congress eliminated the overtime exemption for all mass-transit employees other than drivers, operators, and conductors.  § 206(c), 80 Stat. 836 .  The application of the FLSA to public schools and hospitals was ruled to be within Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.  Maryland v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S. 183</citedDecision> (1968).  The FLSA obligations of public mass-transit systems like SATS were expanded in 1974 when Congress provided for the progressive repeal of the surviving overtime exemption for mass-transit employees.  Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1974, § 21(b), 88 Stat. 68 .  Congress simultaneously brought the States and their subdivisions further within the ambit of the FLSA by extending FLSA coverage to virtually all state and local-government employees.  §§ 6(a)(1) and (6), 88 Stat. 58 , 60, 29 U. S. C. §§ 203 (d) and (x).  SATS complied with the FLSA’s overtime requirements until 1976, when this Court, in National League of Cities , overruled <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Wirtz</citedDecision> , and held that the FLSA could not be *534 applied constitutionally to the “traditional governmental functions” of state and local governments.  Four months after National League of Cities was handed down, SATS informed its employees that the decision relieved SATS of its overtime obligations under the FLSA.  3 Matters rested there until September 17, 1979, when the Wage and Hour Administration of the Department of Labor issued an opinion that SAMTA’s operations “are not constitutionally immune from the application of the Fair Labor Standards Act” under National League of Cities .  Opinion WH-499, 6 LRR 91:1138.  On November 21 of that year, SAMTA filed this action against the Secretary of Labor in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas.  It sought a declaratory judgment that, contrary to the Wage and Hour Administration’s determination, National League of Cities precluded the application of the FLSA’s overtime requirements to SAMTA’s operations.  The Secretary counterclaimed under 29 U. S. C. §217 for enforcement of the overtime and recordkéeping requirements of the FLSA.

 If there are to be limits on the Federal Government’s power to interfere with state functions — as undoubtedly there are — we must look elsewhere to find them.  We accordingly return to the underlying issue that confronted this Court in National League of Cities — the manner in which the Constitution insulates States from the reach of Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause.  Ill The central theme of National League of Cities was that the States occupy a special position in our constitutional system and that the scope of Congress’ authority under the Commerce Clause must reflect that position.  Of course, the Commerce Clause by its specific language does not provide any special limitation on Congress’ actions with respect to the States.  See EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 248 (1983) (concurring opinion).  It is equally true, however, that the text of the Constitution provides the beginning rather than the final answer to every inquiry into questions of federalism, for “[bjehind the words of the constitutional provisions are postulates which limit and control.” Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 322 (1934).  National League of Cities reflected the general conviction that the Constitution precludes “the National Government [from] devouring] the essentials of state sovereignty.” <citedDecision>Maryland</citedDecision> v. Wirtz, <citedDecision>392 U. S., at 205</citedDecision> (dissenting opinion).  In order to be faithful to the underlying federal premises of the Constitution, courts must look for the “postulates which limit and control.” What has proved problematic is not the perception that the Constitution’s federal structure imposes limitations on the Commerce Clause, but rather the nature and content of those limitations.  One approach to defining the limits on Con *548 gress’ authority to regulate the States under the Commerce Clause is to identify certain underlying elements of political sovereignty that are deemed essential to the States’ “separate and independent existence.” Lane County v. Oregon, 7 Wall. 71, 76 (1869).  This approach obviously underlay the Court’s use of the “traditional governmental function” concept in National League of Cities.  It also has led to the separate requirement that the challenged federal statute “address matters that are indisputably ‘attribute^] of state sovereignty.’” Hodel, 452 U. S., at 288 , quoting National League of Cities, 426 U. S., at 845 .  In National League of Cities itself, for example, the Court concluded that decisions by a State concerning the wages and hours of its employees are an “undoubted attribute of state sovereignty.” 426 U. S., at 845 .  The opinion did not explain what aspects of such decisions made them such an “undoubted attribute,” and the Court since then has remarked on the uncertain scope of the concept.
