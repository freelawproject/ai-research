<p id="A_il">dissenting:</p>
<p id="b686-7">This case involves the problem of rate making under the Natural Gas Act. Added importance arises from the obvious fact that the principles stated are generally applicable to all federal agencies which are entrusted with the determination of rates for utilities. Because my views differ somewhat from those of my brethren, it may be of some value to set them out in a summary form.</p>
<p id="b686-8">The Congress may fix utility rates in situations subject to federal control without regard to any standard except the constitutional standards of due process and for taking private property for public use without just compensation. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>New, </em><span class="citation" data-id="98903"><a href="/opinion/98903/wilson-v-new/#350" aria-description="Citation for case: Wilson v. New">243 U. S. 332, 350</a></span>. A Commission, however, does not have this freedom of action. Its powers are limited not only by the constitutional standards but also by the standards of the delegation. Here the standard added by the Natural Gas Act is that the rate be “just <page-number citation-index="1" label="621">*621</page-number>and reasonable."<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 6<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> throws additional light on the meaning of these words.</p>
<p id="b687-4">When the phrase was used by Congress to describe allowable rates, it had relation to something ascertainable. The rates were not left to the whim of the Commission. The rates fixed would produce an annual return and that annual return was to be compared with a theoretical just and reasonable return, all risks considered, on the fair value of the property used and useful in the public service at the time of the determination.</p>
<p id="b687-5">Such an abstract test is not precise. The agency charged with its determination has a wide range before it could properly be said by a court that the agency had disregarded statutory standards or had confiscated the property of the utility for public use. Cf. Chicago, <em>M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em><span class="citation" data-id="92743"><a href="/opinion/92743/chicago-milwaukee-st-paul-railway-co-v-minnesota/#461" aria-description="Citation for case: Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Co. v. Minnesota">134 U. S. 418, 461-66</a></span>, dissent. This is as Congress intends. Rates are left to an experienced agency particularly competent by training to appraise the amount required.</p>
<p id="b687-6">The decision as to a reasonable return had not been a source of great difficulty, for borrowers and lenders reached such agreements daily in a multitude of situations; and although the determination of fair value had been troublesome, its essentials had been worked out in fairness to investor and consumer by the time of the en<page-number citation-index="1" label="622">*622</page-number>actment of this Act. Cf. <em>Los Angeles Gas &amp; Electric Corp. </em>v. <em>Railroad Commission, </em><span class="citation" data-id="102091"><a href="/opinion/102091/los-angeles-gas-electric-corp-v-railroad-commission/" aria-description="Citation for case: Los Angeles Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission">289 U. S. 287</a></span>, 304 <em>et seq. </em>The results were well known to Congress and had that body desired to depart from the traditional concepts of fair value and earnings, it would have stated its intention plainly. <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Griffiths, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103795"><a href="/opinion/103795/helvering-v-griffiths/" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v. Griffiths">318 U. S. 371</a></span>.</p>
<p id="b688-6">It was already clear that when rates are in dispute, "earnings produced by rates do not afford a standard for decision.” <span class="citation" data-id="102091"><a href="/opinion/102091/los-angeles-gas-electric-corp-v-railroad-commission/#305" aria-description="Citation for case: Los Angeles Gas &amp; Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission">289 U. S. at 305</a></span>. Historical cost, prudent investment and reproduction cost<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> were all relevant factors in determining fair value. Indeed, disregarding the pioneer investor’s risk, if prudent investment and reproduction cost were not distorted by changes in price levels or technology, each of them would produce the same result. The realization from the risk of an investment in a speculative field, such as natural gas utilities, should be reflected in the present fair value.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The amount of evidence to be admitted on any point was of course in the agency’s reasonable discretion, and it was free to give its own weight to these or other factors and to determine from all the evidence its own judgment as to the necessary rates.</p>
<p id="b689-2"><page-number citation-index="1" label="623">*623</page-number>I agree with the Court in not imposing a rule of prudent investment alone in determining the rate base. This leaves the Commission free, as I understand it, to use any available evidence for its finding of fair value, including both prudent investment and the cost of installing at the present time an efficient system for furnishing the needed utility service.</p>
<p id="b689-3">My disagreement with the Court arises primarily from its view that it makes no difference how the Commission reached the rate fixed so long as the result is fair and reasonable. For me the statutory command to the Commission is more explicit. Entirely aside from the constitutional problem of whether the Congress could validly delegate its rate-making power to the Commission, <em>in toto </em>and without standards, it did legislate in the light of the relation of fair and reasonable to fair value and reasonable return. The Commission must therefore make its findings in observance of that relationship.</p>
<p id="b689-4">The Federal Power Commission did not, as I construe their action, disregard its statutory duty. They heard the evidence relating to historical and reproduction cost and to the reasonable rate of return, and they appraised its weight. The evidence of reproduction cost was rejected as unpersuasive, but from the other evidence they found a rate base, which is to me a determination of fair value. On that base the earnings allowed seem fair and reasonable. So far as the Commission went in appraising the property employed in the service, I find nothing in the result which indicates confiscation, unfairness or unreasonableness. Good administration of rate-making agencies under this method would avoid undue delay and render revaluations unnecessary except after violent fluctuations of price levels. Rate making under this method has been subjected to criticism. But until Congress changes the standards for the agencies, these rate-making bodies should continue the conventional theory of rate <page-number citation-index="1" label="624">*624</page-number>making. It will probably be simpler to improve present methods than to devise new ones.</p>
<p id="b690-4">But a major error, I think, was committed in the disregard by the Commission of the investment in exploratory operations and other recognized capital costs. These were not considered by the Commission because they were charged to operating expenses by the company at a time when it was .unregulated. Congress did not direct the Commission in rate making to deduct from the rate base capital investment which had been recovered during the unregulated period through excess earnings. In my view this part of the investment should no more have been disregarded in the rate base than any other capital investment which previously had been recovered and paid out in dividends or placed to surplus. Even if prudent investment throughout the life of the property is accepted as the formula for figuring the rate base, it seems to me illogical to throw out the admittedly prudent cost of part of the property because the earnings in the unregulated period had been sufficient to return the prudent cost to the investors over and above a reasonable return. What would the answer be under the theory of the Commission and the Court, if the only prudent investment in this utility had been the seventeen million capital charges which are now disallowed?</p>
<p id="b690-5">For the reasons heretofore stated, I should affirm the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in returning the proceeding to the Commission for further consideration and should direct the Commission to accept the disallowed capital investment in determining the fair value for rate-making purposes.</p>

<p id="b688-7"> “Reproduction cost” has been variously defined, but for rate-making purposes the most useful sense seems to be, the minimum amount necessary to create at the time of the inquiry a modern plant capable of rendering equivalent service. See I Bonbright, Valuation of Property (1937) 152. Reproduction cost as the cost of building a replica of an obsolescent plant is not of real significance.</p>
<p id="b688-8">“Prudent investment” is not defined by the Court. It may mean the sum originally put in the enterprise, either with or without additional amounts from excess earnings reinvested in the business.</p>

<footnote label="4">
<p id="b688-9"> It is of no more than bookkeeping significance whether the Commission allows a rate of return commensurate with the risk of the original investment or the lower rate based on current risk and a capitalization reflecting the established earning power of a suceessful company and the probable cost of duplicating its services.
