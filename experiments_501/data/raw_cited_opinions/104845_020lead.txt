<p id="Aqc">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b431-5">Petitioner was summoned to appear before a federal district grand jury in Denver, Colorado. Both before that body and before the district judge where he was later taken, petitioner declined to answer questions concerning the activities and records of the Communist Party of Colorado, claiming his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination. He also refused to reveal the whereabouts of his wife, who was wanted by the grand jury as a witness in connection with the same investigation. As to this refusal to testify, petitioner asserted his privilege against disclosing confidential communications between husband and wife. The district judge overruled both claims of privilege and sentenced petitioner to six months in prison for contempt of court. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed. 179 F. 2d 559.</p>
<p id="b431-6">For the reasons set out in our recent opinion in <em>Patricia Blau </em>v. <em>United States, </em>340 U. S. 159, we hold it was error to fail to sustain the claim of privilege against self-incrimination.</p>
<p id="b431-7">This leaves for consideration the validity of the sentence insofar as it rests on the failure of petitioner to disclose the whereabouts of his wife. In <em>Wolfle </em>v. <em>United States, </em>291 U. S. 7, this Court recognized that a confidential communication between husband and wife was privileged. It is not disputed in the present case that petitioner obtained his knowledge as to where his wife was by communication from her. Nevertheless, the Government insists that he should be denied the benefit of the privilege because he failed to prove that the information was privately conveyed. This contention ignores the rule that marital communications are presumptively confidential. <em>Wolfle </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>at 14; Wigmore, Evidence, § 2336. The Government made no effort to overcome the presumption. In this case, more<page-number citation-index="1" label="334">*334</page-number>over, the communication to petitioner was of the kind likely to be confidential. Petitioner’s wife, according to the district judge, knew that she and a number of others were “wanted” as witnesses by the grand jury but she “hid out, apparently so that the process . . . could not be served upon her.” <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Several of the witnesses who appeared were put in jail for contempt of court. Under such circumstances, it seems highly probable that Mrs. Blau secretly told her husband where she could be found. Petitioner’s refusal to betray his wife’s trust therefore was both understandable and lawful. We have no doubt that he was entitled to claim his privilege.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>

<footnote label="1">
<p id="b432-8"> Petitioner’s wife, when apprehended, was sentenced to one year’s imprisonment for contempt, <em>Patricia Blau </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>although other witnesses who refused to testify received shorter sentences. In sentencing Mrs. Blau, the judge stated: “I haven’t much sympathy for this lady because, as I said, she defied the Court by avoiding the process of the Court when she knew very well that she was wanted here, and yet she hid out, apparently so that the process of this court could not be served upon her.”</p>

<p id="b432-9"> In view of our decision on this phase of the case, it is unnecessary to reach the question whether the single <em>conviction </em>for <em>contempt </em>(which was based on the refusal to give incriminating testimony <em>and </em>on the refusal to reveal a confidential marital communication) would be valid if petitioner were entitled to claim one, but not both, of the privileges.</p>
