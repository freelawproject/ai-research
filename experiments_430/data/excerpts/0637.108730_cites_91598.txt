**Lead Opinion**
 II We granted certiorari to resolve a sharp conflict among the federal courts 2 on the choice of forum where a prisoner attacks an interstate detainer on federal habeas corpus.  Before turning to that question, we must make clear that petitioner is entitled to raise his speedy trial claim on federal habeas corpus at this time.  First, he is currently “in custody” within the meaning of the federal habeas corpus statute, 28 U. S. C. §2241 (c)(3).  Prior to our decision in Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), the “prematurity doctrine” of McNally v. Hill, 293 U. S. 131 (1934), would, of course, have barred his petition for relief.  3 But our decision in Peyton v. Rowe discarded the prematurity doctrine, which had permitted *489 a prisoner to attack on habeas corpus only his current confinement, and not confinement that would be imposed in the future, and opened the door to this action.  4 Second, petitioner has exhausted all available state remedies as a prelude to this action.  It is true, of course, that he has not yet been tried on the Kentucky indictment, and he can assert a speedy trial defense when, and if, he is finally brought to trial. It is also true, as our Brother Rehnquist points out in dissent, that federal habeas corpus does not lie, absent “special circumstances,” to adjudicate the merits of an affirmative defense to a state criminal charge prior to a judgment of conviction by a state court. Ex parte Royall, <citedDecision>117 U. S. 241, 253</citedDecision> (1886).  Petitioner does not, however, seek at this time to litigate a federal defense to a criminal charge, but only *490 to demand enforcement of the Commonwealth’s affirmative constitutional obligation to bring him promptly to trial. Smith v. Hooey, 393 U. S. 374 (1969).  He has made repeated demands for trial to the courts of Kentucky, offering those courts an opportunity to consider on the merits his constitutional claim of the present denial of a speedy trial. Under these circumstances it is clear that he has exhausted all available state court remedies for consideration of that constitutional claim, even though Kentucky has not yet brought him to trial. .  The exhaustion doctrine is a judicially crafted instrument which reflects a careful balance between important interests of federalism and the need to preserve the writ of habeas corpus as a “swift and imperative remedy in all cases of illegal restraint or confinement.” Secretary of State for Home Affairs v. O’Brien, [1923] A. C. 603, 609 (H. L.).  It cannot be used as a blunderbuss to shatter the attempt at litigation of constitutional claims without regard to the purposes that underlie the doctrine and that called it into existence.  As applied in our earlier decisions, the doctrine “preserves the role of the state courts in the application and enforcement of federal law. Early federal intervention in state criminal proceedings would tend to remove federal questions from the state courts, isolate those courts from constitutional issues, and thereby remove their understanding of and hospitality to federally protected interests.  Second, [the doctrine] preserves orderly administration of state judicial business, preventing the interruption of state adjudication by federal habeas proceedings.  It is important that petitioners reach state appellate courts, which can develop and correct errors of state and federal law and most effectively supervise and *491 impose uniformity on trial courts.” Note, Developments in the Law — Federal Habeas Corpus, 83 Harv. L. Rev. 1038 , 1094 (1970).  See Darr v. Burford, 339 U. S. 200, 204-206 (1950), and the case which overruled it, Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 417-420 (1963).  See also <citedDecision>Ex parte Royall, supra, at 251-252</citedDecision> ; Ex parte Hawk, 321 U. S. 114 (1944); cf. Younger v. Harris, 401 U. S. 37 (1971); Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U. S. 117 (1951).  The fundamental interests underlying the exhaustion doctrine have been fully satisfied in petitioner's situation.  He has already presented his federal constitutional claim of a present denial of a speedy trial to the courts of Kentucky.  The state courts rejected the claim, apparently on the ground that since he had once escaped from custody the Commonwealth should not be obligated to incur the risk of another escape by returning him for trial. Petitioner exhausted all available state court opportunities to establish his position that the prior escape did not obviate the Commonwealth’s duty under Smith v. Hooey, supra. Moreover, petitioner made no effort to abort a state proceeding or to disrupt the orderly functioning of state judicial processes.  He comes to federal court, not in an effort to forestall a state prosecution, but to enforce the Commonwealth’s obligation to provide him with a state court forum.  He delayed his application for federal relief until the state courts had conclusively determined that his prosecution was temporarily moribund.  Since petitioner began serving the second' of two 10-year Alabama sentences in March 1972, the revival of the prosecution may be delayed until as late as 1982.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Blackmun, concurring in the result. I concur in the result. The conclusion the Court reaches is not unexpected when one notes the extraordinary expansion of the concept of habeas corpus effected in recent years. See Ex parte Hull, 312 U. S. 546 (1941); Ex parte Endo, 323 U. S. 283 (1944); Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U. S. 236 (1963); Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968); Carajus v. LaVallee, 391 U. S. 234 (1968); Nelson v. George, 399 U. S. 224 (1970). Cf. Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U. S. 487 (1971). A trend of this kind, once begun, easily assumes startling proportions. The present case is but one more step, with the Alabama warden now made the agent of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. I do not go so far as to say that on the facts of this case the result is necessarily wrong. I merely point out that we have come a long way from the traditional notions of the Great Writ. The common-law scholars of the past hardly would recognize what the Court has developed, see 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *131-134, and they would, I suspect, conclude that it is not for the better. The result in this case is not without its irony. The petitioner’s speedy trial claim follows upon his escape from Kentucky custody after that State, at its expense, had returned the petitioner from California to stand trial in Kentucky. Had he not escaped, his Kentucky trial would have taken place five years ago> Furthermore, the petitioner is free to assert his speedy trial claim in the Kentucky courts if and when he is brought to trial there. *502 And the claim, already strong on the facts here, increases in strength as time goes by.
**Dissenting Opinion**
Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with whom The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Powell concur, dissenting.  Today the Court overrules Ahrens v. Clark, 335 U. S. 188 (1948), which construed the legislative intent of Congress in enacting the lineal predecessor of 28 U. S. C, § 2241.  Although considerations of “convenience” may support the result reached in this case, those considerations are, in this context, appropriate for Congress, mot this Court, to make.  Congress has not legislatively overruled Ahrens , and subsequent “developments” are simply irrelevant to the judicial task of ascertaining the legislative intent of Congress in providing, in 1867, that federal district courts may issue writs of habeas corpus “within their respective jurisdictions” for prisoners in the custody of state authorities.  The Court, however, not only accomplishes a feat of judicial prestidigitation but, without discussion or analysis, explicitly extends the scope of Peyton v. Rowe, 391 U. S. 54 (1968), and implicitly rejects Ex parte Royall, <citedDecision>117 U. S. 241</citedDecision> (1886).  I In order to appreciate the full impact of the Court’s decision, a brief reiteration of the procedural stance of the case at the time the petition for habeas corpus was filed is necessary.  Petitioner is incarcerated in Alabama pursuant to a state court judgment, the validity of which petitioner does not attack.  Petitioner had been indicted in Kentucky and a detainer filed by Kentucky authorities with the Alabama authorities.  Kentucky had conducted no proceedings against petitioner; no judgment of conviction on the Kentucky indictment had been obtained.  From Alabama, petitioner requested Kentucky authorities to ask the Alabama authorities to de *503 liver him to Kentucky so that petitioner could be tried on the Kentucky indictment.  No action was taken on this request, and the Kentucky Supreme Court refused to issue a writ of mandamus requiring Kentucky authorities to request that Alabama deliver petitioner for trial in Kentucky.
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Smith v. Hooey did *505 not, however, establish that a right distinct from the right to a speedy trial existed.  It merely held that a State could not totally rely on the fact that it could not order that a prisoner be brought from another jurisdiction as a justification for not attempting to try the defendant as expeditiously as possible.  The right to a speedy trial is, like other constitutional rights, a defense to a criminal charge, but one which, unlike others, increases in terms of potential benefit to the accused with the passage of time.  Barker v. Wingo, 407 U. S. 514 (1972).  The fact that a State must make an effort to obtain a defendant from another sovereign for trial but fails, after demand, to make an effort would weigh heavily in the defendant’s favor.  But Smith v. Hooey does not necessarily imply that federal courts may, as the District Court did in this case, in effect, issue an injunction requiring a state court to conduct a criminal trial. If the State fails to perform its duty, Smith v. Hooey , it must face the consequences of possibly not obtaining a conviction, Barker v. Wingo .  But the fact that the State has a duty by no means leads to the conclusion that the failure to perform that duty can be raised by a prospective defendant on federal habeas corpus in advance of trial. The history of habeas corpus and the principles of federalism strongly support the approach established by Ex parte <citedDecision>Royall, supra,</citedDecision> that, absent extraordinary circumstances, federal habeas corpus should not be used to adjudicate the merits of an affirmative defense to a state criminal charge prior to a judgment of conviction by a state court. The Court’s reasoning for allowing a state prisoner to resort to federal habeas corpus is that the prisoner is attacking the validity of a “future custody.” The Court relies on Peyton to justify federal jurisdiction.  Peyton , however, was in a significantly different procedural posture from the instant case. There, the Court held that a *506 state prisoner could challenge the constitutional validity of a sentence which he had not yet begun to serve when he was currently incarcerated pursuant to a valid conviction and sentence, but the sentence he sought to attack was to run consecutively to the valid sentence.  Even though a person may be “in custody” for purposes of §§ 2241 (c)(3), or 2254, if he has not yet begun to serve a sentence entered after a judgment of conviction, as the Court held in Peyton , it by no means follows that he is similarly “in custody” when no judgment of conviction has been entered or even any trial on the underlying charge conducted.  The Court’s suggestion that a person may challenge by way of federal habeas corpus any custody that might possibly be imposed at some time in the “future,” which suggestion unwarrantedly assumes both that a constitutional defense will be rejected and that the jury will convict, is not supported by the language or reasoning of Peyton .  Mr. Chief Justice Warren, writing for the Court in Peyton , emphasized the role of federal habeas corpus for state prisoners as “substantially a post-conviction device,” 391 U. S., at 60 , and “the instrument for resolving fact issues not adequately developed in the original proceedings.” Id., at 63 .  The Court there stated that the demise of the McNally rule would allow prisoners “the opportunity to challenge defective convictions.” Id., at 65 .  The Court here glosses over the disparate procedural posture of this case, and merely asserts, without analyzing the historical function of federal habeas corpus for state prisoners, that the rationale of Peyton is applicable to a pretrial, preconviction situation.  Citation to that decision cannot obscure the fact that the Court here makes a significant departure from previous decisions, a departure that certainly requires analysis and justification more detailed than that which the Court puts forth.  *507 There is no doubt that a prisoner such as petitioner can assert, by appropriate motion in the courts of the State in which the indictment was handed down, that he should be brought to trial on that charge.  Smith v. Hooey, supra. There is also no doubt that such a prisoner may petition a federal district court for a writ of habeas corpus prior to trial. See 28 U. S. C. § 2241 (c)(3).  What the Court here disregards, however, is almost a century of decisions of this Court to the effect that federal habeas corpus for state prisoners, prior to conviction, should not be granted absent truly extraordinary circumstances.  In Ex parte <citedDecision>Royall, supra,</citedDecision> the petitioner was indicted in state court for selling a bond coupon without a license.  Prior to trial on that indictment, he petitioned in federal court for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that the statute upon which the indictment was predicated violated the contract clause, insofar as it was applied to owners of coupons.  In holding that the (then) Circuit Court had the power to issue the writ but had properly exercised its discretion not to do so, the Court wrote: “That discretion should be exercised in the light of the relations existing, under our system of government, between the judicial tribunals of the Union and of the States, and in recognition of the fact that the public good requires that those relations be not disturbed by unnecessary conflict between courts equally bound to guard and protect rights secured by the Constitution.” <citedDecision>117 U. S., at 251</citedDecision> .  The judicial approach set forth in Ex parte Royall— that federal courts should not, absent extraordinary circumstances, interfere with the judicial administration and process of state courts prior to trial and conviction, even though the state prisoner claims that he is held in violation of the Constitution — has been consistently followed.  Cook v. Hart, 146 U. S. 183 (1892) (custody *508 alleged to violate Art. 4, § 2); New York v. Eno, 155 U. S. 89 (1894) (custody alleged to violate Supremacy Clause); Whitten v. Tomlinson, 160 U. S. 231 (1895) (custody alleged in violation of Constitution due to improper extradition); Drury v. Lewis, 200 U. S. 1 (1906) (custody alleged to violate Supremacy Clause).  Cf. Ex parte Fonda, 117 U. S. 516 (1886); In re Duncan, 139 U. S. 449 (1891); In re Wood, 140 U. S. 278 (1891); In re Frederick, 149 U. S. 70 (1893).  The situations in which pretrial or preconviction federal interference by way of habeas corpus with state criminal processes is justified involve the lack of jurisdiction, under the Supremacy Clause, for the State to bring any criminal charges against the petitioner.  Wildenhus’s Case, 120 U. S. 1 (1887); In re Loney, 134 U. S. 372 (1890); In re Neagle, 135 U. S. 1 (1890).  The effect of today's ruling that federal habeas corpus prior to trial is appropriate because it will determine the validity of custody that may be imposed in actuality only sometime in the indefinite future constitutes an unjustifiable federal interference with the judicial administration of a State’s criminal laws.
