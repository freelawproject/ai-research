1244 . 10 It should also be observed that there has been no suggestion that under the law of Florida, the decree of divorce in question is in any respect invalid or could successfully be subjected to the type of attack permitted by the Massachusetts court. The implicit assumption underlying the position taken by respondent and the Massachusetts court is that this case involves a decree of divorce valid and final in the State which rendered it; and we so assume. 11 11 That the jurisdiction of the Florida court to enter a valid decree of divorce was dependent upon petitioner's domicile in that State is not disputed. 12 This requirement was recognized by the Florida court which rendered the divorce decree, and the principle has been given frequent application in decisions of the State Supreme Court. 13 But whether or not petitioner was domiciled in Florida at the time the divorce was granted was a matter to be resolved by judicial determination. Here, unlike the situation presented in Williams v. North Carolina, 1945, 325 U.S. 226 , 65 S.Ct. 1092 , 89 L.Ed. 1577 , 157 A.L.R. 1366 , the finding of the requisite jurisdictional facts was made in proceedings in which the defendant appeared and participated. The question with which we are confronted, therefore, is whether such a finding made under the circumstances presented by this case may, consistent with the requirements of full faith and credit, be subjected to collateral attack in the courts of a sister State in a suit brought by the defendant in the original proceedings. 12 The question of what effect is to be given to an adjudication by a court that it possesses requisite jurisdiction in a case, where the judgment of that court is subsequently subjected to collateral attack on jurisdictional grounds, has been given frequent consideration by this Court over a period of many years. Insofar as cases originating in the federal courts are concerned, the rule has evolved that the doctrine of res judicata applies to adjudications relating either to jurisdiction of the person or of the subject matter where such adjudications have been made in proceedings in which those questions were in issue and in which the parties were given full opportunity to litigate. 14 The reasons for this doctrine have frequently been stated.

28 It would certainly have been easier if from the beginning the Full Faith and Credit Clause had been construed to mean that the assumption of jurisdiction by the courts of a State would be conclusive, so that every other State would have to respect it. But such certainly has not been the law since 1873. Thompson v. Whitman, 18 Wall. 457 , 21 L.Ed. 897 . Nor was it the law when this Court last considered the divorce problem, in 1945. Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U.S. 226 , 65 S.Ct. 1092 , 89 L.Ed. 1577 , 157 A.L.R. 1366 . A State that is asked to enforce the action of another State may appropriately ascertain whether that other State had power to do what it purported to do. And if the enforcing State has an interest under our Constitution in regard to the subject-matter that is vital and intimate, it should not be within the power of private parties to foreclose that interest by their private arrangement. Andrews v. Andrews, 188 U.S. 14 , 23 S.Ct. 237 , 47 L.Ed.

9 Petitioner testified that for many years prior to her departure for Florida, respondent had made frequent allusions to the fact that petitioner's mother had been committed to a mental institution and had suggested that petitioner was revealing the same traits of mental instability. Petitioner testified that as a result of these remarks and other acts of cruelty, her health had been undermined and that it had therefore become necessary for her to leave respondent. In order to insure her departure, she had represented that her stay in Florida was to be only temporary, but from the outset she had in fact intended not to return. Petitioner testified further that both before and after the Florida decree of divorce had been entered, she had intended to reside permanently in Florida and that she and Phelps had returned to Massachusetts only after receiving a letter stating that Phelps' father was in poor health. 10 1946, 320 Mass. 351 , 69 N.E.2d 801 . 11 See Williams v. North Carolina, 1945, 325 U.S. 226 , 233, 234, 65 S.Ct. 1092 , 1096, 1097, 89 L.Ed. 1577 , 157 A.L.R. 1366 ; cf. Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co., 1939, 308 U.S. 66 , 78, note 26, 60 S.Ct. 44 , 50, 84 L.Ed. 85 . No Florida case has been called to our attention involving a collateral attack on a divorce decree questioning the domicile of the parties, and hence the jurisdiction of the court which entered the decree, where both parties appeae d in the divorce proceedings.

See note 1 supra. 19 Justices Brewer, Shiras, and Peckham dissented. Mr. Justice Holmes took no part in the case. 20 Thus, in the Andrews case, before the divorce decree was entered by the South Dakota court, the defendant withdrew her appearance in accordance with a consent agreement. 21 See note 14 supra. 22 But cf. Williams v. North Carolina, 1945, 325 U.S. 226 , 230, 65 S.Ct. 1092 , 1095. 23 Davis v. Davis, 1938, 305 U.S. 32 , 40, 59 S.Ct. 3 , 6; Williams v.

305 U.S. at page 41, 59 S.Ct. at pages 6, 7. Moreover this Court's citation therein of Andrews v. Andrews, supra, indicates an absence of intention to overrule the holding of that case that opportunity to litigate the issue of domicile does not foreclose inquiry as to the true facts. Andrews v. Andrews has since been cited with respect, as recently as Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287 , 309, 320, n. 7, 63 S.Ct. 207 , 218, 223, 87 L.Ed. 279 , 143 A.L.R. 1273 , and Id., 325 U.S. 226 , 229, 240, 242, 65 S.Ct. 1092 , 1094, 1095, 1100. 2 Compare the English laws providing for a King's Proctor to represent the interests of the Crown in divorce proceedings. Sections 5—7, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1860, 23 & 24 Vict., c. 44; § 1, Matrimonial Causes Act, 1873, 36 & 37 Vict., c. 31; § 181, The Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, 15 § 16 Geo. 5, c. 49, 9 Halsbury's Statutes of England 393, 394. 3 Rev.L. 1835, c. 76: § 39. When any inhabitant of this state shall go into any other state or country, in order to obtain a divorce for any cause which had occurred here, and whilst the parties resided here, or for any cause which would not authorize a divorce by the laws of this state, a divorce so obtained shall be of no force or effect in this state.

16 It is by no means clear that the issue before the Massachusetts courts in either of these cases was or could have been litigated in Florida or Nevada. All that the Florida or Nevada courts could have determined was whether the jurisdictional requisites of State law and of the due process clause of the Constitution, Amend. 14, were met. And if a direct attack on these decrees had been made in this Court, all that we could have decided would have been the due process point. A divorce may satisfy due process requirements, and be valid where rendered, and still lack the jurisdictional requisites for full faith and credit to be mandatory. Compare Williams v. North Carolina, 317 U.S. 287 , 307, 63 S.Ct. 207 , 217 (concurring opinion), with Williams v. North Carolina, 325 U.S. 226 , 65 S.Ct. 1092 . This is true even though the Florida and Nevada courts appear to characterize the jurisdictional prerequisites under their respective laws as domicile, Wade v. Wade, 93 Fla. 1004 , 1007, 113 So. 374 ; Latterner v. Latterner, 51 Nev. 285 , 274 P. 194 ; since we may be unwilling to apply as loose a test of 'domicile,' in determining whether extrastate enforcement is mandatory, as those States might properly choose to use in determining what divorces might be granted and effective within their own borders. Thus, at no point in the proceedings in Florida or Nevada in the instant cases was there an opportunity to litigate whether Mrs. Sherrer or Mr. Coe had acquired Florida or Nevada domicile, respectively, sufficient to entitle their divorces to extraterritorial recognition. 17 North Carolina appears to be the only other State allowing divorce on less than a year's residence, but it does not allow divorce for many of the usual causes. The Williams cases attest that its laws are not lax. 18 The easier it is made for those who through affluence are able to exercise disproportionately large influence on legislation, to obtain migratory divorces, the less likely it is that the divorce laws of their home States will be liberalized, insofar as that is deemed desirable, so as to affect all.
