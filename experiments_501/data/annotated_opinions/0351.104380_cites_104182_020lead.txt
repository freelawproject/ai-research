 If the North Carolina action had been dismissed because it was brought in one North Carolina court rather than in another, of course no federal issue would have been involved.  See, e. g., Woods v. Nierstheimer, 328 U. S. 211 .  Had that been the case, a suit for the same cause of action could have been initiated in a North Carolina federal district court, just as another suit could have been brought in the proper North Carolina State court. But that is not the present situation.  A quite different situation is before us.  Being somewhat unusual, it calls for a critical consideration of the scope and purpose of the doctrine of res judicata.  2.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Carolina would clearly bar this suit had it been brought anew *187 in a state court. For purposes of diversity jurisdiction a federal court is, “in effect, only another court of the State.” Guaranty Trust Co. v. York, <citedDecision>326 U. S. 99, 108</citedDecision> ; see Traction Company v. Mining Company, 196 U. S. 239 , 253; Ex parte Schollenberger, 96 U. S. 369, 377 .  Of course, Bullington could not have succeeded in the District Court for the Western District of North Carolina after an adverse judgment in the State courts, had the decision in this case involved no federal ground.  That is equally true where a federal question was decided in the State courts.  That the adjudication of federal questions by the North Carolina Supreme Court may have been erroneous is immaterial for purposes of res judicata.  Baltimore S. S. Co. v. Phillips, 274 U. S. 316, 325 .  A higher court was available for an authoritative adjudication of the federal questions involved.  And so the question is whether federal rights were necessarily involved and adjudicated in the litigation in the State courts.
