Co., 309 U.S. 624 (1940), in which this Court had heard oral argument and apparently considered the merits prior to concluding that affirmance by an equally divided Court was appropriate. The law of the case doctrine presumes a hearing on the merits. See, e. g., Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 347, n. 18 (1979). This ease does not involve a previous consideration of the merits. Indeed, when this case previously was before us, due to absence of a quorum, we could not consider either the merits or whether to consider those merits through grant of a writ of certiorari. This fact, along with the obvious difficulty of finding other equivalent substitute forums, convinces us that Pink’s statement does not control the outcome here, that the “law of the case” doctrine does not prevent our considering both issues presented, and that we should now proceed to decide them. III The Court of Appeals upheld the judges claim of tax immunity upon the authority of Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920). That ease arose in 1919 when Judge Walter Evans challenged Congress’ authority to include sitting federal judges within the scope of a federal income tax law that the Sixteenth Amendment had authorized a few years earlier. See Revenue Act of 1918, §213, 40 Stat. 1065 (defining “gross income” to include judicial salaries). In Evans itself, the Court held that the Compensation Clause barred application of the tax to Evans, who had been appointed a judge before Congress enacted the tax. 253 U. S., at 264. A few years later, the Court extended Evans, making clear that its rationale covered not only judges appointed before Congress enacted a tax but also judges whose appointments took place after the tax had become law. See Miles v. Graham, 268 U. S. 501, 509 (1925). Fourteen years after deciding Miles, this Court overruled Miles. O’Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277 (1939). But, *567 as the Court of Appeals noted, this Court did not expressly overrule Evans itself. 64 F. 3d, at 650. The Court of Appeals added that, if “changes in judicial doctrine” had significantly undermined Evans’ holding, this “Court itself would have overruled the case.” Ibid. Noting that this case is like Evans (involving judges appointed before enactment of the tax), not like O’Malley (involving judges appointed after enactment of the tax), the Court of Appeals held that Evans controlled the outcome. 64 F. 3d, at 650. Hence application of both Medicare and Social Security taxes to these preenactment judges violated the Compensation Clause. The Court of Appeals was correct in applying Evans to the instant ease, given that “it is this Court’s prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents.” State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U. S. 3,20 (1997); see also Rodriguez de Quijos v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989). Nonetheless, the court below, in effect, has invited us to reconsider Evans. We now overrule Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiseriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before enactment of the tax. The Court’s opinion in Evans began by explaining why the Compensation Clause is constitutionally important, and we begin by reaffirming that explanation. As Evans points out, 253 U. S., at 251-252, the Compensation Clause, along with the Clause securing federal judges appointments “during good Behavior,” U. S. Const., Art. Ill, § 1 — the practical equivalent of life tenure — helps to guarantee what Alexander Hamilton called the “complete independence of the courts of justice.” The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Hamilton thought these guarantees necessary because the Judiciary is “beyond comparison the weakest of the three” branches of Government. Id., at 465-466.

; see also id., No. 48, at 810 (J. Madison) (“[A]s the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of the people, and has . . . full discretion .. . over the pecuniary rewards of those who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in the latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of the former”). Evans properly added that these guarantees of compensation and life tenure exist, “not to benefit the judges,” but “as a limitation imposed in the public interest.” 253 U. S., at 253. They “promote the public weal,” id., at 248, in part by helping to induce “learned” men and women “to quit the lucrative pursuits” of the private sector, 1 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *294, but more importantly by helping to secure an independence of mind and spirit necessary if judges are “to maintain that nice adjustment between individual rights and governmental powers which constitutes political liberty,” W. Wilson, Constitutional Government in the United States 143 (1911). Chief Justice John Marshall pointed out why this protection is important. A judge may have to deeide “between the Government and the man whom that Government is prosecuting: between the most powerful individual in the *569 community, and the poorest and most unpopular.” Proceedings and Debates of the Virginia State Convention, of 1829-1830, p. 616 (1830). A judge’s decision may affect an individual’s “property, his reputation, his life, his all.” Ibid. In the “exercise of these duties,” the judge must “observe the utmost fairness.” Ibid. The judge must be “perfectly and completely independent, with nothing to influence or con-tro[l] him but God and his conscience.” Ibid.

ever inflicted,” Marshall thought, “was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent Judiciary.” Id., at 619. Those who founded the Republic recognized the importance of these constitutional principles. See, e. g., Wilson, Leetures on Law (1791), in 1 Works of James Wilson 363 (J. Andrews ed. 1896) (stating that judges should be “completely independent” in “their salaries, and in their offices”); McKean, Debate in Pennsylvania Ratifying Convention, Dec. 11, 1787, in 2 Debates on the Federal Constitution 539 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (the security of undiminished compensation disposes judges to be “more easy and independent”); see also 1 Kent, supra, at *294 (“[P]ermanent support” and the “tenure of their office” “is well calculated... to give [judges] the requisite independence”). They are no less important today than in earlier times. And the fact that we overrule Evans does not, in our view, diminish their importance. We also agree with Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause offers protections that extend beyond a legislative effort directly to diminish a judge’s pay, say, by ordering a lower salary. 253 U.S., at 254. Otherwise a legislature could circumvent even the most basic Compensation Clause protection by enacting a discriminatory tax law, for example, that precisely but indirectly achieved the forbidden effect. Nonetheless, we disagree with Evans' application of Compensation Clause principles to the matter before it — a non-diseriminatory tax that treated judges the same way it treated other citizens. Evans’ basic holding was that the *570 Compensation Clause forbids such a tax because the Clause forbids “all diminution,” including “taxation,” “whether for one purpose or another.” Id., at 255. The Federal Circuit relied upon this holding. 64 F. 3d, at 650. But, in our view, it is no longer sound law. For one thing, the dissenters in Evans cast the majority’s reasoning into doubt. Justice Holmes, joined by Justice Brandéis, wrote that the Compensation Clause offers “no reason for exonerating” a judge “from the ordinary duties of a citizen, which he shares with all others. To require a man to pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot possibly be made an instrument to attack his independence as a judge.” 253 U. S., at 265. Holmes analogized the “diminution” that a tax might bring about to the burden that a state law might impose upon interstate commerce. If “there was no discrimination against such commerce the tax constituted one of the ordinary burdens of government from which parties were not exempted.” Id., at 267. For another thing, this Court’s subsequent law repudiated Evans’ reasoning. In 1939, 14 years after Miles extended Evans’ tax immunity to judges appointed after enactment of the tax, this Court retreated from that extension. See O’Malley, 307 U.S., at 283 (overruling Miles). And in so doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans dissent. The Court said that the question was whether judges are immune “from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes ... is subjected.” 307 U.S., at 282. Holding that judges are not “immun[e] from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government,” ibid., the Court pointed out that the legal profession had criticized Evans’ contrary conclusion, and that courts outside the United States had resolved similar matters differently, 307 U.S., at 281. And the Court concluded that “a non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not, when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution *571 of his salary within the prohibition of Article III.” Id., at 282. The Court conceded that Miles had reached the opposite conclusion, but it said that Miles “cannot survive.” 307 U. S., at 283. Still later, this Court noted that “[b]ecause Miles relied on Evans v. Gore, O’Malley must also be read to undermine the reasoning of Evans.” United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 227, n. 31 (1980). Finally, and most importantly, we believe that the reasoning of Justices Holmes and Brandéis, and of this Court in O’Malley, is correct. There is no good reason why a judge should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens. We concede that this Court has held that the Legislature cannot directly reduce judicial salaries even as part of an equitable effort to reduce all Government salaries. See 449 U. S., at 226. But a tax law, unlike a law mandating a salary reduction, affects compensation indirectly, not directly. See ibid. (distinguishing between measures that directly and those that indirectly diminish judicial compensation). And those prophylactic considerations that may justify an absolute rule forbidding direct salary reductions are absent here, where indirect taxation is at issue. In practice, the likelihood that a nondiscriminatory tax represents a disguised legislative effort to influence the judicial will is virtually nonexistent. Hence, the potential threats to judicial independence that underlie the Constitution’s compensation guarantee cannot justify a special judicial exemption from a commonly shared tax, not even as a preventive measure to counter those threats. For these reasons, we hold that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax (including an increase in rates or a change in conditions) upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect. Insofar as Evans holds to the contrary, that case, in O’Malley’s words, “cannot survive.” 307 U.S., at 283. *572 The Government points out that the Medicare tax is just such a nondiseriminatory tax. Neither the courts below, nor the federal judges here, argue to the contrary. Hence, insofar as the Court of Appeals found that application of the Medicare tax law to federal judges is unconstitutional, we reverse its decision. IV The Social Security tax is a different matter. Respondents argue that the 1983 law imposing that tax upon then-sitting judges violates the Compensation Clause, for it discriminates against judges in a manner forbidden by the Clause, even as interpreted in O’Malley, not Evans. Cf. O’Malley, supra, at 282 (stating question as whether judges are immune "from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes ... is subjected” (emphasis added)). After examining the statute’s details, we agree with the judges that it does discriminate in a manner that the Clause forbids. Four features of the law, taken together, lead us to this conclusion. First, federal employees had remained outside the Social Security system for nearly 50 years prior to the passage of the 1983 law. Congress enacted the law pursuant to the Social Security Commission’s recommendation to bring those employees within the law.

Justice Scalia, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with the Court that extending the Social Security tax to sitting Article III judges in 1984 violated Article Ill’s Compensation Clause. I part paths with the Court on the issue of extending the Medicare tax to federal judges in 1983, which I think was also unconstitutional. 1 *582 I As an initial matter, I think the Court is right in concluding that Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920) — holding that new taxes of general applicability cannot be applied to sitting Article III judges — is no longer good law, and should be overruled. We went out of our way in O’Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277, 280-281 (1939), to catalog criticism of Evans, and subsequently recognized, in United States v.

II My disagreement with the Court arises from its focus upon the issue of discrimination, which turns out to be dispositive with respect to the Medicare tax. The Court holds “that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax . . . upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect.” Ante, at 571.

1961); see also Will, supra, at 227 (the Constitution “placed faith in the integrity and sound judgment of the elected representatives to enact increases” in judicial sala *584 ries to account for inflation). Since Hamilton thought that the Compensation Clause “put it out of the power of [Congress] to change the condition of the individual [judge] for the worse,” The Federalist No. 79, at 473, he obviously believed that inflation does not diminish compensation as that term is used in the Constitution. This distinction between Government action affecting compensation and Government action affecting the value of compensation was the basis for our statement in O’Malley, supra, at 282, that “[t]o subject [judges] to a general tax is merely to recognize that judges are also citizens, and that their particular function in government does not generate an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government . . . .” I agree with the Court, therefore, that Evans was wrongly decided — not, however, because in Evans there was no discrimination, but because in Evans the universal application of the tax demonstrated that the Government was not reducing the compensation of its judges but was acting as sovereign rather than employer, imposing a general tax. But just as it is clear that a federal employee’s sharing of a tax-free status that all citizens enjoy is not compensation (and elimination of that tax-free status not a reduction in compensation), so also it is clear that a tax-free status conditioned on federal employment is compensation, and its elimination a reduction. The Court apparently acknowledges that if a tax is imposed on the basis of federal employment (an income tax, for example, payable only by federal judges) it would constitute a reduction in compensation. It is impossible to understand why a tax that is suspended on the basis of federal employment (an exemption from federal income tax for federal judges) does not constitute the conferral of compensation — in which case its elimination is a reduction, whether or not federal judges end up being taxed just like other citizens. Only converting the Compensation *585 Clause into a Discrimination Clause can explain a contrary conclusion. And this, of course, is what has been achieved by the targeted extension of the Medicare tax to federal employees who were previously exempt. It may well be that, in some abstract sense, they are not being '“discriminated against,” since they end up being taxed like other citizens; but this does not alter the fact that, since exemption from the tax was part of their employment package — since they had an employment expectation of a preferential exemption from taxation — their compensation was being reduced.

See Miles v. Graham, 268 U.S. 501 , 509 (1925). Fourteen years after deciding Miles, this Court overruled Miles. O'Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U.S. 277 (1939). But, *567 as the Court of Appeals noted, this Court did not expressly overrule Evans itself. 64 F.3d , at 650 .

Noting that this case is like Evans (involving judges appointed before enactment of the tax), not like O'Malley (involving judges appointed after enactment of the tax), the Court of Appeals held that Evans controlled the outcome. 64 F.3d , at 650 . Hence application of both Medicare and Social Security taxes to these pre enactment judges violated the Compensation Clause. The Court of Appeals was correct in applying Evans to the instant case, given that "it is this Court's prerogative alone to overrule one of its precedents." State Oil Co. v. Khan, 522 U.S. 3 , 20 (1997); see also Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477 , 484 (1989). Nonetheless, the court below, in effect, has invited us to reconsider Evans.

The Court's opinion in Evans began by explaining why the Compensation Clause is constitutionally important, and we begin by reaffirming that explanation. As Evans points out, 253 U.S. , at 251-252 , the Compensation Clause, along with the Clause securing federal judges appointments "during good Behavior," U. S. Const., Art. III, § 1the practical equivalent of life tenurehelps to guarantee what Alexander Hamilton called the "complete independence of the courts of justice." The Federalist No. 78, p. 466 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961). Hamilton thought these guarantees necessary because the Judiciary is "beyond comparison the weakest of the three" branches of Government.

They are no less important today than in earlier times. And the fact that we overrule Evans does not, in our view, diminish their importance. We also agree with Evans insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause offers protections that extend beyond a legislative effort directly to diminish a judge's pay, say, by ordering a lower salary. 253 U.S. , at 254 . Otherwise a legislature could circumvent even the most basic Compensation Clause protection by enacting a discriminatory tax law, for example, that precisely but indirectly achieved the forbidden effect. Nonetheless, we disagree with Evans ` application of Compensation Clause principles to the matter before ita nondiscriminatory tax that treated judges the same way it treated other citizens. Evans' basic holding was that the *570 Compensation Clause forbids such a tax because the Clause forbids "all diminution," including "taxation," "whether for one purpose or another." Id., at 255. The Federal Circuit relied upon this holding. 64 F.3d , at 650 . But, in our view, it is no longer sound law. For one thing, the dissenters in Evans cast the majority's reasoning into doubt. Justice Holmes, joined by Justice Brandeis, wrote that the Compensation Clause offers "no reason for exonerating" a judge "from the ordinary duties of a citizen, which he shares with all others. To require a man to pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot possibly be made an instrument to attack his independence as a judge." 253 U.S. , at 265 . Holmes analogized the "diminution" that a tax might bring about to the burden that a state law might impose upon interstate commerce. If "there was no discrimination against such commerce the tax constituted one of the ordinary burdens of government from which parties were not exempted." Id., at 267. For another thing, this Court's subsequent law repudiated Evans' reasoning. In 1939, 14 years after Miles extended Evans ` tax immunity to judges appointed after enactment of the tax, this Court retreated from that extension. See O'Malley, 307 U. S., at 283 (overruling Miles ). And in so doing the Court, in an opinion announced by Justice Frankfurter, adopted the reasoning of the Evans dissent. The Court said that the question was whether judges are immune "from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes . . . is subjected." 307 U.S. , at 282 . Holding that judges are not "immun[e] from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government," ibid., the Court pointed out that the legal profession had criticized Evans ` contrary conclusion, and that courts outside the United States had resolved similar matters differently, 307 U.S. , at 281 . And the Court concluded that "a non-discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not, when applied to the income of a federal judge, a diminution *571 of his salary within the prohibition of Article III." Id., at 282. The Court conceded that Miles had reached the opposite conclusion, but it said that Miles "cannot survive." 307 U.S. , at 283 . Still later, this Court noted that "[b]ecause Miles relied on Evans v. Gore , O'Malley must also be read to undermine the reasoning of Evans. " United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200 , 227, n. 31 (1980). Finally, and most importantly, we believe that the reasoning of Justices Holmes and Brandeis, and of this Court in O'Malley, is correct. There is no good reason why a judge should not share the tax burdens borne by all citizens. We concede that this Court has held that the Legislature cannot directly reduce judicial salaries even as part of an equitable effort to reduce all Government salaries. See 449 U.S. , at 226 . But a tax law, unlike a law mandating a salary reduction, affects compensation indirectly, not directly. See ibid. (distinguishing between measures that directly and those that indirectly diminish judicial compensation). And those prophylactic considerations that may justify an absolute rule forbidding direct salary reductions are absent here, where indirect taxation is at issue. In practice, the likelihood that a nondiscriminatory tax represents a disguised legislative effort to influence the judicial will is virtually nonexistent. Hence, the potential threats to judicial independence that underlie the Constitution's compensation guarantee cannot justify a special judicial exemption from a commonly shared tax, not even as a preventive measure to counter those threats. For these reasons, we hold that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax (including an increase in rates or a change in conditions) upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect. Insofar as Evans holds to the contrary, that case, in O'Malley `s words, "cannot survive." 307 U.S. , at 283 . *572 The Government points out that the Medicare tax is just such a nondiscriminatory tax. Neither the courts below, nor the federal judges here, argue to the contrary. Hence, insofar as the Court of Appeals found that application of the Medicare tax law to federal judges is unconstitutional, we reverse its decision. IV The Social Security tax is a different matter. Respondents argue that the 1983 law imposing that tax upon thensitting judges violates the Compensation Clause, for it discriminates against judges in a manner forbidden by the Clause, even as interpreted in O'Malley, not Evans. Cf. O'Malley, supra, at 282 (stating question as whether judges are immune "from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes . . . is subjected" (emphasis added)). After examining the statute's details, we agree with the judges that it does discriminate in a manner that the Clause forbids.

Will, 449 U.S. 200 , 227, and n. 31 (1980), that O'Malley had "undermine[d] the reasoning of Evans. " The Court's decision today simply recognizes what should be obvious: that Evans has not only been undermined, but has in fact collapsed. II My disagreement with the Court arises from its focus upon the issue of discrimination, which turns out to be dispositive with respect to the Medicare tax. The Court holds "that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax . . . upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect." Ante, at 571.
**Combined Opinion**
Since Hamilton thought that the Compensation Clause "put it out of the power of [Congress] to change the condition of the individual [judge] for the worse," The Federalist No. 79, at 473, he obviously believed that inflation does not diminish compensation as that term is used in the Constitution. This distinction between Government action affecting compensation and Government action affecting the value of compensation was the basis for our statement in O'Malley, supra, at 282, that "[t]o subject [judges] to a general tax is merely to recognize that judges are also citizens, and that their particular function in government does not generate an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government . . . ." I agree with the Court, therefore, that Evans was wrongly decidednot, however, because in Evans there was no discrimination, but because in Evans the universal application of the tax demonstrated that the Government was not reducing the compensation of its judges but was acting as sovereign rather than employer, imposing a general tax. But just as it is clear that a federal employee's sharing of a tax-free status that all citizens enjoy is not compensation (and elimination of that tax-free status not a reduction in compensation), so also it is clear that a tax-free status conditioned on federal employment is compensation, and its elimination a reduction. The Court apparently acknowledges that if a tax is imposed on the basis of federal employment (an income tax, for example, payable only by federal judges) it would constitute a reduction in compensation. It is impossible to understand why a tax that is suspended on the basis of federal employment (an exemption from federal income tax for federal judges) does not constitute the conferral of compensationin which case its elimination is a reduction, whether or not federal judges end up being taxed just like other citizens. Only converting the Compensation *585 Clause into a Discrimination Clause can explain a contrary conclusion. And this, of course, is what has been achieved by the targeted extension of the Medicare tax to federal employees who were previously exempt. It may well be that, in some abstract sense, they are not being "discriminated against," since they end up being taxed like other citizens; but this does not alter the fact that, since exemption from the tax was part of their employment packagesince they had an employment expectation of a preferential exemption from taxationtheir compensation was being reduced.

II, § 1, cl. 7, cannot, consistent with the Constitution, have their compensation diminished. If this case involved salary cuts to pay for Social Security, rather than taxes to pay for Social Security, the irrelevance of whether other federal employees were covered by the operative legislation would be clear. * * * I join in the judgment that extension of the Social Security tax to sitting Article III judges was unconstitutional. I would affirm the Federal Circuit's holding that extension of the Medicare tax was unconstitutional as well. Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part. I believe this Court was correct in Evans v. Gore, 253 U.S. 245 (1920), when it held that any tax that reduces a judge's *587 net compensation violates Article III of the Constitution. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in its entirety. NOTES [*] Briefs of amici curiae urging affirmance were filed for the Federal Judges Association by Kevin M. Forde and Richard J. Prendergast; and for the Los Angeles County Bar Association et al. by Mark E. Haddad, Catherine V. Barrad, Paul J. Watford, Richard Walch, Evan A. Davis, Amitai Schwartz, Steven F. Pflaum, Richard William Austin, Barbara J. Collins, Dennis F. Kerrigan, Jr., P. Kevin Castel, Herbert H. Franks, Dennis A. Rendelman, and John J. Kenney. [1] I agree with the Court, see Part II, ante, that the law-of-the-case doctrine does not bar our consideration of the merits. I also join the Court in holding, see Part V, ante, that any constitutional violation was not remedied by subsequent salary increases. [2] As the Court explains, the purpose of the Medicare tax extension was to ensure that federal workers "bear a more equitable share of the costs of financing the benefits to which many of them eventually became entitled" by reason of their own or their spouses' private-sector employment.
