**Combined Opinion**
*785 Mr. Justice Reed delivered the opinion of the Court. .  This case, like Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines, 328 U. S. 707 , and Caldarola v. Eckert, <citedDecision>332 U. S. 155</citedDecision> , presents questions concerning the liability for injury to third persons of a general- agent who, under the terms of the wartime standard form of agency agreement, GAA 4-4-42, 1 manages certain phases of the business of ships owned by the United States and operated by the War Shipping Administration.  More specifically the issue raised by these facts is whether such a general agent is liable under § 33 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, known as the Jones Act, 2 to a member of the crew who suffered physical injury through the negligence of the master and officers of such a vessel, when the injury occurred after March 24, 1943, the date of enactment of the War Shipping Administration (Clarification) Act.  3 Respondent was procured from the union hiring hall by petitioner in accordance with the terms of the standard agreement 4 and made available to the master for employment by him.  The master is designated by the contract as an agent and employee of the United States.  In July of 1945 respondent was signed on the S. S. Edward B. Haines at New York by the master of that vessel as second assistant engineer.  In the space on the shipping articles entitled “Operating Company on this Voyage” there was written “Cosmopolitan Shipping Co., Inc., as general agent for the United States.” The articles were *786 stamped at the top as follows: “You Are Being Employed By the United States.” 5 In November, 1945, when The Haines was on voyage and either in port or off the coast of China, respondent contracted poliomyelitis.  At that time the master exercised “full control, responsibility and authority with respect to the navigation and management of the vessel” as provided in § 3A (d) of the contract.

 The answer denied these allegations.  The jury found a verdict for respondent for $100,000.  On appeal the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.  McAllister v. Cosmopolitan Shipping Co., 169 F. 2d 4 .  While recognizing, that Cosmopolitan was “a shipping company which contracted with the.  War Shipping Administration to attend to the accounting' ^nd certain other shoreside .  usiness of The Haines- ... in accordance with the standard form of General- Agency Service Agreement,” id. at p. 5, the court felt itself bound by the decision of this Court in Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines, supra. It relied upon the fact that we expressly distinguished the Hust *787 ease in <citedDecision>Caldarola</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Eckert, supra.</citedDecision> The Court of Appeals reached this conclusion despite the fact that the injury to Hust occurred prior to the' Clarification Act, and the injury here occurred subsequent to that act.  In its view the Hust case held, as a matter of law, that before the Clarification Act a seaman under the Jones Act could recover for a tort against a service agreement general agent, as an employer.  The court did not perceive how the Clarification Act changed this liability.  169 F.. 2d 4,8.  I.  We are impelled to the conclusion that the Clarification Act affords no basis for distinguishing the present case from the Hust case and that the reasoning in the later <citedDecision>Caldarola</citedDecision> case, which we accept as sound, calls for the rejection of the basis of the Hust case. The Hust case went on the theory that the general agents for the United States under the same standard service agreement were employers of the injured seaman, Hust, for the purposes of liability under the Jones Act.  6 The general agent was found to be liable to the seaman by two steps of reasoning: first, that the overruling of Fleet Corporation v. Lustgarten, 280 U. S. 320 , by Brady v. Roosevelt S. S. Co., 317 U. S. 575 , gave a seaman a right tó sue undér the Jones Act such general agents as were employed under Contracts like Moore-McCormack’s for torts committed against seamen by masters and crew, 328 U. S. 716 -722; second, that although “technically the agree *788 ment made Hust an employee of the United States,” p. 723, the “rules of private agency,” p. 724, should not be applied to take away “protections” from seamen.  See 332 U. S. 165 -166 7 This second step was said to find support in the election given to seamen by § 1 of the Clarification Act to proceed under the new Act for claims arising after October 1,1941, and before the enactment of the Clarification Act, March 24, 1943.  328 U. S. at 725 , et seq. 8 *789 As to the first conclusion, we think it arises from a misconception of the ruling of the Brady case. The Brady case decided no more, directly or by implication, than that an action could be maintained against agents of the United States at common law for the agents’ own torts.  The case did not involve the right to recover against employers under the Jones Act.  Brady was a customs inspector suing for injuries sustained when a ship’s ladder broke.  The opinion said, 317 U. S. at 577 , “The sole question here is whether the Suits in Admiralty Act makes private operators such as respondent nonsuable for their torts.” 9 Cf. <citedDecision>Caldarola</citedDecision> v. Eckert, <citedDecision>332 U. S. at 159-160</citedDecision> .  As to the second conclusion, we are unable to perceive in the statutes relating to sailors’ rights or the history *790 behind their enactment any legislative purpose to create in seamen employees of the United States through the War Shipping Administration a right to enforce tort claims under the Jones Act against others than their employers or any recognition that such right ever existed.  The Jones Act was welfare legislation that created new rights in seamen for damages arising from maritime torts.  As welfare legislation, this statute is entitled to a liberal construction to accomplish its beneficent purposes.  Compare Aguilar v. Standard Oil Co., 318 U. S. 724 ; American Stevedores v. Porello, 330 U. S. 446 .  In considering similar legislation in other fields, we have concluded that Congress intended that the purposes of such enactments should not be restricted by common-law concepts of control so as to bar from welfare legislation as independent contractors persons who were as a matter of economic reality a part of the processes and dependent upon the businesses to which they rendered service.  10 The issue in this case is whether a construction- of the Jones Act carrying out the 'intention of Congress to grant those nety rights to seamen against their employers requires or permits a holding that the general agent under the contract here in question is an employer undér the Jones Act.

 This was specifically declared in H. R. Rep. No. 107, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 21: “The various rights and remedies under statute and general maritime law with respect to death, injury, illness, and other casualty to seamen, have been rather fully set forth hereinabove.  Under clause 2 of section 1 (a) these substantive rights would be governed by existing law relating to privately employed seamen.  The only modification thereof arises from the remedial provision that they shall be enforced in accordance with the provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act.  This procedure is appropriate in view of the fact that the suits will be against the Government of the United States.  In such a suit ño provision is made for a jury trial as may otherwise be had in a proceeding such as one under the Jones Act for reasons set forth in the letter of the Attorney General (September 14, 1942).” See S. Rep. No. 62, 78th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 11-12; S. Rep. No. 1813, 77th.  Cong., 2d Sess., p. 6; Hearings before the Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fish *793 eries, House of Representatives, 77th Cong., 2d Sess., on H. R. 7424, p. 33.  The <citedDecision>Caldarola</citedDecision> case, <citedDecision>332 U. S. 155</citedDecision> , undermined the foundations of Hust .  See the dissent therein at pp. 161— 163.  <citedDecision>Caldarola</citedDecision> held that the general agents under the standard form contract were not in possession and control of the vessel so as to make them liable under New York law to an invitee for injuries arising from negligence in its maintenance.  Pp. 158-59.  Our ruling was based on “the interpretation of that contract” as “a matter of federal concern.” We do not think it consistent to hold that the general agent has enough “possession and control” to be an employer under the Jones Act but not enough to be responsible for maintenance under New York law. It is true, as respondent argues, that <citedDecision>Caldarola</citedDecision> dealt only with the general agent’s liability to a stevedore, as opposed to a crew member, under the law of New York. We think, however, that vicarious liability to anyone must be predicated on the relation which exists under the standard form agreement and the shipping articlés between the general agent on the one hand and the master and crew of the vessel on the other.  <citedDecision>Caldarola</citedDecision> held that this relation was not one which involved that proximity necessary to a finding of liability in the general agent for the torts of the master and crew.  We perceive no reason why the rationale of this holding does not apply with equal force to a suit under the Jones Act.  Under common-law principles of agency such a conclusion is required.  We think it equally compelled even if we are to adopt, as the Court in Rust suggested, the perhaps less technical and more substantial tests propounded in Labor Board v. Hearst Publications, 322 U. S. 111 .  Hust was decided June 10, 1946; <citedDecision>Caldarola</citedDecision> June 23, 1947.  Certainly from the latter date, the danger of relying on Hust was apparent to the world though it must be admitted there was enough uncertainty in the law *794 properly to give concern to Congress.  14 Notwithstanding there may be somb undesirable results in overruling Hust , such as loss of rights under the Suits in Admiralty Act by reliance on Hust , we think that in view of <citedDecision>Caldarola</citedDecision> , the uncertainty as to remedies that the two decisions generate, and the desirability of clarifying the position of the United States as an employer through the War Shipping Administration, that case should be and is overruled.  n. A re-examination of the present standard'service agreement will make clear the conclusion set out in Part I of this opinion., 46 C. F. R. Cum. Supp. § 306.44 et seq. *795 The solution of the problem of determining the employer under such a contract depends upon determining whose enterprise the operation of the vessel was.  Such words as employer, agent, independent contractor are not decisive.  No single phrase can be said to determine the employer.  One must look at the venture as a whole.  Whose orders controlled the master and the crew?  Whose money paid their wages?

A contract such as this does not give “exclusive possession, command, and navigation of the vessel,” Reed v. United States, 11 Wall. 591, 600 , and therefore fails to give the operator an owner’s power.  Leary v. United States, 14 Wall. 607, 611 ; United States v. Shea, 152 U.

Such seamen, because of the temporary wartime character of their employment by the War Shipping Administration, shall not be considered as officers or employees of the United States for the purposes of the United States Employees Compensation Act, as amended; the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended; the Act of Congress approved March 7, 1942 (Public Law 490, Seventy-seventh Congress); or-the Act entitled ‘An Act to provide benefits for the injury, disability, death, or detention of employees of contractors with the United States and certain other persons or reimbursement therefor’, approved December *789 2, 1942 (Public Law 784, Seventy-seventh Congress).  Claims arising under clause (1) hereof shall be enforced in the same manner as such claims would be enforced if the seaman were employed on a privately owned and operated American vessel.  Any claim referred to in clause (2) or (3) hereof shall, if administratively disallowed in whole or in part, be enforced pursuant to the provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act, notwithstanding the vessel on which the seaman is employed is not a merchant vessel within the meaning of such Act.

A. seamen against the United States for torts, there has been an effort to do so. H. R. 4873, 80th Cong., 2d Sess., sought to do so by amending the Suits in Admiralty Act, § 5, 41 Stat. 525 , 526, so as to make the remedy in admiralty of that act exclusive as to the same subject matter so as to protect the general agent from suits such as Hust or <citedDecision>Caldarola</citedDecision> .  The bill was passed by the House June 8, 1948, 94 Cong. Rec. 7388-89, but was not passed by the Senate.  H. R. 483 and 4051 of the 81st Cong., 1st Sess., to the same effect, are.now pending.  In H.

Eckert ( <citedDecision>332 U. S. 155</citedDecision> ), which claifified, in the opinion of the committee, the rule previously announced so as to makd it plain that the agent while liable for the negligence of its own employees was not liable for the negligence of the civil-service masters and crews with whom the United States manned the vessels.  For the negligence of those, the United States was the only responsible party.  The committee believes that litigants should, not be made the victims of the legal confusion regarding the proper remedy ill such cases, and are not responsible for the conditions brought about by the lack of clarity in tt s opinions of the Supreme Court. Legislative relief is requisite not mly to save to litigants possessing meritorious claims their right to 2 day in court, but also to settle the question of remedy in future cas'/s.” 15 Executive Order 9054 of February 7, 1942, issued under the First War Powers Act of December 18, 1941, 55 Stat. 838 .  3 C.
