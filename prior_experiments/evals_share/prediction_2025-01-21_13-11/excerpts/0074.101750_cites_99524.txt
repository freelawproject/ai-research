Case of interest: Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission (1920)
-----------------------
 with the pipes on the consumers' premises. So segregated the gas in such service lines and pipes remains in readiness or moves forward to serve as needed. The treatment and division of the large compressed volume of gas is like the breaking of an original package, after shipment in interstate commerce, in order that its contents may be treated, prepared for sale and sold at retail. State v. Flannelly, 96 Kan. 372, 383-384; 152 P. 22; W. Va. & Md. Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm., 134 Md. 137, 143-145; 106 A. 265. Cf. Atlantic Coast Line v. Standard Oil Co., 275 U.S. 257, 269. Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419. Leisy v. Hardin, 135 U.S. 100.

Appellant relies on Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., <caseOfInterest>252 U.S. 23</caseOfInterest>. There the question was whether the New York commission had jurisdiction to prescribe the rates to be charged local consumers of gas transported to that State from Pennsylvania. This court, following the findings of the highest court of New York (225 N.Y. 397, 403-404; 122 N.E. 260), held that the entire movement of the gas was interstate commerce and that, in the absence of contrary regulation by the Congress, the state commission had jurisdiction to prescribe such rates. The theory on which that conclusion was reached is not wholly consistent with the views expressed in Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon, supra, and in Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co., supra. In the former the court *472 said (p. 245): "Interstate movement [of natural gas being transported from State to State] ended when the gas passed into local mains." In the latter, it was said (p. 308): "With the delivery of the gas [transported from one State to another] to the distributing companies . . . the interstate movement ends.
