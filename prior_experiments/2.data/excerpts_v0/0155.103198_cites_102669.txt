Passage 1:
atistical and other information.
The case presents no debatable question as to the jurisdiction of the district court. A statement of the facts alleged conclusively shows that in purpose, terms and effect the final order constitutes not mere determination or declaration but affirmative commands. There is no occasion to review earlier decisions dealing with affirmative and negative administrative orders and obviously *148 none to overrule any of them or to repudiate or impair the doctrine they establish.[*] The Court's discussion, extraneous to the issue involved, confuses rather than clarifies.
The findings of the district court are amply sustained by the evidence, and its decree should be affirmed.
MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS concurs in this opinion.
NOTES
[1]  On November 13, 1935, the order was amended in matters not here relevant.
[2]  The hearing before the examiner lasted two days; 221 pages of testimony were taken and 34 exhibits were introduced.
[3]  Under United States v. Corrick, <targetCase>298 U.S. 435</targetCase>, 440, and United States v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 226, 229, the doctrine of "negative orders" implies a jurisdictional defect which courts must consider sua sponte.
[4]  All except one of the prior decisions of this Court on the "negative order" doctrine involved review of action by the Interstate Commerce Commission. United States v. Corrick, supra, note 3, involved review of action by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act.
[5]  United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., 244 U.S. 82. Compare Federal Power Comm'n v. Metropolitan Edison Co., 304 U.S. 375.
[6]  Delaware & Hudson Co. v. United States, 266 U.S. 438.
[7]  United States v. Los Angeles & S.L.R. Co., 273 U.S. 299.
[8]  Shannahan v. United States, 303 U.S. 596; compare Shields v. Utah Idaho Central R. Co., 305 U.S. 177, 182-184.
[9]  Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409, is the symbol for considerations which limit the constitutional power of the federal courts, though that case itself never reached adjudication.
Passage 2:
st the equivalent of a threat of prosecution under the statute, and, in fact, considerable weight is given to administrative practice in ascertaining the meaning of such legislation. Compare United States v. Village of Hubbard, 266 U.S. 474.
[12]  The initial decision in this group of cases, the Intermountain Rate Cases, 234 U.S. 476, held reviewable the action of the Commission in refusing to grant requested consent to depart from the long-short haul clause. (ยง 4 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as amended.) While this case would seem to control the Lehigh Valley case and at least to be persuasive in the Piedmont & Northern case, it was not mentioned in them. After these two cases, subsequent decisions in this group indicated that the "negative order" doctrine might prevent review of the refusal by the Secretary of Agriculture to accept rates for filing, the Packers and Stockyards Act prohibiting the charging of rates except those on file with the Secretary, United States v. Corrick, <targetCase>298 U.S. 435</targetCase>, and of the refusal to grant an increase in rates of compensation for carrying of mail, the Railway Mail Pay Act of 1916 requiring the carrier to carry the mail at the rate set, United States v. Griffin, 303 U.S. 226. But in both these decisions the result reached was supported by factors irrelevant to the present discussion. On the other hand, in Powell v. United States, 300 U.S. 276, action of the Commission, striking from its files a tariff on the ground that a point was not served by the carrier, was held subject to review as a command to the railway which had filed the tariff not to give the service covered by the tariff.
