 And a Congress that includes the State not only within its substantive regulatory rules but also (expressly) within a related system of private remedies likely believes that a remedial exemption would similarly threaten that program.  See Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd. v. Co liege Savings Bank, ante, at 656-657 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  It thereby avoids an enforcement gap which, when allied with the pressures of a competitive marketplace, could place the State’s regulated private competitors at a significant disadvantage.  These considerations make Congress’ need to possess the power to condition entry into the market upon a waiver of sovereign immunity (as “necessary and proper” to the exercise of its commerce power) unusually strong, for to deny Congress that power would deny Congress the power effectively to regulate private conduct.  Cf. California v. Taylor, 353 U. S. 553, 566 (1957).  At the same time they make a State’s need to exercise sovereign immunity unusually weak, for the State is unlikely to have to supply what private firms already supply, nor may it fairly demand special treatment, even to protect the public purse, when it does so. Neither can one easily imagine what the Constitution’s Founders would have thought about the assertion of sovereign immunity in this special context.  These considerations, differing in kind or degree from those that would support a general *696 congressional “abrogation” power, indicate that Pardens holding is sound, irrespective of this Court’s decisions in Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, <citedDecision>517 U. S. 44</citedDecision> (1996), and Alden v. Maine, post, p. 706.  Neither did Parden break “sharply.  with prior cases.” Parden itself cited authority that found related “waivers” in at least roughly comparable circumstances.  United States v. California, 297 U. S. 175 (1936), for example, held that a State, “by engaging in interstate commerce by rail, has subjected itself to the commerce power,” id., at 185 , which amounted to a waiver of a (different though related) substantive immunity.  See also Taylor, supra, at 568 .  Parden also relied on authority holding that States seeking necessary congressional approval for an interstate compact had, “by venturing into the [federal] realm 'assume[d] the [waiver of sovereign immunity] conditions .  .

 411 U. S., at 296-297 (Marshall, J., concurring in result).  The remaining cases the majority mentions offer it no greater support.  One said, “We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.” Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 488 U. S. 468 , 475 (1987).  Two others also considered legislative clarity, not power.  Atascadero State Hospital, supra, at 247 (Rehabilitation Act “falls far short” of clearly indicating a waiver by a State accepting funds under the Act); Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 674 (1974) (same for Social Security Act).  Even Seminole Tribe carefully avoided calling Par-den into question.  While specifying that Congress cannot, in the exercise of its Article I powers, “abrogate unilaterally the States’ immunity from suit,” <citedDecision>517 U. S., at 59</citedDecision> , it left open the scope of the term “unilaterally” by referring to Parden , without criticism, as standing for the “unremarkable, and completely unrelated, proposition that the States may waive their sovereign immunity,” <citedDecision>517 U. S., at 65</citedDecision> .  In short, except for those in today’s majority, no member of this Court had ever questioned the holding of Parden that the Court today discards because it cannot find “merit in attempting to salvage any remnant of it.” Ante, at 680.  *699 Parden had never been questioned because, Seminole Tribe or not, it still makes sense.  The line the Court today rejects has been drawn by this Court to place States outside the ordinary dormant Commerce Clause rules when they act as “market participants.” White v. Massachusetts Council of Constr. Employers, Inc., 460 U. S. 204, 206-208 (1988); Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U. S. 429, 434-439 (1980); Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap Corp., 426 U. S. 794, 804-810 (1976).  And Congress has drawn this same line in the related context of foreign state sovereign immunity.  28 U. S. C. § 1605 (a)(2).  In doing so, Congress followed the modern trend, which “spread rapidly after the Second World War,” regarding foreign state sovereign immunity.

 A/41/498, Aug. 26, 1986) (when a State engages in a commercial contract with a foreign person, “the State is considered to have consented to the exercise” of foreign jurisdiction in a proceeding arising out of that contract).  Indeed, given the widely accepted view among modern nations that when a State engages in ordinary commercial activity sovereign immunity has no significant role to play, it is today’s holding, not Parden , that creates the legal “anomaly.” II I resist all the more strongly the Courts extension of Seminole Tribe in this case because, although I accept this Court’s -pre-Seminole Tribe sovereign immunity decisions, I am not yet ready to adhere to the proposition of law set forth in Seminole Tribe.  Cf. EEOC v. Wyoming, 460 U. S. 226, 249-250 (1988) (Stevens, J., concurring).  In my view, Congress does possess the authority to abrogate a State’s sover *700 eign immunity where "necessary and proper” to the exercise of an Article I power.  My reasons include those that Justices Stevens and Souter already have described in detail.  (1) Neither constitutional text nor the surrounding debates support Seminole Tribe's view that Congress lacks the Article I power to abrogate a State’s sovereign immunity in federal-question cases (unlike diversity eases).  Seminole Tribe, <citedDecision>517 U. S., at 82-88</citedDecision> , and nn. 8, 9 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>id., at 142-150</citedDecision> (Souter, J., dissenting); ef.  the majority’s characterization of this argument, ante, at 687-688.  (2) The precedents that offer important legal support for the doctrine of sovereign immunity do not help the Seminole Tribe majority.  They all focus upon a critically different question, namely, whether courts, acting without legislative support, can abrogate state sovereign immunity, not whether Congress, acting legislatively, can do so. See Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934); Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890); Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 429 (1793) (Iredell, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>Seminole Tribe, supra, at 119</citedDecision> (Souter, J., dissenting) (“Because no federal legislation purporting to pierce state immunity was at issue, it cannot fairly be said that Hans held state sovereign immunity to have attained some constitutional status immunizing it from abrogation”).  (3) Sovereign immunity is a common-law doctrine.  The new American Nation received common-law doctrines selectively, accepting some, abandoning others, and frequently modifying those it accepted in light of the new Nation’s special needs and circumstances.  <citedDecision>Seminole Tribe, supra, at 130-142</citedDecision> (Souter, J., dissenting).  The new Nation’s federalist lodestar, dual sovereignty (of State and Nation), demanded modification of the traditional single-sovereign immunity doctrine, thereby permitting Congress to narrow or abolish state sovereign immunity where necessary.  *701 (a) Dual sovereignty undercuts the doctrine’s traditional “logical and practical” justification, namely (in the words of Justice Holmes), that “there can be no legal right as against the authority that makes the law on which the right depends.” Kawananakoa v. Polyblank, 205 U.S. 349, 353 (1907).  When a State is sued for violating federal law, the “authority” that would assert the immunity, the State, is not the “authority” that made the (federal) law. This point remains true even if the Court treats sovereign immunity as a principle of natural law. Alden v. Maine, post, at 762-764 (Souter, J., dissenting).  (b) Dual sovereignty, by granting Congress the power to create substantive rights that bind States (despite their sovereignty) must grant Congress the subsidiary power to create related private remedies that bind States (despite their sovereignty).  (c) Dual sovereignty means that Congress may need that lesser power lest States (if they are not subject to federal remedies) ignore the substantive federal law that binds them, thereby disabling the National Government and weakening the very Union that the Constitution creates.  Cf. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407-408 (1819); Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 386-387 (1821).
