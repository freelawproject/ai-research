 10 Thus, appellants’ objection is to *621 the rate of the Montana tax, and even then, their only complaint is that the amount the State receives in taxes far exceeds the value of the services provided to the coal mining industry.  In objecting to the tax on this ground, appellants may be assuming that the Montana tax is, in fact, intended to reimburse the State for the cost of specific services furnished to the coal mining industry.  Alternatively, appellants could be arguing that a State’s power to tax an activity connected to interstate commerce cannot exceed the value of the services specifically provided to the activity.  Either way, the premise of appellants’ argument is invalid.  Furthermore, appellants have completely misunderstood the nature of the inquiry under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test.  The Montana Supreme Court held that the coal severance tax is “imposed for the general support of the government.” -Mont., at-, 615 P. 2d, at 856 , and we have no reason to question this characterization of the Montana tax as a general revenue tax. 11 Consequently, in reviewing appellants’ contentions, we put to one side those cases in which the Court reviewed challenges to “user” fees or “taxes” that were designed and defended as a specific charge imposed by the State for the use of state-owned or state-provided transportation or other facilities and services.  See, e. g., Evans *622 ville-Vanderburgh Airport Authority Dist. v. Delta Airlines, Inc., 405 U. S. 707 (1972); Clark v. Paul Cray, Inc., <citedDecision>306 U. S. 583</citedDecision> (1939); Ingels v. Morf, 300 U. S. 290 (1937).  12 This Court has indicated that States have considerable latitude in imposing general revenue taxes.  The Court has, for example, consistently rejected claims that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands as a barrier against taxes that are “unreasonable” or “unduly burdensome.” See, e. g., Pittsburgh v. Alco Parking Corp., 417 U. S. 369 (1974); Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40 (1934); Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Co. v. Smith, 255 U. S. 44 (1921).  Moreover, there is no requirement under the Due Process Clause that the amount of general revenue taxes collected from a particular activity must be reasonably related to the value of the services provided to the activity.  Instead, our consistent rule has been: “Nothing is more familiar in taxation than the imposition of a tax upon a class or upon individuals who enjoy no direct benefit from its expenditure, and who are not responsible for the condition to be remedied.  “A tax is not an assessment of benefits.  It is, as we *623 have said, a means of distributing the burden of the cost of government.

 Appellants *621 contend that inasmuch as 50% of the revenues generated by the Montana tax is “cached away, in effect, for unrelated and unknown purposes,” it is clear that the tax is not fairly related to the services furnished by the State.  Reply Brief for Appellants 8.  At oral argument before the Montana Supreme Court, appellants’ counsel suggested that a tax of “perhaps twelve and a half to fifteen percent of the value of the coal” would be constitutional.  — Mont., at —, 615 P. 2d, at 851 .  Contrary to appellants’ suggestion, the fact that 50% of the proceeds of the severance tax is paid into a trust fund does not undermine the Montana court’s conclusion that the tax is a general revenue tax. Nothing in the Constitution prohibits the people of Montana from choosing to allocate a portion of current tax revenues for use by future generations.  As the Court has stated, “such imposition, although termed a tax, cannot be tested by standards which generally determine the validity of taxes.” Interstate Transit, Inc. v. Lindsey, 283 U. S. 183, 190 (1931).  Because such charges are purportedly assessed to reimburse the State for costs incurred in providing specific quantifiable services, we have required a showing, based on factual evidence in the record, that “the fees charged do not appear to be manifestly disproportionate to the services rendered ...” <citedDecision>Clark</citedDecision> v. Paul Gray, Inc., <citedDecision>306 U. S., at 599</citedDecision> .  See <citedDecision>id., at 598-600</citedDecision> ; Ingels v. Morf, 300 U. S., at 296-297 .  One commentator has suggested that these “user” charges “are not true revenue measures and .  .  .  the considerations applicable to ordinary tax measures do not apply.” P. Hartman, State Taxation of Interstate Commerce 20, n. 72 (1953).  Instead, “user” fees “partak[e] ... of the nature of a rent charged by the State, based upon its proprietary interest in its public property, [rather] than of a tax, as that term is thought of in a technical sense.” Id., at 122.  See generally id., at 122-130.
