<p id="AYs">concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="b619-7">I agree with the Court’s conclusion that the Superior Court erred in its belief that the United States Constitution required the application of the procedures mandated by <em>Anders </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U. S. 738 (1967), to this case. In my view, however, on remand the Superior Court should be able to consider whether appointed counsel’s review of respondent’s case was adequate under Pennsylvania law or the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s remand order.</p>
