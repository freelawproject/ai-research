 Whether the decree is prospective only or requires payments for the weeks or months wrongfully skipped over by the state officials, the nature of the impact on the state treasury is precisely the same.  We have granted relief in other welfare cases which included retroactive assistance benefits or payments.  In State Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Services v. Zarate, 407 U. S. 918 , the sole issue presented to us 4 was whether the Eleventh Amendment barred a judgment against state officers for retroactive welfare assistance benefits or payments.  That had been ordered by the lower court and we summarily affirmed, only Mr. Justice White voting to note probable jurisdiction.  We also summarily affirmed the judgment in Sterrett v. Mothers’ & Children’s Rights Organization, 409 U. S. 809 , where one of the two questions 5 was whether retroactive payments of benefits violated the Eleventh Amendment.  In Wyman v. Bowens, 397 U. S. 49 , we affirmed a judgment *683 where payments were awarded in spite of the argument that the order was an incursion on the Eleventh Amendment.  6 In Shapiro v. Thompson, <citedDecision>394 U. S. 618</citedDecision> , we affirmed a judgment which ordered payment of benefits wrongfully withheld; 7 and while we did not specifically refer to the point, the lower court had expressly rejected the Eleventh Amendment argument.  8 In Gaither v. Sterrett, 346 F. Supp. 1095, 1099 , whose judgment we affirmed, 9 409 U. S. 1070 , the court said: “[T]his court would note that if defendants’ position regarding the jurisdictional bar of the Eleventh Amendment is correct, a great number of federal district court judgments are void, and the Supreme Court has affirmed many of these void judgments.” The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is in line with that view; the opposed view of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Rothstein v. Wyman, 467 F. 2d 226 , is out of harmony with the established law. What is asked by the instant case is minor compared to the relief granted in Griffin v. School Board, 377 U. S. 218 .  In that case we authorized entry of an order putting an end to a segregated school system.  We held, inter alia, that “the District Court may, if necessary to prevent further racial discrimination, require the Supervisors to *684 exercise the power that is theirs to levy taxes to raise funds adequate to reopen, operate, and maintain without racial discrimination a public school system in Prince Edward County like that operated in other counties in Virginia.” Id., at 233 .  We so held against vigorous contentions of the state officials that the Eleventh Amendment protected the State; and in reply we cited Lincoln County v. Luning, 133 U. S. 529 , and Kennecott Copper Corp. v. State Tax Comm’n, 327 U. S. 573, 579 , to support the proposition that “actions against a county can be maintained in United States courts in order to vindicate federally guaranteed rights.” 377 U. S., at 233 .  Griffin is sought to be distinguished on the ground that a “county” is not the “state” for purposes of the Eleventh Amendment.  But constitutionally the county in Griffin was exercising state policy as are the counties here, because otherwise the claim of denial of equal protection would be of no avail.

 *686 We have not always been unanimous in concluding when a State has waived its immunity.  In Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U. S. 184 , where Alabama was sued by some of its citizens for injuries suffered in the interstate operation of an Alabama railroad, the State defended on the grounds of the Eleventh Amendment.  The Court held that Alabama was liable as a carrier under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, saying: “Our conclusion is simply that Alabama, when it began operation of an interstate railroad approximately 20 years after enactment of the FELA, necessarily consented to such suit as was authorized by that Act,” id., at 192 .  The Court added: “Our conclusion that this suit may be maintained is in accord with the common sense of this Nation’s federalism.  A State’s immunity from suit by an individual without its consent has been fully recognized by the Eleventh Amendment and by subsequent decisions of this Court. But when a State leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own and enters into activities subject to congressional regulation, it subjects itself to that regulation as fully as if it were a private person or corporation.” Id., at 196 .  As the Court of Appeals in the instant case concluded, Illinois by entering into the joint federal-state welfare plan just as surely “ [left] the sphere that is exclusively its own.” Ibid. It is argued that participation in the program of federal financial assistance is not sufficient to establish consent on the part of the State to be sued in federal courts.  But it is not merely participation which supports a finding of Eleventh Amendment waiver, but *687 participation in light of the existing state of the law as exhibited in such decisions as Shapiro v. Thompson, <citedDecision>394 U. S. 618</citedDecision> , which affirmed judgments ordering retroactive payment of benefits.  Today's holding that the Eleventh Amendment forbids court-ordered retroactive payments, as the Court recognizes, necessitates an express overruling of several of our recent decisions.  But it was against the background of those decisions that Illinois continued its participation in the federal program, and it can hardly be claimed that such participation was in ignorance of the possibility of court-ordered retroactive payments.  The decision to .participate against that background of precedent can only be viewed as a waiver of immunity from such judgments.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  Effective January 1, 1974, this AABD program was replaced by a similar program.  See 42 U. S. C. §§ 801-805 (1970 ed., Supp. II).
