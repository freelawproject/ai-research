They preserved the petitioner’s end of conversations concerning the placing of bets and the receipt of wagering information. On the single occasion when the statements of another person were inadvertently intercepted, the agents refrained from listening to them. Although the protections afforded the petitioner in Osborn were “similar ... to those ... of conventional warrants,” they were not identical. A conventional warrant ordinarily serves to notify the suspect of an intended search. But if Osborn had been told in advance that federal officers intended to record his conversations, the point of making such recordings would obviously have been lost; the evidence in question could not have been obtained. In omitting any requirement of advance notice, the federal court that authorized electronic surveillance in Osborn simply recognized, as has this Court, that officers need not announce their purpose before conducting an otherwise authorized search if such an announcement would provoke the escape of the suspect or the destruction of critical evidence. See Ker v. California, <targetCase>374 U. S. 23</targetCase>, 37-41. Although some have thought that this “exception to the notice requirement where exigent circumstances are present,” id., at 39, should be deemed inapplicable where police enter a home before its occupants are aware that officers are present, id., at 55-58 (opinion of Mr. Justice BrenNAN), the reasons for such a limitation have no bearing here. However true it may be that “[i]nnocent citizens should not suffer the shock, fright or embarrassment attendant upon an unannounced police intrusion,” id., at 57, and that “the requirement of awareness . . . serves to minimize the hazards of the officers’ dangerous calling,” id., at 57-58, these considerations are not rele *356 vant to the problems presented by judicially authorized electronic surveillance. Nor do the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure impose an inflexible requirement of prior notice. Rule 41 (d) does require federal officers to serve upon the person searched a copy of the warrant and a receipt describing the material obtained, but it does not invariably require that this be done before the search takes place. Nordelli v. United States, 24 F. 2d 665, 666-667. Thus the fact that the petitioner in Osborn was unaware that his words were being electronically transcribed did not prevent this Court from sustaining his conviction, and did not prevent the Court in Berger from reaching the conclusion that the use of the recording device sanctioned in Osborn was entirely lawful. 388 U. S. 41, 57. Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 464 (dissenting opinion of Me. Justice BRENNAN). See, e. g., Jones v. United States, 357 U. S. 493, 497-499; Rios v. United States, 364 U. S. 253, 261; Chapman v. United States, 365 U. S. 610, 613-615; Stoner v. <targetCase>California</targetCase>, 376 U. S. 483, 486-487. See, e. g., Carroll v. United States, 267 U. S. 132, 153, 156; McDonald v. United States, 335 U. S. 451, 454-456; Brinegar v. United States, 338 U. S. 160, 174-177; Cooper v. <targetCase>California</targetCase>, 386 U. S. 58; Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298-300. In Agnello v. United States, 269 U. S. 20, 30, the Court stated: “The right without a search warrant contemporaneously to search persons lawfully arrested while committing crime and to search the place where the arrest is made in order to find and seize things connected with the crime as its fruits or as the means by which it was committed, as well as weapons and other things to effect an escape from custody, is not to be doubted.” Whatever one’s view of “the long-standing practice of searching for other proofs of guilt within the control of the accused found upon arrest,” United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U. S. 56, 61; cf. id., at *358 71-79 (dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter), the concept of an “incidental’’ search cannot readily be extended to include surreptitious surveillance of an individual either immediately before, or immediately after, his arrest. Although “[t]he Fourth Amendment does not require police officers to delay in the course of an investigation if to do so would gravely endanger their lives or the lives of others,” Warden v. Hayden, 387 U. S. 294, 298-299, there seems little likelihood that electronic surveillance would be a realistic possibility in a situation so fraught with urgency. A search to which an individual consents meets Fourth Amendment requirements, Zap v. United States, 328 U. S. 624, but of course “the usefulness of electronic surveillance depends on lack of notice to the suspect.” Lopez v. United States, 373 U. S. 427, 463 (dissenting opinion of MR. Justice BreNNAn). Whether safeguards other than prior authorization by a magistrate would satisfy the Fourth Amendment in a situation involving the national security is a question not presented by this case. See Osborn v. United States, 385 U. S. 323, 330.
