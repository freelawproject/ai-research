*123 Mr. Justice Roberts, dissenting.  There is certainly a distinction in fact between the transaction considered in Klein v. United States, <citedDecision>283 U. S. 231</citedDecision> , and those under review in Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., 296 U. S. 39 , and Becker v. St. Louis Uniont Trust Co., 296 U. S. 48 .  The courts, the Board of Tax Appeals, and the Treasury have found no difficulty in observing the distinction in specific cases. I believe it is one of substance, not merely of terminology, and not dependent on the niceties of conveyancing or recondite doctrines of ancient property law. But if I am wrong in this, I still think the judgments in Nos. 110-112, and 183 should be affirmed and that in 399 should be reversed.  The rule of interpretation adopted in the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases should now be followed for two reasons: First, that rule was indicated by decisions of this court as the one applicable in the circumstances here disclosed, as early as 1927; was progressively developed and applied by the Board of Tax Appeals, the lower federal courts, and this court, up to the decision of McCormick v. Burnet, 283 U. S. 784 , in 1931; and has since been followed by those tribunals in not less than fifty cases. It ought not to be set aside after such a history.  Secondly.  The rule was not contrary to any treasury regulation; was, indeed, in accord with such regulations as there were on the subject; .was subsequently embodied in a specific regulation, and, with this background, Congress has three times reenacted the law without amending § 302 (c) in respect of the matter here in issue.  The settled doctrine, that reenactment of a statute so construed, without alteration, renders such construction a part of the statute itself, should not be ignored but observed.  *124 1.

 If A makes a present irrevocable transfer in trust, conditioned that he shall receive the income for life and, at his death, the principal shall go to B, B is at once legally *126 invested with the principal.  A’s life .estate ceases at his death.  Nothing then passes.  There is no tax imposed by the statute because there is no transfer any more than there would be in the case of a similar life estate given A by his grandmother.  (This is May v. Heiner, 281 U. S. 238 .) If, on the other hand, A creates an estate for years or for life in B, retaining the remaining beneficial interest .in the property for himself, and, whether by the terms of the grant, or by the terms of A’s will, or under the intestate law, that remainder passes to someone else at his death, such passage renders the transfer taxable.  (This is <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> v. United <citedDecision>States, supra.)</citedDecision> If what A does is to transfer his property irrevocably, with provision that it shall be.  enjoyed successively by various persons for life and then go absolutely to a named person, but that if he, A, shall outlive that person, the property shall come back to him, and A dies in the lifetime of the person in question, A has merely" lost the chance that the beneficial ownership of the property may revert to him.  That chance cannot pass under his will or under the intestate laws.  As there is no transfer which can become effective at his death by the shifting of any interest from him, no tax is imposed, (This is McCormick v. Burnet, supra, and Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Company, supra.) 2.  These governing principles were indicated as early as 1927 4 and were thereafter developed, in application to specific cases, in a consistent line of authorities.  In May v. Heiner, supra, it was held that a transfer in trust under which the income was payable to.  the trans-feror’s husband for his life and, after his death, to the transferor during her life, with remainder to her children, was not subject to tax as a'transfer intended to; take effect *127 in possession or enjoyment at or after death.

 This court said (p. 243): “.  .  .  At the death of Mrs. May no interest in the property held under the trust deed, passed from her to the living; title thereto had been definitely fixed by the trust deed.  The interest therein which she possessed .immediately prior to her death was obliterated by that event.” [Italics supplied.] It will be noted that this is the equivalent of the Treasury’s statement, supra, that such an interest lapses at death'.  That decision is indistinguishable in principle from the St. Louis Union Trust Company cases and the instant cases; and what was there said serves to distinguish the <citedDecision>Klein</citedDecision> case. McCormick v. Burnet followed May v. Heiner .  The court there held that neither a reservation by the grantor of a life estate with remainders over, nor a provision for a reverter in case all the beneficiaries should die in the lifetime of the grantor, made the gifts transfers intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the grantor’s death.  In the Circuit Court of Appeals the Commissioner urged that the provision for payment of the trust estate to the settlor in case she survived all the beneficiaries rendered the transfer taxable.  That court dealt at length with the point and sustained his view.  ( 43 F. 2d 277, 279 .) The Commissioner made the same contention in this court, but it was overruled upon the authority of May v. Heiner .  Then came the two St. Louis Union Trust Company cases, decided upon the authority of May v. Heiner and McCormick v. Burnet .
