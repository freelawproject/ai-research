v. Blaisdell, 290 U.S. 398 , 428. Rather it should be construed to harmonize its direction "with the necessary residuum of state power." Id., at p. 435. Prominent in the residuum of state power, as pointed out above, is the right of a state to deal with the marriage relations of its citizens and to pursue its chosen domestic policy of public morality in that connection. Both Nevada and North Carolina have rights in this regard which are entitled to recognition. The conflict between those rights here should not be resolved by extending into North Carolina the effects of Nevada's action through a perfunctory application of the literal language of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, with the result that measures which North Carolina has adopted to safeguard the welfare of her citizens in this area of legitimate governmental concern are undermined. When the interests are considered, those of North Carolina are of sufficient validity that they should as clearly free her of the compulsions of the Full Faith and Credit Clause as did the interest of the state in the devolution of property within its boundaries in Fall v. Eastin, <targetCase>215 U.S. 1</targetCase> ; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U.S. 386 , and Hood v. McGehee, 237 U.S. 611 , or the interests of a state in the application of its own workmen's compensation statute in Alaska Packers Assn. v. Comm'n, supra , or its interest in declining to enforce the penal laws of another jurisdiction, cf. Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U.S. 657 , 666, all of which seem to be matters of far less concern to a state than the untrammeled enforcement within its borders of those standards of public morality with regard to the marriage relation which it considers to be in the best interests of its citizens. *311 There is an element of tragic incongruity in the fact that an individual may be validly divorced in one state but not in another. But our dual system of government and the fact that we have no uniform laws on many subjects give rise to other incongruities as well Â— for example, the common law took the logical position that an individual could have but one domicile at a time, but this Court has nevertheless said that the Full Faith and Credit Clause does not prevent conflicting state decisions on the question of an individual's domicile. Cf. Worcester County Co. v. Riley, 302 U.S. 292 , 299.

." Sec. 9467.02 provides that "In all civil cases where the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the residence of one of the parties to the action, the court shall require corroboration of the evidence of such residence." L. 1931, p. 277. [4] Thus we have here no question as to extraterritorial effect of a divorce decree insofar as it affects property in another State. See the cases cited, infra, note 5. [5] Fall v. Eastin, <targetCase>215 U.S. 1</targetCase> ; Olmsted v. Olmsted, 216 U.S. 386 ; Hood v. McGehee, 237 U.S. 611 . These decisions refuse to require courts of one state to allow acts or judgments of another to control the disposition or devolution of realty in the former. They seem to rest on the doctrine that the state where the land is located is "sole mistress" of its rules of real property. See Hood v. McGehee, supra, p. 615; and the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Holmes in <targetCase>Fall</targetCase> v. Eastin, supra, p. 14. That the case of Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., 191 U.S. 373 , is not an exception but only an appropriate application of the doctrine of forum non conveniens, see Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U.S. 629 , 642-643. [6] It has been repeatedly stated that the full faith and credit clause does not require one state to enforce the penal laws of another. See, for example, Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U.S. 657 , 666; Converse v. Hamilton, 224 U.S. 243 , 260; Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, 286 U.S. 145 , 160. But the question of whether a judgment based on a penalty is entitled to full faith and credit was reserved in Milwaukee County v. White Co., 296 U.S. 268 , 279. For other dicta that the application of the full faith and credit clause may be limited by the policy of the law of the forum, see Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper, supra, p. 160; Alaska Packers Assn. v. Industrial Accident Comm'n, 294 U.S. 532 , 546; Broderick v. Rosner, supra, note 5, p. 642.
