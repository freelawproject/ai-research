 .  .  .” Mineral Lands Leasing Act of 1920, § 35, 41 Stat. 450 , as amended, 30 U. S. C. § 191 .  An additional 40% of this federal revenue from mineral leases is indirectly returned to the States through a reclamation fund.  Ibid. Moreover, § 601 of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, Pub. L. 95-620, 92 Stat. 3323, 42 U. S. C. § 8401 (1976 ed., Supp. Ill), authorizes federal grants to areas affected by increased coal production.  This is a marked departure from the Court’s prior cases. Rather than suggesting such a mechanical test, those cases imply that a tax will be struck down under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test if the plaintiff establishes a factual record that the tax is not fairly related to the services and protection provided by the State.  See, e. g., Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., <citedDecision>435 U. S. 734, 750-751</citedDecision> (1978); <citedDecision>id., at 764</citedDecision> (Powell,.J., concurring in part and concurring in result).  See Merrion v. Jicaritta Apache Tribe, 617 F. 2d 537 , 545, n. 4 (CA10) (en banc), cert. granted, 449 U. S. 820 (1980).  Even the trial court in the present case recognized that if it reached this question it “would necessarily have to deny the motion to dismiss and proceed to a factual determination.” App. 37a.  As the example of Alaska illustrates, this prospect is not a fanciful one.  Ninety percent of Alaska’s revenue derives from petroleum taxes and royalties; because of the massive sums that have been so raised, that State’s income tax has been eliminated.  See N. Y. Times, June 5, 1981, section 1, p. A10, col. 1.  As noted above, Montana’s severance tax already allegedly accounts for 20% of its total tax revenue, and the State has enacted property and income tax relief.

 Brief for Appellees 1-3, 26-27.  Indeed, the stated objectives of the 1975 amendment were to: “(a) preserve or modestly increase revenues going to the general fund, (b) to respond to current social impacts attributable to coal development, and (c) to invest in the future, when new energy technologies reduce our dependence on coal and mining activity may decline.” Statement to Accompany the Report of the Free Joint Conference Committees on Coal Taxation 1 (1975).  Since the tax was designed only to “preserve or modestly increase” general revenues, it is appropriate for a court to inquire here whether the “surplus” revenue Montana has received from this severance tax is “manifestly disproportionate” to the present or future costs attributable to coal development.  Complete Auto Transit gave several examples of “tailored” taxes: property taxes designed to differentiate between property used in transportation and other types of property; an income tax using different rates for different types of business; and a tax on the “privilege of doing business in corporate form” that changed with the nature of the corporate activity involved.  430 U. S., at 288, n. 15 .  A severance tax using different rates for different minerals is, of course, directly analogous to these examples.  See also Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., <citedDecision>435 U. S. 734, 754-755</citedDecision> (1978); <citedDecision>id., at 764</citedDecision> (Powell, J., concurring in part and concurring in result).  The degree to which a tax may be “exported” turns on such factors as the taxing jurisdiction’s relative dominance of the market, the elasticity of demand for the product, and the availability of adequate substitutes.  See, e. g., McLure, Economic Constraints on State and Local Taxation of Energy Resources, 31 Nat. Tax J. 257, 257-259 (1978); Posner, at 510-512.  Commentators are in disagreement over the likelihood that coal severance taxes are in fact exported.  Compare, e. g., McLure, at 259, and Gillis & Peprah, Severance Taxes on Coal and Uranium in the Sunbelt, Tex. Bus. Rev. 302, 308 (1980), with Church, at 277, and Griffin, at 33.  It is clear, however, that that likelihood increases to the extent that the taxing States form a cartel arrangement.  Gillis, at 308.
