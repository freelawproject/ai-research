492. In answers to special interrogatories, the jury found that Sylvania had engaged "in a contract, combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade in violation of the antitrust laws with respect to location restrictions alone," and assessed Continental's damages at $591,505, which was trebled pursuant to 15 U.S. C . ยง 15 to produce an award of $1,774,515. App. 498, 501. [9] On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, reversed by a divided vote. 537 F.2d 980 (1976). The court acknowledged that there is language in Schwinn that could be read to support the District Court's instruction but concluded that Schwinn was distinguishable on several grounds. Contrasting the nature of the restrictions, their competitive impact, and the market shares of the franchisers in the two cases, the court concluded that Sylvania's location restriction had less potential for competitive harm than the restrictions invalidated in Schwinn and thus should be judged under the "rule of reason" rather than the per se rule stated in Schwinn. The court found support for its *42 position in the policies of the Sherman Act and in the decisions of other federal courts involving nonprice vertical restrictions. [10] We granted Continental's petition for certiorari to resolve this important question of antitrust law. 429 U.S. 893 (1976). [11] II A We turn first to Continental's contention that Sylvania's restriction on retail locations is a per se violation of ยง 1 of the Sherman Act as interpreted in Schwinn.

. Schwinn's territorial restrictions requiring dealers to confine their sales to exclusive territories prescribed by Schwinn prevented a dealer from competing for customers outside his territory. . . . Schwinn's restrictions guaranteed each wholesale distributor that it would be absolutely isolated from all competition from other Schwinn wholesalers." 537 F.2d 980 , 989-990 (1976). Moreover, like its franchised retailers, Schwinn's distributors were absolutely barred from selling to nonfranchised retailers, further limiting the possibilities of intrabrand price competition. The majority apparently gives no weight to the Court of Appeals' reliance on the difference between the competitive effects of Sylvania's location clause and Schwinn's interlocking "system of vertical restraints affecting both wholesale and retail distribution." Id., at 989. It also ignores post- Schwinn *63 decisions of the Third and Tenth Circuits upholding the validity of location clauses similar to Sylvania's here. Salco Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 517 F.2d 567 (CA10 1975); Kaiser v. General Motors Corp., 530 F.2d 964 (CA3 1976), aff'g 396 F. Supp. 33 (ED Pa. 1975).
