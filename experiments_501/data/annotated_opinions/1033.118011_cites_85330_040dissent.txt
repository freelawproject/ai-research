 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800, pp. 352-449 (M. Marcus ed. 1994).  9 *112 Congress took no action on Sedgwick’s proposal, however, and the Amendment as ultimately adopted two years later could hardly have been meant to limit federal-question jurisdiction, or it would never have left the States open to federal-question suits by their own citizens.  To be sure, the majority of state creditors were not citizens, but nothing in the Treaty would have prevented foreign creditors from selling their debt instruments (thereby assigning their claims) to citizens of the debtor State.  If the Framers of the Eleventh Amendment had meant it to immunize States from federal-question suits like those that might be brought to enforce the Treaty of Paris, they would surely have drafted the Amendment differently.  See Fletcher, The Diversity Explanation of the Eleventh Amendment: A Reply to Critics, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1261, 1280-1282 (1989).  It should accordingly come as no surprise that the weightiest commentary following the Amendment’s adoption described it simply as constricting the scope of the Citizen-State Diversity Clauses.  In Cohens v. Virginia, <citedDecision>6 Wheat. 264</citedDecision> (1821), for instance, Chief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court, emphasized that the Amendment had no effect on federal courts’ jurisdiction grounded on the “arising under” provision of Article III and concluded that “a case arising under the constitution or laws of the United States, is cognizable in the Courts of the Union, whoever may be the parties to that case.” <citedDecision>Id., at 383</citedDecision> .  The point of the Eleventh Amendment, according to <citedDecision>Cohens</citedDecision> , was to bar jurisdiction in suits at common law by Revolutionary War debt creditors, *113 not “to strip the government of the means of protecting, by the instrumentality of its courts, the constitution and laws from active violation.” <citedDecision>Id., at 407</citedDecision> .  The treatment of the Amendment in Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), was to the same effect.  The Amendment was held there to be no bar to an action against the State seeking the return of an unconstitutional tax. “The eleventh amendment of the constitution has exempted a State from the suits of citizens of other States, or aliens,” Marshall stated, omitting any reference to cases that arise under the Constitution or federal law. Id., at 847 .  The good sense of this early construction of the Amendment as affecting the diversity jurisdiction and no more has the further virtue of making sense of this Court’s repeated exercise of appellate jurisdiction in federal-question suits brought against States in their own courts by out-of-staters.  Exercising appellate jurisdiction in these cases would have been patent error if the Eleventh Amendment limited federal-question jurisdiction, for the Amendment’s unconditional language (“shall not be construed”) makes no distinction between trial and appellate jurisdiction.  10 And yet, again and again we have entertained such appellate cases, even when brought against the State in its own name by a *114 private plaintiff for money damages.  See, e. g., Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, 453 U. S. 609 (1981); Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota Comm’r of Revenue, 460 U. S. 575 (1983).

 .  .  States may legislate in conformity to their opinions, and may enforce those opinions by penalties.  It would be hazarding too much to assert that the judicatures of the States will be exempt from the prejudices by which the legislatures and people are influenced, and will constitute perfectly impartial tribunals.  In many States the judges are dependent for office and for salary on the will of the legislature.  The constitution of the United States furnishes no security against the universal adoption of this principle.  When we observe the importance which that constitution attaches to the independence of judges, we are the less inclined to suppose that it can have intended to leave these constitutional questions to tribunals where this independence may not exist.” <citedDecision>Cohens</citedDecision> v. Virginia, <citedDecision>6 Wheat., at 386-387</citedDecision> .  And yet that is just what Hans threatened to do.  How such a result could have been threatened on the basis of a principle not so much as mentioned in the Constitution is difficult to understand.  But history provides the explanation.  As I have already said, Hans was one episode in a long story of debt repudiation by the States of the former Confederacy after the end of Reconstruction.  The turning point in the States’ favor came with the Compromise of 1877, when the Republican Party agreed effectively to end Reconstruction and to withdraw federal troops from the South in return for Southern acquiescence in the decision of the Electoral Commission that awarded the disputed 1876 presidential election to Rutherford B. Hayes.  See J. Orth, Judicial Power of the United States: The Eleventh Amendment in American History 53-57 (1987); Gibbons, supra, at 1978- *121 1982; see generally Foner, Reconstruction, at 575-587 (describing the events of 1877 and their aftermath).

 In the past, we have assumed that a plain-statement requirement is sufficient to protect the States from undue federal encroachments upon their traditional immunity from suit.  See, e. g., Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways & Public Transp., 483 U. S., at 475; Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U. S., at 239-240 .  It is hard to contend that this rule has set the bar too low, for (except in Union Gas) we have never found the requirement to be met outside the context of laws passed under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The exception I would recognize today proves the rule, moreover, because the federal abrogation of state immunity comes as part of a regulatory scheme which is itself designed to invest the States with regulatory powers that Congress need not extend to them.  This fact suggests to me that the political safeguards of federalism are working, that a plain-statement rule is an adequate check on congressional overreaching, and that today’s abandonment of that approach is wholly unwarranted.  There is an even more fundamental “clear statement” principle, however, that the Court abandons today.  John Marshall recognized it over a century and a half ago in the very context of state sovereign immunity in federal-question cases: *185 “The jurisdiction of the court, then, being extended by the letter of the constitution to all cases arising under it, or under the laws of the United States, it follows that those who would withdraw any case of this description from that jurisdiction, must sustain the exemption they claim on the spirit and true meaning of the constitution, which spirit and true meaning must be so apparent as to overrule the words which its framers have employed.” <citedDecision>Cohens</citedDecision> v. Virginia, <citedDecision>6 Wheat., at 379-380</citedDecision> .  Because neither text, precedent, nor history supports the majority’s abdication of our responsibility to exercise the jurisdiction entrusted to us in Article III, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  The two Citizen-State Diversity Clauses provide as follows: “The judicial Power shall extend ... to Controversies .  .  .  between a State and Citizens of another State;... and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.” U. S. Const., Art. Ill, §2.  In his opinion in Union Gas, Justice Stevens referred to these Clauses as the “citizen-state” and “alien-state” Clauses, respectively, Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S. 1, 24 (1989) (concurring opinion).

 While a minority has adopted the second view set out above, see, e. g., Marshall, Fighting the Words of the Eleventh Amendment, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1342 (1989); Massey, State Sovereignty and the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments, 56 U. Chi. L. Rev. 61 (1989), and others have criticized the diversity theory, see, e. g., Marshall, The Diversity Theory of the Eleventh Amendment: A Critical Evaluation, 102 Harv. L. Rev. 1372 (1989), I have discovered no commentator affirmatively advocating the position taken by the Court today.  As one scholar has observed, the literature is “remarkably consistent in its evaluation of the historical evidence and text of the amendment as not supporting a broad rule of constitutional immunity for states.” Jackson, supra, at 44, n. 179.  Vassall initiated a suit against Massachusetts, invoking the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Although the marshal for the district of Massachusetts served a subpoena on Governor John Hancock and Attor *112 ney General James Sullivan, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts did not appear by the original return date of August 1793, and the case was continued to the February 1794 Term. Massachusetts never did appear, and the case was “simply continued from term to term through 1796.” 5 Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, at 369.  In February 1797 the suit was “dismissed with Costs, for reasons unknown,” ibid, (internal quotation marks omitted), perhaps because “Vassall failed to prosecute it properly,” ibid. We have generally rejected Eleventh Amendment challenges to our appellate jurisdiction on the specious ground that an appeal is not a “suit” for purposes of the Amendment.  See, e. g., McKesson Corf.  v. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, 496 U. S. 18, 27 (1990).  Although Cohens v. Virginia, <citedDecision>6 Wheat. 264, 412</citedDecision> (1821), is cited for this proposition, that case involved a State as plaintiff.  See generally Jackson, 98 Yale L. J., at 32-35 (rejecting the appeal/suit distinction).  The appeal/suit distinction, in any ease, makes no sense.  Whether or not an appeal is a “suit” in its own right, it is certainly a means by which an appellate court exercises jurisdiction over a “suit” that began in the courts below.  Cf. Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U. S. 56, 58 (1982) (per curiam) (“The filing of a notice of appeal is an event of jurisdictional significance — it confers jurisdiction on the court of appeals and divests the district court of its control over those aspects of the case involved in the appeal”).  See also Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., 491 U. S., at 31 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (“If this text [of the Eleventh Amendment] were intended as a comprehensive description of state sovereign immunity in federal courts ... then it would unquestionably be most reasonable to interpret it as providing immunity only when the sole basis of federal jurisdiction is the diversity of citizenship that it describes (which of course tracks some of the diversity jurisdictional grants in U. S. Const., Art. Ill, §2).  For there is no plausible reason why one would wish to protect a State from being sued in federal court for violation of federal law .
