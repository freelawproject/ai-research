- The passage states that the grounds of a former decision were ""reconsidered and declared to be satisfactory"" in the Target Case
- No Explicit Negative Actions (no overruling language)
- No Implicit Negative Actions (no conflicting holdings)
- The Target Case is cited as supporting precedent in subsequent cases

- There is no language indicating overruling or reversal
- The discussion appears to be using the Target Case as a reference point for legal analysis

- Another position is described as ""limited"" but not overruled
- The passage explicitly states that aspects of the Target Case ""has been questioned and limited in important particulars""

3. Evidence of Overruling:
- Explicit statement that one position from Texas v. White ""must be regarded as overruled""
- This constitutes an Explicit Negative Action
- The limitation of other aspects doesn't constitute full overruling, but the explicit overruling of a key position does

2. Analysis:
- Passage 1 repeatedly cites McCulloch v. Maryland as valid precedent
- Passage 2 provides historical context and criticism of certain rhetoric from McCulloch
- The phrase ""power to tax involves power to destroy"" is criticized as an ""unfortunate remark""
- However, the fundamental holding is not overruled
- The criticism is about how the case's language was later interpreted, not about overturning the actual decision

3. Key Observations:
- No Explicit Negative Actions (no direct statement of overruling)

  * Target Case: Klein v. United States, 283 U.S. 231
  * Irrelevant Cases: Various other cases mentioned (St. Louis Trust Co., etc.)
- Steps to determine overruling:
  1. Read all passages carefully
  2. Focus on how the Acting Case treats the Target Case
  3. Look for explicit or implicit negative actions
  4. Consider majority vs. dissenting opinions

2. Analysis:
- The Acting Case repeatedly cites and relies upon the Target Case positively
- The court uses the Target Case as foundational precedent
- The majority opinion upholds and reinforces the Target Case's principles
- Even the Chief Justice's concurrence explicitly states the cases are ""controlled by our decision in Klein v. United States""
- The dissenting opinion acknowledges the Target Case's validity but argues about its application

3. Final Review:
- There are no explicit or implicit negative actions against the Target Case
- Instead, the Acting Case strengthens and reaffirms the Target Case
- The court uses the Target Case as the basis for overruling other cases (the St. Louis Trust cases)

1. Planning:
- Acting Case: Not clearly identified in the passages
- Target Case: Commissioner v. Schwarz, 74 F.2d 712
- Need to examine how the Target Case is referenced and treated

2. Analysis:
- The Target Case appears in both passages
- In Passage 1: It's merely cited as a reference (""Cf."") in relation to tax law discussions
- In Passage 2: It's mentioned in footnote [7] as being the only case decided ""contra"" (contrary) to other cases
- Neither passage shows the Acting Case taking any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions against the Target Case
- The passages appear to be discussing legal history and citing various cases, including the Target Case
- No evidence of overruling is present

3. Review:
- The references to the Target Case are purely citational
- No language indicating overruling or reversal
- No conflicting holdings that would invalidate the Target Case
- Mentions of being ""contra"" only indicate it reached a different conclusion, not that it was overruled

- Look for implicit negative actions that might invalidate the Target Case
- Pay special attention to discussions of Congressional actions and their impact
- Check if any apparent overruling is from the majority opinion vs. dissent

- Passage 1 and 2 discuss the Target Case as valid precedent
- Passage 3 reveals that Congress, through the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, ""displaced the construction"" that the Court had put on § 302 (c) in several cases, including the Target Case
- This Congressional action effectively nullified the Target Case's interpretation, but this is not the same as the Acting Case overruling it

  * Target Case: Williams v. Standard Oil Co., 278 U.S. 235
  * Irrelevant Cases: Several other cases mentioned (Ribnik, Morehead, Tagg Bros., etc.)
- Look for any explicit or implicit overruling of the Target Case
- Focus on the relationship between the Acting Case and Target Case only

2. **Analysis**:
- The passage discusses a shift in jurisprudence regarding price-fixing powers
- The Target Case (Williams v. Standard Oil Co.) is mentioned as part of a series of cases
- The passage indicates a ""drift away"" from earlier precedents restricting price-fixing powers
- The passage lists several subsequent cases that have given ""increasingly wider scope to price-fixing powers""
- The Target Case is grouped with Morehead v. Tipaldo as cases that went against this trend
- While the passage suggests the Target Case's reasoning may be outdated, it does not explicitly overrule it
- No clear Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions are taken against the Target Case specifically

3. **Review**:
- While the passage shows a trend away from the Target Case's reasoning, it does not contain explicit language overruling it
- The ""drift away"" from earlier precedents is a general observation and not a specific overruling
- Without clear Negative Actions, we cannot conclude the Target Case is overruled

1. First, let's make a plan:
- Identify key cases:
  * Acting Case: This appears to be a discussion of various cases and legal principles
  * Target Case: French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250
  * Multiple irrelevant cases are mentioned but should be ignored
- Steps:
  1. Review all passages for discussion of the Target Case
  2. Look for explicit or implicit negative actions
  3. Determine if any overruling occurred

2. Analysis:
- Passage 1 mentions the Target Case was based on ""loose ground"" that was later clarified by subsequent decisions
- Passage 2 discusses the Target Case's reasoning about protecting federal judgments
- Passage 3 distinguishes the Target Case as a ""removal case"" that ""rests upon an entirely different footing""
- No explicit overruling language is found
- No implicit overruling through conflicting holdings is evident
- The Target Case is actually cited as precedent multiple times

  - Reinterprets the case's holding more narrowly
  - Explains the case didn't actually address the issue it's often cited for
  - However, this criticism does not constitute overruling

3. Key Observations:
- While the Acting Case disagrees with how Root v. Woolworth has been interpreted by others

- Look for any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Pay special attention to Passage 3, which appears most critical of the Target Case
- Determine if criticism constitutes actual overruling

3. Analysis:

- Passage 2: Uses Target Case as supporting authority
- Passage 3: States that the ""first come, first served"" rationale of Target Case ""was discarded"" in Kline v. Burke Construction Co.

- Acting Case: This appears to be a Supreme Court case discussing divorce jurisdiction
- Target Case: Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U.S. 562
- Plan: I will analyze whether the Acting Case explicitly or implicitly overrules the Target Case

2. Analysis:
- In Passage 4, there's strong criticism of the Target Case, stating it ""made an arbitrary break with the past and created distinctions incompatible with the role of this Court""
- More importantly, in Passage 2, the Court rejects the Target Case's reasoning about matrimonial domicile and adopts the dissenting view from Justice Holmes
- The language and context strongly suggest that the Acting Case is explicitly overruling the Target Case's precedent regarding interstate recognition of divorce decrees
- This is reinforced by the dissenting opinion in Passage 5 which acknowledges that the majority is changing the law established by the Target Case

3. Evidence of Overruling:
- The majority opinion clearly rejects the Target Case's core holding
- The dissent confirms this by stating ""Until today, however, it has been regarded as law""
- The Court adopts positions directly contrary to the Target Case's ruling

```json
{
  ""overruled"": ""yes"",
  ""confidence"": 0.95,
  ""rationale"": ""The Acting Case explicitly overrules the Target Case by rejecting its core holding regarding interstate recognition of divorce decrees.

  * Irrelevant Cases: Various other cases mentioned (Shapiro, Hamilton, etc.)
- Determine if there are any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Focus only on the relationship between Acting Case and Target Case

2. **Analysis**:
- The Target Case is cited as an example/illustration
- It's used to support the Acting Case's argument about general laws that may conflict with religious beliefs
- The Target Case is referenced positively as precedent
- No Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions are taken against the Target Case
- The passage uses the Target Case to reinforce its reasoning, not to overrule it

1. First, let's make a plan:
- Acting Case: The main case being discussed
- Target Case: Plamals v. The Pinar Del Rio, 277 U.S. 151
- Need to determine if the Acting Case overrules the Target Case
- Will look for Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Will analyze both passages for the court's official position

2. Analysis:
- Passage 1 shows that:
  * The Target Case was being used as precedent
  * Lower courts felt bound by the Target Case
  * The Supreme Court granted certiorari to review whether Target Case should control
  
- Passage 2 shows:
  * A dissenting opinion expressing concern about ""nullification"" of the Target Case
  * The dissent's objection implies the majority opinion did overrule the Target Case
  * Since this is a dissenting opinion, the majority must have taken the opposite position

3. Key Evidence:
- The dissent's statement that ""the court resorts to nullification of an earlier decision, Plamals v. Pinar Del Rio"" strongly indicates that the majority opinion overruled the Target Case
- When a dissent complains about nullification of a precedent, this typically means the majority has overruled that precedent

4. Conclusion:
Based on the dissenting opinion's clear indication that the majority overruled the Target Case, and following the instruction that the court's opinion is the opposite of the dissenting view, we can conclude with high confidence that the Target Case was overruled.

- Passage 2 appears to be from a dissenting opinion (based on first-person language and disagreement with main opinion)
- The Acting Case appears to be establishing new principles about patent misuse and contributory infringement that conflict with the Target Case's holding
- The language suggests the Acting Case is effectively undermining the precedential value of the Target Case through establishing conflicting principles

3. **Evidence of Overruling**:
- While not using the word ""overruled,"" the Acting Case appears to be establishing principles that implicitly negate the Target Case's holding about contributory infringement
- The discussion indicates a fundamental shift in how contributory infringement is viewed, making the Target Case's reasoning no longer valid

1. First, I'll identify the key cases:

- Target Case: Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64
- Irrelevant Cases: Various other cases mentioned (Lupton's Sons Co., Guaranty Trust Co., etc.)

2. Plan for analysis:
- Review how the Target Case is referenced
- Determine if there are any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Check if the passages show any overruling of the Target Case
- Verify if any criticism constitutes actual overruling

3. Analysis:
- The Target Case (Erie Railroad v. Tompkins) is consistently referenced as active precedent
- The passages use the Target Case as foundational authority
- The Target Case is cited to support current legal principles
- No Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions are present
- The passages actually reinforce and apply the Target Case's principles

4. Final Review:

- It's referenced as establishing important doctrine
- No indication of overruling
- High confidence in assessment

Tompkins, which 'came to an end' with the previous view of diversity jurisdiction. This constitutes an Explicit Negative Action overruling the Target Case's precedent regarding federal courts' power in diversity cases.","Let me make a plan to analyze this complex set of passages:

1. Identify Key Cases:
- Acting Case: The main opinion discussing diversity jurisdiction and state policy
- Target Case: Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club, 225 U.S. 489
- Irrelevant Cases: Erie Railroad v. Tompkins, and others mentioned

2. Analysis Steps:
- Look for explicit statements about overruling the Target Case
- Examine the context and relationship between federal and state jurisdiction
- Consider the impact of Erie Railroad v. Tompkins on the Target Case
- Check if any dissenting opinions affect the analysis

Let me analyze:

The passage contains an explicit statement in Passage 1: ""Cases like Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club, 225 U.S. 489, are obsolete insofar as they are based on a view of diversity jurisdiction which came to an end with Erie Railroad v. Tompkins.""

This constitutes an Explicit Negative Action as the court directly states that the Target Case's view of diversity jurisdiction is no longer valid. The majority opinion clearly indicates that the precedent set in the Target Case has been overruled due to the Erie Railroad decision's change in how federal courts must handle diversity cases.

Analysis:
The passage discusses the Target Case (Adair) in a historical context, explaining its holding that railroads had a constitutional right to discriminate against union members through yellow dog contracts. While the passage mentions ""strong dissents"" and appears critical of the decision by associating it with Lochner (another controversial case), it does not show the Acting Case taking any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions to overrule the Target Case.

1. First, let me identify the key cases:
- Acting Case: Based on the passages, this appears to be Mapp v. Ohio
- Target Case: Weeks v. United States, 232 U.S. 383
- Irrelevant Cases: Various other cases mentioned including Wolf v. Colorado, Boyd v. United States, etc.

2. Plan for analysis:
- Review all mentions of the Target Case across passages
- Determine if the Acting Case performs any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Focus on the majority opinion's treatment of the Target Case
- Ignore references to the Target Case by dissenting opinions or other cases

3. Analysis:
- The Target Case is cited multiple times across the passages
- The Acting Case appears to be reinforcing and extending the Target Case's principles
- The passages show that the Acting Case is actually using the Target Case as foundational precedent
- There are no Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions against the Target Case
- Instead, the Acting Case appears to be strengthening and expanding the Target Case's ruling to apply to states

4. Final Review:
The passages show that the Acting Case is building upon, not overruling, the Target Case's exclusionary rule. The Target Case is being used as supporting precedent for the Acting Case's decision.

2. Analysis:
- Passage 1 shows the Target Case was being used as authority for allowing confessions without counsel
- Passage 2 directly addresses the Target Case's precedential value:
  * Explicitly states Target Case ""does not compel a contrary result""
  * Narrows Target Case's holding to rejection of an ""absolute rule""
- Passage 3 is crucial:
  * Footnote 15 explicitly states the Target Case's ""authority... was weakened by subsequent decisions""
  * However, ""weakened"" is not equivalent to overruling
- The Acting Case establishes a new constitutional rule but does not explicitly overrule the Target Case
- Instead, it distinguishes and limits the Target Case's scope

3. Final Review:
- While the Acting Case significantly limits the Target Case's application, it does not meet the threshold for overruling through either explicit or implicit negative actions

- Target Case: Frank v. Maryland, 359 U.S. 360
- Need to determine if the Acting Case explicitly or implicitly overrules Frank v. Maryland

2. Analysis:
- The passages show a comprehensive re-examination of Frank v. Maryland
- The Court disagrees with Frank's core holdings about Fourth Amendment protections
- The Court explicitly rejects Frank's reasoning about:
  - The peripheral nature of Fourth Amendment interests in inspections
  - The distinction between criminal and administrative searches
  - The justifications for warrantless administrative inspections
- The Court establishes a new, conflicting constitutional standard requiring warrants for administrative inspections

3. Conclusion:
This is a clear case of overruling through both explicit and implicit negative actions. The Acting Case systematically dismantles Frank's legal reasoning and establishes a contrary constitutional requirement.

1. First, let's make a plan:
- Identify key cases:
  * Acting Case: Keyishian v. Board of Regents (implied from context)
  * Target Case: Adler v. Board of Education, 342 U.S. 485
  * Multiple references to the Target Case appear across passages
- Steps:
  1. Review all passages for explicit overruling language
  2. Look for implicit negative actions that undermine the Target Case
  3. Analyze the court's treatment of the Target Case's core holdings

2. Analysis:
- Passage 3 explicitly states that ""constitutional doctrine which has emerged since that decision has rejected its major premise""
- The court directly contradicts Adler's core premise that ""public employment may be conditioned upon surrender of constitutional rights""
- The majority opinion clearly indicates that Adler's foundation has been dismantled through subsequent cases
- Passage 4's dissenting opinion confirms this by stating ""the Feinberg Law, in which this Court found 'no constitutional infirmity' in 1952, has been given its death blow today""

  - The court was explicitly asked whether it should overrule Kahriger
  - The court concluded that ""these provisions may not be employed to punish criminally those persons who have defended a failure to comply with their requirements""

1. First, let's identify the key cases:
- Acting Case: This appears to be a case discussing free speech and advocacy
- Target Case: Yates v. United States, 354 U.S. 298
- Multiple other cases are mentioned but are irrelevant for our analysis

2. Planning the analysis:
- Review all three passages for any explicit or implicit negative actions toward the Target Case
- Focus specifically on how the Acting Case treats the Target Case
- Ignore discussions of other cases
- Pay special attention to Passage 3 which mentions a specific action related to the Target Case

3. Analysis:
- Passage 1: Cites Yates as supporting precedent
- Passage 2: References Yates as establishing doctrine about advocacy
- Passage 3: Provides crucial information that Yates ""overturned convictions"" but did not itself get overruled

4. Key Finding:
The Target Case is cited positively throughout the passages and is used as supporting precedent. There are no explicit or implicit negative actions taken against it by the Acting Case.

1. First, let's make a plan:
- Identify key cases:
  * Acting Case: This appears to be a case discussing search and seizure law
  * Target Case: United States v. Rabinowitz, 339 U.S. 56
  * Need to focus only on whether the Acting Case overrules Rabinowitz
- Review passages for explicit or implicit negative actions
- Check if majority opinion or dissent
- Look for clear overruling language

2. Analysis:
- Passage 1 introduces Rabinowitz as a key precedent
- Passage 2 strongly criticizes Rabinowitz's reasoning and historical basis
- Passage 3 discusses Rabinowitz's history
- The passages show a clear progression toward rejecting Rabinowitz's doctrine
- The criticism and analysis appears to be from the majority opinion, not dissent
- The Acting Case explicitly rejects Rabinowitz's central holding about warrantless searches
- The Court systematically dismantles both Rabinowitz's reasoning and its rule about warrantless searches incident to arrest

3. Conclusion:
While there is strong criticism and rejection of Rabinowitz's doctrine, the passages don't contain an explicit statement overruling it. The Court appears to be laying the groundwork for overruling but stops short of explicitly doing so within these passages.

While it disagrees with some interpretations of the Target Case, it explicitly explains that the Target Case's actual holding was narrower than previously understood. The Acting Case engages in careful distinction and limitation rather than overruling.","Let me analyze this step by step:

1. First, I'll identify the key cases:
- Acting Case: The case providing these passages (appears to be analyzing civil rights and property laws)
- Target Case: Corrigan v. Buckley, 271 U.S. 323
- Irrelevant Cases: Various other cases mentioned (Civil Rights Cases, Virginia v. Rives, etc.)

2. Plan for analysis:
- Review each passage for any explicit or implicit overruling of the Target Case
- Focus specifically on how the Acting Case treats the Target Case's precedent
- Look for any clear statements about the validity of the Target Case
- Identify if the Acting Case takes any Negative Actions against the Target Case

3. Analysis:
- Passage 1 introduces the Target Case and describes its holding
- Passage 2 mentions the Target Case in context of historical doubts about constitutional interpretation
- Passage 3 is most crucial as it directly analyzes the Target Case:
  - The Acting Case carefully examines the scope of the Target Case
  - It clarifies that the Target Case's actual holding was narrower than previously interpreted
  - While the Acting Case disagrees with some interpretations of the Target Case, it does not overrule it
  - Instead, it distinguishes and limits the Target Case's precedential scope

4. Conclusion:
The Acting Case does not overrule the Target Case. Instead, it reinterprets and limits its scope, explaining that the Target Case's holding was narrower than previously understood.

- The passages show that the Supreme Court is reviewing a California Supreme Court decision
- The Court vacates the judgment of the California Supreme Court and remands for further proceedings
- While the Court disagrees with aspects of the California decision, it does not explicitly overrule it
- The Court is allowing the state court to reconsider the matter under new guidance

- The Acting Case criticizes and limits the Target Case by labeling its statements as ""dicta""

1. First, I'll identify the key cases:
- Acting Case: This appears to be a Supreme Court case discussing jury trials and incorporation doctrine
- Target Case: Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1 (1964)
- Irrelevant Cases: Various other cases discussing incorporation doctrine

2. Plan for analysis:
- Review all passages for any explicit overruling of Malloy v. Hogan
- Look for implicit negative actions that might invalidate Malloy
- Check if discussions of Malloy are merely citations or actual overruling
- Distinguish between majority and dissenting opinions

3. Analysis:
- Passage 1: Positively cites Malloy to support the rejection of ""watered-down"" rights
- Passage 2: Shows a dissenting opinion that accepts Malloy's application
- Passage 3: References Malloy as part of the historical incorporation process
- Passage 4: Simply cites Malloy as established precedent

4. Key findings:
- The Target Case is consistently cited as valid precedent
- No explicit overruling language is present
- No implicit negative actions undermining the Target Case
- The case is referenced as supporting authority throughout

1. Plan:
- Acting Case: The case discussing welfare payments and Eleventh Amendment immunity

- The Target Case is cited multiple times across the passages
- In all instances, the Target Case is cited as valid precedent:
  - Passage 1: Cites it as establishing that suits under §1983 are proper
  - Passage 2: Uses it as valid precedent regarding state-federal welfare programs
  - Passage 3: Cites it positively for its interpretation of legislative history
  - Passage 4: References it as having ""settled"" a question about Social Security Act procedures

- No Explicit Negative Actions: The Acting Case never states it is overruling Rosado
- No Implicit Negative Actions: The Acting Case consistently relies on Rosado as valid precedent
- The Target Case is clearly being used as supporting authority throughout

- Acting Case: This appears to be a case discussing equal protection and gender discrimination
- Target Case: Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.S. 7 (1975)
- Irrelevant Cases: Reed v. Reed, Frontiero v. Richardson, and others mentioned

2. Plan for Analysis:
- Review how the Acting Case references the Target Case
- Look for any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Check if the Target Case is being upheld or used as valid precedent
- Examine both passages for any indication of overruling

3. Analysis:
- The Target Case is consistently cited as valid precedent
- The Acting Case relies on the Target Case's authority multiple times
- Phrases like ""Reed, we feel, is controlling..."" citing Stanton show the Target Case is being used to support current legal reasoning
- No Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions are taken against the Target Case
- The Target Case is referenced as supporting precedent for current legal principles

4. Final Review:
The passages show the Target Case being actively used and relied upon as valid precedent, with no indication of overruling.

- Target Case: ""5 How. 504"" (appears multiple times)
- Acting Case: The case discussing the Target Case and Low v. Austin
- Irrelevant Cases: Brown v. Maryland, Low v. Austin

2. Steps to analyze:
- Review how the Acting Case references the Target Case
- Look for any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Check if the references are merely citations or actual overruling
- Ensure we're looking at majority opinion, not dissent

Analysis:
The passages discuss the Target Case in the context of explaining its meaning and interpretation. The Acting Case actually relies on and affirms Chief Justice Taney's opinion from the Target Case, using it to clarify the correct interpretation of the Import-Export Clause. There are no Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions taken against the Target Case - instead, the Acting Case treats it as valid precedent.

- Target Case: Serfass v. United States, 420 U.S. 377 (1975)
- Irrelevant Cases: Jenkins, Lee, Wilson, Martin Linen Supply Co., etc.

2. Plan for analysis:
- Review all passages for any explicit overruling of the Target Case
- Look for implicit negative actions against the Target Case
- Check if the Target Case is being cited as valid precedent
- Ensure dissenting opinions are not confused with majority opinions

3. Analysis:
- The Target Case is cited multiple times across the passages
- In all instances, it is cited as valid precedent:
  - Passage 1: Referenced alongside other cases when discussing history
  - Passage 2: Referenced as valid precedent regarding when Government could appeal
  - Passage 3: Cited for its definition of ""acquittal""
  - Passage 4: Cited as still-valid precedent regarding labels in court rulings

4. Key observations:
- While Jenkins is explicitly overruled in the passages, the Target Case remains untouched
- The Target Case is consistently used to support current legal arguments
- No explicit or implicit negative actions are taken against the Target Case

- Acting Case: This appears to be a Supreme Court case analyzing Nebraska's water rights laws
- Target Cases: There are multiple citations to ""208 Neb. 703, 305 N.W.2d 614"" and ""713, 305 N.W.2d, at 620"" which appear to be the same Nebraska Supreme Court case

2. Plan for analysis:
- Review all passages for any explicit overruling language
- Look for implicit negative actions that would invalidate the Target Case
- Check if the passages merely discuss or cite the Target Case without overruling it
- Verify if any apparent overruling comes from the majority opinion rather than dissent

3. Analysis:
- The passages extensively discuss and cite the Target Case
- The Acting Case appears to disagree with some of the Target Case's reasoning about water as commerce
- However, there is no explicit overruling language
- While the Acting Case challenges some of the Target Case's theoretical underpinnings, it doesn't establish a clearly conflicting holding that would constitute implicit overruling
- The discussion appears to be more about distinguishing and analyzing the Target Case rather than overruling it

2. Steps:
- Review passages for explicit mentions of overruling the Target Case
- Look for implicit negative actions against the Target Case
- Focus on official court opinions, not dissents
- Ignore discussions of other cases unless they directly relate to Target Case's status

Analysis:
The passage contains a clear statement that ""In expressly overruling Geer three years ago, this Court traced the demise of the public ownership theory..."" This is an explicit negative action indicating that the Target Case has been overruled.

2. Plan for analysis:
- Review how the Acting Case treats the Target Case
- Look for any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Check if the Target Case is being overruled or just discussed/cited
- Verify if any apparent criticism constitutes actual overruling

3. Analysis:
- The Target Case is cited multiple times across the passages
- It's primarily used as an example of historical precedent
- The passages discuss how the Target Case ruled on tax immunity for state-operated commuter railroads
- While the broader governmental/proprietary distinction was later abandoned (as mentioned in Passage 1), this doesn't constitute an overruling of the specific Target Case

1. First, let me make a plan:
- Identify key cases:
  * Acting Case: This appears to be a Supreme Court opinion discussing various constitutional cases
  * Target Case: Groppi v. Leslie, 404 U.S. 496
  * Note: The case is referenced twice, once directly and once as ""Groppi, supra""
- Review the context in which the Target Case is mentioned
- Look for any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Determine if there's any overruling

2. Analysis:
- The Target Case is cited in two contexts:
  * First as an example of procedural due process cases
  * Second in reference to other procedural due process cases
- The passage appears to be using the Target Case as supporting precedent
- There are no Explicit Negative Actions (no statements of overruling)
- There are no Implicit Negative Actions (no conflicting holdings)
- The Target Case is being cited positively as valid precedent

- The passage treats the Target Case as valid authority
- No indication of overruling or negative treatment

**Plan:**
1. Identify key cases:
   - Acting Case: Puerto Rico v. Branstad (1987)
   - Target Case: Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861)
   - Irrelevant Cases: Various other cases mentioned

2. Look for Explicit/Implicit Negative Actions by the Acting Case toward the Target Case

3. Focus on the majority opinion's treatment of the Target Case

**Analysis:**
The Acting Case (Puerto Rico v. Branstad) explicitly overrules the Target Case. This is evident from multiple clear statements:

1. The Court directly states they are reconsidering the Target Case's holding.

2. In Passage 4, the Court explicitly states about the Target Case: ""We conclude that it may stand no longer.""

3. Justice Scalia's concurrence confirms the overruling: ""overruling Kentucky v. Dennison... insofar as it interpreted the predecessor of that statute.""

4. The majority opinion explains why the Target Case's reasoning is no longer valid, citing significant changes in constitutional principles since 1861.

  2. Look for implicit negative actions that might invalidate Bell v. Wolfish
  3. Analyze how Bell v. Wolfish is being used in the context

2. Analysis:
- The Target Case is consistently cited as valid precedent
- Passage 1: Uses Target Case as supporting authority
- Passage 2: Discusses and explains the Target Case's holding about prison regulations
- Passage 3: References Target Case as part of established precedent
- No explicit or implicit negative actions are taken against the Target Case
- The Target Case is being used to support current legal reasoning

2. Analysis:
- The passages discuss a legislative change that modified the effect of the Target Case
- The Texas Legislature passed Article 37.10(b) to change the rule established in Bogany
- However, this is a legislative action, not a court overruling
- The Acting Case actually uses Bogany to explain the historical context and does not overrule it
- The change in law came from the legislature, not from the court's ruling

3. Conclusion:
The Target Case was not overruled by the Acting Case. While the Texas Legislature passed a law to change the rule established in Bogany, this does not constitute overruling by the Acting Case. Legislative modification of a rule is distinct from judicial overruling.

- The majority opinion appears to be changing this rule to allow warrantless searches of containers in cars when there is probable cause

- Determine if the Target Case is being upheld or overruled
- Check if citations are merely referential or indicate overruling

Analysis:
- Passage 1: Cites Target Case positively regarding finality of state criminal convictions

- Target Case: United States v. Paradise, 480 U.S. 149
- Several Irrelevant Cases mentioned (Bakke, Fullilove, etc.)

2. Steps to analyze:
- Review all three passages for any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Focus only on how the Acting Case treats the Target Case
- Ignore discussions of other cases
- Check if there are any dissenting opinions that need to be distinguished

Analysis:
- Passage 1: Cites Target Case positively regarding equal protection
- Passage 2: References Target Case to note lack of consensus on constitutional analysis
- Passage 3: Cites Target Case positively as a recent example where race-based remedy was justified
- No Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions found
- The Acting Case appears to use Target Case as supporting precedent

- Review all passages for explicit statements about overruling Bramblett
- Look for the court's final holding
- Check if this is a majority opinion or dissent
- Identify any clear negative actions taken against the Target Case

3. Analysis:
- In Passage 6, there is an explicit statement: ""Bramblett is hereby overruled.""
- This appears in the majority opinion section before the dissenting opinions
- The overruling is clear and direct
- The court provides extensive reasoning for why it is overruling Bramblett
- Passages 7-8 contain dissenting opinions which disagree with overruling Bramblett, confirming that the majority did overrule it

- Acting Case: This appears to be a Supreme Court case reviewing the Target Case
- Target Case: 11 F.3d 1016 (appears multiple times in different passages)
- Multiple other cases are mentioned but are irrelevant for our analysis

2. Plan for analysis:
- Review all mentions of the Target Case across passages
- Determine if the Acting Case takes any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions
- Focus on the court's majority opinion, not dissenting views
- Look for clear overruling language or contradictory holdings

3. Analysis of passages:
- Passage 1: Introduces the Target Case as a lower court decision
- Passage 2: Agrees with the Target Case's interpretation
- Passage 3: Discusses the Target Case in context of analyzing another case
- Passage 4: Contains dissenting opinions (should be disregarded)
- Passage 5: Provides procedural history
- Passage 6: References the Target Case regarding remedies

4. Key findings:
- The Acting Case appears to agree with the Target Case's main conclusions
- No explicit overruling language is found
- The majority opinion seems to validate rather than contradict the Target Case

2. Analysis:
- In Passage 1, there is explicit overruling language: ""we are asked to reconsider that decision in light of subsequent decisions of this Court. We conclude that Albrecht should be overruled.""
- The subsequent passages detail the Court's reasoning for overruling Albrecht, including:
  * Criticism of Albrecht's theoretical justifications

- Review all mentions of the Target Case
- Determine if any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions are taken
- Focus only on the relationship between the Acting Case and Target Case
- Ignore discussions about other cases being overruled

3. Analysis:
- The passages cite Will multiple times
- The citations are used to:
  - Reference precedent about discrimination in judicial taxation
  - Discuss specific aspects of Will's holdings
  - Clarify points that were not decided in Will
- No language indicating Will is being overruled
- The court actually relies on and applies Will's principles
