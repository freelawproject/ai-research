**Dissenting Opinion**
An abstraction having such profoundly pernicious consequences is not made less so by characterizing the 1974 amendments as legislation directed against the “States qua States.” Ante, at 847. See ante, at 845, 854. Of course, regulations that this Court can say are not regulations of “commerce” cannot stand, Santa Cruz Fruit Packing Co. v. NLRB, 303 U. S. 453, 466 (1938), and in this sense “[t]he Court has ample power to prevent . . . 'the Utter destruction of the State as a sovereign political entity.’ ” Maryland v. Wirtz, 392 U. S. 183, 196 (1968). 3 But my *861 Brethren make no claim that the 1974 amendments are not regulations of “commerce”; rather they overrule Wirtz in disagreement with historic principles that United States v. <targetCase>California, supra</targetCase>, reaffirmed: “[W]hile the commerce power has limits, valid general regulations of commerce do not cease to be regulations of commerce because a State is involved. If a State is engaging in economic activities that are validly regulated by the Federal Government when engaged in by private persons, the State too may be forced to conform its activities to federal regulation.” Wirtz, supra, at 196-197. Clearly, therefore, my Brethren are also repudiating the long line of our precedents holding that a judicial finding that Congress has not unreasonably regulated a subject matter of “commerce” brings to an end the judicial role. “Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the constitution, and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that end, which are not prohibited, but consist with the letter and spirit of the constitution, are constitutional.” M'Culloch v. Maryland, supra, at 421. The reliance of my Brethren upon the Tenth Amendment as “an express declaration of [a state sovereignty] limitation,” ante, at 842, 4 not only suggests that they *862 overrule governing decisions of this Court that address this question but must astound scholars of the Constitution. For not only early decisions, Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 196; M‘Culloch v. Maryland, supra, at 404-407; and Martin v. Hunter’s Lessee, 1 Wheat. 304, 324— 325 (1816), hold that nothing in the Tenth Amendment constitutes a limitation on congressional exercise of powers delegated by the Constitution to Congress.
