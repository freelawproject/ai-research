 If subcontracts are awarded to two or more DBEs, 10 percent of the final amount of the approved DBE subcontracts, not to exceed 2 percent of the original contract amount.” App. 24-26.  To benefit from this clause, Mountain Gravel had to hire a subcontractor who had been certified as a small disadvantaged business by the SBA, a state highway agency, or some other certifying authority acceptable to the contracting officer.  Any of the three routes to such certification described above — SBA’s 8(a) or 8(d) program, or certification by a State *210 under the DOT regulations — would meet that requirement.  The record does not reveal how Gonzales obtained its certification as a small disadvantaged business.  After losing the guardrail subcontract to Gonzales, Ada-rand filed suit against various federal officials in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, claiming that the race-based presumptions involved in the use of subcontracting compensation clauses violate Adarand’s right to equal protection.  The District Court granted the Government’s motion for summary judgment.  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Skinner, <citedDecision>790 F. Supp. 240</citedDecision> (1992).  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  16 F. 3d 1637 (1994).  It understood our decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U. S. 448 (1980), to have adopted “a lenient standard, resembling intermediate scrutiny, in assessing” the constitutionality of federal race-based action.  16 F. 3d, at 1544.  Applying that “lenient standard,” as further developed in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 647 (1990), the Court of Appeals upheld the use of subcontractor compensation clauses.  16 F. 3d, at 1547.
