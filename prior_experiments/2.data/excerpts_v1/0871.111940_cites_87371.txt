Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the Court. This case requires that we reconsider the holding of Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861), that federal courts *221 have no power to order the Governor of a State to fulfill the State’s obligation under the Extradition Clause of the Constitution, Art. IV, § 2, to deliver up fugitives from justice. I On January 25, 1981, respondent Ronald Calder, then a civilian air traffic controller employed by the Federal Aviation Administration in San Juan, Puerto Rico, struck two people with his automobile. One of the victims, Antonio de Jesus Gonzalez, was injured; his wife, Army Villalba, was killed. Villalba was eight months pregnant; her unborn child did not survive. App. 3a.

7a-8a. Respondents stipulated before the District Court that the extradition papers fully complied with the requirements of the Act. App. to Pet. for Cert. A20. The District Court dismissed the complaint, agreeing with respondents that this Court’s holding in Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861), absolutely barred any attempt to invoke federal judicial authority to compel compliance with the Clause or the Act. Civil No. 84-126-E (SD Iowa, May 22, 1985), App. to Pet. for Cert. A10. The Court of Appeals “[r]eluctantly” affirmed. 787 F. 2d 423, 424 (CA8 1986). *224 We granted certiorari, 479 U. S. 811 (1986), to consider whether the propositions concerning the limitation of federal judicial power stated in Kentucky v. Dennison in 1861 retain their validity today. We reverse. II A Kentucky v. Dennison was an action brought under this Court’s original jurisdiction to compel by writ of mandamus the extradition of a fugitive fejon. The grand jury of Wood-ford County, Kentucky, returned an indictment in October 1859 charging Willis Lago, a “free man of color,” with the crime of assisting the escape’ of a slave. 24 How., at 67. The defendant was a resident pf Ohio, and papers requesting his extradition were served upon William Dennison, the Governor of that State. Dennipon secured an opinion from Ohio’s Attorney General, who took the view that the Extradition Clause 3 covered only those acts which were crimes under the law of the asylum State, or which were “regarded as malum in se by the general judgment and conscience of civilized nations.” Id., at 69. 4 On this basis Dennison refused extradition, and Kentucky brought its mandamus action in this Court. The case was heard in February 1861, and decided on March 14.

But the Court concluded that “the words ‘it shall be the duty’ were not used as mandatory and compulsory, but as declaratory of the moral duty” created by the Constitution. Id., at 107. Such a construction was necessary, in the Court’s view, to avoid constitutional infirmity. “The act does not provide any means to compel the execution of this duty, nor inflict any punishment for neglect or refusal on the part of the Executive of the State; nor is there any clause or provision in the Constitution which arms the Government of the United States with this power. Indeed, such a power would place every State under the control and dominion of the General Government, even in the administration of its internal concerns and reserved rights. And we think it clear, that the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it.” Ibid. B Thus, for over 125 years, Kentucky v. Dennison has stood for two propositions: first, that the Extradition Clause creates a mandatory duty to deliver up fugitives upon proper demand; and second, that the federal courts have no authority under the Constitution to compel performance of this ministerial duty of delivery. As to the first of these conclusions, the passage of time has revealed no occasion for doubt. The language of the Clause is “clear and explicit.” Michigan v. *227 Doran, 439 U. S. 282, 286 (1978). Its mandatory language furthers its intended purposes: “to enable each state to bring offenders to trial as swiftly as possible in the state where the alleged offense was committed,” and “to preclude any state from becoming a sanctuary for fugitives from justice of another state.” Id., at 287; see Biddinger v. Commissioner of Police, 245 U. S. 128, 132-133 (1917); Appleyard v. Massachusetts, 203 U. S. 222, 227 (1906). The Framers of the Constitution perceived that the frustration of these objectives would create a serious impediment to national unity, and the Extradition Clause responds to that perception. “It would have been far better to omit it altogether, and to have left it to the comity of the States, and their own sense of their respective interests, than to have inserted it as conferring a right, and yet defining that right so loosely as to make it a never-failing subject of dispute and ill-will.” Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How., at 102. We reaffirm the conclusion that the commands of the Extradition Clause are mandatory, and afford no discretion to the executive officers or courts of the asylum State. See California v. Superior Court of California, 482 U. S. 400, 405-406 (1987). The second, and dispositive, holding of Kentucky v. Dennison rests upon a foundation with which time and the currents of constitutional change have dealt much less favorably. If it seemed clear to the Court in 1861, facing the looming shadow of a Civil War, that “the Federal Government, under the Constitution, has no power to impose on a State officer, as such, any duty whatever, and compel him to perform it,” 24 How., at 107, basic constitutional principles now point as clearly the other way. Within 15 years of the decision in Dennison it was said that “when a plain official duty, requiring no exercise of discretion, is to be performed, and performance is refused, any person who will sustain personal injury by such refusal may have a mandamus to compel its performance,” and it was no objection that such an order might be sought in the federal courts against a state officer. Board of Liquidation v. McComb, 92 U. S. 531, 541 (1876). *228 It has long been a settled principle that federal courts may enjoin unconstitutional action by state officials. See Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123, 155-156 (1908). It would be superfluous to restate all the occasions on which this Court has imposed upon state officials a duty to obey the requirements of the Constitution, or compelled the performance of such duties; it may suffice to refer to Brown v. Board of Education, 349 U. S. 294 (1955), and Cooper v. Aaron, 358 U. S. 1 (1958). The fundamental premise of the holding in Dennison — “that the States and the Federal Government in all circumstances must be viewed as coequal sovereigns — is not representative of the law today.” FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U. S. 742, 761 (1982). Yet, with respect to extradition, the law has remained as it was more than a century ago. Considered de novo, there is no justification for distinguishing the duty to deliver fugitives from the many other species of constitutional duty enforceable in the federal courts. Indeed the nature of the obligation here is such as to avoid many of the problems with which federal courts must cope in other circumstances. That this is a ministerial duty precludes conflict with essentially discretionary elements of state governance, and eliminates the need for continuing federal supervision of state furictions. The explicit and long-settled nature of the command, contained in a constitutional provision and a statute substantially unchanged for 200 years, eliminates the possibility that state officers will be subjected to inconsistent direction. Because the duty is directly imposed upon the States by the Constitution itself, there can be no need to weigh the performance of the federal obligation against the powers reserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment. Respondents contend, however, that an “executive common law” of extradition has developed through the efforts of Governors to employ the discretion accorded them under Dennison, and that this “common law” provides a superior alternative to the “ministerial duty” to extradite provided for by the Constitution. Tr. of Oral Arg. 21. Even assum *229 ing the existence of this tradition of “executive common law,” no weight can be accorded io it. Long continuation of decisional law or administrative practice incompatible with the requirements of the Constitution cannot overcome our responsibility to enforce thos'e requirements. See, e. g., Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954); Green v. New Kent County School Board, 391 U. S. 430 (1968). Though not articulated in theise terms, respondents’ argument is in essence a request thkt we reconsider our construction of the Extradition Clause to establish as a matter of constitutional interpretation a discretion which has hitherto been exercised solely because the Constitution’s explicit command has gone unenforced. This, for the reasons previously stated, we decline to do. C Respondents further contend that even if the holding in Kentucky v. Dennison cannot Withstand contemporary scrutiny, petitioner would not prbfit from its demise because Puerto Rico is not a State, and has no right to demand rendition of fugitives under the Extradition Clause. It is true that the words of the Clause apply only to “States,” and we have never held that the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is entitled to all the benefits confer]'ed upon the States under the Constitution. We need not decide today what applicability the Extradition Clause may have to the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, however, for the Extradition Act clearly applies. The Act requires rendition of fugitives at the request of a demanding “Territory,” as 'well as State. It was decided long ago that Puerto Rico, ais a Territory of the United States, could invoke the Act to'reclaim fugitives from its justice, see New York ex rel. Kopel v. Bingham, 211 U. S. 468 (1909), and respondents do nob challenge the correctness of that holding. The subsequent change to Commonwealth status through legislation, see 64 Stat. 319, 48 U. S. C. §§ 731b-731d, did not remove from the Government of the Commonwealth any power to demand extradition which it had possessed as a Territory, for the intention of that legislation *230 was “to accord to Puerto Rico the degree of autonomy and independence normally associated with States of the Union.” Examining Board of Engineers, Architects and Surveyors v. Flores de Otero, 426 U. S. 572, 594 (1976). Since the Act applies to Puerto Rico, the Commonwealth may invoke the power of federal courts to enforce against state officers rights created by federal statutes, including equitable relief to compel performance of federal statutory duties. See Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U. S. 1 (1980). Accordingly, Puerto Rico may predicate its mandamus action on the Act, without regard to the direct applicability of the Extradition Clause. 5 Ill Kentucky v. Dennison is the product of another time. The conception of the relation between the States and the Federal Government there announced is fundamentally incompatible with more than a century of constitutional development. Yet this decision has stood while the world of which it was a part has passed away. We conclude that it may stand no longer. The decision of the Court of Appeals is Reversed. Petitioner had previously sought to file a bill of complaint in this Court, under our original jurisdiction. Motion for leave to file the bill was denied.

Yet this decision has stood while the world of which it was a part has passed away. We conclude that it may stand no longer. The decision of the Court of Appeals is Reversed. JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE POWELL joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I join Parts I, II-A, II-C, and III of the Court's opinion. Because the Court ultimately resolves this case under the *231 Extradition Act, 18 U.S. C . § 3182, I do not find Part II-B, and its statements concerning the Extradition Clause of the Constitution, necessary to the decision of this case. Accordingly, I do not subscribe to that part of the Court's opinion. See, e. g., Jean v. Nelson, 472 U.S. 846 , 854 (1985); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352 , 361, n. 10 (1983); Ashwander v. TVA, 297 U.S. 288 , 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring). JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment. I concur in the result, and in the portions of the Court's opinion applying 18 U.S. C . § 3182 and overruling Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861), insofar as it interpreted the predecessor of that statute. I note that no party before us has asserted the lack of power of Congress to require extradition from a State to a Territory. NOTES [1] Petitioner had previously sought to file a bill of complaint in this Court, under our original jurisdiction. Motion for leave to file the bill was denied. Puerto Rico v.

If no such agent appears within thirty days from the time of the arrest, the prisoner may be discharged."
