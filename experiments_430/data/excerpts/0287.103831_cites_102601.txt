 On this record it plainly cannot be said that petitioners were engaged in a commercial rather than a religious venture.  It is a distortion of the facts of record to describe their activities as the occupation of selling books and pamphlets.  And the Pennsylvania court did not rest the judgments of conviction on that basis, though it did find *112 that petitioners “sold” the literature.  The Supreme Court of Iowa in State v. Mead, 230 Iowa 1217 , 300 N. W. 523, 524 , described the selling activities of members of this same sect as “merely incidental and collateral” to their “main object which was to preach and publicize the doctrines of their order.” And see State v. Meredith, 197 S. C. 351, 15 S. E. 2d 678 ; People v. Barber, 289 N. Y. 378, 385-386 , 46 N. E. 2d 329 .  That accurately summarizes the present record.  We do not mean to say that religious groups and the press are free from all financial burdens of government.  See Grosjean v. American Press Co., <citedDecision>297 U. S. 233, 250</citedDecision> .  We have here something quite different, for example, from a tax on the income of one who engages in religious activities or a tax on property used or employed in connection with those activities.  It-is one thing to impose a tax on the income or property of a preacher.  It is quite another thing to exact a tax from him for the privilege of delivering a sermon.  The tax imposed by the City of Jeannette is a flat license tax, the payment of which is a condition of the exercise of these constitutional privileges.  The power to tax the exercise of a privilege is the power to control or suppress its enjoyment.  Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U. S. 40, 44-45 , and cases cited.

 It is a flat license tax levied and collected as a condition to the pursuit of activities whose enjoyment is guaranteed by the First Amendment.  Accordingly, it restrains in advance those constitutional liberties of press and religion and inevitably tends to suppress their exercise.  That is almost uniformly recognized as the inherent vice and evil of this flat license tax. As stated by the Supreme Court of Illinois in a case involving this same sect and an ordinance similar to the present one, a person cannot be compelled “to purchase, through a license fee or a license tax, the privilege freely granted by the constitution.” 9 Blue Island v. Kozul, 379 Ill. 511, 519 , 41 N. E. 2d 515 .  So, it may not be said that proof is lacking that these license taxes either separately or cumulatively have restricted or are likely to restrict petitioners’ religious activities.  On their face they are a restriction of the free exercise of those freedoms which are protected by the First Amendment.  The taxes imposed by this ordinance can hardly help but be as severe and telling in their impact on the freedom *115 of the press and religion as the “taxes on knowledge” at which the First Amendment was partly aimed.  <citedDecision>Grosjean</citedDecision> v. American Press Co., supra, pp. 244-249.  They may indeed operate even more subtly.  ’ Itinerant evangelists moving throughout a state or from state to state would feel immediately the cumulative effect of such ordinances as they become fashionable.  The way of the religious dissenter has long been hard. But if the formula of this type of ordinance is approved, a new device for the suppression of religious minorities will have been found. This method of disseminating religious beliefs can be crushed and closed out by the sheer weight of the toll or tribute which is exacted town by town, village by village.  The spread of religious ideas through personal visitations by the literature ministry of numerous religious groups would be stopped.  The fact that the ordinance is “nondiscriminatory” is immaterial.  The protection afforded by the First Amendment is not so restricted.

 Is there anything in the decisions of this Court which indicates that church or press is free from the financial *128 burdens of government?  We find nothing.  Religious societies depend for their exemptions from taxation upon state constitutions or general statutes, not upon the Federal Constitution.  Gibbons v. District of Columbia, 116 U. S. 404 .  This Court has held that the chief purpose of the free press guarantee was to prevent previous restraints upon publication.  Near v. Minnesota, 283 U. S. 697, 713 .  14 In Grosjean v. American Press Co., <citedDecision>297 U. S. 233, 250</citedDecision> , it was said that the predominant purpose was to preserve “an untrammeled press as a vital source of public information.” In that case, a gross receipts tax on advertisements in papers with a circulation of more than twenty thousand copies per week was held invalid because “a deliberate and calculated device in the guise of a tax to limit the circulation.  .  .  .” There was this further comment: “It is not intended by anything we have said to suggest that the owners of newspapers are immune from any of the ordinary forms of taxation for support of the government.  But this is not an ordinary form of tax, but one single in kind, with a long history of hostile misuse against the freedom of the press.” <citedDecision>Id., 250</citedDecision> .  It may be said, however, that ours is a too narrow, technical and legalistic approach to the problem of state taxation of the activities of church and press; that we should look not to the expressed or historical meaning of the First Amendment but to the broad principles of free speech and free exercise of religion which pervade our national way of life. It may be that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees these principles rather than the more definite concept expressed in the First Amendment.  This would mean that as a Court, we should determine what sort of liberty it is that the due process clause of *129 the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees against state restrictions on speech and church.  But whether we give content to the literal words of the First Amendment or to principles of the.  liberty of the press and the church, we conclude that cities or states may levy reasonable, non-discriminatory taxes on such activities as occurred in these cases. Whatever exemptions exist from taxation arise from the prevailing law of the various states.  The constitutions of Alabama and Pennsylvania, with substantial similarity to the exemption provisions of other constitutions, forbid the taxation of lots and buildings used exclusively for religious worship.  Alabama (1901), § 91; Pennsylvania (1874), Art. IX, § 1.

 “The Freedom of Speech, and of the Press, and the right of the People peaceably to assemble, and consult for their common good, and to apply to the Government for a redress of grievances, shall not be infringed.” Records of the United States Senate, 1A-C2 (U. S. Nat. Archives).  Apparently when the proposed amendments were passed by the Senate on September 9,1789, what is now the first amendment read as follows: “Congress shall make no law establishing articles of faith, or a mode of worship, or prohibiting the free exercise of religion, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition to the government for a redress of grievances.” Id.
