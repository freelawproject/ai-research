<p id="b701-6">Whatever effect the Court’s decision may have in weakening the application of <em>stare decisis, </em>it is likely to be less <page-number citation-index="1" label="560">*560</page-number>important than what the Court has done to the Constitution itself. A unique feature of the United States is <em>the federal </em>system of government guaranteed by the Constitution and implicit in the very name of our country. Despite some genuflecting in the Court’s opinion to the concept of federalism, today’s decision effectively reduces the Tenth Amendment to meaningless rhetoric when Congress acts pursuant to the Commerce Clause. The Court hoids that the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) “contravened no_affirmative limit on Congress’ power under the Commerce Clause” to determine the wage rates and hours of employment of all state and local employees. <em>Ante, </em>at 556. In rejecting the traditional view of our federal system, the Court states:</p>
<blockquote id="b702-5">“Apart from the limitation on federal authority inherent in the delegated nature of Congress’ Article I powers, the principal means chosen by the Framers to ensure the role of the States in the federal system lies in the <em>structure of </em>the Federal Government itself.” <em>Ante, </em>at 550 (emphasis added).</blockquote>
<p id="b702-6">To leave no doubt about its intention, the Court renounces its decision in <em>National League of </em>Cities"because it “inevitably invites an unelected federal judiciary to make decisions about which state policies its favors and which ones it dislikes.” <em>Ante, </em>at 546. In other words, the extent to which the States may exercise their authority, when Congress purports to act under the Commerce Clause, henceforth is to be determined from time to time by political decisions made by members of the Federal Government, decisions the Court says will not be subject to judicial review. I note that it does not seem to have occurred to the Court that <em>it </em>— an unelected majority of five Justices — today rejects almost 200 years of the understanding of the constitutional status of federalism. In doing so, there is only a single passing reference to the Tenth Amendment. Nor is so much as a dictum of any court cited in support of the view that the role of the States in the federal system may depend upon <page-number citation-index="1" label="561">*561</page-number>the grace of elected federal officials, rather than on the Constitution as interpreted by this Court.</p>
<p id="b703-4">In my opinion that follows, Part II addresses the Court’s criticisms of <em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v. Usery">National League of Cities</a></span>. </em>Part III reviews briefly the understanding of federalism that ensured the ratification of the Constitution and the extent to which this Court, until today, has recognized that the States retain a significant measure of sovereignty in our federal system. Part IV considers the applicability of the FLSA to the indisputably local service provided by an urban transit system.</p>
<p id="b703-5">II</p>
<p id="b703-6">The Court finds that the test of state immunity approved in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v. Usery">National League of Cities</a></span> </em>and its progeny is unworkable and unsound in principle. In finding the test to be unworkable, the Court begins by mischaracterizing <em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v. Usery">National League of Cities</a></span> </em>and subsequent cases. In concluding that efforts to define state immunity are unsound in principle, the Court radically departs from long-settled constitutional values and ignores the role of judicial review in our system of government.</p>
<p id="b703-7">A</p>
<p id="b703-8">Much of the Court’s opinion is devoted to arguing that it is difficult to define <em>a priori </em>“traditional governmental functions.” <em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v.

This omission is noteworthy, since the author of today’s opinion joined <em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v.

<p id="b706-5">B</p>
<p id="b706-6">Today’s opinion does not explain how the States’jrole in the electoral process guarantees that particular exercises, of the Commerce Clause power will not infringe on residual state sovereignty.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Members of Congress are elected from the various States, but once in office they are Members of the <page-number citation-index="1" label="565">*565</page-number>Federal Government.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although the States participate in the Electoral College, this is hardly a reason to view the President as a representative of the States’ interest against federal encroachment.

The Court offers no reason to think that this pressure will not operate when Congress seeks to invoke its powers under the Commerce Clause, notwithstanding the electoral role of the States.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b708-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="566">*566</page-number>The Court apparently thinks that the States’ success at obtaining federal funds for various projects and exemptions from the obligations of some federal statutes is indicative of the “effectiveness of the federal political process in preserving the States’ interests. . . .” <em>Ante, </em>at 552.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But such political success is not relevant to the question whether the political <em>processes </em>are the proper means of enforcing constitutional limitations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The fact that Congress generally <page-number citation-index="1" label="567">*567</page-number>does not transgress constitutional limits on its power to reach state activities does not make judicial review any less necessary to rectify the cases in which it does do so.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The States’ role in our system of government is a matter of constitutional law, not of legislative grace. “The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people.” U. S. Const., Amdt. 10.</p>
<p id="b709-4">More troubling than the logical infirmities in the Court’s reasoning is the result of its holding, <em>i. e., </em>that federal political officials, invoking the Commerce Clause, are the sole judges of the limits of their own power. This result is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of our constitutional system. See, <em>e. g., </em>The Federalist No. 78 (Hamilton). At least since <em>Marbury </em>v. <em>Madison, </em><span class="citation" data-id="84759"><a href="/opinion/84759/marbury-v-madison/#177" aria-description="Citation for case: Marbury v. Madison">1 Cranch 137, 177</a></span> (1803), it has been the settled province of the federal judiciary “to say what the law is” with respect to the constitutionality of Acts of Congress. In rejecting the role of the judiciary in protecting the States from federal overreaching, the Court’s opinion offers no explanation for ignoring the teaching of the most famous case in our history.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b710-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="568">*568</page-number>Ill</p>
<p id="b710-5">A</p>
<p id="b710-6">In our federal system, the States have a major role that cannot be pre-empted by the National Government. As contemporaneous writings and the debates at the ratifying conventions make clear, the States’ ratification of the Constitution was predicated on this understanding of federalism. Indeed, the Tenth Amendment was adopted specifically to ensure that the important role promised the States by the proponents of the Constitution was realized.</p>
<p id="b710-7">Much of the initial opposition to the Constitution was rooted in the fear that the National Government would be too powerful and eventually would eliminate the States as viable political entities. This concern was voiced repeatedly until proponents of the Constitution made assurances that a Bill of Rights, including a provision explicitly reserving powers in the States, would be among the first business of the new Congress. Samuel Adams argued, for example, that if the several States were to be joined in “one entire Nation, under one Legislature, the Powers of which shall extend to every Subject of Legislation, and its Laws be supreme &amp; controul the whole, the Idea of Sovereignty in these States must be lost.” Letter from Samuel Adams to Richard Henry Lee (Dec. 3, 1787), reprinted in Anti-Federalists versus Federal<page-number citation-index="1" label="569">*569</page-number>ists 159 (J. Lewis ed. 1967). Likewise, George Mason feared that “the general government being paramount to, and in every respect more powerful than the state governments, the latter must give way to the former.” Address in the Ratifying Convention of Virginia (June 4-12, 1788), reprinted in Anti-Federalists versus Federalists, <em>supra, </em>at 208-209.</p>
<p id="b711-4">Antifederalists raised these concerns in almost every state ratifying convention.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> See generally 1-4 Debates in the Several State Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution (J. Elliot 2d. ed. 1876). As a result, eight States voted for the Constitution only after proposing amendments to be adopted after ratification.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> All eight of these included among their recommendations some version of what later became the Tenth Amendment. <em>Ibid. </em>So strong was the concern that the proposed Constitution was seriously defective without a specific bill of rights, including a provision reserving powers to the States, that in order to secure the votes for ratification, the Federalists eventually conceded that such provisions were necessary. See 1 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights: A Documentary History 505 and <em>passim, </em>(1971). It was thus generally agreed that consideration of a bill of rights would be among the first business of the new Congress. See generally 1 Annals of Cong. 432-437 (1789) (remarks of James Madison). Accordingly, the 10 Amendments that we know as the Bill of Rights were proposed and adopted early in the first session of the First Congress. 2 Schwartz, The Bill of Rights, <em>supra, </em>at 983-1167.</p>
<p id="b712-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="570">*570</page-number>This history, which the Court simply ignores, documents the integral role of the Tenth Amendment in our constitutional theory. It exposes as well, I believe, the fundamental character of the Court’s error today. Far from being “unsound in principle,” <em>ante, </em>at 546, judicial enforcement of the Tenth Amendment is essential to maintaining the federal system so carefully designed by the Framers and adopted in the Constitution.</p>
<p id="b712-5">B</p>
<p id="b712-6">The Framers had definite ideas about the nature of the Constitution’s division of authority between the Federal and State Governments. In The Federalist No. 39, for example, Madison explained this division by drawing a series of contrasts between the attributes of a “national” government and those of the government to be established by the Constitution. While a national form of government would possess an “indefinite supremacy over all persons and things,” the form of government contemplated by the Constitution instead consisted of “local or municipal authorities [which] form distinct and independent portions of the supremacy, no more subject within their respective spheres to the general authority, than the general authority is subject to them, within its own sphere.” <em>Id., </em>at 256 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Under the Constitution, the sphere of the proposed government extended to jurisdiction of “certain enumerated objects only,... leaving] to the several States a residuary and inviolable sovereignty over all other objects.” <em>Ibid.</em></p>
<p id="b712-7">Madison elaborated on the content of these separate spheres of sovereignty in The Federalist No. 45:</p>
<blockquote id="b712-8">“The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution ’ to the Federal Government, are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State Governments, are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negociation, and foreign commerce .... The powers <page-number citation-index="1" label="571">*571</page-number>reserved to the several States will extend to all the objects, which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the lives, liberties and properties of the people; and the internal order, improvement, and prosperity of the State.” <em>Id., </em>at 313 (J. Cooke ed. 1961).</blockquote>
<p id="b713-4">Madison considered that the operations of the Federal Government would be “most extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the State Governments in times of peace and security.” <em>Ibid. </em>As a result of this division of powers, the state governments generally would be more important than the Federal Government. <em>Ibid.</em></p>
<p id="b713-5">The Framers believed that the separate sphere of sovereignty reserved to the States would ensure that the States would serve as an effective “counterpoise” to the power of the Federal Government. The States would serve this essential role because they would attract and retain the loyalty of their citizens. The roots of such loyalty, the Founders thought, were found in the objects peculiar to state government. For example, Hamilton argued that the States “regulat[e] all those personal interests and familiar concerns to which the sensibility of individuals is more immediately awake . . . .” The Federalist No. 17, p. 107 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Thus, he maintained that the people would perceive the States as “the immediate and visible guardian of life and property,” a fact which “contributes -more__than any other circumstance to impressing upon the minds of the people affection, esteem and reverence towards the government.” <em>Ibid. </em>Madison took the same position, explaining that “the people will be more familiarly and minutely conversant” with the business of state governments, and “with the members of these, will a greater proportion of the people have the ties of personal acquaintance and friendship, and of family and party attachments . . . .” The Federalist No. 46, p. 316 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). Like Hamilton, Madison saw the States’ involvement in the everyday concerns of the people as the source of <page-number citation-index="1" label="572">*572</page-number>their citizens’ loyalty. <em>Ibid. </em>See also Nagel, Federalism as a Fundamental Value: National League of Cities in Perspective, 1981 S. Ct. Rev. 81.</p>
<p id="b714-5">Thus, the harm to the States that results from federal overreaching under the Commerce Clause is not simply a matter of dollars and cents. <em>National League of Cities, </em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/#846" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v. Usery">426 U. S., at 846-851</a></span>. Nor is it a matter of the -wisdom or folly of certain policy choices. Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 546. Rather, by usurping functions traditionally performed by the States, federal overreaching under the Commerce Clause undermines the constitutionally mandated balance of power between the States and the Federal Government, a balance designed to protect our fundamental liberties.</p>
<p id="b714-6">C</p>
<p id="b714-7">The emasculation of the powers of the States that can result from the Court’s decision is predicated on the Commerce Clause as a power “delegated to the United States” by the Constitution. The relevant language states: “Congress shall have power... To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” Art. I, § 8, cl. 3. Section 8 identifies a score of powers, listing the authority to lay taxes, borrow money on the credit of the United States, pay its debts, and provide for the common defense and the general welfare <em>before </em>its brief reference to “Commerce.” It is clear from the debates leading up to the adoption of the Constitution that the commerce to be regulated was that which the States themselves lacked the practical capability to regulate. See, <em>e. g., </em>1 <em>M. </em>Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787 (rev. ed. 1937); The Federalist Nos. 7, 11, 22, 42, 45. See also <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Wyoming, </em><span class="citation" data-id="110881"><a href="/opinion/110881/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-wyoming/#265" aria-description="Citation for case: Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Wyoming">460 U. S. 226, 265</a></span> (1983) (Powell, J., dissenting). Indeed, the language of the Clause itself focuses on activities that only a National Government could regulate: commerce with foreign nations and Indian tribes and <em>“among” </em>the several States.</p>
<p id="b715-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="573">*573</page-number>To be sure, this Court has construed the Commerce Clause to accommodate unanticipated changes over the past two centuries. As these changes have occurred, the Court has had to decide whether the Federal Government has exceeded its authority by regulating activities beyond the capability of a single State to regulate or beyond legitimate federal interests that outweighed the authority and interests of the States. In so doing, however, the Court properly has been mindful of the essential role of the States in our federal system.</p>

<p id="b715-5">This Court has recognized repeatedly that state sovereignty is a fundamental component of our system of government.

<p id="b716-6">D</p>
<p id="b716-7">In contrast, the Court today propounds a view of federalism that pays only lipservice to the role of the States. Although it says that the States “unquestionably do 'retai[n] a significant measure of sovereign authority,’” <em>ante, </em>at 549 (quoting <em><span class="citation" data-id="110881"><a href="/opinion/110881/equal-employment-opportunity-commission-v-wyoming/" aria-description="Citation for case: Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v.

Wyoming"><em>Wyoming, supra, </em>at 269</a></span> (Powell, J., dissenting)), it fails to recognize the broad, yet specific areas of sovereignty that the Framers intended the States to retain. Indeed, the Court barely acknowledges that the Tenth Amendment exists.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> That Amendment states explicitly that “[t]he powers not delegated to the United States . . . are reserved to the States.” The Court recasts this language to say that the States retain their sovereign powers “only to the extent that the Constitution has not divested them of their original powers and transferred those powers to the Federal <page-number citation-index="1" label="575">*575</page-number>Government.” <em>Ante, </em>at 549. This rephrasing is not a distinction without a difference; rather, it reflects the Court’s unprecedented view that Congress is free under the Commerce Clause to assume a State’s traditional sovereign power, and to do so without judicial review of its action. Indeed, the Court’s view of federalism appears to relegate the States to precisely the trivial role that opponents of the Constitution feared they would occupy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b717-4">In <em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v.

Usery">426 U. S., at 851</a></span>. Not only are these activities remote from any normal concept of interstate commerce, they are also activities that epitomize the concerns of local, democratic self-government. See n. 5, <em>supra. </em>In emphasizing the need to protect traditional governmental functions, we identified the kinds of activities engaged in by state and local governments that affect the everyday lives of citizens. These are services that people are in a position to understand and evaluate, and in a democracy, have the right to oversee.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We recognized that “it is <page-number citation-index="1" label="576">*576</page-number>functions such as these which governments are created to provide ...” and that the States and local governments are better able than the National Government to perform them. <span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/#851" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v.

<p id="b718-5">The Court maintains that the standard approved in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v. Usery">National League of Cities</a></span> </em>“disserves principles of democratic self-governance.” <em>Ante, </em>at 547. In reaching this conclusion, the Court looks myopically only to persons elected to positions in the Federal Government. It disregards entirely the far more effective role of democratic self-government at the state and local levels. One must compare realistically the operation of the state and local governments with that of the Federal Government. Federal legislation is drafted primarily by the staffs of the congressional committees. In view of the hundreds of bills introduced at each session of Congress and the complexity of many of them, it is virtually impossible for even the most conscientious legislators to be truly familiar with many of the statutes enacted. Federal departments and agencies customarily are authorized to write regulations. Often these are more important than the text of the statutes. As is true of the original legislation, these are drafted largely by staff personnel. The administration and enforcement of federal laws and regulations necessarily are largely in the hands of staff and civil service employees. These employees may have little or no knowledge of the States and localities that will be affected by the statutes and regulations for which they are responsible. In any case, they hardly are as accessible and responsive <page-number citation-index="1" label="577">*577</page-number>as those who occupy analogous positions in state and local governments.</p>
<p id="b719-4">In drawing this contrast, I imply no criticism of these federal employees or the officials who are ultimately in charge. The great majority are conscientious and faithful to their duties. My point is simply that members of the immense federal bureaucracy are not elected, know less about the services traditionally rendered by States and localities, and are inevitably less responsive to recipients of such services, than are state legislatures, city councils, boards of supervisors, and state and local commissions, boards, and agencies. It is at these state and local levels — not in Washington as the Court so mistakenly thinks — that “democratic self-government” is best exemplified.</p>
<p id="b719-5">IV</p>
<p id="b719-6">The question presented in these cases is whether the extension of the FLSA to the wages and hours of employees of a city-owned transit system unconstitutionally impinges on fundamental state sovereignty. The Court’s sweeping holding does far more than simply answer this question in the negative. In overruling <em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v.

Thus, for purposes of federal regulation, the Court rejects the distinction between public and private employers that had been drawn carefully in <em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v.

<p id="b720-5">The Court emphasizes that municipal operation of an intra-city mass transit system is relatively new in the life of our country. It nevertheless is a classic example of the type of service traditionally provided by local government. It is <em>local </em>by definition. It is indistinguishable in principle from the traditional services of providing and maintaining streets, public lighting, traffic control, water, and sewerage systems.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Services of this kind are precisely those with which citizens are more “familiarly and minutely conversant.” The Federalist No. 46, p. 316 (J. Cooke ed. 1961). State and local officials of course must be intimately familiar with these services and sensitive to their quality as well as cost. Such <page-number citation-index="1" label="579">*579</page-number>officials also know that their constituents and the press respond to the adequacy, fair distribution, and cost of these services.

Moreover, rather than carefully analyzing the case law, the Court simply lists various functions thought to be protected or unprotected by courts interpreting <em>National League of Cities.

In the cited cases, however, the courts considered the issue of state immunity on the specific facts at issue; they did not make blanket pronouncements that particular things inherently qualified as traditional governmental functions or did not. Having thus considered the cases out of context, it was not difficult for the Court to conclude that there is no “organizing principle” among them. See <em>ante, </em>at 539.</p>

<p id="b705-4"> In undertaking such balancing, we have considered, on the one hand, the strength of the federal interest in the challenged legislation and the impact of exempting the States from its reach. Central to our inquiry into the federal interest is how closely the challenged action implicates the central concerns of the Commerce Clause, viz., the promotion of a national economy and free trade among the States.

<p id="b706-12"> Late in its opinion, the Court suggests that after all there may be some “affirmative limits the constitutional structure might impose on federal action affecting the States under the Commerce Clause.” <em>Ante, </em>at 556. The Court asserts that “[i]n the factual setting of these cases the internal safeguards of the political process have performed as intended.” <em>Ibid. </em>The Court does not explain the basis for this judgment. Nor does it identify the circumstances in which the “political process” may fail and “affirmative limits” are to be imposed. Presumably, such limits are to be determined by the Judicial Branch even though it is “unelected.” Today’s opinion, however, has rejected the balancing standard and suggests no other standard that would enable a court to determine when there has been a malfunction of the “political process.” The Court’s failure to specify the “affirmative limits” on federal power, or when and how these limits are to be determined, may well be'explained by the transparent fact that any such attempt would be subject to precisely the same objections on which it relies to overrule <em><span class="citation" data-id="109499"><a href="/opinion/109499/national-league-of-cities-v-usery/" aria-description="Citation for case: National League of Cities v.

<p id="b707-5"> At one time in our history, the view that the structure of the Federal Government sufficed to protect the States might have had a somewhat more practical, although not a more logical, basis. Professor Wechsler, whose seminal article in 1954 proposed the view adopted by the Court today, predicated his argument on assumptions that simply do not accord with current reality. Professor Wechsler wrote: “National action has . . . always been regarded as exceptional in our polity, an intrusion to be justified by some necessity, the special rather than the ordinary case.” Wechsler, The Political Safeguards of Federalism: The Role of the States in the Composition and Selection of the National Government, <span class="citation no-link">54 Colum. L. Rev. 543</span>, 544 (1954). Not only is the premise of this view clearly at odds with the proliferation of national legislation over the past 30 years, but “a variety of structural and political changes occurring in this century have combined to make Congress particularly <em>insensitive </em>to state and local values.” Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), Regulatory Federalism: Policy, Process, Impact and Reform 50 (1984). The adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment (providing for direct election of Senators), the weakening of political parties on the local level, and the rise of national media, among other things, have made Congress increasingly less representative of state and local interests, and more likely to be responsive to the demands of various national constituencies. <em>Id., </em>at 50-51. As one observer explained: “As Senators and members of the House develop independent constituencies among groups such as farmers, businessmen, laborers, environmentalists, and the poor, each of which generally supports certain national initiatives, their tendency to identify with state interests and the positions of state officials is reduced.” Kaden, <page-number citation-index="1" label="566">*566</page-number>Federalism in the Courts: Agenda for the 1980s, in ACIR, The Future of Federalism in the 1980s, p. 97 (July 1981).</p>

<p id="b708-7"> The Court believes that the significant financial assistance afforded the States and localities by the Federal Government is relevant to the constitutionality of extending Commerce Clause enactments to the States. See <em>ante, at </em>552-553, 555.
