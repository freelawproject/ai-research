**Combined Opinion**
315 U. S., at 684 (emphasis added).  Its conclusion was driven by the language of the Treaty as well as the report of the treaty negotiations and what it revealed to be the Yakimas' understanding of the TreatyÂ—to preserve their right "to hunt and fish in accordance with the immemorial customs of their tribes.  " Ibid. (emphasis added).  [1] Subsequent decisions evaluating state regulation by the conservation necessity standard similarly focused upon the language of the Treaty or agreement at issue and the Indians' understanding of the Treaty as revealed by the historical evidence.  See Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Assn., 443 U. S. 658, 665-669, 674685 (1979) (recognizing that the Court had construed the same Treaty language several times before, and emphasizing *224 the historical background against which the Treaty at issue was signed); Puyallup Tribe v. Department of Game of Wash., 391 U. S. 392, 395, 397 (1968) (involving treaty language almost identical to that at issue in United States v. Winans, 198 U. S. 371 (1905), and Tulee, supra ); see also Antoine v. Washington, 420 U. S. 194, 206 (1975) (favorably comparing the somewhat different language of the agreement at issue with the language of the Treaties at issue in Winans and Puyallup ).  Most important, all the cases that the majority cites in support of the proposition that States may enforce against Indians in their exercise of off-reservation usufructuary activities only those regulations necessary for purposes of conservation, ante, at 204-205, involved the same or substantially similar treaty language reserving a right to hunt or fish. And all but Antoine also provided that the Indians could exercise their reserved rights at the usual and accustomed places.  In New York ex rel. Kennedy v. Becker, <citedDecision>241 U. S. 556</citedDecision> (1916), the Court considered significantly different language.  The Big Tree Treaty of 1797, as the agreement was known, provided that the Seneca were to retain "the privilege of fishing and hunting on the said tract of land" conveyed by the agreement.  7 Stat. 602 (emphasis added); see also <citedDecision>241 U. S., at 562</citedDecision> (quoting the reservation clause).  The Court characterized the Senecas' claim as one "sought to be maintained in derogation of the sovereignty of the State." <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> In rejecting such a claim, it stated: "[I]t can hardly be supposed that the thought of the Indians was concerned with the necessary exercise of inherent power under modern conditions for the preservation of wild life. But the existence of the sovereignty of the State was well understood, and this conception involved all that was necessarily implied in that sovereignty, whether fully appreciated or not.  We do not think that it is a proper construction of the reservation in the conveyance to regard it as an attempt either to *225 reserve sovereign prerogative or so to divide the inherent power of preservation as to make its competent exercise impossible.  Rather we are of the opinion that the clause is fully satisfied by considering it a reservation of a privilege of fishing and hunting upon the granted lands in common with the grantees, and others to whom the privilege might be extended, but subject nevertheless to that necessary power of appropriate reg- ulation, as to all those privileged, which inhered in the sovereignty of the State over the lands where the privi- lege was exercised.  " <citedDecision>Id., at 563-564</citedDecision> (emphasis added).  The only fair reading of Kennedy is that the Treaty reserved for the Seneca a privilege in common with all persons to whom the State chose to extend fishing and hunting privileges.  The Court did not indicate that the Treaty limited New York's regulatory authority with respect to the Seneca in any way.  See <citedDecision>id., at 564</citedDecision> (the treaty privilege was subject to "that necessary power of appropriate regulation, as to all those privileged, which inhered in the sovereignty of the State over the lands where the privilege was exercised" (emphasis added)).  Of course, then, what was "appropriate" state regulation as applied to non-Indians was "appropriate" regulation as applied to the Seneca.  Cf. Puyallup Tribe, supra, at 402, n. 14 ("The measure of the legal propriety of [regulations that are to be measured by the conservation necessity standard] is .  .  .  distinct from the federal constitutional standard concerning the scope of the police power of a State").  [2] *226 The 1837 Treaty at issue here did not reserve "the right of taking fish at all usual and accustomed places, in common with citizens of the Territory" like those involved in Tulee and Puyallup Tribe .
