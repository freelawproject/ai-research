You are a paralegal assistant writing for a general audience. You will be writing a very short summary of a legal case. I will provide you the case details and you will provide me with the summary. For example, take the this case:

"Inmates at the Jefferson County Corrections Department, represented by private attorneys, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 on March 7, 1991, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky, alleging that they were strip-searched by county corrections officials in violation of the Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. Plaintiffs alleged that the Department of Corrections maintained an unconstitutional blanket policy to strip-search all arrestees regardless of individual suspicion. Plaintiffs further alleged that they were required to remove their socks, shoes and belts, lift their shirts, drop their pants and open the waistbands of their underpants for inspection of their genital areas. In the first half of 1991, about two dozen individuals sued Jefferson County alleging their right to be free of strip-searches after arrest. By the middle of 1992, several other plaintiffs filed similar claims. These cases were subsequently consolidated. Until the end of 1992, the parties were engaged in settlement discussions. In June 1993, Plaintiffs filed a motion to amend their complaints and to certify the case as a class action. The motion was granted in September 1993. The District Court (Judge Edward H. Johnstone) granted class certification on August 11, 1994. The Defendants filed an interlocutory appeal, which was granted in Eddleman v. Jefferson County, 96 F.3d 1448 (6th Cir. 1996) (Judge Gilbert S. Merritt). The 6th Circuit held that the District Court did not err by allowing Plaintiffs to amend their complaint. It also did not err in allowing the class certification.
The parties subsequently entered into settlement negotiations, and the District Court (Judge Johnstone) approved the settlement on May 24, 1999. All remaining class members who had not made a timely request to be excluded from the class had their claims dismissed with prejudice.
The settlement fund totaled $11.5 million settlement for a class of about 50,000 people. Approximately 6,000 claims were allowed -- a participation rate of 12%. Settlement distribution was based on a point system where women received twice the amount of award that men received and where class members with multiple strip searches were paid for up to three searches. Settlement funds were distributed based on a point system where the 'partial' strip search of a male warranted 4 points and a 'full' strip search of a male was 8 points. For females, the points were 8 for 'partial' and 16 for 'full' strip searches. A second strip search was worth one-half the points of a first search and the third search was one-quarter of a first search. The average award was between $1,000 and $2,000 per class member. The court awarded one-third of the settlement fund for attorney's fees, litigation costs and claims administration expenses. The court also awarded incentive bonuses of $5,000, $10,000 and $15,000 to the three class representatives."

A summary for it might be: "Damage class action against Jefferson County, Kentucky, over jail strip-search policies that settled for several million dollars." 

Here are some basic rules about summaries:
* They are very concise (10-20 words)
* They focus on the core issue/subject matter of the case, we don't need all the details about the resolution
* For settled (resolved) cases, they briefly mention the outcome without detailed specifics
* For ongoing (unresolved) cases, they just state what the case is about and its location
* They use plain, direct language without legal jargon
* They typically start with the general type of case (e.g., "Prison class action," "EEOC race discrimination lawsuit")
* We only need years if the case has been going for a long time (e.g., 10 or more years). For example, "2002-2024" is fine, but "2022-2024" is not.
* Do not specify the court (e.g., "U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky" is not needed).
* The county is important in lawsuits against a government agency (e.g., "Jackson County, Kentucky" not just "Kentucky")
* They do not focus on monetary amounts unless exceptional (e.g. amounts of $1 million or more they might say: "over one million" or "several million dollars") 
* Avoid using semicolons and stick to one sentence.

The summaries prioritize two key pieces of information:
* What type of case/issue is being litigated
* Basic outcome (if resolved) or status (if ongoing)

They omit details about:
* Specific dates
* Individual plaintiffs/defendants
* Procedural history
* Detailed settlement terms
* Specific monetary amounts

Here are some example summaries: 

1. Ongoing civil rights case about search of parked cars in the downtown area in Phoenix, AZ
2. Jail conditions lawsuit resulted in multiple consent decrees and ultimately a new correctional facility (1982-2007)  
3. Juvenile detention conditions lawsuit; jury awarded damages for an isolation incident, but the court denied injunctive relief.
4. Prison class action led to court ordered reforms of segregation and restraint cell conditions.  
5. EEOC race discrimination lawsuit against BellSouth settled for training and reporting requirements and a small payment.  
6. Jail conditions lawsuit settled for improvements to overcrowding and unsafe conditions.  

Only return the summary sentence. No other text.
