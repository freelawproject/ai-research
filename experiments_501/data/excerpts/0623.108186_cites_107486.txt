**Concurrence In Part Opinion**
 If the right were merely a procedure mandated by statute, it would not have required the ex post facto holding.  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide for a jury of 12, Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 23, and as recently as last year lower federal courts have assumed this Court's commitment to the unanimous verdict of 12.  United States v. Fioravanti, 412 F. 2d 407, 418 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1969); Williams v. United States, 332 F. 2d 36 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1964); see also, e. g., United States v. Virginia Erection Corp., 335 F. 2d 868, 870 (C. A. 4th Cir. 1964); United States v. Goldberg, 330 F. 2d 30, 42 (C. A. 3d Cir. 1964); Rogers v. United States, 319 F. 2d 5 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1963); Fournier v. Gonzalez, 269 F. 2d 26 (C. A. 1st Cir. 1959); Billeci v. United States, 87 U. S. App. D. C. 274, 184 F. 2d 394 (1950); Horne v. United States, 264 F. 2d 40 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1959); Hibdon v. United States, 204 F. 2d 834 (C. A. 6th Cir. 1953).  In addition to separate opinions noted in the text, see, e. g., Poe v. Ullman, 367 U. S. 497, 522 , at 539-545 (1961) (dissenting opinion); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 499 (1965) (concurring in the judgment); Lanza v. New York, 370 U. S. 139, 147 (1962) (concurring opinion); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 349 (1963) (concurring opinion); Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n, 378 U. S. 52, 80 (1964) (concurring in the judgment); Barber v. Page, 390 U. S. 719, 726 (1968) (concurring opinion); Berger v. New York, 388 U.

Florida, 398 U. S. 30, 38 (1970) (concurring opinion).  The right to counsel appears not to have been explicitly “incorporated,” although Gilbert v. California, 388 U. S. 263 (1967), implicitly does so. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 (1963), purported to be a determination that “fundamental fairness” requires the State to afford trial counsel to the indigent accused.  Id., at 343 .  Although I have disagreed with particular holdings like Gilbert v.

S. 218, 250</citedDecision> (1967), which I joined, this is because those decisions incorrectly require, in my view, counsel in circumstances where his presence is not necessary under either the Sixth Amendment or the Due Process Clause.  See my separate opinion in Coleman v. Alabama , decided today, ante, p. 19.  The President of the Legal Aid Society in New York City recently reported that 49% of the society’s clients who were tried in the New York City Criminal Court in 1967 (without a jury) were acquitted; there were 3,023 convictions after trial, 2,678 acquittals after trial.
