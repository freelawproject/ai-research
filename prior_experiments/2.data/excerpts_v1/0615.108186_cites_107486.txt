6th Cir. 1953). [14] In addition to separate opinions noted in the text, see, e. g., Poe v. Ullman, 367 U.S. 497 , 522, at 539-545 (1961) (dissenting opinion); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 , 499 (1965) (concurring in the judgment); Lanza v. New York, 370 U.S. 139 , 147 (1962) (concurring opinion); Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 , 349 (1963) (concurring opinion); Murphy v. Waterfront Comm'n, 378 U.S. 52 , 80 (1964) (concurring in the judgment); Barber v. Page, 390 U.S. 719 , 726 (1968) (concurring opinion); Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 , 89 (1967) (dissenting opinion); Chimel v. California, supra ; Ashe v. Swenson, 397 U.S. 436 , 448 (1970) (concurring opinion); Coleman v. Alabama , ante, p. 19 (1970) (separate opinion); Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194 , 215 (1968) (dissenting opinion); Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 , 23 (1967) (concurring in the result); Dickey v. Florida, 398 U.S. 30 , 38 (1970) (concurring opinion). [15] The right to counsel appears not to have been explicitly "incorporated," although Gilbert v. California, 388 U.S. 263 (1967), implicitly does so. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963), purported to be a determination that "fundamental fairness" requires the State to afford trial counsel to the indigent accused. Id., at 343. Although I have disagreed with particular holdings like Gilbert v. California, supra , where the Court held that the States must arrange presence of counsel at lineups, see MR. JUSTICE WHITE'S separate opinion in United States v. Wade, 388 U.S. 218 , 250 (1967), which I joined, this is because those decisions incorrectly require, in my view, counsel in circumstances where his presence is not necessary under either the Sixth Amendment or the Due Process Clause. See my separate opinion in Coleman v. Alabama , decided today, ante, p. 19.
