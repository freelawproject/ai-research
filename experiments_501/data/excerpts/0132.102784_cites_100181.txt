**Combined Opinion**
 The appellant conducts a hotel.  The appellee Elsie Parrish was employed as a chambermaid and (with her husband) brought this suit to recover the difference between the wages paid her and the minimum wage fixed pursuant to the state law. The minimum wage was $14.50 per week of 48 hours.  The appellant challenged the act as repugnant to the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  The Supreme Court of the State, reversing the trial court, sustained the statute and directed judgment for the plaintiffs.  Parrish v. West Coast Hotel Co., 185 Wash. 581 ; 55 P. (2d) 1083 .  The case is here on appeal.  The appellant relies upon the decision of this Court in Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, <citedDecision>261 U. S. 525</citedDecision> , which held invalid the District of Columbia Minimum Wage Act, which was attacked under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.  On the argument at bar, counsel for the appellees attempted to distinguish the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case upon the ground that the appellee was employed in a hotel and that the business of an innkeeper was affected with a public interest.  That effort at distinction is obviously futile, as it appears that in one of the cases ruled by the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> opinion the employee was a woman employed as an elevator operator in a hotel.  Adkins v. Lyons, <citedDecision>261 U. S. 525, at p. 542</citedDecision> .  The recent case of Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, 298 U. S. 587 , came here on certiorari to the New York court, which had held the New York minimum wage act for women to be invalid.  A minority of this Court thought that the New York statute was distinguishable in a material feature from that involved in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case, and that for that and other reasons the New *389 York statute should be sustained.  But the Court of Appeals of New York had said that it found no material difference between the two statutes, and this Court held that the “meaning of the statute” as fixed by the decision of the state court “must be accepted here as if the meaning had been specifically expressed in the enactment.” Id., p. 609.  That view led to the affirmance by this Court of the judgment in the Morehead case, as the Court considered that the only question before it was whether the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case was distinguishable and that reconsideration of that decision had not been sought.  Upon that point the Court said: “The petition for the writ sought review upon the ground that this case [Morehead] is distinguishable from that one [Adkins].  No application has been made for reconsideration of the constitutional question there decided.  The validity of the principles upon which that decision rests is not challenged.  This court confines itself to the ground upon which the writ was asked or granted .  .  .  Here the review granted was no broader than that sought by the petitioner .  .  .  He is not entitled and does not aák to be heard upon the question whether the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case should be overruled.  He maintains that it may be distinguished on the ground that the statutes are vitally dissimilar.” Id., pp. 604, 605.  We think that the question which was not deemed to be open in the Morehead case is open and is necessarily presented here.  The Supreme Court of Washington has upheld the minimum wage statute of that State.  It has decided that the statute is a reasonable exercise of the police power of the State.  In reaching that conclusion the state court has invoked principles long established by this Court in the application of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The state court has refused to regard the decision in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case as determinative and has pointed to our decisions both before and since that case as justifying its position.  We are of the opinion that this ruling of *390 the state court demands on our part a reexamination of the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case. The importance of the question, in which many States having .similar laws are concerned, the close division by which the decision in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case was reached, and the economic conditions which have supervened, and in the light of which the reasonableness of the exercise of the protective power of the State must be considered, make it not only appropriate, but we think imperative, that in deciding the present case the subject should receive fresh consideration.  The history of the litigation of this question may be briefly stated.  The minimum wage statute of Washington was enacted over twenty-three years ago.  Prior to the decision in the instant case it had 1 twice been held valid by the Supreme Court of the State.  Larsen v. Rice, 100 Wash. 642 ; 171 Pac. 1037 ; Spokane Hotel Co. v. Younger, 113 Wash. 359 ; 194 Pac. 595 .  The Washington statute is essentially the same as that enacted in Oregon in the same year.  Laws of 1913 (Oregon) chap. 62.  ' The validity of the latter act was sustained by the Supreme Court of Oregon in Stettler v. O’Hara, 69 Ore. 519 ; 139 Pac. 743 , and Simpson v. O’Hara, 70 Ore. 261 ; 141 Pac. 158 .  These cases, after reargument, were affirmed here by an equally divided court, in 1917.  243 U. S. 629 .  The law of Oregon thus continued in effect.  The District of Columbia Minimum Wage Law ( 40 Stat. 960 ) was enacted in 1918.  The statute was sustained by the Supreme Court of the District in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case. Upon appeal the Court of Appeals of the District first affirmed that ruling but on rehearing reversed it and the case came before this Court in 1923.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals holding the Act invalid was affirmed, but with Chief Justice Taft, Mr. Justice Holmes and Mr. Justice Sanford dissenting, and Mr. Justice Brandéis taking no part.  The dissenting opinions took the ground that the decision was at variance with the *391 principles which this Court had frequently announced and applied.  In 1925 and 1927, the similar minimum wage statutes of Arizona and Arkansas were held invalid upon the authority of the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case. The Justices who had!  dissented in that case bowed to the ruling and Mr. Justice Brandeis dissented.  Murphy v. Sardell, 269 U. S. 530 ; Donham v. West-Nelson Co., 273 U. S. 657 .  The question did not come before us again until the last .  term in the Morehead case, as already noted.  In that case, briefs supporting the New York statute were submitted by the States of Ohio, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Rhode Island.  298 U. S., p. 604, note.  Throughout this entire period the Washington statute now under consideration has been in force.  The principle which must control our decision is not in doubt.  The constitutional provision invoked is the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment governing the States, as the due process clause invoked in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case governed Congress.  In each case the violation alleged by those attacking minimum wage regulation for women is deprivation of freedom of contract.  \ What is this freedom?  The Constitution does 'not speak of freedom of contract.  It speaks of liberty and prohibits the deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In prohibiting that deprivation the Constitution does not recognize an absolute and uncontrollable liberty.  Liberty in each of its phases has its history and connotation.  But the liberty safeguarded is liberty in a social organization which requires the protection of law against the evils which menace the health, safety, morals and welfare of the people.
**Combined Opinion**
 The whole is no greater than the sum of all the parts, and when the individual health, safety and welfare are sacrificed or neglected, the State must suffer.” It is manifest that this established principle is peculiarly applicable in relation to the employment of women in whose protection the State has a special interest.  That phase of the subject received elaborate consideration in Muller v. Oregon (1908), 208 U. S. 412 , where the constitutional authority of the State to limit the working hours of women was sustained.  We emphasized the consideration that “woman’s physical structure and the performance of maternal functions place her at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence” and that her physical well being “becomes an object of public interest and care in order to preserve the strength and vigor of the race.” We emphasized the need of protecting women against oppression despite her possession of contractual rights.  We said that “though limitations upon personal and contractual rights may be removed by legislation, there is that in her *395 disposition and habits of life which will operate against a full assertion of those rights.  She will still be where some legislation to protect her seems necessary to secure a real equality of right.” Hence she was “properly placed in a class by herself, and legislation designed for her protection may be sustained even when like legislation is not necessary for men and could not be sustained.” We concluded that the limitations which the statute there in question “placed upon her contractual powers, upon her right to agree with her employer as to the time she shall labor” were “not imposed solely for her benefit, but also largely for the benefit of all.” Again, in Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, 223 U. S. 59, 63 , in referring to a differentiation with respect to the employment of women, we said that the Fourteenth Amendment did not interfere with state power by creating a “fictitious equality.” We referred to recognized classifications on the basis of sex with regard to hours of work and in other matters, and we observed that the particular points at which that difference shall be enforced by legislation were largely in the power of the State.  In later rulings this Court sustained the regulation of hours of work of women employees in Riley v. Massachusetts, 232 U. S. 671 (factories), Miller v. Wilson, 236 U. S. 373 (hotels), and Bosley v. McLaughlin, 236 U. S. 385 (hospitals).  This array of precedents and the principles they applied were thought by the dissenting Justices in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case to demand that the minimum wage statute be sustained.  The validity of the distinction made by the Court between a minimum wage and a maximum of hours in limiting liberty of contract was especially challenged.  261 U. S., p. 564.  That challenge persists and is without any satisfactory answer.  As Chief Justice Taft observed: “In absolute freedom of contract the one term is as important as the other, for both enter equally into the consideration given and received, a restriction as to *396 the one is not greater in essence than the other and is of the same kind.  One is the multiplier and the other the multiplicand.” And Mr. Justice Holmes, while recognizing that “the distinctions of the law are distinctions of degree,” could “perceive no difference in the kind or degree of interference with liberty, the only matter with which we have any concern, between the one case and the other.  The bargain is equally affected whichever half you regulate.” Id., p. 569.  One of the points which was pressed by the Court in supporting its ruling in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case was that the standard set up by the District of Columbia Act did not take appropriate account of the value of the services rendered.  In the Morehead case, the minority thought that the New York statute had met that point in its definition of a “fair wage” and that it accordingly presented a distinguishable feature which the Court could recognize within the limits which the Morehead petition for certiorari was deemed to present.  The Court, however, did not take that view and the New York Act was held to be essentially the same as that for the District of Columbia.  The statute now before us is like the latter, but we are unable to conclude that in its minimum wage requirement the State has passed beyond the boundary of its broad protective power.  The minimum wage to be paid under the Washington statute is fixed after full consideration by representatives of employers, employees and the public.  It may be assumed that the minimum wage is fixed in consideration of the services that are performed in the particular occupations under normal conditions.  Provision is made for special licenses at less wages in the case of women who are incapable of full service.  The statement of Mr. Justice Holmes in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case is pertinent: “This statute does not compel anybody to pay anything.  It simply forbids employment at rates below those fixed as *397 the minimum requirement of health and right living.  It is safe to assume that women will not be employed at even the lowest wages allowed unless they earn them, or unless the employer’s business can sustain the burden.  In short the law in its character and operation is like hundreds of so-called police laws that have been upheld.” 261 U. S., p. 570.  And Chief Justice Taft forcibly pointed out the consideration which is basic in a statute of this character: “Legislatures which adopt a requirement of maximum hours or minimum wages may be presumed to believe that when sweating employers are prevented from paying unduly low wages by positive law they will continue their business, abating that part of their profits, which were wrung from the necessities of their employees, and will concede the better terms required by the law; and that while in individual cases hardship may result, the restriction will enure to the benefit of the general class of employees in whose interest the law is passed and so to that of the community at large.” Id., p. 563.  We think that the views thus expressed are sound and that the decision in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case was a departure from the true application of the principles governing the regulation by the State of the relation of employer and employed.  Those principles have been reenforced by our subsequent decisions.  Thus in Radice v. New York, 264 U. S. 292 , we sustained the New York statute which restricted the employment of women in restaurants at night.  In O’Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co., 282 U. S. 251 , which upheld an act regulating the commissions of insurance agents, we pointed to the presumption of the constitutionality of a statute dealing with a subject within the scope of the police power and to the absence of any factual foundation of record for deciding that the limits of power had been transcended.  In Nebbia v. New York, 291 U. S. 502 , dealing *398 with the New York statute providing for minimum prices for milk, the general subject of the regulation of the use of private property and of the making of private contracts received an exhaustive examination and we again declared that if such laws “have a reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose, and are neither arbitrary nor discriminatory, the requirements of due process are satisfied” ; that “with the wisdom of the policy adopted, with the adequacy or practicability of the law enacted to forward it, the courts are both incompetent and unauthorized to deal”; that “times without number we have said that the legislature is primarily the judge of the necessity of such an enactment, that every possible presumption is in favor of its validity, and that though the.  court may hold views inconsistent with the wisdom of the law, it may not be annulled unless palpably in excess of legislative power.” Id., pp. 537, 538.  With full recognition of the earnestness and vigor which characterize the prevailing opinion in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case, we find it impossible to reconcile that ruling with these well-considered declarations.  What can be closer to the public interest than the health of women and their protection from unscrupulous and overreaching employers?  And if the protection of women is a legitimate end of the exercise of state power, how can it be said that the requirement of the payment of a minimum wage fairly fixed in order to meet the very necessities of existence is not an admissible means to that end?  The legislature of the State was clearly entitled to consider the situation of women in employment, the fact that they are in the class receiving the least pay, that their bargaining power is relatively weak, and that they are the ready victims of those who would take advantage of their necessitous circumstances.  The legislature was entitled to adopt measures to reduce the evils of the “sweating sys *399 tern,” the exploiting of workers at wages so low as to be insufficient to meet the bare cost of living, thus making their very helplessness the occasion of a most injurious competition.  The legislature had the right to consider that its minimum wage requirements would be an important aid in carrying out its policy of protection.  The adoption of similar requirements by many States evidences a deepseated conviction both as to the presence of the evil and as to the means adapted to check it.
**Combined Opinion**
 This Court has frequently held that the legislative authority, acting within its proper field, is not bound to extend its regulation to all cases which it might possibly reach.  The legislature “is free to recognize degrees of harm and it may confine its restrictions to those classes of cases where the need is deemed to be clearest.” If “the law presumably hits the evil where it is most felt, it is not to be overthrown because there are other instances to which it might have been applied.” There is no “doctrinaire requirement” that the legislation should be couched in all embracing terms.  Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance Co., 199 U. S. 401, 411 ; Patsone v. Pennsylvania, 232 U. S. 138, 144 ; Keokee Coke Co. v. Taylor, 234 U. S. 224, 227 ; Sproles v. Binford, 286 U. S. 374, 396 ; Semler v. Oregon Board, 294 U. S. 608, 610, 611 .  This familiar principle has repeatedly been applied to legislation which singles out women, and particular classes of women, in the exercise of the State’s protective power.  Miller v. Wilson, supra, p. 384 ; Bosley v. McLaughlin, supra, pp. 394, 395 ; Radice v. New York, supra, pp. 295-298.  Their relative need in the presence of the evil, no less than the existence of the evil itself, is a matter for the legislative judgment.  Our conclusion is that the case of <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> v. Children’s <citedDecision>Hospital, supra,</citedDecision> should be, and it is, overruled.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of the State of Washington is Affirmed.  Mr. Justice Sutherland, dissenting: Mr. Justice Van Devanter, Mr. Justice McReynolds, Mr. Justice Butler and I think the judgment of the court below should be reversed.  *401 The principles and authorities relied upon to sustain the judgment, were considered in Adkins v. Children’s Hospital, <citedDecision>261 U. S. 525</citedDecision> , and Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo, 298 U. S. 587 ; and their lack of application to cases like the one in hand was pointed out.  A sufficient answer to all that is now said will be found in the opinions of the court in those cases. Nevertheless, in the circumstances, it seems well to restate our reasons and conclusions.  Under our form of government, where the written Constitution, by its own terms, is the supreme law, some agency, of necessity, must have the power to say the final word as to the validity of a statute assailed as unconstitutional.  The Constitution makes it clear that the power has been intrusted to this court when the question arises in a controversy within its jurisdiction; and so long as the power remains there, its exercise cannot be avoided without betrayal of the trust.  It has been pointed out many times, as in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case, that this judicial duty is one of gravity and delicacy; and that rational doubts must be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of the statute.  But whose doubts, and by whom resolved?  Undoubtedly it is the duty of a member of the court, in the process of reaching a right conclusion, to give due weight to the opposing views of his associates; but in the end, the question which he must answer is not whether such views seem sound to those who entertain them, but whether they convince him that the statute is constitutional or engender in his mind a rational doubt upon that issue.  The oath which he takes as a judge is not a composite oath, but an individual one.  And in passing upon the validity of a statute, he discharges a duty imposed upon him, which cannot be consummated justly by an automatic acceptance of the views of others which have neither convinced, nor created a reasonable doubt in, his mind.  If upon a question so *402 important he thus surrender his deliberate judgment, he stands forsworn.  He cannot subordinate his convictions to that extent and keep faith with his oath or retain his judicial and moral independence.
**Combined Opinion**
 Judge Cooley, in the first volume of his Constitutional Limitations (8th ed.), p. 124, very clearly pointed out that much of the benefit expected from written constitutions would be lost if their provisions were to be bent to circumstances or modified by public opinion.  He pointed out that the common law, unlike a constitution, was subject to modification by public sentiment and action which the courts might recognize; but that “a court or legislature which should allow a change in public sentiment to influence it in giving to a written constitution a construction not warranted by the intention of its founders, would be justly chargeable with reckless disregard of official oath and public duty; and if its course could become a precedent, these instruments would be of little avail.  .  .  .  What a court is to do, therefore, is to declare the law as written, leaving it to the people themselves to make such changes as new circumstances may require.  The meaning of the constitution is fixed when it is adopted, and it is not different at any subsequent time when a court has occasion to pass upon it.” The <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case dealt with an act of Congress which had passed the scrutiny both of the legislative and executive branches of the government.  We recognized that *405 thereby these departments had affirmed the validity of the statute, and properly declared that their determination must be given great weight, but we then concluded, after thorough consideration, that their view could not be sustained.  We think it not inappropriate now to add a word on that subject before coming to the question immediately under review.  The people by their Constitution created three separate, distinct, independent and coequal departments of government.  The governmental structure rests, and was intended to rest, not upon any one or upon any two, but upon all three of these fundamental pillars.  It seems unnecessary to repeat, what so often has been said, that the powers of these departments are different and are to be exercised independently.  The differences clearly and definitely appear in the Constitution.  Each of the departments is an agent of its creator; and one department is not and cannot be the agent of another.  Each is answerable to its creator for what it does, and not to another agent.  The view, therefore, of the Executive and of Congress that an act is constitutional is persuasive in a high degree; but it is not controlling.  Coming, then, to a consideration of the Washington statute, it first is to be observed that it is in every substantial respect identical with the statute involved in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case. Such vices as existed in the latter are present in the former.  And if the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case was properly decided, as we who join in this opinion think it was, it necessarily follows that the Washington statute is invalid.  In support of minimum-wage legislation it has been urged, on the one hand, that great benefits will result in favor of underpaid labor, and, on the other hand, that the danger of such legislation is that the minimum will tend to become the maximum and thus bring down the *406 earnings of the more efficient toward the level of the less-efficient employees.  But with these speculations we have nothing to do.  We are concerned only with the question of constitutionality.  That the clause of the Fourteenth Amendment which forbids a state to deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law includes freedom of contract is so well settled as to be no longer open to question.  Nor reasonably can it be disputed that contracts of employment of labor are included in the rule.  Adair v. United States, 208 U. S. 161, 174-175 ; Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U. S. 1, 10, 14 .  In the first of these cases, Mr. Justice Harlan, speaking for the court, said, “The right of a person to sell his labor upon such terms as he deems proper is, in its essence, the same as the right of the purchaser of labor to prescribe the conditions upon which he will accept such labor from the person offering to sell.  ... In all such particulars the employer and employe have equality of right, and any legislation that disturbs that equality is an arbitrary interference with the liberty of contract which no government can legally justify in a free land.” In the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case we referred to this language, and said that while there was no such thing as absolute freedom of contract, but that it was subject to a great variety of restraints, nevertheless, freedom of contract was the general rule and restraint the exception; and that the power to abridge that freedom could only be justified by the existence of exceptional circumstances.  This statement of the rule has been many times affirmed; and we do not understand that it is questioned by the present decision.  We further pointed out four distinct classes of cases in which this court from time to time had upheld statutory interferences with the liberty of contract.  They were, in brief, (1) statutes fixing rates and charges to be *407 exacted by businesses impressed with a public interest; (2) statutes relating to contracts for the performance of public work; (3) statutes prescribing the character, methods and time for payment of wages; and (4) statutes fixing hours of labor.  It is the last class that has been most relied upon as affording support for minimum-wage legislation; and much of the opinion in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case ( 261 U. S. 547 -553) is devoted to pointing out the essential distinction between fixing hours of labor and fixing wages.  What is there said need not be repeated.  It is enough for present purposes to say that statutes of the former class deal with an incident of the employment, having no necessary effect upon wages.  The parties are left free to contract about wages, and thereby equalize such additional burdens as may be imposed upon the employer as a result of the restrictions as to hours by an adjustment in respect of the amount of wages.  This court, wherever the question is adverted to, has been careful to disclaim any purpose to uphold such legislation as fixing wages, and has recognized an essential difference between the two.  E. g., Bunting v. Oregon, 243 U. S. 426 ; Wilson v. New, 243 U. S. 332, 345-346, 353-354 ; and see Freund, Police Power, § 318.  We then pointed out that minimum-wage legislation such as that here involved does not deal with any business charged with a public interest, or with public work, or with a temporary emergency, or with the character, methods or periods of wage payments, or with hours of labor, or with the protection of persons under legal disability, or with the prevention of fraud.  It is, simply and exclusively, a law fixing wages for adult women who are legally as capable of contracting for themselves as men, and cannot be sustained unless upon principles apart from those involved in cases already decided by the court. Two cases were involved in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> decision.  In one of them it appeared that a woman 21 years of age, *408 who brought the suit, was employed as an elevator operator at a fixed salary.  Her services were satisfactory, and she was anxious to retain her position, and her employer, while willing to retain her, was obliged to dispense with her services on account of the penalties prescribed by the act.  The wages received by her were the best she was able to obtain for any work she was capable of performing; and the enforcement of the order deprived her, as she alleged, not only of that employment, but left her unable to secure any position at which she could make a living with as good physical and moral surroundings and as good wages as she was receiving and was willing to take.  The Washington statute, of course, admits of the same situation and result, and, for aught that appears to the contrary, the situation in the present case may have been the same as that just described.  Certainly, to the extent that the statute applies to such cases, it cannot be justified as a reasonable restraint upon the freedom of contract.  On the contrary, it is essentially arbitrary.  Neither the statute involved in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> case nor the Washington statute, so far as it is involved here, has the slightest relation to the capacity or earning power of the employee, to the number of hours which constitute the day’s work, the character of the place where the work is to be done, or the circumstances or surroundings of the employment.  The sole basis upon which the question of validity rests is the assumption that the employee is entitled to receive a sum of money sufficient to provide a living for her, keep her in health and preserve her morals.  And, as we pointed out at some length in that case (pp. 555-557), the question thus presented for the determination of the board can not be solved by any general formula prescribed by a statutory bureau, since it is not a composite but an individual question to be answered for each individual, considered by herself.  *409 What we said further in that case (pp. 557-559), is equally applicable here: “The law takes account of the necessities of only one party to the contract.  It ignores the necessities of the employer by compelling him to pay not less than a certain sum, not only whether the employee is capable of earning it, but irrespective of the ability of his business to sustain the burden, generously leaving him, of course, the privilege of abandoning his business as an alternative for going on at a loss.  Within the limits of the minimum sum, he is precluded, under penalty of fine and imprisonment, from adjusting compensation to the differing merits of his employees.  It compels him to pay at least the sum fixed in any event, because the employee needs it, but requires no service of equivalent value from the employee.
**Combined Opinion**
 The ability to make a fair bargain, as everyone knows, does not depend upon sex.  If, in the light of the facts, the state legislation, without reason or for reasons of mere expediency, excluded, men from the provisions of the legislation, the power was exercised arbitrarily.  On the other hand, if such legislation in respect of men was properly omitted on the ground that it would be unconstitutional, the same conclusion of unconstitutionality is inescapable in respect of similar legislative restraint in the case of women, 261 U. S. 553 .  Finally, it may be said that a statute absolutely fixing wages in the various industries at definite sums and forbidding employers and employees from contracting for any other than those designated1, would probably not be thought to be constitutional.  It is hard to see why the power to fix minimum wages does not connote a like power in respect of maximum wages.  And yet, if both powers be exercised in such a way that the minimum and the maximum so nearly approach each other as to *414 become substantially the same, the right to make any contract in respect of wages will have been completely abrogated.  A more complete discussion may be found in the <citedDecision>Adkins</citedDecision> and Tipaldo cases cited supra. 1 Allgeyer v. Louisiana, 165 U. S. 578 ; Lochner v. New York, 198 U.
