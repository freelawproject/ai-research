16,248a; United States v. Emerson, 4 Cranch (C. C.) 188; Fed. Cas. No. 15,050; Kent’s Commentaries (3rd ,ed. 1836) pp. 300-301. And when .the Act came before this Court in Ex parte Robinson, 19 Wall. 505, 511, Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the Court, acknowledgéd that it had limited the power of those courts. And see. Ex parte Bradley, 7 Wall. 364, 374. So far as the decisions of this Court are concerned, that view persisted to the time when Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States, supra, was decided. See Ex parte Wall, 107 U. S. 265; Savin, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 267, 276; Cuddy, Petitioner, 131 U. S. 280, 285; Eilenbecker v. District Court, 134 U. S. 31, 38. Mindful of that history, we come to the construction of § 268 of the Judicial Code in light of the specific facts of this case.
