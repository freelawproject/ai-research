      <p class="indent">Reyes is a Cuban immigrant with little education and almost no knowledge of English.  In 1984 he allegedly stabbed and killed a man in a bar fight.  He was arrested, charged with murder, and provided with a defense attorney and interpreter.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p3">
      <span class="num">3</span>
      <p class="indent">Reyes's attorney, Mr. Tommy Hawk, decided Reyes should plead nolo contendere to Manslaughter in the First Degree.  Or.Rev.Stat. Sec. 163.118(1)(a) (1989).  Reyes signed a plea form that explained in English the rights he was waiving by entering the plea.  The state court then held a hearing to approve the plea, at which Reyes was represented by Hawk and his interpreter, Mr. Ben Sanchez.  The judge asked Hawk and Sanchez if they had explained to Reyes the rights enumerated in the plea form and the consequences of pleading nolo contendere, and they answered in the affirmative.  The judge then explained to Reyes in English the rights he would waive by his plea, asking Sanchez to translate for him.  Reyes indicated he understood his rights and still wished to plead nolo contendere to manslaughter.  The judge accepted his plea.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="num" id="p4">
      <span class="num">4</span>
      <p class="indent">Two years later, Reyes collaterally attacked the plea in a post-conviction proceeding in the Oregon Circuit Court for the County of Marion.  He alleged his plea had not been knowing and intelligent because Sanchez failed in several critical instances to translate accurately and completely for him.  As a result, he claimed, he did not understand the purposes of the plea form or the plea hearing.  He did not know he was pleading no contest to manslaughter;  instead, he thought he was agreeing to be tried on the manslaughter count.  He also contended his plea was invalid because Sanchez had not interpreted for him the mens rea element of manslaughter.<a class="footnote" href="#fn1" id="fn1_ref">1</a></p>

Under Oregon's definition of Manslaughter in the First Degree, the terms "recklessly" and "extreme indifference" describe the mens rea element of the offense.  Or.Rev.Stat. Sec. 163.118(1)(a) (1989).  The Oregon Supreme Court has held these terms are components of the same basic mental state, but that the "extreme indifference" language indicates more must be proved than mere recklessness.<a class="footnote" href="#fn4" id="fn4_ref">4</a>   Needless to say, the shades of legal meaning here are difficult even for English-speaking lawyers to differentiate.  We do not believe, therefore, that Henderson demands a rigid, technically precise translation of the terms mentioned.  However, if the general import of these terms was not adequately conveyed to Reyes, his nolo contendere plea was not knowing or voluntary.</p>

Without expressing a view of when this presumption should attach as a general matter, we believe it is of limited relevance to this case.  Even if we were to presume Hawk described to Reyes in English the mens rea element of manslaughter, there remains the critical issue of whether Sanchez accurately translated that communication.  Without an adequate translation, Hawk's advice in English, no matter how lucid and complete, would not satisfy Henderson.</p>

      <p class="indent">Reyes's second claim is that Sanchez failed to translate accurately and completely (1) critical portions of the plea proceeding, and (2) the plea form he signed in advance of the proceeding.  As a result, Reyes asserts he had no idea what was happening at the hearing as the judge explained in English the nature of the impending plea and the rights he would waive by entering the plea.  He also had no idea what he had agreed to by signing the plea form.  In short, he did not understand that he was pleading nolo contendere to manslaughter and giving up his right to a jury trial.

The magistrate further found that the state post-conviction court's second and third findings, if accurate, were fatal to Reyes's allegation that the translations were insufficient.  Finally, he decided that the two findings should be accorded the presumption of correctness under section 2254(d), that Reyes had failed to establish an exception to that presumption, and that no evidentiary hearing was required to further explore the basis of his claims.<a class="footnote" href="#fn7" id="fn7_ref">7</a>   The district court adopted the magistrate's opinion in all respects.</p>

But the state court's finding in this case that Sanchez did an accurate and complete job of translating is purely one of "historical" fact.  Reyes bristles at this suggestion, apparently because he believes a finding that is largely dispositive of a legal claim necessarily is one of law.

Reyes was the only person who testified.  The hearing focused on Sanchez's translation of the plea form and plea proceeding.  There was almost no factual development of Reyes's claim that Sanchez had failed to translate the mens rea element of Manslaughter in the First Degree.  Mr. Hellewell, Reyes's post-conviction attorney, merely directed the court's attention to various sections of Sanchez's deposition, attempting with his limited knowledge of Spanish to point out the inadequacies of Sanchez's translations.  The State objected to Hellewell's discussion on the ground that he was not qualified as an expert witness, and Hellewell's presentation of the issue quickly disintegrated.</p>

      <p class="indent">Mr. Hellewell's brief and unilluminating reference to the Sanchez deposition hardly indicates the material facts surrounding Reyes's claim were adequately developed.  Hellewell could have developed these facts by a number of means, but did not.  For instance, Hellewell did not call Sanchez to testify.<a class="footnote" href="#fn17" id="fn17_ref">17</a>   Nor did he call an expert witness to give an opinion on the accuracy of Sanchez's interpretations.  Most strikingly, though Hellewell put Reyes on the stand, he did not ask him any questions relevant to the claim.<a class="footnote" href="#fn18" id="fn18_ref">18</a>   The colloquy quoted above, and Sanchez's deposition, constituted the chief evidence before the court.  This evidence sheds little light on whether the mens rea element of manslaughter was correctly defined for Reyes.  Thus, under section 2254(d)(3), the material facts relevant to Reyes's claim were not adequately developed, and the presumption of correctness does not apply here.</p>

      <p class="indent">Townsend illustrates the narrowness of this standard.  In Townsend, petitioner had confessed to murder after being injected with a drug that arguably rendered his confession involuntary.  In the state court, petitioner's counsel did not adequately develop the fact that this drug had "truth serum" properties.  Some testimony was adduced concerning the drug, but not enough to enable the court to grasp its true nature.  Because this factual development was crucial to petitioner's constitutional claim, he was held to have passed the first prong of the test.  Applying the inexcusable neglect prong, the Court stated:  "And the medical expert's failure to testify fully cannot realistically be regarded as Townsend's inexcusable default."    <span class="citation" data-id="106544"><span class="antecedent_guess">Townsend,</span> <a href="/opinion/106544/townsend-v-sain/"><span class="volume">372</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> at <span class="page">322</span></a></span>, 83 S.Ct. at 762.

      <p>If there is anything clear from the record in this case, it is that petitioner made no knowing and intelligent decision not to offer fully developed testimony regarding the failures of Mr. Sanchez's attempts at translation during the post-conviction proceedings.  Postconviction counsel clearly made attempts to develop the record as recounted in petitioner's previous submissions to this court.  Those efforts were woefully inadequate.  A simple reading of the transcript of the post-conviction trial, without more, reveals both the inadequacy, and the clear lack of any willful design to bypass state procedure.</p>

        <p> Reyes advanced two ineffective assistance of counsel claims in the state post-conviction court.  When Reyes raised the claims again in the district court, the magistrate noted he arguably had failed to assert them in the state court of appeals.  The magistrate overlooked the exhaustion defect, however, because he believed his denial of Reyes's claim that the plea was unconstitutional necessarily disposed of the ineffective assistance of counsel claims.  On appeal, Reyes makes a single oblique reference to ineffective assistance of counsel, prompting the State to argue he has abandoned these claims.

        <p>The Oregon Criminal Code defines four culpable mental states:  intentional, knowing, reckless and criminally negligent.  ORS 161.085(7)-(10).  These statutes define neither extreme indifference to the value of human life nor the circumstances which may manifest such indifference.  In the absence of a definition we determine the extreme indifference language does not create an additional culpable mental state.  The language does, however, require more than recklessness.  We conclude that the jury must find not only recklessness but also conduct which in addition to recklessness, manifests extreme indifference to the value of human life on the part of this defendant, as may be inferred from his conduct at the time of the event.</p>

        <p> As we explain later in this opinion, this case presents an example of how the tests in Townsend and section 2254(d) are not always coextensive</p>

        <p> Reyes alleges Hellewell failed to develop the "heart" of his case, but this contention is more appropriately analyzed under section 2254(d)(3), which states an exception to the presumption of correctness where "the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing."    28 U.S.C. Sec. 2254(d)(3) (1988).  The next section will address the applicability of this exception</p>

        <p> Two of our decisions arguably have assumed section 2254(d)(3) and Townsend's fifth circumstance pose the same test.  See Fritz v. Spalding, <span class="citation" data-id="406133"><a href="/opinion/406133/lewis-donald-fritz-v-james-spalding/"><span class="volume">682</span> <span class="reporter">F.2d</span> <span class="page">782</span></a></span>, 785 (9th Cir.1982);  Griggs v.

Since Fritz and Griggs do not clearly stand for this proposition, we are not bound by them</p>

        <p> The district court's opinion does not clearly indicate if it reached the issue of whether the material facts were adequately developed.  The court may have resolved Reyes's claim based solely on the second prong of Townsend, by finding inexcusable neglect.  In any event, we exercise our discretion to address the issue now, rather than remand it to the district court.  See Aguon v. Calvo, <span class="citation" data-id="494692"><a href="/opinion/494692/jesus-f-aguon-vincent-aguon-concepcion-a-cruz-rosa-a-mantanona-ana-a/"><span class="volume">829</span> <span class="reporter">F.2d</span> <span class="page">845</span></a></span>, 848 (9th Cir.1987)</p>

        <p> As pointed out at oral argument, it may be that Sanchez has forgotten how he translated the mens rea element of manslaughter (assuming he did at all).  However, Hellewell still might have asked Sanchez presently to define the relevant terms for the court;  if Sanchez had been unable to render accurate translations in that setting, such testimony would have tended to support the theory that Sanchez's earlier translations were deficient</p>
