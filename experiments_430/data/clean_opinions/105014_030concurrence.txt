Mr. Justice Reed, concurring in the judgment of the Court. Assuming that a state may establish a system for the licensing of motion pictures, an issue not foreclosed by the Courtâ€™s opinion, our duty requires us to examine the facts of the refusal of a license in each case to determine *507 whether the principles of the First Amendment have been honored.- This film does not seem to me to be of a character that the First Amendment permits a state to exclude from public view.
