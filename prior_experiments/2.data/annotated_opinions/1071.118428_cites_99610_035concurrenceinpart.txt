Justice Scalia, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with the Court that extending the Social Security tax to sitting Article III judges in 1984 violated Article Ill’s Compensation Clause. I part paths with the Court on the issue of extending the Medicare tax to federal judges in 1983, which I think was also unconstitutional. 1 *582 I As an initial matter, I think the Court is right in concluding that Evans v. Gore, <targetCase>253 U.S. 245</targetCase> (1920) — holding that new taxes of general applicability cannot be applied to sitting Article III judges — is no longer good law, and should be overruled. We went out of our way in O’Malley v. Woodrough, 307 U. S. 277, 280-281 (1939), to catalog criticism of <targetCase>Evans</targetCase>, and subsequently recognized, in United States v. Will, 449 U.S. 200, 227, and n. 31 (1980), that O’Malley had “undermine[d] the reasoning of Evans.” The Court’s decision today simply recognizes what should be obvious: that <targetCase>Evans</targetCase> has not only been undermined, but has in fact collapsed. II My disagreement with the Court arises from its focus upon the issue of discrimination, which turns out to be dispositive with respect to the Medicare tax. The Court holds “that the Compensation Clause does not forbid Congress to enact a law imposing a nondiscriminatory tax . . . upon judges, whether those judges were appointed before or after the tax law in question was enacted or took effect.” Ante, at 571. Since “the Medicare tax is just such a nondiscriminatory tax,” the Court concludes that “application of [that] tax law to federal judges is [ejonstitutional.” Ante, at 572.

1961); see also Will, supra, at 227 (the Constitution “placed faith in the integrity and sound judgment of the elected representatives to enact increases” in judicial sala *584 ries to account for inflation). Since Hamilton thought that the Compensation Clause “put it out of the power of [Congress] to change the condition of the individual [judge] for the worse,” The Federalist No. 79, at 473, he obviously believed that inflation does not diminish compensation as that term is used in the Constitution. This distinction between Government action affecting compensation and Government action affecting the value of compensation was the basis for our statement in O’Malley, supra, at 282, that “[t]o subject [judges] to a general tax is merely to recognize that judges are also citizens, and that their particular function in government does not generate an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government . . . .” I agree with the Court, therefore, that <targetCase>Evans</targetCase> was wrongly decided — not, however, because in <targetCase>Evans</targetCase> there was no discrimination, but because in <targetCase>Evans</targetCase> the universal application of the tax demonstrated that the Government was not reducing the compensation of its judges but was acting as sovereign rather than employer, imposing a general tax. But just as it is clear that a federal employee’s sharing of a tax-free status that all citizens enjoy is not compensation (and elimination of that tax-free status not a reduction in compensation), so also it is clear that a tax-free status conditioned on federal employment is compensation, and its elimination a reduction. The Court apparently acknowledges that if a tax is imposed on the basis of federal employment (an income tax, for example, payable only by federal judges) it would constitute a reduction in compensation. It is impossible to understand why a tax that is suspended on the basis of federal employment (an exemption from federal income tax for federal judges) does not constitute the conferral of compensation — in which case its elimination is a reduction, whether or not federal judges end up being taxed just like other citizens. Only converting the Compensation *585 Clause into a Discrimination Clause can explain a contrary conclusion. And this, of course, is what has been achieved by the targeted extension of the Medicare tax to federal employees who were previously exempt. It may well be that, in some abstract sense, they are not being '“discriminated against,” since they end up being taxed like other citizens; but this does not alter the fact that, since exemption from the tax was part of their employment package — since they had an employment expectation of a preferential exemption from taxation — their compensation was being reduced.
