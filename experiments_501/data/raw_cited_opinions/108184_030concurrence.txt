<p id="b90-7">I adhere to the view that the admission at trial of evidence acquired in alleged violation of Fourth Amend<page-number citation-index="1" label="55">*55</page-number>ment standards is not of itself sufficient ground for a collateral attack upon an otherwise valid criminal conviction, state or federal. See <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>394 U. S. 286, 307 (dissenting <em>opinion); Kaufman </em>v. <em>United States, </em>394 U. S. 217, 242 (dissenting opinion). But until the Court adopts that view, I regard myself as obligated to consider the merits of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment claims in a case of this kind. Upon that premise I join the opinion and judgment of the Court.</p>
