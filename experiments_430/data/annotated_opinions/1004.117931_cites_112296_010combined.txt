 On the other hand, it is also true that Congress has not seen fit to overturn the holding in Bramblett , despite the fact that the opinions endorsing the judicial function exception evidence a good deal of respectful skepticism about the correctness of that decision.  V With the foregoing considerations in mind, we now turn to the difficult stare decisis question that this case presents.  It is, of course, wise judicial policy to adhere to rules announced in earlier cases. As Justice Cardozo reminded us: "The labor of judges would be increased almost to the breaking point if every past decision could be reopened in every case, and one could not lay one's own course of bricks on the secure foundation of the courses laid by others who had gone before him." B. Cardozo, The Nature of the Judicial Process 149 (1921).  Adherence to precedent also serves an indispensable institutional role within the Federal Judiciary.  Stare decisis is "a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon `an arbitrary discretion.' " Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, <citedDecision>491 U. S. 164, 172</citedDecision> (1989) (quoting The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton)).  See also Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa. v. Casey, 505 U. S. 833, 854-855 (1992) (joint opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).  Respect for precedent is strongest "in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation *712 of its legislation." Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977).  [11] In this case, these considerations point in two conflicting directions.  On one hand, they counsel adherence to the construction of § 1001 adopted in Bramblett ; on the other, they argue in favor of retaining the body of law that has cut back on the breadth of Bramblett in Circuits from coast to coast.  It would be difficult to achieve both goals simultaneously.

 Conversely, Bramblett could not stand if we preserved the thrust of the judicial function exception i.  e., if we interpreted 18 U. S. C. § 1001 so that it did not reach conduct occurring in federal-court proceedings.  Again, although Bramblett involved a false representation to an office within the Legislative Branch, the decision lumped all three branches together in one and the same breath.  See 384 U. S., at 509 ("department" in § 1001 "was meant to describe the executive, legislative and judicial branches of the Government").  *713 We think the text of § 1001 forecloses any argument that we should simply ratify the body of cases adopting the judicial function exception.  We are, however, persuaded that the clarity of that text justifies a reconsideration of Bramblett .  [12] Although such a reconsideration is appropriate only in the rarest circumstances, we believe this case permits it because of a highly unusual "intervening development of the law," see Patterson, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 173</citedDecision> , and because of the absence of significant reliance interests in adhering to Bramblett .  The "intervening development" is, of course, the judicial function exception.  In a virtually unbroken line of cases, respected federal judges have interpreted § 1001 so narrowly that it has had only a limited application within the Judicial Branch.  See nn. 2 and 10, supra. This interpretation has roots both deep and broad in the lower courts.  Although the judicial function exception has not been adopted by this Court, our review of Bramblett supports the conclusion that the cases endorsing the exception almost certainly reflect the intent of Congress.  It is thus fair to characterize the judicial function exception as a "competing legal doctrin[e]," Patterson, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 173</citedDecision> , that can lay a legitimate claim to respect as a settled body of law. Overruling Bramblett would preserve the essence of this doctrine and would, to that extent, promote stability in the law. [13] *714 Stare decisis has special force when legislators or citizens "have acted in reliance on a previous decision, for in this instance overruling the decision would dislodge settled rights and expectations or require an extensive legislative response." Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U. S. 197, 202 (1991); see also Casey, 505 U. S., at 854-856 (joint opinion of O'Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).  Here, however, the reliance interests at stake in adhering to Bramblett are notably modest.  In view of the extensive array of statutes that already exist to penalize false statements within the Judicial Branch, see, e. g., 18 U. S. C. § 1621 (perjury); § 1623 (false declarations before grand jury or court); § 1503 (obstruction of justice); § 287 (false claims against the United States), we doubt that prosecutors have relied on § 1001 as an important means of deterring and punishing litigation-related misconduct.  [14] But we need not speculate, for we have direct evidence on this point.  The United States Attorneys' Manual states quite plainly that "[p]rosecutions should not be brought under 18 U. S. C. § 1001 for false statements submitted in federal court proceedings"; it instead directs prosecutors to proceed under the perjury or obstruction of justice statutes.  U. S. Dept. of *715 Justice, United States Attorneys' Manual ¶ 9-69.267 (1992).

 It is so ordered.  *716 Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  I concur in the judgment of the Court, and join Parts IIII and VI of Justice Stevens' opinion.  United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503 (1955), should be overruled.  The doctrine of stare decisis protects the legitimate expectations of those who live under the law, and, as Alexander Hamilton observed, isone of the means by which exercise of "an arbitrary discretion in the courts" is restrained, The Federalist No. 78, p. 471 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Who ignores it must give reasons, and reasons that go beyond mere demonstration that the overruled opinion was wrong (otherwise the doctrine would be no doctrine at all).  The reason here, as far as I am concerned, is the demonstration, over time, that Bramblett has unacceptable consequences, which can be judicially avoided (absent overruling) only by limiting Bramblett in a manner that is irrational or by importing exceptions with no basis in law. Unlike Justice Stevens, Ido not regard the Courts of Appeals' attempts to limit Bramblett as an "`intervening development of the law,' " ante, at 713 (quoting Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, <citedDecision>491 U. S. 164, 173</citedDecision> (1989)),that puts us to a choice between two conflicting lines of authority.  Such "intervening developments" by lower courts that we do not agree with are ordinarily disposed of by reversal.  See, e. g., McNally v. United States, 483 U. S. 350 (1987).  Instead, the significance I find in the fact that so many Courts of Appeals have strained so mightily to discern an exception that the statute does not contain, see ante, at 699, n. 2 (collecting cases), is that it demonstrates how great a potential for mischief federal judges have discovered in the mistaken reading of 18 U. S. C. § 1001 , a potential we did not fully appreciate when Bramblett was decided.  To be sure, since 18 U. S. C. § 1001 's prohibition of concealment is violated only when *717 there exists a duty to disclose, see, e. g., United States v. Kingston, 971 F. 2d 481, 489 (CA10 1992); United States v. Richeson, 825 F. 2d 17, 20 (CA4 1987); United States v. Irwin, 654 F.2d 671, 678-679 (CA10 1981), cert. denied, 455 U. S. 1016 (1982), it does not actually prohibit any legitimate trial tactic.  There remains, however, a serious concern that the threat of criminal prosecution under the capacious provisions of § 1001 will deter vigorous representation of opposing interests in adversarial litigation, particularly representation of criminal defendants, whose adversaries control the machinery of § 1001 prosecution.  One could avoid the problem by accepting the Courts of Appeals' invention of a "judicial function" exception, but there is simply no basis in the text of the statute for that.

 The trustee also alleged in a separate motion that petitioner had, despite requests, failed to turn over all the books and records relating to the bankruptcy estate.  Petitioner filed a response denying the allegation, and asserting that he had produced the requested documents at the behest ofa previous trustee.  Petitioner was then indicted under 18 U. S. C. § 1001 ,and a jury found that each of these responses was a lie.  Today, the majority jettisons a 40-year-old unanimous decision of this Court, United States v. Bramblett, 348 U. S. 503 (1955), under which petitioner's conviction plainly would have been upheld.  It does so despite an admission that the Court's reading of § 1001 in Bramblett was "not completely implausible," ante, at 706.  In replacing Bramblett `s plausible, albeit arguably flawed, interpretation of the statute with its own "sound" reading, the Court disrespects the traditionally stringent adherence to stare decisis in statutory decisions.  Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, <citedDecision>491 U. S. 164, 172</citedDecision> (1989); Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U. S. 720, 736 (1977).  The two reasons offered by the plurality in Part V of the opinion and the justification offered by the concurring opinion fallfar short of the institutional hurdle erected by our past practice against overruling a decision of this Court interpreting an Act of Congress.  The first reason is styled as an "intervening development in the law"; under it, decisions of Courts of Appeals that cannot be reconciled with our earlier precedent are treated as a basis for disavowing, not the aberrant Court of Appeals decisions, *719 but, mirabile dictu our own decision!  This novel corollary to the principle of stare decisis subverts the very principle on which a hierarchical court system is built.  The second reason given is that there has been little or no reliance on our Bramblett decision; I believe that this ground is quite debatable, if not actually erroneous.  Today's decision harkens to the important reason behind the doctrine of stare decisis, but does not heed it.  That doctrine is "a basic self-governing principle within the Judicial Branch, which is entrusted with the sensitive and difficult task of fashioning and preserving a jurisprudential system that is not based upon `an arbitrary discretion.' " <citedDecision>Patterson, supra, at 172</citedDecision> , citing The Federalist No. 78, p. 490 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (A. Hamilton).  Respect for precedent is strongest "in the area of statutory construction, where Congress is free to change this Court's interpretation of its legislation." Illinois Brick Co., supra, at 736.  Justice Brandeis' dissenting opinion in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 (1932), made the point this way: " Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.  This is commonly true even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation." Id. , at 406 (citations omitted).  We have recognized a very limited exception to this principle for what had been called "intervening developments in the law." But the cases exemplifying this principle, e. g., Andrews v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 406 U. S. 320 (1972); Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc. , 490 U. S. 477 (1989), have invariably made clear that the "intervening developments" were in the case law of this Court, not of the lower federal courts.

[10]  Some 17 years before Masterpol , the Second Circuit restricted the application of§ 1001 in a slightly different manner.  In United States v. D'Amato, 507 F. 2d 26 (1974), the court overturned a § 1001 conviction arising out ofa falseaffidavit submitted inthe course of a private civil lawsuit.  Based upon a review of relevant case law and legislative history, the court concluded that § 1001 did not apply "where the Government is involved only by way of a court deciding a matter in which the Government or its agencies are not involved." Id., at 28.  Accord, United States v. London, 714 F. 2d 1558, 1561-1562 (CA11 1983).  [11]  See also, e. g., <citedDecision>Patterson</citedDecision> v. McLean Credit Union, <citedDecision>491 U. S., at 172-173</citedDecision> ( stare decisis has "special force in the area of statutory interpretation, for here, unlike in the context of constitutional interpretation, the legislative power is implicated, and Congress remains free to alter what we have done"); Square D Co. v. Niagara Frontier Tariff Bureau, Inc., 476 U. S. 409, 424 (1986) (noting "the strong presumption of continued validity that adheres in the judicial interpretation of a statute"); Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U. S. 160, 189 (1976) (Stevens, J., concurring) (declining to overturn "a line of [statutory] authority which I firmly believe to have been incorrectly decided"); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting) (" Stare decisis is usually the wise policy, because in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.  This is commonly true, even where the error is a matter of serious concern, provided correction can be had by legislation") (citation omitted).  [12]  Because the fate of the judicial function exception is tied so closely to Bramblett , we find no merit in the Government's suggestion that a reconsideration of the validity of that decision is not fairly included in the question on which we granted certiorari.  See generally Lebron v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, 513 U. S. 374, 379-383 (1995).  [13]  The dissent criticizes us for according respect to a body of law developed in the lower courts, arguing that our decision will "induce" federal judges on the courts of appeals to "ignore" precedents from this Court and thereby invite chaos in the judicial system.  Post, at 721.  We would have thought it self-evident that the lower courts must adhere to our precedents.
