Could not the purpose of the prohibition be wholly thwarted if this avenue of attack were left open? Certainly there is nothing in the words of the prohibition indicating that it is directed against one legislative power and not another; and in our opinion due regard for its spirit and principle requires that it be taken as directed against them all.” . Mr. Justice Holmes wrote a dissenting opinion, in which Mr. Justice Brandéis joined. With that expression his opposition to the decision ended. Two years later, in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, 257 U. S. 501, writing for the Court, invalidating a state tax upon- net income of a lessee from sales of his share of oil and gas received under leases of restricted Indian land, he said (p. 505): “In cases where the principal is' absolutely immune from interference an inquiry is allowed into the sources from which net income is derived and if a part of it comes from-,such a source the tax is pro tanto void; Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan & Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429; 158 U. S. 601; a.rule lately illustrated by Evans v. Gore . . .” And in that case he relied on the truth, as put by Chief Justice Marshall in M’Culloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431, that “the power to tax involves the power to destroy.” He quoted (p,-505) with approval from Indian Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U. S. 522, the statement of the opinion (p. 530) that “A tax upon the leases is a tax upon’the power to make them, and could be used to destroy - the power, to make them.” 15 *295 Miles v. Graham (1925), 268 U. S. 501, held invalid § 213 (a), Revenue Act of 1918, (condemned in Evans v. Gore) when applied to compensation of Judge Graham, *296 appointed after its enactment. Mr. Justice Holmes joined in the decision. Mr. Justice Brandéis merely noted dissent. In the course of the opinion, we said: “Does the circumstance that defendant in error’s appointment came after the taxing Act require a different view concerning his right to exemption ? The answer depends upon the import of the word ‘compensation’ in the constitutional provision. “The words and history of the clause indicate that the purpose was to impose upon Congress the duty definitely to declare what sum shall be received by each judge out of the public funds and the times for payment. When this duty has been complied with the amount specified becomes the compensation which is protected against diminution during his continuance in office.

O’Keefe, 306 U. S. 466. It is there said: “A succession of *295 decisions [Gillespie v. Oklahoma is the first cited] thereby withdrew from the taxing power of the States and Nation a very considerable range of wealth without regard to the actual workings of our federalism, and this, too, when the financial needs of all governments began steadily to mount.” At another place in' that concurrence, the writer stated: “The volume of the Court’s business has long since made impossible the early healthy practice whereby the Justices gave expression to individual opinions. But the old tradition still has relevance when an important shift in constitutional doctrine is announced after a reconstruction in the membership of the Court. . . . The arguments upon which McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, rested . . . have been distorted, by sterile refinements unrelated to affairs. These refinements derived authority from an unfortunate remark in the opinion in McCulloch v. Maryland. Partly as a flourish of rhetoric and partly because the intellectual fashion of the times indulged' a free use of absolutes, Chief Justice Marshall gave currency to the phrase that ‘the power to tax involves the power to destroy.’ . . . The web of unreality spun from Marshall’s famous dictum was brushed away by one stroke of Mr. Justice Holmes’s pen: ‘The power' to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits’. Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi, 277 U. S. 218, 223 (dissent).” But, in the Gillespie case, Mr.’Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, had definitely applied the doctrine that the power to tax does involve the power to destroy. In the Panhandle ease neither the Court, nor -indeed another justice dissenting, was impressed by “The power to tax is not the power to destroy while this Court sits.” The statement is vague and may be read to imply a power that this Court never possessed.
