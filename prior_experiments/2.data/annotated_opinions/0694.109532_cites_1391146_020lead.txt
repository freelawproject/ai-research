54 In light of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia we must disagree. First, the petitioner attacks that part of § 27-2534.1 (b) (1) that authorizes a jury to consider whether a defendant has a “substantial history of serious assaultive criminal convictions.” The Supreme Court of Georgia, however, has demonstrated a concern that the new sentencing procedures provide guidance to juries. It held this provision to be impermissibly vague in Arnold v. State, 236 Ga. 534, 540, 224 S. E. 2d 386, 391 (1976), because it did not provide the jury with “sufficiently 'clear and objective standards.’ ” Second, the petitioner points to § 27-2534.1 (b)(3) which speaks of creating a “great risk of death to more than one person.” While such a phrase might be susceptible of an overly broad interpretation, the Supreme Court of Georgia has not so construed it. The only case in which the court upheld a conviction in reliance on this aggravating circumstance involved a man who stood up in a church and fired a gun indiscriminately into the audience. See *203 Chenault v. State, 234 Ga. 216, 216 S. E. 2d 223 (1975). On the other hand, the court expressly reversed a finding of great risk when the victim was simply kid-naped in a parking lot. See Jarrell v. State, <targetCase>234 Ga. 410</targetCase>, 424, 216 S. E. 2d 258, 269 (1975). 55 The petitioner next argues that the requirements of Furman are not met here because the jury has the power to decline to impose the death penalty even if it finds that one or more statutory aggravating circumstances are present in the case. This contention misinterprets Furman. See supra, at 198-199. Moreover, it ignores the role of the Supreme Court of Georgia which reviews each death sentence to determine whether it is proportional to other sentences imposed for similar crimes. Since the proportionality requirement on review is intended to prevent caprice in the decision to inflict the penalty, the isolated decision of a jury to afford mercy does not render unconstitutional death sentences imposed on defendants who were sentenced under a system that does not create a substantial risk of arbitrariness or caprice. The petitioner objects, finally, to the wide scope of evidence and argument allowed at presentence hearings.

1975). 56 In per *205 forming its sentence-review function, the Georgia court has held that “if the death penalty is only rarely imposed for an act or it is substantially out of line with sentences imposed for other acts it will be set aside as excessive.” Coley v. State, 231 Ga., at 834, 204 S. E. 2d, at 616. The court on another occasion stated that “we view it to be our duty under the similarity standard to assure that no death sentence is affirmed unless in similar cases throughout the state the death penalty has been imposed generally . . . Moore v. State, 233 Ga. 861, 864, 213 S. E. 2d 829, 832 (1975). See also <targetCase>Jarrell</targetCase> v. State, supra, at 425, 216 S. E. 2d, at 270 (standard is whether “juries generally throughout the state have imposed the death penalty”); Smith v. State, 236 Ga. 12, 24, 222 S. E. 2d 308, 318 (1976) (found “a clear pattern” of jury behavior). It is apparent that the Supreme Court of Georgia has taken its review responsibilities seriously. In Coley, it held that “[t]he prior cases indicate that the past practice among juries faced with similar factual situations and like aggravating circumstances has been to impose only the sentence of life imprisonment for the offense of rape, rather than death.” 231 Ga., at 835, 204 S. E. 2d, at 617. It thereupon reduced Coley's sentence from death to life imprisonment. Similarly, although armed robbery is a capital offense under Georgia law, § 26-1902 (1972), the Georgia court concluded that the death sentences imposed in this case for that crime were “unusual in that they are rarely imposed for [armed robbery], Thus, under the test provided by statute, . . . they must be considered to be excessive or disproportionate to the penalties imposed in similar cases.” 233 *206 Ga., at 127, 210 S. E. 2d, at 667. The court therefore vacated Gregg's death sentences for armed robbery and has followed a similar course in every other armed robbery death penalty case to come before it. See Floyd v. State, 233 Ga. 280, 285, 210 S. E. 2d 810, 814 (1974); <targetCase>Jarrell</targetCase> v. State, 234 Ga., at 424-425, 216 S. E. 2d, at 270. See Dorsey v. State, 236 Ga. 591, 225 S. E. 2d 418 (1976). The provision for appellate review in the Georgia capital-sentencing system serves as a check against the random or arbitrary imposition of the death penalty. In particular, the proportionality review substantially eliminates the possibility that a person will be sentenced to die by the action of an aberrant jury. If a time comes when juries generally do not impose the death sentence in a certain kind of murder case, the appellate review procedures assure that no defendant convicted under such circumstances will suffer a sentence of death. V The basic concern of Furman centered on those defendants who were being condemned to death capriciously and arbitrarily. Under the procedures before the Court in that case, sentencing authorities were not directed to give attention to the nature or circumstances of the crime committed or to the character or record of the defendant.

In light of the limited grant of certiorari, see supra, at 162, we review the “vagueness” and “overbreadth” of the statutory aggravating circumstances only to consider whether their imprecision renders this capital-sentencing system invalid under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because it is incapable of imposing capital punishment other than by arbitrariness or caprice. In the course of interpreting Florida’s new capital-sentencing statute, the Supreme Court of Florida has ruled that the phrase “especially heinous, atrocious or cruel” means a “conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim.” State v. Dixon, 283 So. 2d 1, 9 (1973). See Proffitt v. Florida, post, at 255-256. Two other reported cases indicate that juries have found aggravating circumstances based on § 27-2534.1 (b) (7). In both cases a separate statutory aggravating circumstance was also found, and the Supreme Court of Georgia did not explicitly rely on the finding of the seventh circumstance when it upheld the death sentence. See Jarrell v. State, <targetCase>234 Ga. 410</targetCase>, 216 S. E. 2d 258 (1975) (State Supreme Court upheld finding that defendant committed two other capital felonies — kidnaping and armed robbery — in the course of *202 the murder, §27-2534.1 (b)(2); jury also found that the murder was committed for money, § 27-2534.1 (b) (4), and that a great risk of death to bystanders was created, § 27-2534.1 (b) (3)); Floyd v. State, 233 Ga. 280, 210 S. E. 2d 810 (1974) (found to have committed a capital felony — armed robbery' — in the course of the murder, §27-2534.1 (b)(2)). The petitioner also attacks § 25-2534.1 (b) (7) as vague. As we have noted in answering his overbreadth argument concerning this section, however, the state court has not given a broad reading to the scope of this provision, and there is no reason to think that juries will not be able to understand it. See n. 51, supra; Proffitt v. Florida, post, at 255-256. The petitioner also objects to the last part of § 27-2534.1 (b) (3) which requires that the great risk be created “by means of a weapon or device which would normally be hazardous to the lives of more than one person.” While the state court has not focused on this section, it seems reasonable to assume that if a great risk in fact is created, it will be likely that a weapon or device normally hazardous to more than one person will have created it. The court is required to specify in its opinion the similar cases which it took into consideration. § 27-2537 (e) (Supp.
