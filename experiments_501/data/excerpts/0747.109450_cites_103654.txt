 The plaintiffs are an individual Virginia resident who suffers from diseases that require her to take prescription drugs on a daily basis, 9 and two nonprofit organizations.  10 Their *754 claim is that the First Amendment entitles the user of prescription drugs to receive information that pharmacists wish to communicate to them through advertising and other promotional means, concerning the prices of such drugs.  Certainly that information may be of value.  Drug prices in Virginia, for both prescription and nonprescription items, strikingly vary from outlet to outlet even within the same locality.  It is stipulated, for example, that in Richmond “the cost of 40 Achromycin tablets ranges from $2.59 to $6.00, a difference of 140% [sic],” and that in the Newport News-Hampton area the cost of tetracycline ranges from $1.20 to $9.00, a difference of 650%.  11 The District Court seized on the identity of the plaintiff-appellees as consumers as a feature distinguishing the *755 present case from Patterson Drug Co. v. Kingery, supra. Because the unsuccessful plaintiffs in that earlier case were pharmacists, the court said, “theirs was a prima facie commercial approach,” 373 F. Supp., at 686 .  The present plaintiffs, on the other hand, were asserting an interest in their own health that was “fundamentally deeper than a trade consideration.” Ibid. In the District Court’s view, the expression in Valentine v. Chrestensen, <citedDecision>316 U. S. 52</citedDecision> , 54—55 (1942), to the effect that “purely commercial advertising” is not protected had been tempered, by later decisions of this Court, to the point that First Amendment interests in the free flow of price information could be found to outweigh the countervailing interests of the State.  The strength of the interest in the free flow of drug price information was borne out, the court felt, by the fact that three States by court decision had struck down their prohibitions on drug price advertising.  Florida Board of Pharmacy v. Webb’s City, Inc., 219 So. 2d 681 (Fla. 1969); Maryland Board of Pharmacy v. Sav-A-Lot, Inc., 270 Md. 103 , 311 A. 2d 242 (1973); Pennsylvania State Board of Pharmacy v. Pastor, 441 Pa. 186 , 272 A. 2d 487 (1971).  12 The District Court recognized that this Court had upheld — against federal constitutional challenges other than on First Amendment grounds — state restric *756 tions on the advertisement of prices for optometrists’ services, Head v. New Mexico Board, 374 U. S. 424 (1963), for eyeglass frames, Williamson v. Lee Optical Co., 348 U. S. 483 (1955), and for dentists’ services, Semler v. Dental Examiners, 294 U. S. 608 (1935).  13 The same dangers of abuse and deception were not thought to be present, however, when the advertised commodity was prescribed by a physician for his individual patient and was dispensed by a licensed pharmacist.  The Board failed to justify the statute adequately, and it had to fall.  373 F. Supp., at 686-687 .

 This is clear from the decided cases. In Lament v. Postmaster General, 381 U. S. 301 (1965), the Court upheld the First Amendment rights of citizens to receive political publications sent from abroad.  *757 More recently, in Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U. S. 753, 762-763 (1972), we acknowledged .that this Court has referred to a First Amendment right to “receive information and ideas,” and that freedom of speech “ ‘necessarily protects the right to receive.’ ” And in Procunier v. Martinez, 416 U. S. 396, 408-409 (1974), where censorship of prison inmates’ mail was under examination, we thought it unnecessary to assess the First Amendment rights of the inmates themselves, for it was reasoned that such censorship equally infringed the rights of noninmates to whom the correspondence was addressed.  There are numerous other expressions to the same effect in the Court’s decisions.  See, e. g„ Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 390 (1969); Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U. S. 557, 564 (1969); Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U. S. 479, 482 (1965); Marsh v. Alabama, 326 U. S. 501, 505 (1946); Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S. 516, 534 (1945); Martin v. Struthers, 319 U. S. 141, 143 (1943).  If there is a right to advertise, there is a reciprocal right to receive the advertising, and it may be asserted by these appellees.  15 *758 IV The appellants contend that the advertisement of prescription drug prices is outside the protection of the First Amendment because it is “commercial speech.” There can be no question that in past decisions the Court has given some indication that commercial speech is unprotected.  In <citedDecision>Valentine</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Chrestensen, supra,</citedDecision> the Court upheld a New York statute that prohibited the distribution of any “handbill, circular ... or other advertising matter whatsoever in or upon any street.” The Court concluded that, although the First Amendment would forbid the banning of all communication by handbill in the public thoroughfares, it imposed “no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising.” <citedDecision>316 U. S., at 54</citedDecision> .  Further support for a “commercial speech” exception to the First Amendment may perhaps be found in Breard v. Alexandria, 341 U. S. 622 (1951), where the Court upheld a conviction for violation of an ordinance prohibiting door-to-door solicitation of magazine subscriptions.  The Court reasoned: “The selling .  .  .  brings into the transaction a commercial feature,” and it distinguished Martin v. Struthers, supra, where it had reversed a conviction for door-to-door distribution of leaflets publicizing a religious meeting, as a case involving “no element of the commercial.” 341 U. S., at 642-643 .  Moreover, the Court several times has stressed that communications to which First Amendment protection was given were not “purely commercial.” New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254, 266 *759 (1964); Thomas v. Collins, 323 U. S., at 533 ; Murdock v. Pennsylvania, 319 U. S. 105, 111 (1943); Jamison v. Texas, 318 U. S. 413, 417 (1943).

 We are aware of no general principle that freedom of speech may be abridged when the speaker’s listeners could come by his message by some other means, such as seeking him out and asking him what it is.  Nor have we recognized any such limitation on the independent right of the listener to receive the information sought to be communicated.  Certainly, the recipients of the political publications in Lamont could have gone abroad and thereafter disseminated them *758 themselves.  Those in Kleindienst who organized the lecture tour by a foreign Marxist could have done the same.  And the addressees of the inmate correspondence in Procunier could have visited the prison themselves.  As for the recipients' great need for the information sought to be disseminated, if it distinguishes our prior cases at all, it makes the appellees' First Amendment claim a stronger rather than a weaker one.  See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S., at 820 n. 6, citing Mr. Justice Douglas’ observation in Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S. 498, 514 (1959) (concurring opinion), that the <citedDecision>Chrestensen</citedDecision> ruling “was casual, almost offhand.  And it has not survived reflection”; the similar observation of four Justices in dissent in Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298 , 314 n. 6 (1974); and expressions of three Justices in separate dissents in Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm’n, 413 U. S., at 393, 398 , and 401.  See also Mr. Justice Douglas’ comment, dissenting from the denial of certiorari in Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (1971).  The speech of labor disputants, of course, is subject to a number of restrictions.  The Court stated in NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S., at 618 , for example, that an employer’s threats of retaliation for the labor actions of his employees are “without the protection of the First Amendment.” The constitutionality of restrictions upon speech in the special context of labor disputes is not before us here.  We express no views on that complex subject, and advert to cases in the labor field only to note that in some circumstances speech of an entirely private and economic character enjoys the protection of the First Amendment.  The point hardly needs citation, but a few figures are illustrative.

Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring.  In Thornhill v. Alabama, 310 U. S. 88 , the Court observed that “[fjreedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.” Id., at 102 .  Shortly after the Thorn-hill decision, the Court identified a single category of communications that is constitutionally unprotected: communications “which by their very utterance inflict *776 injury.” Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572 .  Yet only a month after Chaplinsky , and without reference to that decision, the Court stated in Valentine v. Chrestensen, <citedDecision>316 U. S. 52, 54</citedDecision> , that “the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising.” For more than 30 years this “casual, almost offhand” statement in <citedDecision>Chrestensen</citedDecision> has operated to exclude commercial speech from the protection afforded by the First Amendment to other types of communication.  Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S. 498, 514 (Douglas, J., concurring).  1 Today the Court ends the anomalous situation created by <citedDecision>Chrestensen</citedDecision> and holds that a communication which does no more than propose a commercial transaction is not “wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment.” Ante, at 761.  But since it is a cardinal principle of the First Amendment that “government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content,” 2 the Court's decision calls into immediate question the constitutional legitimacy of every state and federal law regulating false or deceptive advertising.  I write separately to explain why I think today’s decision does not preclude such governmental regulation.  *777 The Court has on several occasions addressed the problem posed by false statements of fact in libel cases. Those cases demonstrate that even with respect to expression at the core of the First Amendment, the Constitution does not provide absolute protection for false factual statements that cause private injury.  In Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S. 323, 340 , the Court concluded that “there is no constitutional value in false statements of fact.” As the Court had previously recognized in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U. S. 254 , however, factual errors are inevitable in free debate, and the imposition of liability for erroneous factual assertions can “dampe[n] the vigor and limi[t] the variety of public debate” by inducing “self-censorship.” Id., at 279 .  In order to provide ample “breathing space” for free expression, the Constitution places substantial limitations on the discretion of government to permit recovery for libelous communications.  See Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., supra, at 347-349.

 6 “Under the First Amendment there is no such thing as a false idea,” and the only way that ideas can be suppressed is through “the competition of other ideas,” Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U. S., at 339-340 .  Commercial price and product advertising differs markedly from ideological expression because it is confined to the promotion of specific goods or services.  7 The First Amendment protects the advertisement because of the “information of potential interest and value” conveyed, Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 822 , rather than because of any direct contribution to the interchange of ideas.  See ante, at 762-765, 770.  8 Since the factual claims contained in commercial price or product advertisements relate to tangible goods or services, they may be tested empirically and corrected to reflect the truth without in any manner jeopardizing the free dis *781 semination of thought.  Indeed, the elimination of false and deceptive claims serves to promote the one facet of commercial price and product advertising that warrants First Amendment protection — its contribution to the flow of accurate and rehable information relevant to public and private decisionmaking.  In recent years the soundness of the sweeping language of the <citedDecision>Chrestensen</citedDecision> opinion has been repeatedly questioned.  See Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U. S. 809, 819-821 ; Lehman v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U. S. 298, 314-315 , and n. 6 (Brennan, J., dissenting); Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm’n, 413 U. S. 376, 398 (Douglas, J., dissenting); id., at 401 , and n. 6 (Stewart, J., dissenting); Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove, 404 U. S. 898, 904-906 (Douglas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U. S. 92, 95 .  See, e. g., Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U. S. 507, 520 ; Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U. S. 205, 209 ; Pell v. Procunier, 417 U. S. 817, 828 ; Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U. S. 104, 115 .  In the labor relations area, governmental regulation of expression by employers has been justified in part by the competing First Amendment associational interests of employees and by the economic dependence of employees on their employers.  See NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U. S., at 617-618 ; NLRB v. Virginia Electric & Power Co., 314 U. S. 469, 477 .  The Court in Gissel Packing Co. emphasized the NLRB’s expertise in determining whether statements by employers would tend to mislead or coerce employees.
