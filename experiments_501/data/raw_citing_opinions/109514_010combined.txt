  The question presented by this case is whether the provision of a New Orleans ordinance, as amended in 1972, that excepts from the ordinance’s prohibition against vendors’ selling of foodstuffs from pushcarts in the Vieux Carre, or French Quarter, “vendors who have continuously operated the same business within the Vieux Carre ... for eight or more years prior to January 1, 1972 . . .” denied appellee vendor equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.

  mits to points outside the Vieux Carre. However, even as to those occupations — including all pushcart food vendors — which were to be banned from the Vieux Carre during seasons other than Mardi Gras, the City Council made the “grandfather provision” exception. Two pushcart food vendors — one engaged in the sale of hot dogs and the other an ice cream vendor — had operated in the Vieux Carre for 20 or more years and therefore qualified under the “grandfather clause” and continued to operate there. The Court of Appeals recognized the “City Council’s legitimate authority generally to regulate business conducted on the public streets and sidewalks of the Vieux Carre in order to preserve the appearance and custom valued by the Quarter’s residents and attractive to tourists,” 501 F. 2d, at 709, but nevertheless found that the Council’s justification for the “grandfather” exception was “insufficient to support the discrimination imposed” and thus deprived appellee of equal protection.

<p id="b328-5">
  The unconstitutionality of the ordinance, in its application to appellee, has been definitely and finally adjudicated by the Court of Appeals, and only a state-law question remains to be decided on remand — whether the statute will be totally invalidated or whether only its “grandfather provision” will be struck down. There is no federal, much less constitutional, question which is yet to be resolved below, and the policy underlying § 1254 (2) — ensuring that state laws are not erroneously invalidated — will in no way be served by further delay in adjudicating the constitutional issue presented. Moreover, since the outcome of the severability question will not moot a difficult constitutional issue in this case, the policy of avoiding needless constitutional decisions would not be furthered by staying our hand. Furthermore, to the extent any “finality” requirement in the context of § 1254 (2) might be premised on the policies of avoiding piecemeal appeals or the rendering of advisory opinions, neither difficulty is likely to eventuate in this case; even if we were to uphold the Court of Appeals’ remand for a determination of the severability of the “grandfather provision” under state law, the ruling on remand is not one which would be subject to further review in this Court. On the other hand, a decision by this Court rejecting the constitutional challenge to the statute will obviate the need for further proceedings and bring to a halt the continued disruption of the city’s internal economic affairs.

  The record makes abundantly clear that the amended ordinance, including the “grandfather provision/’ is solely an economic regulation aimed at enhancing the vital role of the French Quarter’s tourist-oriented charm in the economy of New Orleans.

  When local economic regulation is challenged solely as violating the Equal Protection Clause, this Court consistently defers to legislative determinations as to the desirability of particular statutory discriminations. See,

Unless a classification trammels fundamental personal rights or is drawn upon inherently suspect distinctions such as race, religion, or alienage, our decisions presume the constitutionality of the statutory discriminations and require only that the classification challenged be rationally related to a legitimate state interest. States are accorded wide latitude in the regulation of their local economies under their police powers, and rational distinctions may He made with substantially less than mathematical exactitude. ’"'Legislatures may implement their program "step by step,

  The Court of Appeals held in this case, however, that the “grandfather provision” failed even the rationality test. We disagree. The city’s classification rationally furthers the purpose which the Court of Appeals recognized the city had identified as its objective in enacting the provision, that is, as a means “to preserve the appearance and custom valued by the Quarter’s residents and attractive to tourists.” 501 F. 2d, at 709. The legitimacy of that objective is obvious. The City Council plainly could further that objective by making the reasoned judgment that street peddlers and hawkers tend to interfere with the charm and beauty of a historic area and disturb tourists and disrupt their enjoyment of that charm and beauty, and that such vendors in the Vieux Carre, the heart of the city’s tourist industry,

  It is suggested that the “grandfather provision,” allowing the continued operation of some vendors was a, totally arbitrary and irrational method of achieving the city’s purpose. But rather than proceeding by the immediate and absolute abolition of all pushcart food vendors, the city could rationally choose initially to eliminate vendors of more recent vintage. This gradual approach to the problem is not constitutionally impermissible. The governing constitutional principle was stated in

  The city could reasonably decide that newer businesses were less likely to have built up substantial reliance interests in continued operation in the Vieux Carre and that the two vendors who qualified under the “grandfather clause” — both of whom had operated in the area for over 20 years rather than only eight — had themselves become part of the distinctive character and charm that distinguishes the Vieux Carre.
