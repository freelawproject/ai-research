 For the policy of the national Labor Management Relations Act is not to condemn all picketing but only that ascertained by its prescribed processes to fall within its prohibitions.  Otherwise, it is implicit in the Act that the public interest is served by freedom of labor to use the weapon of picketing.  For a state to impinge on the area of labor combat designed to be free is quite as much an obstruction of federal policy as if the state were to declare picketing free for purposes or by methods which the federal Act prohibits.” 346 U. S., at 499-500 .  5 Moreover, San Diego Unions v. Garmon expressly recognized that “the Board may decide that an activity is neither protected nor prohibited, and thereby raise the *145 question whether such activity may be regulated by the States.” 359 U. S., at 245 .  6 It is true, however, that many decisions fleshing out the concept of activities “protected” because Congress meant them to be “unrestricted by any governmental power to regulate,” Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 488 , involved review of per se NLRB rules applied in the regulation of the bargaining process.  E. g., NLRB v. American National Ins. Co., 343 U. S. 395 (1952); NLRB v. Insurance Agents, supra; NLRB v. Drivers Local Union, 362 U. S. 274 (1960); NLRB v. Brown, 380 U. S. 278 (1965); American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S. 300 (1965); cf. NLRB v. Truck Drivers Union, 353 U. S. 87 (1957); H. K. Porter Co. v. NLRB, 397 U. S. 99 (1970); Florida Power & Light v. Electrical Workers, 417 U. S. 790 , 805 n. 16 (1974).  But the analysis of Garner and Insurance Agents came full bloom in the pre-emption area in Teamsters Union v. Morton, <citedDecision>377 U. S. 252</citedDecision> (1964), which held pre-empted the application *146 of state law to award damages for peaceful union secondary picketing.  Although <citedDecision>Morton</citedDecision> involved conduct neither “protected nor prohibited” by § 7 or § 8 of the NLRA, we recognized the necessity of an inquiry whether “ ‘Congress occupied this field and closed it to state regulation.’ ” <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 258</citedDecision> .  Central to Morton’s analysis was the observation that “ [i] n selecting which forms of economic pressure should be prohibited .  .  .  , Congress struck the ‘balance .  .  .

 It cannot be said that the Act forbids an employer ... to rely ultimately on its economic strength to try to secure what it cannot obtain through bargaining.” “[Rjesort to economic weapons should more peaceful measures not avail” is the right of the employer as well as the employee, American Ship Bldg. Co. v. NLRB, 380 U. S., at 317, 8 and the State may not prohibit the use of such weapons or “add to an employer’s federal legal obligations in collective bargaining” any more than in the case of employees.  Cox, supra, n. 4, at 1365.  See, e. g., Beasley v. Food Fair of North Carolina, 416 U. S. 653 (1974).  Whether self-help economic activities are employed by employer or union, the crucial inquiry regarding pre-emption is the same: whether “the exercise *148 of plenary state authority to curtail or entirely prohibit self-help would frustrate effective implementation of the Act’s processes.” Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 394 U. S., at 380 .  Ill There is simply no question that the Act’s processes would be frustrated in the instant case were the State’s ruling permitted to stand.  The employer in this case invoked the Wisconsin law because it was unable to overcome the Union tactic with its own economic self-help means.  9 Although it did employ economic weapons putting pressure on the Union when it terminated the pre *149 vious agreement, supra, at 134, it apparently lacked sufficient economic strength to secure its bargaining demands under “the balance of power between labor and management expressed in our national labor policy,” Teamsters Union v. Morton, <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 260</citedDecision> .  10 But the economic weakness of the affected party cannot justify state aid contrary to federal law for, as we have developed, “the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute is not a grudging exception [under] .  .  .  the [federal] Act; it is part and parcel of the process of collective bargaining.” Insurance Agents, 361 U. S., at 495 .  The state action in this case is not filling “a regulatory void which Congress plainly assumed would not exist,” Hanna Mining Co. v. Marine Engineers, 382 U. S., at 196 (Brennan, J., concurring).  Rather, it is clear beyond question that Wisconsin “[entered] into the substantive aspects of the bargaining process to an extent Congress has not countenanced.” NLRB v. Insurance Agents, supra, at 498 .

 Workers simply left the plant at the end of their workshift and refused to volunteer for or accept overtime or Saturday work.  In sustaining the order of the Wisconsin Commission, the Wisconsin Supreme Court relied on Briggs-Stratton as dispositive against the Union’s claim of pre-emption, 67 Wis. 2d, at 19 , 226 *155 N. W. 2d, at 206 .  The court held further that the refusal to work overtime was neither arguably protected under § 7 nor arguably prohibited under § 8 of the federal Act, id., at 23-24, 226 N. W. 2d, at 208 , an analysis which, as developed, is largely inapplicable to the circumstances of this case. NLRB v. Insurance Agents was distinguished on the ground that that case dealt only with NLRB power “to regulate .  .  .  strike tactics” and left such “regulation ... to the states.” 67 Wis. 2d, at 22 , 226 N. W. 2d, at 207 .  Finally, the court rejected the Union’s argument relying on Teamsters Union v. <citedDecision>Morton</citedDecision> that the refusal to work overtime was affirmatively “permitted” under federal law, stating: “Congress has not 'focused upon’ partial .  .  .  strikes,” and therefore “[p]olicing of such conduct is left wholly to the states.” 67 Wis. 2d, at 26 , 226 N. W. 2d, at 209 .  Since Briggs-Stratton is today overruled, and as we hold further that the Union’s refusal to work overtime is peaceful conduct constituting activity which must be free of regulation by the States if the congressional intent in enacting the comprehensive federal law of labor relations is not to be frustrated, the judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court is Reversed.  Wisconsin Stat. § 111.06 (2) (1974) provides: “It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employe individually or in concert with others: “(h) To take unauthorized possession of property of the employer or to engage in any concerted effort to interfere with production except by leaving the premises in an orderly manner for the purpose of going on strike.” Thus Automobile Workers v. Russell, 356 U. S. 634 (1958), upheld state-court jurisdiction of a common-law tort action against *137 a union to recover compensatory and punitive damages for malicious interference with the plaintiff's lawful occupation by mass picketing and threats of violence that prevented the plaintiff from entering the plant and engaging in his employment; Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., 355 U. S. 131 (1957), sustained state-court power to enjoin striking employees from threatening or provoking violence or obstructing or attempting to obstruct the free use of the streets adjacent to the struck plant, or free ingress and egress to and from the property; Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 351 U. S. 266 (1956), sustained state authority to vest jurisdiction in a state labor relations board to enjoin violent union conduct; United Constr. Workers v. Laburnum Constr. Corp., 347 U. S. 656 (1954), held a state court not precluded from hearing and determining a common-law tort action based on conduct which, although an unfair labor practice under federal law, constituted threats of violence and intimidation that forced an employer to abandon all of its projects in the area.  In short, a State still may exercise “its historic powers over such traditionally local matters as public safety and order and the use of streets and highways,” Allen-Bradley Local v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 315 U. S. 740, 749 (1942), for “[policing of such conduct is left wholly to the states.” Automobile Workers v. Wisconsin Emp. Rel. Board, 336 U. S. 245, 253 (1949).
