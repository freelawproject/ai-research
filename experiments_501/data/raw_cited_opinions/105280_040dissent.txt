<p id="AJi">dissenting.</p>
<p id="b513-7">In view of the recentness of the decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kahriger, </em>345 U. S. 22, and my continuing disagreement with the constitutional views which it expressed, I cannot acquiesce in this decision. Indeed, this case only emphasizes the difficulties which I found in <em>Kahriger, </em>for here we are concerned with a spurious use of the taxing power as a means of facilitating prosecution of federal offenses.</p>
