 Reg. v. Boyes, 1 B. & S. 311, 330; Brown v. Walker, 161 U. S. 591, 599-600 ; Rogers v. United States, 340 U. S. 367, 374 .  Petitioner was confronted by a comprehensive system of federal and state prohibitions against wagering activities; he was required, on pain of criminal prosecution, to provide information which he might reasonably suppose would be available to prosecuting authorities, and which would surely prove a significant “link in a chain” 9 of evidence tending to establish his guilt.  10 Unlike the income tax return *49 in question in United States v. Sullivan, 274 U. S. 259 , every portion of these requirements had the direct and unmistakable consequence of incriminating petitioner; the application of the constitutional privilege to the entire registration procedure was in this instance neither “extreme” nor “extravagant.” See id., at 263 .  It would appear to follow that petitioner’s assertion of the privilege as a defense to this prosecution was entirely proper, and accordingly should have sufficed to prevent his conviction.  Nonetheless, this Court has twice concluded that the privilege against self-incrimination may not appropriately be asserted by those in petitioner’s circumstances.  United States v. Kahriger, supra; Lewis v. United States, supra. We must therefore consider whether those cases have continuing force in light of our more recent decisions.  Moreover, we must also consider the relevance of certain collateral lines of authority; in particular, we must determine whether either the “required records” doctrine, Shapiro v. United States, 335 U. S. 1 , or restrictions placed upon the use by prosecuting authorities of information obtained as a consequence of the wagering taxes, cf. Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 52</citedDecision> , should be utilized to preclude assertion of the constitutional privilege in this situation.  To these questions we turn.  *50 III. The Court's opinion in Kahriger suggested that a defendant under indictment for willful failure to register under § 4412 cannot properly challenge the constitutionality under the Fifth Amendment of the registration requirement.  For this point, the Court relied entirely upon Mr. Justice Holmes’ opinion for the Court in United States v. Sullivan, supra. The taxpayer in Sullivan was convicted of willful failure to file an income tax return, despite his contention that the return would have obliged him to admit violations of the National Prohibition Act.  The Court affirmed the conviction, and rejected the taxpayer’s claim of the privilege.  It concluded that most of the return’s questions would not have compelled the taxpayer to make incriminating disclosures, and that it would have been “an extreme if not an extravagant application” of the privilege to permit him to draw within it the entire return.  274 U. S., at 263 .

 The Government’s anxiety to obtain information known to a private individual does not without more render that information public; if it did, no room would remain for the application of the constitutional privilege.  Nor does it stamp information with a public character that the Government has formalized its demands in the attire of a statute; if this alone were sufficient, the constitutional privilege could be entirely abrogated by any Act of Congress.  Third, the requirements at issue in Shapiro were imposed in “an essentially non-criminal and regulatory area of inquiry” while those here are directed to a “selective group inherently suspect of criminal activities.” Cf. Albertson v. SACB, 382 U. S. 70, 79 .  The United States’ principal interest is evidently the collection of revenue, and not the punishment of gamblers, see United States v. Calamaro, 354 U. S. 351, 358 ; but the characteristics of the activities about which information is sought, and the composition of the groups to which inquiries are made, readily distinguish this situation from that in Shapiro .  There is no need to explore further the elements and limitations of Shapiro and the cases involving public papers; these points of difference in combination preclude any appropriate application of those cases to the present one.' *58 y. Finally, we have been urged by the United States to permit continued enforcement of the registration and occupational tax provisions, despite the demands of the constitutional privilege, by shielding the privilege’s claimants through the imposition of restrictions upon the use by federal and state authorities of information obtained as a consequence of compliance with the wagering tax requirements.  It is suggested that these restrictions might be similar to those imposed by the Court in Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, <citedDecision>378 U. S. 52</citedDecision> .  The Constitution of course obliges this Court to give full recognition to the taxing powers and to measures reasonably incidental to.  their exercise.  But we are equally obliged to give full effect to the constitutional restrictions which attend the exercise of those powers.  We do not, as we have said, doubt Congress’ power to tax activities which are, wholly or in part, unlawful.  Nor can it be doubted that the privilege against self-incrimination may not properly be asserted if other protection is granted which “is so broad as to have the same extent in scope and effect” as the privilege itself.  Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U. S. 547, 585 .

 We must therefore assume that the imposition of use-restrictions would directly preclude effectuation of a significant element of Congress’ purposes in adopting the wagering taxes.  16 Moreover, the imposition of such restrictions would necessarily oblige state prosecuting authorities to establish in each case that their evidence was untainted by any connection with information obtained as a consequence of the wagering taxes; 17 the federal requirements would thus be protected only at the cost of hampering, perhaps seriously, enforcement of state prohibitions against gambling.  We cannot know how Congress would assess the competing demands of the *60 federal treasury and of state gambling prohibitions; we are, however, entirely certain that the Constitution has entrusted to Congress, and not to this Court, the task of striking an appropriate balance among such values.  18 We therefore must decide that it would be improper for the Court to impose restrictions of the kind urged by the United States.  VI.  We are fully cognizant of the importance for the United States’ various fiscal and regulatory functions of timely and accurate information, compare Mansfield, supra, and Meltzer, Required Records, the McCarran Act, and the Privilege against Self-Incrimination, 18 U. Chi. L. Rev. 687 ; but other methods, entirely consistent with constitutional limitations, exist by which Congress may obtain such information.  See generally Counselman v. Hitchcock, supra, at 585 ; compare <citedDecision>Murphy</citedDecision> v. Waterfront <citedDecision>Commission, supra.</citedDecision> Accordingly, nothing we do today will prevent either the taxation or the regulation by Congress of activities otherwise made unlawful by state or federal statutes.  Nonetheless, we can only conclude, under the wagering tax system as presently written, that petitioner properly asserted the privilege against self-incrimination, and that his assertion should have provided a complete defense to this prosecution.  This defense should have reached both *61 the substantive counts for failure to register and to pay the occupational tax, and the count for conspiracy to evade payment of the tax. We emphasize that we do not hold that these wagering tax provisions are as such constitutionally impermissible; we hold only that those who properly assert the constitutional privilege as to these provisions may not be criminally punished for failure to comply with their requirements.  If, in different circumstances, a taxpayer is not confronted by substantial hazards of self-incrimination, or if he is otherwise outside the privilege’s protection, nothing we decide today would shield him from the various penalties prescribed by the wagering tax statutes.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Reversed.  Mr. Justice Marshall took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.

 Insofar as this is intended to suggest the the crucial issue respecting the applicability of Shapiro is the method by which information reaches the Government, we are unable to accept the distinction.  We perceive no meaningful difference between an obligation to maintain records for inspection, and such an obligation supplemented by a requirement that those records be filed periodically with officers of the United States.  We believe, as the United States itself argued in Shapiro , that “[regulations permit records to be retained, rather than filed, largely for the convenience of the persons regulated.” Brief for the United States in No. 49, October Term 1947, at 21, n. 7.  15 Section 6107 reads as follows: “In the principal internal revenue office in each internal revenue district there shall be kept, for public inspection, an alphabetical list of the names of all persons who have paid special taxes under subtitle D or E within such district.  Such list shall be prepared and kept pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Secretary or his delegate, and shall contain the time, place, and business for which such special taxes have been paid, and upon application of any prosecuting officer of any State, county, or municipality there shall be furnished to him a certified copy thereof, as of a public record, for which a fee of $1 for each 100 words or fraction thereof in the copy or copies so requested may be charged.” The special taxes to which the section refers include the occupational tax imposed by 26 U. S. C. §4411 .  16 The requirement now embodied in § 6107 was adopted prior to the special occupational tax on wagering, but Congress plainly indicated when it adopted the latter that it understood, and wished, that state prosecuting authorities would be provided fists of those who had paid the wagering tax. See H. R. Rep. No. 586, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 60; S. Rep. No. 781, 82d Cong., 1st Sess., 118.  17 The Court required such a showing as part of the restrictions imposed in Murphy, <citedDecision>378 U. S., at 79, n. 18</citedDecision> .  The United States has acknowledged that this would be no less imperative here.  Brief for the United States 24r-25.  18 It should be emphasized that it would not suffice here simply to sever § 6107.  See 26 U. S. C. § 7852 (a).  Cf. Warren v. Mayor of Charlestown, 2 Gray 84 , 99; Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U. S. 238, 316 .  We would be required not merely to strike out words, but to insert words that are not now in the statute.
