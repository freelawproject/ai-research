 But in Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494 , we opened wide the door, distorting the “clear and present danger” test beyond recognition.  1 In that case the prosecution dubbed an agreement to teach the Marxist creed a “conspiracy.” The case was submitted to a jury on a charge that the jury could not convict unless it found that the defendants “intended to overthrow the Government ‘as speedily as circumstances would permit.' ” Id., at 509-511 .  The Court sustained convictions under that charge, construing it to mean a determination of ‘“whether the gravity of the “evil,” discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.’ ” 2 Id., at 510 , quoting from United States v. Dennis, 183 F. 2d 201, 212 .  Out of the “clear and present danger” test came other offspring.  Advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow of government as an abstract principle is immune from prosecution.  Yates v. United States, <citedDecision>354 U. S. 298, 318</citedDecision> .  But an “active” member, who has a guilty knowledge and intent of the aim to overthrow the Government *454 by violence, Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290 , may be prosecuted.  Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 228 .  And the power to investigate, backed by the powerful sanction of contempt, includes the power to determine which of the two categories fits the particular witness.  Barenblatt v. United States, 360 U. S. 109, 130 .  And so the investigator roams at will through all of the beliefs of the witness, ransacking his conscience and his innermost thoughts.  Judge Learned Hand, who wrote for the Court of Appeals in affirming the judgment in Dennis, coined the “not improbable” test, 183 F. 2d 201, 214 , which this Court adopted and which Judge Hand preferred over the “clear and present danger” test.

 The line between what is permissible and not subject to control and what may be made impermissible and subject to regulation is the line between ideas and overt acts.  The example usually given by those who would punish speech is the case of one who falsely shouts fire in a crowded theatre.  This is, however, a classic case where speech is brigaded with action.  See Speiser v. Randall, 357 U. S. 513, 536-537 (Douglas, J., concurring).  They are indeed inseparable and a prosecution can be launched for the overt *457 acts actually caused.  Apart from rare instances of that kind, speech is, I think, immune from prosecution.  Certainly there is no constitutional line between advocacy of abstract ideas as in <citedDecision>Yates</citedDecision> and advocacy of political action as in Scales .  The quality of advocacy turns on the depth of the conviction; and government has no power to invade that sanctuary of belief and conscience.  3 See McKay, The Preference For Freedom, 34 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 1182, 1203-1212 (1959).  See Feiner v. New York, 340 U. S. 315 , where a speaker was arrested for arousing an audience when the only “clear and present danger” was that the hecklers in the audience would break up the meeting.  See Mr. Justice Black, dissenting, in Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U. S. 382, 446 , 449 et seq.
