**Combined Opinion**
 The power given to the defendant by § 4 of article 11 of the constitution, the defendant having a population of less than 10,000 inhabitants at the date of its charter and at the date of the ordinance, was only the power to levy, assess and collect an annual tax to defray the current expenses of its local government, not exceeding, for any one year, one-fourth of one per cent. That in exercising its power to borrow not exceeding' $15,000 on its credit, for general purposes, the city could give to the lender, as a voucher for the repayment of the money, evidence of indebtedness in the shape of -non-negotiable paper, is quite clear; but that does not cover the right to issue negotiable' paper or bonds, unimpeachable in the hands of a tona fide holder.  In the present case, it appears that Mensing bought from the defendant $5000 of the bonds at 95 cents oh the dollar, and that other $7000 of the bonds were sold by *182 the city for the same price, it- thus receiving only $11,400 for $12,000 of the "bonds, and suffering a discount on them of $600.  The city thus agreed to pay $12,000, and interest thereon, for $11,400 bprrowed.  This shows the evil working of the issue of bonds for more than the amount of money borrowed.  It appears by the record that depot grounds in, and the right of way through, the city of Brenham were bought for the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad Company with money realized from the sale of bonds issued under the ordinance of June 7,1879, and that $3000 of such bonds were used by the city for fire department purposes.  The power to borrow the $11,400 would not have been nugatory, unaccompanied by the power to issue negotiable bonds therefor.  Merrill v. Monticello, <citedDecision>138 U. S. 673, 687</citedDecision> ; Williams v. Davidson, 43 Texas, 1, 33, 34 ; City of Cleburne v. Railroad Company, 66 Texas, 461 ; 1 Dillon on Municipal Corp. 4th ed. § 89, and notes; § 91, n. 2; § 126, n. 1; §§ 507, 507 a. The confining of the power in the present case to a borrowing of money for general purposes on the credit of the city,limits it to the power to borrow money for ordinary governmental purposes, such as are generally carried out with revenues derived from taxation; and the presumption is that the grant-of the power was intended to confer the right to borrow money in anticipation of the receipt of revenue taxes, and not to plunge the municipal corporation into a debt on which interest must be paid at the rate of ten per centum per annum, semi-annually, for at least ten years.  It is easy for the legislature to confer upon a municipality, when it is constitutional to do so, the power to issue negotiable bonds ; and, under the well-settled rule that any doubt as to the existence of such power ought to be' determined against its existence, it ought not to be held to exist in the present case. A review of the cases on this subject in this court will be useful.  In Rogers v. Burlington, 3 Wall. 654, 666 , in 1865, it was.  held that the statutory power granted to the city of Burling *183 ton, Iowa, “ to borrow money for any public purpose,” gave authority to the city to borrow money to aid a railroad company in building a road for public travel and transportation, and that, as a means of borrowing money to accomplish such object, the city might issue its bonds to be sold by the .railroad company to raise the money.  Bonds were issued and loaned to the company.  They were coupon bonds in the usual form, and were secured by first-mortgage bonds of the company.  Suit was brought by a Iona fide holder for value, to recover against the city on the coupons, and the case came up on a demurrer to the petition.

 The opinion of this court was delivered by Mr. Justice Harlan, and the case of Claiborne County v. Brooks, 111 U. S. 400 , was cited and approved.  In Kelley v. Milan, 127 U. S. 139 , and Norton v. Dyersburg, 127 U. S. 160 , it was held that the power granted to- a municipal corporation to become a stockholder in a railroad com-pany did not carry with it the power to issue negotiable bonds in payment of the subscription, unless the latter power was expressly or by reasonable implication conferred by statute.  In the opinion in the case of Norton v. Dyersburg , the case of Claiborne County v. Brooks, 111 U. S. 400 , was cited with approval.  In Young v. Clarendon Township, 132 U. S. 340 , it was held to be settled law that a municipality has no poAver to issue its bonds in aid of a railroad, except by legislative permission; and in the opinion of the court, delivered by Mr. Justice Lamar, the cases of Claiborne County v. Brooks and of Kelley v. Milan were cited and approved.  In Hill v. Memphis, 134 U. S. 198, 203 , the opinion of the court being delivered by Mr. Justice Field, it was held that the power conferred by a statute on a municipal corporation to subscribe for the stock of a railroad company did not include the power to issue negotiable bonds representing a debt, in order to pay for that subscription; and it was said that that rule was well settled.  It was added: “ The inability of municipal corporations to issue negotiable paper for their indebtedness, however incurred, unless authority for that pun-pose is expressly given or necessarily implied for the execution of other express powers, has been affirmed in repeated decisions of this court; ” and the cases of Police Jury v. Britton , *186 Claiborne County v. Brooks, Kelley v. Milan and Young v. Clarendon Township were cited with approval.  In Merrill v. Monticello, <citedDecision>138 U. S. 673, 687, 691</citedDecision> , it was held that the implied power of a municipal corporation to borrow money to enable it to execute the powers expressly conferred upon it by law, if existing at all, did not authorize it to create and issue negotiable securities to be sold in the market and to be taken by the purchaser freed from the equities that might be set up by the maker; and that to borrow money, and to give a bond or obligation therefor which might circulate in the market as a negotiable security, freed from any equities that might be set up by the maker of it, were essentially different transactions in their nature and legal effect.  In the opinion of the court, which was delivered by Mr. Justice Lamar, the cases of Police Jury v. Britton, Claiborne County v. Brooks, Kelley v. Milan, Young v. Clarendon Township and Hill v. Memphis were cited with approval.  It was added: u It is admitted that the power to borrow money, or to incur indebtedness, carries with it the power to issue the usual evidences of indebtedness, by the corporation, to the lender or other creditor.  Such evidences may be in the form of promissory notes, warrants, and, perhaps,' most generally, in that of a bond. But there is a marked legal difference between the power to give a note to a lender for the amount of money borrowed, or to a creditor for the amount due, and the power to issue for sale, in open market, a bond, as a commercial security, with immunity, in the hands of a bona fide holder for value, from equitable defences.  The plaintiff in error contends that there is no legal or substantial difference between the two; that the issuing and disposal of bonds in market, thóugh in common parlance, and sometimes in legislative enactment, called a sale, is not so in fact; and that the so-called purchaser who takes the bond and advances his money for it is actually a lender, as much so as a person who takes á bond payable to him in his own name.” The opinion then stated that the logical result of the doctrines announced in the five cases which it cited ■ clearly showed that the bonds sued on in the case of <citedDecision>Merrill</citedDecision> v. Mon *187 bicello were invalid, and added: “It.  does not follow that, because the town of Monticello had the right to contract a. loan, it had, therefore, the right to issue negotiable bonds and put them on the market as evidences of such loan.  To borrow; money, and to give a bond or obligation therefor which may circulate in the market as a negotiable security, freed from any equities that may be set up by the maker of it, are, in their nature and in their legal effect, essentially different transactions.  In the present case, all that can be contended, for is, that the town had the power to contract a loan, under certain specified restrictions and limitations.  Nowhere in the statute is there any express power given to issue negotiable bonds as evidence of such loan.  Nor can such power be implied, because the' existence of it is not necessary to carryout any of the .purposes of the municipality.  It is true that-there is a considerable number of cases, many of Avhich are cited in the brief of counsel for.

 It is also to be remarked that the ordinance of June 7, 1879, provided that the city should have the right to redeem the bonds “at any time after five years, from date,” while each bond on its face states that it is redeemable by the city “after the expiration of ten years from date hereof.” The officers of the city had no power to depart from the.  terms of the ordinance by varying the time limited for redemption.  We see nothing in the provisions of the constitution of Texas of 1876, before cited, to aid the power of the city to issue these negotiable bonds.  We cannot regard the.provision in the charter of the city, that bonds of the corporation of the city “ shall not be subject to tax under this act,” as recognizing the validity of the bonds in question.  Whatever that provision may mean, it cannot include bonds unlawfully issued.  As there was no authority-to issue the bonds, even a bona fide holder of them cannot have a right to recover upon them or their coupons.  Marsh v. Fulton Country, 10 Wall. 676 ; East Oakland v. Skinner, 94 U. S. 255 ; Buchanan v. Litchfield, 102 U. S. 278 ; Hayes v. Holly Springs, 114 U. S. 120 ; Daviess County v. Dickinson, 117 U. S. 657 ; Hopper v. Covington, 118 U. S. 148, 151 ; Merrill v. Monticello, <citedDecision>138 U. S. 673, 681, 682</citedDecision> .  As the action here is directly upon, the coupons, and there is no right of recovery upon them, the judgment must be *189 Reversed, and the case remanded to the Circuit Court, with a direction to sustain the defendants, general demurrer and special demurrer *and exceptions to the plaintiffs ' original petition, and to sustain the special exceptions and demurrers of the defendant to the plaintiff’’ s supplemental petition, and to enter judgment thereon in favor of the defendant and dismissing both of said petitions, with a general judgment for the defendant.  [See p. 549, post.] Mr. Justice Harlan, with, whom concurred Mr. Justice Brewer and Mr. Justice Brown, dissenting.  Mr. Justice Brewer, Mr. Justice Brown and myself being unable to concur in the opinion just rendered, the grounds of • our dissent will be stated.  The charter of the city of Brenham, granted in 1873, provided that “ the city council shall have the power and authority to borrow, for general purposes, not exceeding fifteen thousand dollars, on the credit of said city; ” also, that the “ bonds of the corporation of the city of Brenham shall not be subject to tax under this act.” Special Laws of Texas, pp. 14 and 23.  Under the authority conferred by this charter the city council in 1879 passed an ordinance, entitled, “An ordinance to provide for the issue and sale of fifteen thousand dollars in coupon bonds of the city, to borrow money for general purposes.” Bonds, negotiable • in form, and to the full amount authorized by the ordinance, were issued by the city in 1879, and the coupons held by the German-American Bank were from the bonds so issued.
**Combined Opinion**
 The people having voted, by the requisite majority, in favor of issuing and lending $15,000 in the bonds of the city to a particular railroad company, bonds for that amount, negotiable in form, were issued.  The court held the construction of a railroad -to be a public purpose, within the meaning of the charter of the city, and that it made no difference whether the bonds were sold in the market by the officers of the municipality, or were first delivered to the company and sold by its agents for the same purpose.  u Technically speaking,” the court observed, “ it may be said that the transaction, as between the company and the defendants, was, in form, a contract of lending; but as between the defendants and the persons who purchased the bonds in the market it was undeniably a contract of borrowing money; and the same remark applies to the- transaction in its practical and legal effect upon all subsequent holders of the securities who have since become such for value, and in the usual course of business.” The minority dissented, not upon the ground that an express power in a municipal corporation to' borrow money did not give authority to execute negotiable instruments for the money borrowed —■ although that question was upon the very face of the case — but upon the ground that the transaction was not one of borrowing money.  Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the minority, said: “ Here the authority conferred is to borrow money ; yet no money was borrowed, but the bonds of the city were lent.  Borrowing money and lending credit are not convertible terms.  The two things which they indicate are essentially distinct and different.” Mr. Justice Mil *191 ler, in a separate dissenting opinion; called attention to the fact that the Supreme Court of Iowa had then recently held the bonds, involved in that suit, to be void, upon the ground that the transaction “ was a loan of credit, and not a borrowing of money.” The principle announced in Rogers v. Burlington was applied in Mitchell v. Burlington, 4 Wall. 270 .  The cases, decided since Rogers v. Burlington, which have been cited, in the opinion of the court, as announcing the doctrine that an express power given to a municipal corporation to borrow money does not authorize the execution of negotiable instruments for the money so borrowed, are: Police Jury v. Britton, 15 Wall. 566, 570, 572 ; Claiborne County v. Brooks, 111 U. S. 400, 406 ; Concord v. Robinson, 121 U. S. 165, 167 ; Kelley v. Milan, 127 U. S. 139, 150 ; Morton v. Dyersburg, 127 U. S. 160, 175 ; Young v. Clarendon, 132 U. S. 340 ; Hill v. Memphis, 134 U. S. 198, 203 ; and Merrill v. Monticello, <citedDecision>138 U. S. 673, 686, 687</citedDecision> .  In Police Jury v. Britton , it appeared that a police jury, in a parish of Louisiana, charged with the supervision and repair of roads, bridges, causeways, dikes, levees and other highways, was prohibited by statute from contracting any debt or pecuniary liability without fully providing in the ordinance creating the debt the means of paying the principal and interest of the debt so contracted.  And the question arose as to whether it could rightfully issue negotiable bonds to take the place of certain orders previously given by it for work done on levees in the parish.  The cáse involved no question as to the scope and effect of an express power in the parish to borrow money.  Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, after observing that the police jury had no express authority to issue bonds, and that, if it.  existed, it must be implied from the general powers of local administration with which they were invested, said: “We have, therefore, the question directly presented in this case whether the trustees or representative officers of a parish, county or other local jurisdiction, invested with the usual powers of administration in specific matters, and the power of levying taxes to defray the necessary expenditures of the jurisdiction, have an implied authority to *192 issue negotiable securities, payable in future, of such a character as to be unimpeachable in the hands of bona fide holders, "for.  the purpose of raising money or funding a,previous indebtedness % ” This question was answered in the negative.
**Combined Opinion**
 did not imply authority to issue negotiable bonds on account of such *193 appropriation. ; in Kelley v. Milan , that “.a municipal corporation, in order to exercise, the power of becoming a stockholder im, a railroad corporation^.  must have such power expressly conferred upon it.  by a grant from the legislature, and that even the power to subscribe for such stock does not carry with it the ppwer.to issue negotiable bonds in payment of the sub-, scription, unless the power to issue such bonds is expressly or by reasonable implication conferred by statute ¡ ” in Norton v. Dyersburg , that “ the .mere authority given to a municipality to subscribe for stock in a railroad company did, hot carry with it the implied power-to issue bonds therefor, especially where, as in the present case, special provisions were made for paying the subscription by taxation;”' in Young v. Clarendon Township, authority to make the municipal bonds there involved was conceded, and the case turned upon the quéstion, whether their execution was not subject to the restrictions and directions of the act which authorized them to be • issuéd; and in Hill v. Memphis , that “the power -to.  subscribe for stock does not of itself ■ include the' power to issue bonds of a town in-payment of it,” and that “ the inability of municipal corporations to issue negotiable paper for their indebtedness, however incurred, unless authority for that purpose is expressly given • or necessa/ril/y implied for the execution of other express powers, has been approved in repeated decisions of this court.” It thus appears that in no -one of the above cases, decided since.  Rogers v. Burlington, was there any question as to negotiable securities being issued under an .express power to borrow money; and .that some of them concede that such a' power carries-with it authority to give a negotiable paper for money borrowed.  The case which seems to be much relied upon to support the present judgment is <citedDecision>Merrill</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Monticello</citedDecision> .  But we submit that it does- not sustain the broad doctrine that negotiable securities may not be issued in execution of an express power to borrow money.  What could or could not be done, under such a power, was not a question involved in that case. The question was whether authority in the town of Monticello to issue^negotiable bonds could be implied, not from an express, *194 but from au implied power to borrow money.  After observing that, under the laws of Indiana, the proposition that a town has an implied authority to borrow money, or contract a loan, under the conditions, and in the manner expressly prescribed, was not to be controverted, the- court, speaking by Mr. Justice Lamar, said: “ But this only brings us back to the question, Does the implied power to borrow money or contract a loan carry with it a further implication of power to issue funding negotiable bonds, for that amount, and' sell them in open market ?  ” The question in that case, as framed by the court, clearly shoAVs that it was only considering Avhether an authority in a municipal corporation to issue, negotiable securities could be implied from a power to borrow which was itself to be implied from other powers granted.  This, also, appears from the following clause in the opinion: “ It is admitted that the power to borrow money, or to incur indebtedness, carries with it the power to issue the usual evidences of indebtedness, by the corporation, to the lender or other creditor.  Such evidences may be in the form of promissory notes, warrants, and perhaps, most generally, in that of a bond.” And it is further shown by the fact that the opinion, referring to the clause in Police Jury v. Britton , above quoted, which' states that authority in a municipal corporation to issue negotiable securities may be implied from an express power to borrow money, states that it has no application to the case then before the court, in which the attempt was made to imply authority to issue negotiable bonds simply from an implied poAver to borrow money.
