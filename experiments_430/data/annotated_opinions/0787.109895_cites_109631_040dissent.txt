**Dissenting Opinion**
Me. Justice Brennan, with whom Mr. Justice White, Mr. Justice Marshall, and Mr. Justice Stevens join, dissenting.  On the basis of his evaluation of the trial evidence, the District Judge concluded that unjustifiable preindictment de *102 lay had so prejudiced respondent’s defense as to preclude— consistently with the Due Process Clause — his conviction of the offense alleged in count one of the indictment.  He therefore dismissed this count with prejudice.  Under the principles of double jeopardy law that controlled until today, further prosecution of respondent under count one would unquestionably be prohibited, and appeal by the United States from the judgment of dismissal thus would not lie.  See 18 U. S. C. § 3731 (1976 ed.).  The dismissal would, under prior law, have been treated as an “acquittal” — i.  e., “a legal determination on the basis of facts adduced at the trial relating to the general issue of the case.” United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., <citedDecision>430 U. S. 564, 575</citedDecision> (1977) (citations omitted).  Indeed, further proceedings would have been barred even if the dismissal could not have been so characterized.  United States v. Jenkins, 420 U. S. 358 (1975), established that, even if a mid-trial termination does not amount to an “acquittal,” an appeal by the United States from the dismissal would not lie if a reversal would, as is of course true in the present case, require “further proceedings of some sort, devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged.” Id., at 370 .  This principle was reaffirmed only last Term in Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, 30 (1977): “Where a midtrial dismissal is granted on the ground, correct or not, that the defendant simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged, .  .  .  further prosecution is barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause.” 1 But the Court today overrules the principle recognized in Jenkins and Lee .
**Dissenting Opinion**
 Accordingly, the policies of the Double Jeopardy Clause mandate that the Government be afforded but one complete opportunity to convict an accused and that when the first proceeding terminates in a final judgment favorable to the defendant 5 any retrial be barred.  The rule as to acquittals can only be understood as simply an application of this larger principle.  Judgments of acquittal normally result from jury or bench *106 verdicts of not guilty.  In such cases, the acquittal represents the factfinder’s conclusion that, under the controlling legal principles, the evidence does not establish that the defendant can be convicted of the offense charged in the indictment.  But the judgment does not necessarily establish the criminal defendant’s lack of criminal culpability; the acquittal may result from erroneous evidentiary rulings or erroneous interpretations of governing legal principles induced by the defense.  Yet the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a second trial. In repeatedly holding that the Government may not appeal from an acquittal if a reversal would necessitate a retrial, the Court has, of course, recognized that this rule impairs to some degree the Government’s interest in enforcing its criminal laws.  Yet, while we have acknowledged that permitting review of acquittals would avoid release of guilty defendants who benefited from “error, irrational behavior, or prejudice on the part of the trial judge,” United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 574</citedDecision> ; see United Statesv.  Wilson, supra, at 352, we nevertheless have consistently held that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars any appellate review in such circumstances.  The reason is not that the first trial established the defendant’s factual innocence, but rather that the second trial would present all the untoward consequences the Clause was designed to prevent.  The Government would be allowed to seek to persuade a second trier of fact of the defendant’s guilt, to strengthen any weaknesses in its first presentation, and to subject the defendant to the expense and anxiety of a second trial. See ibid. This basic principle of double jeopardy law has heretofore applied not only to acquittals based on the verdict of the fact-finder, but also to acquittals entered by the trial judge, following the presentation of evidence but before verdict, pursuant to Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29.  See Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54; United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., *107 supra; Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141 (1962).  For however egregious the error of the acquittal, the termination favorable to the accused has been regarded as no different from a factfinder’s acquittal that resulted from errors of the trial judge. See also Burks v. United States, ante, p. 1.  These cases teach that the Government’s means of protecting its vital interest in convicting the guilty is its participation as an adversary at the criminal trial where it has every opportunity to dissuade the trial court from committing erroneous rulings favorable to the accused.

 Sanabria simply confirms that the distinction the Court today draws is wholly arbitrary, bearing no conceivable relationship to the policies protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  II The Court’s definition of “acquittal” compounds the damage that repudiation of Jenkins and Lee has done to the fabric of double jeopardy law. Not only is this definition unduly *111 restrictive, it is literally incapable of principled application.  The Court’s application of its definition to the facts of this case proves the point.  The doctrine of preindictment delay, like a host of other principles and policies of the law — e. g., entrapment, insanity, right to speedy trial, statute of limitations — operates to preclude the imposition of criminal liability on defendants, notwithstanding a showing that they committed criminal acts.  Like these other doctrines, the question whether preindictment delay violates due process of law cannot ordinarily be considered apart from the factual development at trial since normally only the “ ‘[e] vents of the trial [can demonstrate] actual prejudice.’ ” United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783, 789 (1977), quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U. S. 307, 326 (1971); see United States v. MacDonald, 435 U. S. 850, 858, 858-859 (1978).  Here, therefore, the District Court, quite properly, deferred consideration of the respondent’s pretrial motion to dismiss for preaccusation delay until trial. At the close of the evidence, respondent renewed his motion.  The District Court recognized that there was sufficient evidence of guilt to permit submission of count one to the jury, but granted the motion as to this count because, evaluating the facts adduced at trial, the court found that the delay between the offense alleged and respondent’s indictment had been unjustifiable and had so prejudiced respondent’s ability to present his defense as to constitute a denial of due process of law. A critical feature of today’s holding appears to be the Court’s definition of acquittal as “ 'a resolution [in the defendant’s favor], correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged,’ ” ante, at 97, quoting United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., <citedDecision>430 U. S., at 571</citedDecision> .  But this definition, which is narrower than the traditional one, enjoys no significant support in our prior decisions.  The language quoted from Martin Linen Supply Co. was tied to the par *112 ticular issue in that case and was never intended to serve as an all-encompassing definition of acquittal for all purposes.  Rather, Martin Linen Supply referred generally to “acquittal” as “a legal determination on the basis of facts adduced at the trial relating to the general issue of the case,” <citedDecision>id., at 575</citedDecision> (citations omitted), and this is the accepted definition.  See Serfass v. United States, 420 U. S. 377, 393 (1975), quoting United States v. Sisson, 399 U. S. 267 , 290 n. 19 (1970).  This definition, moreover, clearly encompasses rulings pertaining to all “affirmative defenses” that depend on the factual development at trial. The traditional definition of “acquittal” obviously is responsive to the values protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause.  While it perhaps might not be objectionable to permit retrial of a defendant whose first trial was terminated on the basis of a midtrial ruling on a motion that could— because it did not depend upon the facts adduced at trial — have been raised before jeopardy attached, see Serfass v. United States, supra, at 394, 8 it would be intolerable to permit, the retrial of a defendant whose first prosecution ended on the basis of a ruling — like the one in the present case — which could only be made after the factual development at trial. Notably, the Court neither explains why it chooses to reject the more traditional definition of “acquittal” nor attempts to justify its more restrictive definition in terms of the constitutional policy against multiple trials.  But I will not dwell further on this point.. As the Court opinion itself demonstrates, what is perhaps as important as the actual definition is how it is applied.  The pertinent question, thus, is one the Court never addresses: Why, for pur *113 poses of its new definition of “acquittal,” is not the fact vel non of preindictment delay one of the “factual elements of the offense charged”?  The Court plainly cannot answer that preindictment delay is not referred to in the statutory definition of the offense charged in count one, cf. Patterson v. New York, 432 U. S. 197 (1977), for it states that dismissals based on the defenses of insanity 9 and entrapment — neither of which is bound up with the statutory definition of federal crimes — will constitute “acquittals.” Ante, at 97-98.

 10 Ironically, it seems likely that, when all is said and done, there will be few instances indeed in which defenses can be deemed unrelated to factual innocence.  If so, today’s decision may be limited to disfavored doctrines like preaccusation delay.  See generally United States v. Lovasco, 431 U. S. 783 (1977).  It is regrettable that the Court should introduce such confusion in an area of the law that, until today, had been crystal clear.  Its introduction might be tolerable if necessary to advance some important policy or to serve values protected by *116 the Double Jeopardy Clause, but that manifestly is not the case. Rather, today's decision fashions an entirely arbitrary distinction that creates precisely the evils that the Double Jeopardy Clause was designed to prevent.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  See also Finch v. United States, 433 U. S. 676 (1977) (applying rule of Jenkins to dismissal entered on basis of stipulated facts); United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co., <citedDecision>430 U. S. 564</citedDecision> (1977).  Section 3731 provides that the United States may obtain appellate review of a "dismissal” “except that no appeal shall lie where the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution prohibits further prosecution.” The Court cites with approval Sanabria v. United States, ante, p. 54; United States v. Martin Linen Supply <citedDecision>Co., supra;</citedDecision> Fong Foo v. United States, 369 U. S. 141 (1962); Kepner v. United States, 195 U. S. 100 (1904); and United States v. Ball, 163 U. S. 662 (1896).  There are a number of reasons a retrial enhances the risk that “even though innocent, [the criminal defendant] may be found guilty.” Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 188 (1957).  A retrial affords the Government the opportunity to re-examine the weaknesses of its first presentation in order to strengthen the second.  And, as would any litigant, the Government has been known to take advantage of this opportunity.  It is not uncommon to find that prosecution witnesses change their testimony, not always subtly, at second trials.  See Arizona v. Washington, 434 U. S. 497 , 504 n. 14 (1978), quoting Carsey v. United States, 129 U. S. App. D. C. 205, 208-209, 392 F. 2d 810, 813-814 (1967).  By “final judgment favorable to the accused,” I am, of course, referring to an order terminating all prosecution of the defendant on the ground he “simply cannot be convicted of the offense charged.” See Lee v. United States, 432 U. S. 23, 30 (1977).
