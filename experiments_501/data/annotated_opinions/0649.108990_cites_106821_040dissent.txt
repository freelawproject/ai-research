Me. Justice Marshall, with whom Mr. Justice Blackmun joins, dissenting.  The Social Security Act’s categorical assistance programs, including the Aid to the Aged, Blind, or Disabled (AABD) program involved here, are fundamentally different from most federal legislation.  Unlike the Fair Labor Standards Act involved in last Term’s decision in Employees v. Department of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973), or the Federal Employers’ Liability Act-at issue in Parden v. Terminal R. Co., <citedDecision>377 U. S. 184</citedDecision> (1964), the Social Security Act does not impose federal standards and liability upon all who engage in certain regulated activities, including often-unwilling state agencies.  Instead, the Act seeks to induce state participation in the federal welfare programs by offering federal matching funds in exchange for the State’s voluntary assumption of the Act’s requirements.  I find this basic distinction crucial: it leads me to conclude that by participation in the programs, the States waive whatever immunity they might otherwise have from federal court *689 orders requiring retroactive payment of welfare benefits.  1 In its contacts with the Social Security Act’s assistance programs in recent years, the Court has frequently described the Act as a “scheme of cooperative federalism.” See, e. g., King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309, 316 (1968); Jefferson v. Hackney, 406 U. S. 535, 542 (1972).  While this phrase captures a number of the unique characteristics of these programs, for present purposes it serves to emphasize that the States’ decision to participate in the programs is a voluntary one.  In deciding to participate, however, the States necessarily give up their freedom to operate assistance programs for the needy as they see fit, and bind themselves to conform their programs to the requirements of the federal statute and regulations.  As the Court explained in King v. Smith, supra, at 316-317 (citations omitted): “States are not required to participate in the program, but those which desire to take advantage of the substantial federal funds available for distribution to needy children [or needy aged, blind or disabled] are required to submit an AFDC [or AABD] plan for the approval of the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).

 .  .” Id., at 296 .  A finding of waiver here is also consistent with the reasoning of the majority in Employees , which relied on a distinction between “governmental” and “proprietary” functions of state government.  Id., at 284-285 .  This distinction apparently recognizes that if sovereign immunity is to be at all meaningful, the Court must be reluctant to hold a State to have waived its immunity simply by acting in its sovereign capacity — i.  e., by merely performing its “governmental” functions.  On the other hand, in launching a profitmaking enterprise, “a State leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own,” <citedDecision>Parden</citedDecision> v. Terminal R. Co., <citedDecision>377 U. S., at 196</citedDecision> , and a voluntary waiver of sovereign immunity can more easily be found. While conducting an assistance program for the needy is surely a “governmental” function, the State here has done far more than operate its own program in its sovereign capacity.  It has voluntarily subordinated its sovereignty in this matter to that of the Federal Government, and agreed to comply with the conditions imposed *696 by Congress upon the expenditure of federal funds.  In entering this federal-state cooperative program, the State again “leaves the sphere that is exclusively its own,” and similarly may more readily be found to have voluntarily waived its immunity.  Indeed, this is the lesson to be drawn from this Court’s decision in Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm’n, 359 U. S. 275 (1959), where the Court found that the States had waived the sovereign immunity of the Commission by joining in an interstate compact subject to the approval of Congress.  The Court in Petty emphasized that it was “called on to interpret not unilateral state action but the terms of a consensual agreement” between the States and Congress, id., at 279 ; and held that the States who join such a consensual agreement, “by accepting it and acting under it assume the conditions that Congress under the Constitution attached.” Id., at 281-282 .  Although the congressional intent regarding the sue-and-be-sued clause was by no means certain, the Court held that the surrounding conditions made it clear that the States accepting it waived their sovereign immunity, id., at 280 , especially since this interpretation was necessary to keep the compact “a living interstate agreement which performs high functions in our federalism.” Id., at 279 .  I find the approach in Petty controlling here.
