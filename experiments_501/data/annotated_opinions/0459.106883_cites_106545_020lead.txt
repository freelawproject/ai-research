*479 Mr. Justice Goldberg delivered the opinion of the Court. The critical question in this case is whether, under the circumstances, .the refusal by the police to honor petitioner’s request to consult with his lawyer during the course of an interrogation constitutes a denial of “the Assistance of Counsel” in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as “made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,” Gideon v. Wainwright, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 335, 342</citedDecision> , and thereby renders inadmissible in a state criminal trial any incriminating statement elicited by the police during the interrogation.  On the night of January 19, 1960, petitioner’s brother-in-law was fatally shot.  In the early hours of the next morning, at 2:30 a. m., petitioner was arrested without a warrant and interrogated.  Petitioner made no statement to the police and was released at 5 that afternoon pursuant to a state court writ of habeas corpus obtained by Mr. Warren Wolfson, a lawyer who had been retained by petitioner.  On January 30, Benedict DiGerlando, who was then in police custody and who was later indicted for the murder along with petitioner, told the police that petitioner had fired the fatal shots.  Between 8 and 9 that evening, petitioner and his sister, the widow of the deceased, were arrested and taken to police headquarters.  En route to the police station, the police “had handcuffed the defendant behind his back,” and “one of the arresting officers told defendant that DiGerlando had named him as the one who shot” the deceased.

 It was a stage surely as critical as was the arraignment in Hamilton v. Alabama, 368 U. S. 52 , and the preliminary hearing in White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 .  What happened at this interrogation could certainly “affect the whole trial,” Hamilton v. Alabama, supra, at 54, since rights “may be as irretrievably lost, if not then and there asserted, as they are when an accused represented by counsel waives a right for strategic purposes.” Ibid. It would exalt form over substance to make the right to counsel, under these circumstances, depend on whether at the time of the interrogation, the ¿uthorities had secured a formal indictment.  Petitioner had, for all practical purposes, already been charged with murder.  The New York Court of Appeals, whose decisions this Court cited with approval in Massiah, 377 U. S. 201, at 205 , has recently recognized that, under circumstances such as those here, no meaningful distinction can be drawn between interrogation of an accused before and after formal indictment.  In People v. Donovan, 13 N. Y. 2d 148, 193 N. E. 2d 628 , that court, in an opinion by Judge Fuld, held that a “confession taken from a defendant, during a period of detention [prior to indictment], after his attorney had requested and been denied access *487 to him” could not be used against him in a criminal trial. 6 Id., at 151, 193 N. E. 2d, at 629 .  The court observed that it “would be highly incongruous if our system of justice permitted the district attorney, the lawyer representing the State, to extract a confession from the accused while his own lawyer, seeking to speak with him, was kept from him by the police.” Id., at 152, 193 N. E. 2d, at 629 .  7 In Gideon v. Wainwright, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 335</citedDecision> , we held that every person accused of a crime, whether state or federal, is entitled to a lawyer at trial. 8 The rule sought by the State here, however, would make the trial no more than an appeal from the interrogation; and the “right to use counsel at the formal trial [would be] a very hollow thing [if], for all practical purposes, the conviction is already assured by pretrial examination.” In re Groban, 352 U. S. *488 330, 344 (Black, J., dissenting).  9 “One can imagine a cynical prosecutor saying: 'Let them have the most illustrious counsel, now.  They can’t escape the noose.  There is nothing that counsel can do for them at the trial.’ ” Ex parte Sullivan, 107 F. Supp. 514, 517-518 .  It is argued that if the right to counsel is afforded prior to indictment, the number of confessions obtained by the police will diminish significantly, because most confessions are obtained during the period between arrest and indictment, 10 and “any lawyer worth his salt will tell the suspect in no uncertain terms to make no statement to police under any circumstances.” Watts v. Indiana, 338 U. S. 49, 59 (Jackson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  This argument, of course, cuts two ways.  The fact that many confessions are obtained during this period points up its critical nature as a “stage when legal aid and advice” are surely needed.

 .  .  .” Haynes v. Washington, 373 U. S. 503, 519 .  We have also learned the companion lesson of history that no system of criminal justice can, or should, survive if it comes to depend for its continued effectiveness on the citizens' abdication through unawareness of their constitutional rights.  No system worth preserving should have to fear that if an accused is permitted to consult with a lawyer, he will become aware of, and exercise, these rights.  13 If the exercise of constitutional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of law enforcement, then there is something very wrong with that system.  14 We hold, therefore, that where, as here, the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the sus *491 pect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied “the Assistance of Counsel” in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as “made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,” <citedDecision>Gideon</citedDecision> v. Wainwright, <citedDecision>372 U. S., at 342</citedDecision> , and that no statement elicited by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial. Crooker v. California, 357 U. S. 433 , does not compel a contrary result.  In that case the Court merely rejected the absolute rule sought by petitioner, that “every state denial of a request to contact counsel [is] an infringement of the constitutional right without regard to the circumstances of the case.” Id., at 440.  (Emphasis in original.) In its place, the following rule was announced: “[S]tate refusal of a request to engage counsel violates due process not only if the accused is deprived of counsel at trial on the merits, .  .  .  but also if he is deprived of counsel for any part of the pretrial proceedings, provided that he is so prejudiced thereby as to infect his subsequent trial with an absence of 'that fundamental fairness essential to the very concept of justice.
