 For example, as the law currently stands, the Court will apply “intermediate scrutiny” to cases of invidious gender discrimination and “strict scrutiny” to cases of invidious race discrimination, while applying the same standard for benign classifications as for invidious ones.  If this remains the law, then today’s lecture about “consistency” will produce the anomalous result that the Government can more easily enact affirmative-action programs to remedy discrimination against women than it can enact affirmative-action programs to remedy discrimination against African-Americans — even though the primary purpose of the Equal Protection Clause was to end discrimination against the former slaves.  See Associated General Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. San Francisco, 813 F. 2d 922 (CA9 1987) (striking down racial preference under strict scrutiny while upholding gender preference under intermediate scrutiny).  When a court becomes preoccupied with abstract standards, it risks sacrificing common sense at the altar of formal consistency.  As a matter of constitutional and democratic principle, a decision by representatives of the majority to discriminate against the members of a minority race is fundamentally different from those same representatives’ decision to impose incidental costs on the majority of their constituents in order to provide a benefit to a disadvantaged minority.  5 Indeed, *248 as I have previously argued, the former is virtually always repugnant to the principles of a free and democratic society, whereas the latter is, in some circumstances, entirely consistent with the ideal of equality.  Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., <citedDecision>476 U. S. 267, 316-317</citedDecision> (1986) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  6 *249 By insisting on a doctrinaire notion of “consistency” in the standard applicable to all race-based governmental actions, the Court obscures this essential dichotomy.  III The Court s concept of congruence assumes that there is no significant difference between a decision by the Congress of the United States to adopt an affirmative-action program and such a decision by a State or a municipality.  In my opinion that assumption is untenable.  It ignores important practical and legal differences between federal and state or local decisionmakers.  These differences have been identified repeatedly and consistently both in opinions of the Court and in separate opinions authored by Members of today’s majority.  Thus, in Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC, 497 U. S. 547 (1990), in which we upheld a federal program designed to foster racial diversity in broadcasting, we identified the special “institu *250 tional competence” of our National Legislature.

 But two decisive distinctions separate those two cases. First, Metro Broadcasting involved a federal program, whereas Croson involved a city ordinance.  Metro Broadcasting thus drew primary support from Fullilove , which predated Croson and which Croson distinguished on the grounds of the federal-state dichotomy that the majority today discredits.  Although Members of today’s majority trumpeted the importance of that distinction in Croson, they now reject it in the name of “congruence.” It is therefore *257 quite wrong for the Court to suggest today that overruling Metro Broadcasting merely restores the status quo ante, for the law at the time of that decision was entirely open to the result the Court reached.  Today's decision is an unjustified departure from settled law. Second, Metro Broadcasting’s holding rested on more than its application of “intermediate scrutiny.” Indeed, I have always believed that, labels notwithstanding, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) program we upheld in that case would have satisfied any of our various standards in affirmative-action cases — including the one the majority fashions today.  What truly distinguishes Metro Broadcasting from our other affirmative-action precedents is the distinctive goal of the federal program in that case. Instead of merely seeking to remedy past discrimination, the FCC program was intended to achieve future benefits in the form of broadcast diversity.  Reliance on race as a legitimate means of achieving diversity was first endorsed by Justice Powell in Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U. S. 265, 311-319 (1978).  Later, in Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., <citedDecision>476 U. S. 267</citedDecision> (1986), I also argued that race is not always irrelevant to governmental decisionmaking, see <citedDecision>id., at 314-315</citedDecision> (Stevens, J., dissenting); in response, Justice O’Connor correctly noted that, although the school board had relied on an interest in providing black teachers to serve as role models for black students, that interest “should not be confused with the very different goal of promoting racial diversity among the faculty.” <citedDecision>Id., at 288</citedDecision> , n. She then added that, because the school board had not relied on an interest in diversity, it was not “necessary to discuss the magnitude of that interest or its applicability in this case.” <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Thus, prior to Metro Broadcasting, the interest in diversity had been mentioned in a few opinions, but it is perfectly clear that the Court had not yet decided whether that interest had sufficient magnitude to justify a racial classification.  Metro Broadcasting, of course, answered that question in the *258 affirmative.  The majority today overrules Metro Broadcasting only insofar as it is “inconsistent with [the] holding” that strict scrutiny applies to “benign” racial classifications promulgated by the Federal Government.  Ante, at 227.  The proposition that fostering diversity may provide a sufficient interest to justify such a program is not inconsistent with the Court’s holding today — indeed, the question is not remotely presented in this case — and I do not take the Court’s opinion to diminish that aspect of our decision in Metro Broadcasting.  The Court’s suggestion that it may be necessary in the future to overrule Fullilove in order to restore the fabric of the law, ante, at 235, is even more disingenuous than its treatment of Metro Broadcasting.  For the Court endorses the “strict scrutiny” standard that Justice Powell applied in Bakke , see ante, at 224, and acknowledges that he applied that standard in Fullilove as well, ante, at 218-219.

 That, in any event, is a judgment the political branches can be trusted to make.  In enacting affirmative-action programs, a legislature intends to remove obstacles that have unfairly placed individuals of equal qualifications at a competitive disadvantage.  See Fullilove, 448 U. S., at 521 (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).  I do not believe such action, whether wise or unwise, deserves such an invidious label as “racial paternalism,” ante, at 240 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  If the legislature is persuaded that its program is doing more harm than good to the individuals it is designed to benefit, then we can expect the legislature to remedy the problem.  Significantly, this is not true of a government action based on invidious discrimination.  As I noted in <citedDecision>Wygant</citedDecision> : “There is ... a critical difference between a decision to exclude a member of a minority race because of his or her skin color and a decision *249 to include more members of the minority in a school faculty for that reason.  “The exclusionary decision rests on the false premise that differences in race, or in the color of a person’s skin, reflect real differences that are relevant to a person’s right to share in the blessings of a free society.  As noted, that premise is ‘utterly irrational,’ Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U. S. 432, 452 (1985), and repugnant to the principles of a free and democratic society.  Nevertheless, the fact that persons of different races do, indeed have differently colored skin, may give rise to a belief that there is some significant difference between such persons.  The inclusion of minority teachers in the educational process inevitably tends to dispel that illusion whereas their exclusion could only tend to foster it.  The inclusionary decision is consistent with the principle that all men are created equal; the exclusionary decision is at war with that principle.  One decision accords with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the other does not.
