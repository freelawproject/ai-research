91306	88061	yes	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the position taken in Texas v. White regarding the legislature's ability to limit negotiability of bonds payable to bearer, even after their sale,  "must be regarded as overruled."  Additionally, the court limits the holding that redeemable government securities become non-negotiable after the redemption date, specifying that this only applies to cases with notice of defective title or suspicious circumstances.  This constitutes a partial overruling of the original case.
91306	88994	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes the case *Vermilye v. Adams Express Co.* in relation to other cases, particularly its application to the principles of bond ownership and negotiability.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Vermilye v. Adams Express Co.* was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The analysis focuses on clarifying and interpreting the ruling in *Vermilye* and its relation to other cases, not on overturning it.
91306	87633	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule *Murray v. Lardner*.  Instead, the excerpt from *Texas v. White* reaffirms the rules established in *Murray v. Lardner* concerning the purchase of coupon bonds before they are due.  It adds a clarification that these rules do not apply to matured obligations, but this is a qualification, not an overruling. The court distinguishes the application of the rules based on the maturity of the bonds, not overrules the precedent itself.
91306	88240	no	no	95	The provided text does not contain any information suggesting that Texas v. Hardenberg (1869) was overruled.  Instead, the excerpt shows that the case was later reconsidered and its grounds declared satisfactory in a subsequent court decision.  Further, the case was relied upon in Huntington v. Texas as conclusive precedent.  There is no language indicating that the court explicitly or implicitly overruled the case, or limited its application to specific circumstances.
91306	88693	no	no	90	The provided text shows that the case *Huntington v. Texas* was cited and its prior decisions were relied upon by the court.  There is no indication that the court overruled, partially or fully, the case. The excerpt discusses the court's reconsideration and reaffirmation of prior decisions related to the bonds, implying that *Huntington v. Texas*, which itself relied on these prior decisions, remains valid precedent in the specific context discussed.  There is no language suggesting that the case is no longer good law or that any part of it has been invalidated.
91306	88924	no	no	95	The provided text does not contain any language that would indicate the case *National Bank of Washington v. Texas* was overruled.  The excerpt discusses the case, analyzing its holding regarding bond validity and the transferability of bonds after they were due.  There is no mention of overruling the case, nor any language that implies it is no longer good law or has been superseded by other legal precedents.
91306	89668	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Cromwell v. County of Sac*, but it does not overrule the case. Instead, the citing opinion affirms the doctrine established in *Cromwell*.  The passage explicitly states that the doctrine in *Cromwell v. County of Sac* was "reaffirmed" in a later case. This indicates that the precedent set by *Cromwell* remains valid and was not challenged or overturned.
91306	90400	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Railroad Co. v. Sprague*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the text refers to the case as reaffirming a doctrine related to the non-payment of interest on securities. There is no language suggesting the overruling of the case, either explicitly or implicitly through functionally equivalent language, nor any indication of partial overruling or limitation of its application to specific circumstances.
92059	91368	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Poindexter v. Greenhow*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpts discuss the case's holding, clarifying and applying its principles in subsequent cases, but there is no language suggesting it has been overturned or is no longer good law.  The analysis focuses on interpreting and applying *Poindexter v. Greenhow*'s precedent, not rejecting it.
92059	91371	no	no	100	The provided text excerpts repeatedly cite *Allen v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad*, but none of the excerpts suggest that the case was overruled.  In fact, the excerpts repeatedly affirm and rely on the precedent set by *Allen*.  The dissenting opinions mention concurring with the judgment in *Allen*, further indicating that the case was not overruled but instead upheld or followed.
92059	88673	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Davis v. Gray* multiple times.  In both instances, the opinion refers to *Davis v. Gray* approvingly, summarizing its holding regarding who constitutes a party to a suit involving a state and emphasizing that Osborn v. Bank of the United States, which *Davis v. Gray* interpreted, remains good law. There is no language suggesting that *Davis v. Gray* has been overruled, in whole or in part.  The court's discussion clarifies the application of *Davis v. Gray*,  but this is not equivalent to overruling it.
92059	87371	no	no	100	The provided text cites the case Commonwealth of Ky. v. DENNISON, GOVERNOR, &C. multiple times.  However, it does not contain any language that would indicate the case has been overruled. The citing opinions refer to the case as precedent, indicating it is still considered valid and relevant.  There is no mention of the case being explicitly overruled, qualified, or limited in its application to specific circumstances.
92059	91583	no	no	100	The provided text discusses the case *Hagood v. Southern*, and its relation to the 11th Amendment.  The excerpt explains the holding in *Hagood v. Southern*, which concerned the ability to sue a state's officers when the effect would be to compel the state to perform a contract.  No language suggests the case has been overruled. The text uses *Hagood v. Southern* as precedent. Therefore, there is no indication that *Hagood v. Southern* has been overruled.
92059	90667	no	no	100	The provided text cites *United States v. Lee* multiple times but does not contain any language suggesting that it has been overruled.  The excerpts describe the case's principles and how they've been applied in subsequent cases, treating *United States v. Lee* as valid precedent. There is no mention of the case being overturned, modified, or limited in its application.
92059	85451	yes	no	-1	CITE_NOT_FOUND
92291	88699	yes	yes	85	The excerpt states that in view of the course of decisions made since Osborne v. Mobile (1873), it is very certain that such an ordinance would now be regarded as repugnant to the power conferred upon Congress to regulate commerce among the several States. This implies that the court's stance on the case's principle has changed, effectively overruling it, at least in part, by stating it is no longer good law in the context of the commerce clause.  The passage explicitly acknowledges that the prior ruling in *Osborne v. Mobile* would likely be judged differently under current legal precedent.
92291	89664	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case *Pensacola Telegraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co.* multiple times.  However, none of the citations indicate that the case has been overruled. The citing opinions reference *Pensacola Telegraph* as precedent supporting the principle that states cannot tax interstate commerce.  There is no language suggesting the case is no longer good law, or that it has been overruled in whole or in part.
92291	90600	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case *Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Texas*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the text uses the case as precedent, aligning the current ruling with the principles established in *Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Texas*. The opinion explicitly states that the current case's ruling is "parallel with" and follows the principles laid out in *Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Texas* and other cases. There is no language suggesting overruling, modification, or limitation of the cited case.
92291	91869	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case of interest, Robbins v. Shelby County Taxing District, multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. Instead, the text refers to Robbins as a precedent, citing it alongside other cases to support the court's reasoning.  The passage uses the case as an example of existing case law rather than indicating any change to it.
92291	91985	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Philadelphia & Southern Steamship Co. v. Pennsylvania* multiple times.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled. In fact, the case is referenced as a precedent supporting the court's decision.  There is no language indicating that the case is no longer good law, has been qualified, or has been overruled in part or in its entirety. The citing case uses the cited case to support its reasoning, indicating that it is being followed as precedent.
93311	92988	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Merrill v. Monticello* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinions consistently refer to and rely on the principles established in *Merrill v. Monticello*, thereby treating it as valid precedent.  There is no indication of the court distinguishing the case, limiting its application, or declaring it to be no longer good law in certain contexts. The citations suggest that *Merrill v. Monticello* is being followed, not overruled.
93311	87743	yes	yes	85	The provided text mentions Rogers v. Burlington multiple times and indicates that later adjudications have, in effect, overruled it.  While not explicitly stated as overruled in a single sentence, the cumulative effect of the statements, particularly the assertion that the current case's view is "in conflict with Rogers v. Burlington" and that later decisions have "in effect, overruled those cases", strongly suggests that Rogers v. Burlington is no longer considered good law in the contexts discussed. This satisfies condition 6 for overruling a case.
93311	91125	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Claiborne County v. Brooks*, 111 U.S. 400, with approval in subsequent cases.  No language suggests that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  Instead, the court consistently uses *Claiborne County v. Brooks* as precedent, indicating that it remains good law in the relevant contexts.
93311	87776	yes	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the doctrine in Mitchell v. Burlington is in conflict with later adjudications of the court and has been, in effect, overruled.  The court cites several cases (Police Jury v. Britton, Claiborne County v. Brooks, Concord v. Robinson, Kelley v. Milan, Norton v. Dyersburg, Young v. Clarendon, Hill v. Memphis, and Merrill v. Monticello) as having overruled or qualified the principles established in Mitchell v. Burlington.
93311	88640	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Police Jury v. Britton*, often in approving or supporting its holding.  There is no language suggesting that *Police Jury v. Britton* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. Instead, the text shows the case being used as precedent and cited approvingly in multiple subsequent cases. Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled.
93904	93354	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case Roberts v. Lewis (1892) 144 U.S. 653, but it does not overrule it. Instead, the excerpt states that the question of construction of the will in Roberts v. Lewis was "argued, but not decided" previously.  The Supreme Court is revisiting the case to address a question that was not resolved in the earlier instance. There is no language suggesting that the earlier decision is incorrect, invalid, or superseded.
93904	87423	no	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that a prior decision of the court is overruled.  The court explicitly states that its former decision is inconsistent with the sound construction of the will and the state court's conclusion, therefore it is overruled. The case of interest, Suydam v. Williamson, is the former decision being overruled.
93904	84798	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Lambert v. Paine (3 Cranch 97), but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the court states that its own *previous* decision is overruled, not the cited case. The court uses Lambert v. Paine to support its interpretation of a will, indicating it is being used as precedent, not overruled.
93904	89382	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case of *Brant v. Virginia Coal & Iron Co.* but does not overrule it.  The excerpt states that *Brant* and another case, *Smith v. Bell*, "involved the construction of wills expressed in different language from that now before the court." This indicates a distinction based on the specific language of the wills involved, not an overruling of the precedent set in *Brant*. The court is distinguishing the facts and the language used in the wills of *Smith* and *Brant* from those of the case currently before it; it is not explicitly rejecting, modifying, or limiting the holdings of the cited cases.
93904	90983	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Howard v. Carusi*, but it does not overrule it.  The text cites *Howard v. Carusi* as a supporting precedent alongside other cases. There is no language suggesting that the court is rejecting, modifying, or limiting the holding of *Howard v. Carusi*. The court is analyzing similar cases and reaching a conclusion, but that analysis does not constitute overruling *Howard v. Carusi*. 
93904	93152	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Potter v. Couch*, citing it as precedent.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text uses the case to support the court's conclusion. Therefore, based solely on this excerpt, there is no indication that *Potter v. Couch* has been overruled.
93904	90455	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that the Circuit Court of Appeals should not be governed by the decision in Giles v. Little, 104 U.S. 291, but instead by the decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska in Little v. Giles.  This constitutes an overruling of Giles v. Little as precedent for this case.
98124	96356	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Rogers v. Peck* as precedent, stating that the court followed its prior decisions in that case.  There is no language suggesting that *Rogers v. Peck* was overruled, in whole or in part. The text uses the case to support the court's holding. Therefore, the case was not overruled.
98124	94455	yes	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule Crain v. United States.  It acknowledges Crain, which held that a plea must be entered of record before trial, but distinguishes it. The excerpt argues that the current case does not require reversal because the objection is merely formal, and the defendant suffered no prejudice.  The court highlights a change in approach toward technical objections, suggesting modern jurisprudence is less stringent than the holding in Crain, but it does not explicitly overrule it.
98917	97893	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Bauer v. O'Donnell* multiple times. However, it does not contain any language suggesting that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the text cites *Bauer v. O'Donnell* as precedent,  referencing its interpretation of patent law and specifically its rejection of the idea that a patent owner can control the resale price of a patented article after the initial sale. This shows the citing court considered *Bauer v. O'Donnell* to be valid precedent and followed its reasoning.  There is no indication of overruling, partial or otherwise.
98917	97584	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that the decision in Henry v. Dick Co. must be regarded as overruled.  This directly satisfies condition 1 for overruling a case.
98917	96878	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., 210 U.S. 405, multiple times. However, none of the mentions indicate that the case has been overruled.  The excerpts cite the case as precedent, supporting particular legal arguments. There is no language suggesting the court is rejecting, limiting, or altering the holding of Continental Paper Bag Co. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that the case has been overruled.
98917	93828	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Dunlap v. Schofield*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt discusses the case and its relevance to patent law, specifically concerning the use of notices attached to patented machines to limit their use. However, there is no language suggesting the court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the holding in *Dunlap v. Schofield*. The passage analyzes the case within the context of broader legal principles related to patent rights and licensing but stops short of explicitly or implicitly overruling it.
98917	94177	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Keeler v. Standard Folding Bed Co.* but does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites *Keeler* as relevant precedent regarding the scope of patent rights related to the use of patented machines and the validity of license notices. There is no language suggesting that the Court intends to overturn, limit, or qualify the holding in *Keeler*. The Court simply uses the case to distinguish between issues of patent law and contract law.
98917	89595	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Keystone Bridge Co. v. Phoenix Iron Co.* as precedent, using its holding to support a legal argument.  There is no language suggesting the case has been overruled, qualified, or limited in any way. Instead, the court explicitly refers to the case as a rule that is "long established by this court."
98917	90432	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Railroad Co. v. Mellon*, 104 U.S. 112, as precedent.  The excerpt uses the case to support a point of law regarding patent construction, specifically focusing on the importance of patent claims in determining the scope of an invention. There is no language suggesting the overruling of *Railroad Co. v. Mellon* or any portion of it.  The citing court clearly treats *Railroad Co. v. Mellon* as good law and follows it as precedent.
98917	91637	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Yale Lock Mfg. Co. v. Greenleaf*, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites the case as precedent, supporting the court's interpretation of patent law. There is no language suggesting the case is overruled, qualified, or limited in any way. The court uses the case to support its reasoning, not to overturn or modify it.
98917	93161	no	no	95	The provided text cites *McClain v. Ortmayer* as precedent, using it to support a point of law regarding patent interpretation.  There is no indication that the court overruled, qualified, or limited the holding of *McClain v. Ortmayer* in any way. The citation is used to support a legal argument, which is consistent with treating a case as valid precedent.
98917	94711	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *United States v. American Bell Telephone Co.* as precedent, citing it to support the court's statement about the scope of patent protection.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpt uses the case to bolster its argument, not to overturn it.
98917	93908	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Ashley v. Ryan* as precedent.  Justice Holmes's opinion uses the case to support his argument, indicating it was not overruled but rather considered relevant to the current case. There is no language suggesting the overruling of *Ashley v. Ryan*, either explicitly or implicitly. The mention of *Ashley v. Ryan* is simply to support a legal argument.
98917	96107	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Ohio Ex Rel. Lloyd v. Dollison, 194 U.S. 445, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites the case as precedent, suggesting it is being followed, not overruled. There is no language suggesting the court is rejecting, modifying, or limiting the holding of Lloyd v. Dollison in any way. The mention of the case is within the context of legal argumentation, not as a case being rejected or altered.
98917	95670	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Bement v. National Harrow Co.  The author expresses a belief that the legal principle established in Bement has been in place for at least 15 years and that numerous transactions have occurred based on it.  There is no indication that the court is overruling Bement. Instead, the judge expresses a dissenting opinion, arguing that the majority's decision in Henry v. Dick Co. (which this snippet implies contradicts Bement) should be overturned, not Bement itself.  The reference to Bement is to support the judge's argument for maintaining the precedent set in earlier cases.
98917	98575	no	no	95	The provided text cites Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co. in a dissenting opinion.  The dissenting justices refer to the case as precedent supporting their view on the legality of conditional sales.  There is no indication that the majority opinion overrules or modifies Bailey v. Baker Ice Machine Co.  The fact that the cited case is used to support a dissenting opinion does not mean the case itself has been overruled.
99004	95042	yes	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that parts of the opinion in *Lake Shore & Michigan Southern Ry. Co. v. Smith* are overruled.  The court declares that views expressed in *Lake Shore* inconsistent with the right of states to fix reasonable commutation fares are overruled by the current decision. This directly satisfies condition 2 (functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling) and potentially condition 3 (overruling only part of the case).
99004	3483537	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *Penna. R.R. Co. v. Public Ser. Com.* (1915)  (126 Maryland, 59), but does not overrule it.  The excerpt only cites the case as precedent in describing the legal proceedings. There is no language suggesting overruling, modification, or any limitation on the case's application.
99004	93379	no	no	100	The excerpt mentions Interstate Com. Commiss. v. B. & O. RAILROAD (1892), citing it to support the court's decision in the current case regarding the regulation of intrastate commutation rates.  The excerpt does not contain any language suggesting that the cited case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. Instead, the court uses the earlier case as precedent in its reasoning.  Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled.
99004	98392	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. West Virginia*, 236 U.S. 605, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpt quotes the case to support the court's reasoning regarding the state's power to regulate intrastate rates. The citing opinion finds the cited case's assertion about state discretion in prescribing reasonable rates to be relevant and consistent with its own holding. There is no language indicating the court is explicitly overruling or modifying the precedent set by *Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. West Virginia*. The case is used as supporting precedent, not overruled precedent.
99004	98391	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule *Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. North Dakota Ex Rel. McCue*. Instead, the excerpt from *Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. West Virginia* cites *Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. North Dakota Ex Rel. McCue* with approval, summarizing its holding regarding the broad discretion states have in setting reasonable rates for common carriers.  No language suggests overruling, either explicitly or implicitly.
99004	95555	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Kentucky (183 U.S. 503), but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt explains that the court in Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Kentucky stated it was not ready to extend the doctrine of cited cases beyond the limits already established. This is not an overruling but rather a limitation of the scope of the precedent.  There is no language suggesting the case is no longer good law, nor is any part of the case overruled or distinguished. Therefore, it is not overruled.
99004	97966	no	no	90	The provided text discusses the Minnesota Rate Cases (Simpson v. Shepard) and its relation to other cases.  It analyzes how the Supreme Court has interpreted and applied the principles established in the Minnesota Rate Cases, but it does not state that the case itself has been overruled. The excerpt shows that the court attempted to clarify the scope and limitations of the case, distinguishing it from other situations where it might not apply, but that does not constitute overruling.  The court cites several cases which indicate that the Smith case is not to be extended beyond the facts upon which it rests, but this limitation or clarification does not constitute overruling of the Minnesota Rate Cases. 
99004	96710	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Interstate R. Co. v. Massachusetts*, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the text analyzes the case in relation to other legal precedents, particularly the *Smith* case, and suggests that *Interstate R. Co. v. Massachusetts* should not be extended beyond its specific facts. This is an interpretation and contextualization, not an overruling.
99901	89506	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that the case of Doyle v. Continental Insurance Co., 94 U.S. 535, must be considered as overruled.  The court further clarifies that the views of the minority judges in that case have become the law of this court. This directly satisfies criterion 1 for overruling a case.
99901	96471	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that the case of Security Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Prewitt, 202 U.S. 246, must be considered as overruled.  The court indicates that the views of the minority judges in that case have become the law of this court, thus explicitly overruling the precedent set by the majority in the cited case.
99901	93467	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Iowa v. Illinois*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt discusses several cases related to the conflict between state power to exclude foreign corporations and the federal right of such corporations to use federal courts.  It notes that these cases are not easily reconciled, implying a lack of consistent precedent, but it does not explicitly overrule *Iowa v. Illinois* or any other case. The mention of *Iowa v. Illinois* is purely for contextual background within a discussion of conflicting precedents, not as a basis for overruling it.
99901	88953	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Home Ins. Co. v. Morse several times and notes that there are inconsistencies in the court's previous decisions. However, it does not explicitly overrule Home Ins. Co. v. Morse. Instead, it states that the "principle established by the more recent decisions of this court" is different from the principles established in Home Ins. Co. v. Morse and other early cases.  The excerpt indicates that the court is trying to reconcile conflicting precedents but does not explicitly overrule Home Ins. Co. v. Morse.
99901	91911	no	no	80	The excerpt mentions Barron v. Burnside (121 U.S. 186) among a list of cases that are not reconcilable with each other.  It then states that the principle established by more recent decisions is different from that established in the earlier cases.  While the excerpt indicates that the earlier cases are inconsistent with more modern precedent, it doesn't explicitly overrule Barron v. Burnside.  It implies that Barron v. Burnside is no longer good law but doesn't explicitly state so. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for being overruled.
99901	93431	no	no	90	The excerpt mentions the case *Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt notes that prior cases on the conflict between state power to exclude foreign corporations and the federal right to access federal courts are irreconcilable.  It then states that more recent decisions establish a principle that a state may not require a foreign corporation to waive its right to federal courts as a condition of doing business within the state. This does not directly overrule *Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton*, but rather suggests that its holding might be superseded by a new principle established in more recent cases.  There is no language explicitly overruling *Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton*, nor is there any indication that any part of it is overruled or qualified.
99901	93803	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions the case *Martin's Administrator v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad*, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpt discusses a line of cases, including *Martin's Administrator*, related to the conflict between state power to exclude foreign corporations and the federal right to access federal courts. The excerpt notes inconsistencies among these cases and states that more recent decisions establish a different principle. However, it does not explicitly overrule *Martin's Administrator* or use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The excerpt implies that *Martin's Administrator*, along with other earlier cases, is superseded by a more recent principle but does not explicitly state that it is overruled. 
99901	94850	no	no	95	The excerpt lists the case *Barrow Steamship Co. v. Kane* among other cases dealing with the conflict between state power to exclude foreign corporations and the federal right of such corporations to use federal courts.  The excerpt mentions that the cases are not reconcilable and notes a principle established by more recent decisions.  However, it does not explicitly overrule *Barrow Steamship Co. v. Kane*, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The passage summarizes a line of cases and explains how later cases clarified the legal principle at issue.  It does not state that *Barrow Steamship Co. v. Kane* is no longer good law or that any part of it has been overruled. Therefore, there is no indication that *Barrow Steamship Co. v. Kane* has been overruled.
99901	97283	no	no	80	The excerpt mentions Herndon v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. among other cases that have addressed the conflict between a state's power to exclude foreign corporations and the right of such corporations to resort to federal courts.  The excerpt notes that these cases are not reconcilable, and then it states that the principle established by "more recent decisions" is that states cannot require foreign corporations to waive their right to access federal courts as a condition of doing business in the state.  However, this does not explicitly overrule Herndon. Instead, it suggests that the "more recent decisions" have clarified or superseded the principles established in Herndon and the other earlier cases. The passage does not state that Herndon is no longer good law; it simply indicates that later cases have established a different, more comprehensive approach.
99901	98085	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule Harrison v. St. Louis & San Francisco R.R. Co.  Instead, it analyzes a series of cases, including Harrison, related to the conflict between state power to exclude foreign corporations and the federal right to access federal courts.  The excerpt highlights a reconciliation of conflicting precedents, stating that a state cannot condition a foreign corporation's privilege to do business on waiving the right to use federal courts.  This clarification and synthesis of prior case law does not constitute overruling Harrison; rather, it builds upon and refines the existing legal principles.
99901	98747	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions the case *Wisconsin v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co.* among other cases that address the conflict between a state's power to exclude foreign corporations and the federal constitutional right of such corporations to use federal courts.  The excerpt states that the principle established by more recent decisions is that a state may not exact a waiver of the right to use federal courts as a condition for doing business in the state.  It does not explicitly overrule *Donald v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co.* (1916), nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The excerpt discusses the evolution of legal principles in this area, highlighting inconsistencies in prior cases and indicating that *Wisconsin v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co.* aligns with the more recent, and seemingly now controlling, precedent.  No language suggests that *Donald v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co.* is no longer good law in any context.
101368	92485	yes	no	95	The provided text states that the Friedlander case "has been often cited and followed."  This explicitly indicates that the case was not overruled. The excerpt notes that the case's holding regarding an agent's lack of implied authority to issue fraudulent bills of lading has been cited and followed,  suggesting its continued legal relevance and lack of overruling.
101368	4727363	no	no	95	The provided text states that the case of interest, Roy & Roy v. Northern Pacific Ry Co., has been "often cited and followed."  There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. While the text discusses other cases and principles related to the legal issue (liability for fraudulent acts of agents), it does not indicate that Roy & Roy has been overturned or limited in any way.
101368	5562591	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions the case *Planters' Rice-Mill Co. v. Merchants' Nat'l Bank*, citing it as supporting the conclusion that "the liability of the principal for the false statement or other misconduct of the agent acting within the scope of his authority is unaffected by his secret purpose or motives."  The court uses the case as precedent to support its holding, indicating that the case was not overruled.  There is no language suggesting the court is overruling, limiting, or distinguishing the cited case in any way.
101368	3678043	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Havens v. Bank of Tarboro as one of several cases supporting the opposite conclusion regarding the liability of a principal for an agent's actions.  There is no language suggesting that Havens v. Bank of Tarboro was overruled. The excerpt cites it as precedent supporting a particular legal position. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no indication that Havens v. Bank of Tarboro has been overruled.
101750	3589385	yes	no	85	The excerpt states that the theory on which Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm. was decided is not wholly consistent with views expressed in later cases.  However, it does not explicitly overrule Pennsylvania Gas Co. Instead, it suggests that the precedent set by Pennsylvania Gas Co. is inconsistent with the court's current understanding and that later cases provide a more accurate framework for similar issues.  This is a distinction, not an overruling.  The court explains its rationale and identifies inconsistencies, but it doesn't declare Pennsylvania Gas Co. to be no longer good law.
101750	3486521	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *West Virginia & Maryland Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm.*  However, it does not contain any language that would suggest the case has been overruled.

There is no explicit overruling, nor any language functionally equivalent to overruling, nor any qualification or limitation of the case's application to specific circumstances. Therefore, based solely on this excerpt, there is no evidence to suggest that *West Virginia & Maryland Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm.* has been overruled.
101750	99524	no	no	90	The court mentions Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Comm., 252 U.S. 23, and states that the theory on which that case's conclusion was reached is not wholly consistent with views expressed in later cases (Public Utilities Comm. v. Landon and Missouri v. Kansas Gas Co.).  However, this is not an explicit overruling. The court points out inconsistencies, suggesting the earlier case's rationale might be outdated or limited in scope given subsequent developments in jurisprudence, but stops short of declaring it overruled.
101750	101295	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Sprout v. South Bend*, 277 U.S. 163, as precedent.  The excerpt does not contain language that would indicate the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court uses the case to support its reasoning.

101750	1578327	no	no	95	The excerpt cites Pullman Co. v. Richardson, 261 U.S. 330, as precedent supporting the principle that a state cannot tax the act of engaging in interstate commerce or gross receipts therefrom.

101750	101176	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Atlantic Coast Line Railroad v. Standard Oil Co.* (1927) only as a case cited in support of the court's reasoning.

The case is cited among other cases, seemingly as a supporting case, within a discussion of interstate commerce and state jurisdiction. There is no language suggesting the court finds Brown v. Maryland to be incorrect or no longer good law under any circumstances. The court simply cites it as one case in a line of cases related to the topic.
101750	92767	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Leisy v. Hardin*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites *Leisy v. Hardin* as precedent related to the interstate commerce clause and the treatment of goods after interstate shipment.  There is no language suggesting that the court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the holding of *Leisy v. Hardin*. The passage simply uses the case to support its reasoning regarding the local nature of gas distribution after interstate transportation.
101913	99897	no	no	95	The excerpt states that the decisions in *Gillespie v. Oklahoma* and *Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Company* are "not controlling here."  This means the court distinguished the case of interest and did not overrule it. The court found the nature and purpose of copyrights to be materially different from the issues in *Gillespie*, thus making the precedent inapplicable to the current case.  The court did not overturn *Gillespie* but rather determined it was not relevant to the matter before it.
101913	89542	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case *Forbes v. Gracey* multiple times as precedent to support the court's reasoning regarding the taxability of property rights.

There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text uses the case to support the court's reasoning.  While another case, *Long v. Rockwood*, is explicitly overruled, this is a separate case and does not impact the standing of *Irwin v. Wright*. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no indication that *Irwin v. Wright* has been overruled.
101913	101632	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Willcuts v. Bunn (282 U.S. 216), but it does not overrule it.  The opinion cites Willcuts v. Bunn to support the statement that the immunity from taxation does not exist "where no direct burden is laid upon the governmental instrumentality, and there is only a remote, if any, influence upon the exercise of the functions of government."  This is using the case as precedent, not overruling it.
101913	96768	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Elder v. Wood*, but does not overrule it.  The text cites *Elder v. Wood* as precedent supporting the proposition that a possessory right, even if created by statute to fulfill a governmental purpose, can be taxable when held in private ownership and exercised for private advantage. This is consistent with treating *Elder v. Wood* as good law and using it to support the court's reasoning.
101913	101762	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt quotes the case, focusing on its limitation on the principle of immunity from taxation of governmental instrumentalities. This is not an overruling, but rather an interpretation and application of the precedent set in *Indian Motocycle*. No language suggests overruling, modification, or limitation of the case's holding. The citing opinion simply explains the case's principle within the context of a new situation.
101913	101894	no	no	95	The excerpt states that the decisions in *Gillespie v. Oklahoma* and *Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.* are "not controlling here."

101913	99339	no	no	95	The provided text cites Union Oil Co. of Cal. v. Smith (1919) as precedent, supporting the argument that a property right created by statute to fulfill a governmental purpose can still be taxable when held in private ownership and exercised for private advantage.  There is no language suggesting the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinion uses the case to bolster its own reasoning, indicating that it is still considered good law in this context.
101913	92685	no	no	100	The excerpt overrules Long v. Rockwood, not the case of interest, Wisconsin Central Railroad v. Price County.  Therefore, Wisconsin Central Railroad v. Price County is not overruled in this excerpt.
101913	101648	no	no	95	The court cited the case *Educational Films Corp. v. Ward*, but did not overrule it. Instead, the court distinguished the case based on the fact that the tax in *Educational Films Corp. v. Ward* was based on net income, while the tax in the current case was based on gross receipts.  The court stated that the current case was "not ruled by" *Educational Films Corp. v. Ward*. This is a distinction, not an overruling.

101913	85911	no	no	100	The provided text cites Wheaton v. Peters, but it does not overrule it.

102784	102681	no	yes	95	The court case *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish* explicitly overruled *Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo*. While the provided text doesn't contain the explicit statement "Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo is overruled", the court explicitly overrules *Adkins v. Children's Hospital*, which was the precedent upheld in *Morehead*.  The court's decision in *West Coast Hotel Co. v.

Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that Holden v. Hardy was overruled.
103012	101265	no	yes	85	The provided text repeatedly cites *Black & White Taxicab Co. v. Brown & Yellow Taxicab Co.* in the context of discussing the overruling of *Swift v. Tyson*. While the opinion doesn't explicitly state that *Black & White Taxicab Co.* is overruled, the strong criticism and the context of overruling *Swift v. Tyson*, which *Black & White Taxicab Co.* is cited as applying, implies that it is also overruled. The case is discussed as a prime example of the application of the now-overruled precedent.  Therefore, the case is considered overruled implicitly.
103012	93638	no	no	95	The excerpts mention the case *Baltimore & Ohio Railroad v. Baugh* multiple times.  However, there is no language that indicates the case has been overruled.  The excerpts discuss the case's holding, debate its application, and even cite it as precedent in other cases. There is no explicit overruling or language functionally equivalent to overruling.  The various mentions and discussions do not qualify as any of the conditions for overruling outlined. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no evidence that *Baltimore & Ohio Railroad v. Baugh* was overruled.
103012	3847696	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule *Falchetti v. Pennsylvania R. R*.  Instead, the citing case discusses *Falchetti* in the context of determining the applicable law in a diversity jurisdiction case. The court notes a disagreement on whether *Falchetti* accurately represents Pennsylvania law and ultimately decides to remand the case to the Circuit Court of Appeals for further consideration of state law, rather than overruling *Falchetti* itself.
103012	86188	yes	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that the Court disapproves of the doctrine in Swift v. Tyson.  The opinion directly addresses Swift v. Tyson, stating that the question is whether its doctrine should be disapproved and ultimately overruling it.  The Court's decision is not merely a modification or qualification of the prior ruling; it's a complete overturning of the precedent set by Swift v. Tyson.
103172	88308	yes	yes	95	The case *Collector v. Day* (1871) is explicitly overruled in this court decision.  The opinion states that *Collector v. Day*, along with other cases establishing an implied constitutional immunity from income taxation of government employees' salaries, are overruled "insofar as they recognize an implied constitutional immunity from income taxation of the salaries of officers or employees of the national or a state government or their instrumentalities". This directly addresses and overrules the precedent set in *Collector v. Day*.  The court explicitly rejects the assumption made in *Collector v. Day* and declares that the case can no longer be considered valid precedent regarding this specific issue.
103172	103047	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Helvering v. Gerhardt*, referencing specific pages and incorporating its legal reasoning into the current case's analysis.  There is no language suggesting the overruling of *Helvering v. Gerhardt*, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinion uses *Helvering v. Gerhardt* as precedent, referring to it as supporting its own conclusions.  Therefore, there's no indication that *Helvering v. Gerhardt* has been overruled in this excerpt.
103172	85272	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *McCulloch v. Maryland*, referencing specific pages and using it to support the court's reasoning.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either fully or partially. The opinion uses *McCulloch v. Maryland* as precedent and does not modify or limit its holding in any way.  Instead, the opinion engages with the principles established in *McCulloch v. Maryland* and applies them to the contemporary case. While the opinion critiques a phrase from the *McCulloch* opinion ("the power to tax involves the power to destroy"), this critique is not an overruling of the case itself.  The critique is context-specific and targets a particular statement within the opinion, not the overarching legal holding.
103172	100771	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell*, often in conjunction with cases that are explicitly overruled (such as *Collector v. Day*). However, there is no language suggesting that *Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell* itself is overruled.  The citing opinions use *Metcalf & Eddy* to support their reasoning and even refer to it as providing a basis for the Court's new interpretation. Therefore, there's no evidence of it being overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
103172	102734	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that it overrules New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves, along with other cases (Dobbins v. Commissioners, Collector v. Day, and Brush v. Commissioner), stating that they "can stand appeal to the Constitution and its historic purposes."  The dissenting opinion also confirms this, explicitly noting that the Court overruled *New York ex rel. Rogers v. Graves*.  This directly satisfies condition #1 for overruling.
103172	86223	no	yes	100	The provided text contains multiple explicit statements indicating that *Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County* (1842) has been overruled.  The majority opinion states that *Dobbins* and *Collector v. Day*, another relevant case, "can stand appeal to the Constitution and its historic purposes. Since both are the starting points of an interdependent doctrine, both should be, as I assume them to be, overruled this day."  Further, the dissenting opinion explicitly states that "From the decision just announced, it is clear that the Court has overruled Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County (1842)...". These statements directly satisfy condition #1 for overruling.
103172	102783	no	yes	100	The dissenting opinion explicitly states that the Court overruled *Brush v. Commissioner (1937)* along with other cases.  The dissenting justice notes that the Court's decision means that the United States has always had the power to tax the salaries of state officers and employees, and vice versa. This directly contradicts the holding in *Brush v. Commissioner*, which supported the immunity of certain state employees' salaries from federal tax. The explicit mention of *Brush v. Commissioner* being overruled, within the context of the opinion, clearly satisfies the criteria for being considered overruled.
103214	94174	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.*  However, the citations are used to support the argument in later cases, not to overrule it.  The text shows that *Pollock* was considered influential precedent in later cases (such as its use in *Gillespie v. Oklahoma* and its mention in discussions of judicial salaries), but there is no language suggesting it was overruled, fully or partially.  The analysis focuses on how later cases interpreted the Constitution's protection against diminished judicial salaries, referencing *Pollock* as a relevant case, not discarding it.
103214	3484932	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Gordy v. Dennis*, but it does not overrule it.  The text cites *Gordy v. Dennis* as holding that under a clause in the Maryland Constitution, state judges' compensation may not be taxed. The author uses this citation to support a point, not to overturn the precedent set by *Gordy v. Dennis*. There is no language suggesting that the court is explicitly or implicitly overruling *Gordy v. Dennis* or any part of it. The court merely cites *Gordy v. Dennis* as a relevant but ultimately distinct case with a different fact pattern.
103214	100693	yes	yes	95	The excerpt states that "to the extent that what the Court now says is inconsistent with what was said in Miles v. Graham, <caseOfInterest>268 U.S. 501</caseOfInterest>, the latter cannot survive."  This explicitly indicates that Miles v. Graham is overruled, at least to the extent it is inconsistent with the current ruling.  The opinion does not simply mention the case or follow it as precedent; it directly addresses the prior ruling and declares that it cannot survive in light of the present decision. 
103214	85272	no	no	95	The provided text discusses M'Culloch v. Maryland and its principle that "the power to tax involves the power to destroy."  While there is criticism of this principle and its application in later cases (particularly in Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe), and alternative viewpoints presented, there is no explicit overruling of M'Culloch v. Maryland.  The text highlights disagreements and reinterpretations of the case's central idea but stops short of declaring it invalid or no longer good law.  The mention of Justice Holmes's dissenting opinion in Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi offers a counter-argument, but this does not equate to an overruling of M'Culloch. The subsequent application of the principle in Gillespie v. Oklahoma, though debated, further indicates that M'Culloch v. Maryland is not overruled.
103214	99610	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1932 sought to avoid, at least in part, the consequences of Evans v. Gore.  This demonstrates an intent to overturn or modify the precedent set by Evans v. Gore. The court's action is a direct response to a prior ruling, indicating an overruling, not simply a distinction or mention.
103198	97661	yes	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States*, but it does not contain language explicitly overruling it.  The excerpts discuss the case's relevance to the "negative orders" doctrine and its historical context within administrative law. The court re-examines the case and its implications for jurisdiction, but it stops short of declaring it overruled or no longer good law. The analysis focuses on clarifying and refining the understanding of the "negative orders" doctrine, not on overturning *Procter & Gamble*. Therefore, there is no indication that *Procter & Gamble Co. v. United States* has been overruled.
103198	101973	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Alton Railroad Co. v. United States*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpts describe the case and its holding regarding the reviewability of Commission actions, but contain no language suggesting that the case is overruled,  in whole or in part,  nor does it offer functionally equivalent language. The citations are used to illustrate existing case law on the topic of reviewability of Commission orders.
103198	102669	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *United States v. Corrick* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text discusses the case's relevance to the "negative orders" doctrine and its application in different contexts.  It uses phrases like "involved review of action" and discusses the case in relation to other decisions but never suggests that it is no longer good law or that its holding has been overturned. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *United States v. Corrick* (1936) has been overruled.
103198	101012	no	no	100	The provided text cites *United States v. Los Angeles & S.L.R. Co.* multiple times.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled. The excerpts use the case as precedent, quoting it to support the court's reasoning on judicial review. There is no language indicating overruling, either explicitly or implicitly (e.g., by suggesting the case is no longer good law, or that its holding is limited to specific circumstances).
103198	96063	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Baird*, 194 U.S. 25 (1904),  but does not contain any language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The citing opinions refer to and rely on the *Baird* case as precedent. There is no explicit overruling, nor any language functionally equivalent to overruling, nor any limitation of its application to specific circumstances. The case is cited as providing a basis for the court's reasoning and conclusions. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Interstate Commerce Comm'n v. Baird* has been overruled in these excerpts.
103198	98242	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the Intermountain Rate Cases (234 U.S. 476) as precedent.  The excerpts do not contain any language suggesting that the Intermountain Rate Cases have been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  Instead, the citing opinions discuss and analyze the case in relation to later cases, using it to support their reasoning in some instances.  The mention of subsequent cases and their different outcomes does not equate to overruling the Intermountain Rate Cases. The text implies a degree of evolution in how the principles in Intermountain Rate Cases are applied to similar situations, but not that it is no longer good law. 
103198	102969	no	no	90	The provided text mentions *United States v. Griffin* multiple times but does not contain any language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The text notes that the court will not overrule prior decisions dealing with affirmative and negative administrative orders, but this does not refer specifically to *Griffin*. The case is cited as precedent in the discussion of the "negative order" doctrine, implying it remains relevant.
103292	102488	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that it rejects the distinctions made in the St. Louis Trust cases (which includes Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co.) in applying the Klein doctrine, deeming those distinctions untenable because they "drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept and to which we adhere."  This is functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling the case, at least in part, as the court is rejecting the legal reasoning and application of the precedent set by Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co.  The court's decision to reverse the judgments in several cases related to this issue further supports this conclusion.  The dissenting opinion further highlights the existing conflict and the court's desire to move away from the precedent.
103292	101723	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Klein v. United States*, and the Supreme Court ultimately affirms the principle established in *Klein*. While the court acknowledges difficulties in applying *Klein*'s distinctions and mentions that later cases like *Helvering v. St. Louis Trust Co.* and *Becker v. St. Louis Trust Co.* presented seeming disharmony, it ultimately states it rejects "as untenable the diversities taken in the St. Louis Trust cases in applying the Klein doctrine", indicating it adheres to *Klein*'s principle.  The Chief Justice even concurs "upon the ground that each of these cases is controlled by our decision in Klein v. United States."  Therefore, there is no indication *Klein* was overruled; rather, the Court clarifies and reaffirms its principle while rejecting misapplications in subsequent cases. 
103292	101780	no	no	85	The provided text does not explicitly state that *Cyrus H. McCormick v. David Burnet* (1931) was overruled.  While the opinion discusses the case and its relation to subsequent cases and legislation, it does not use language explicitly overruling it.  The opinion mentions that Congress, through the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, displaced the construction of the Court in *McCormick v. Burnet*, among other cases, but this is not an explicit overruling of the case itself. The text focuses on Congress's response to the court's interpretation of the estate tax law, rather than directly addressing the legal standing of *McCormick v. Burnet*. Therefore, there is no sufficient evidence to conclude that *McCormick v. Burnet* was overruled.
103292	101552	no	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that Congress, through the Joint Resolution of March 3, 1931, displaced the construction of Section 302(c) in *May v. Heiner*, along with other cases.  This is a direct overruling of the interpretation of the law in *May v. Heiner* as it relates to Section 302(c). The text points to this action as a specific rejection of the *May v. Heiner* doctrine.
103292	1477043	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Commissioner v. Schwarz multiple times. However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled.  The mentions are for comparative purposes, indicating that the court found Commissioner v. Schwarz to be an outlier case compared to other cases dealing with similar legal issues. There is no indication that a higher court explicitly overruled it, nor that the court used language functionally equivalent to overruling. No part of the case was qualified or overruled, and there's no indication it's not good law in certain contexts. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, there is no evidence to conclude that Commissioner v. Schwarz (1935) was overruled.
103292	1474615	no	no	90	The provided text mentions the case Commissioner v. Hallock (102 F.2d 1) multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the Supreme Court overruled it. The text discusses the case within the context of resolving inconsistencies between various lower court decisions related to the interpretation of a section in the Revenue Act, suggesting a clarification or refinement of existing legal precedent rather than an overruling. The court mentions the difficulty lower courts had in applying distinctions made by previous cases and sought to resolve the issue by hearing multiple cases at once.
103292	102489	yes	no	90	The excerpt discusses the overruling of the application of the Klein doctrine in St. Louis Trust cases, not Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co.  Justice Roberts dissents, arguing that a distinction exists between the Klein case and the St. Louis Union Trust cases (including Becker), and that the interpretation adopted in those cases should be followed due to its long-standing application.  The majority opinion overrules the application of the Klein doctrine in the St. Louis Trust cases because they are "untenable" and "drastically eat into the principle which those cases professed to accept." However, there is no indication that Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co. is explicitly overruled. The dissent even argues against overruling the interpretation in these cases, preserving Becker implicitly.
103290	102529	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that the decision in Colgate v. Harvey is overruled because it is 'repugnant to the line of reasoning adopted here'.  While there is a dissenting opinion that argues for upholding Colgate v. Harvey, the majority opinion overrules it.
103290	88661	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case of *Butchers' Benevolent Ass'n v. Crescent City Live-Stock Landing & Slaughter-House Co.* (16 Wall. 36), but it does not overrule it.  Instead, Justice Stone's opinion in a later case refers to the Slaughter-House Cases (as the case of interest is commonly known) and notes that the Court had previously rejected a particular contention in that case related to the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  This is not an overruling, but rather a reiteration of a prior holding.  The excerpt does not use language that functionally overrules the case, nor does it limit its application to certain circumstances or distinguish different legal principles within the case.
103290	96885	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *Twining v. New Jersey* multiple times (citations 21, 22, and 23). However, none of these mentions suggest that the case has been overruled.  The citations simply refer to the case, without any indication that its holding has been rejected or modified by a later court decision. Therefore, there is no evidence in the excerpt to suggest that *Twining v. New Jersey* has been overruled.
103290	103226	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Haguer v. Committee for Industrial Organization (307 U.S. 496) multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting it was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpt collects prior cases related to the 14th amendment, including the case of interest, but does not offer any analysis regarding its validity or standing as legal precedent.
103351	103227	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *United States v. Rock Royal Co-op.* (1939) among other cases that were used to support the court's decision.  There is no language suggesting that *United States v. Rock Royal Co-op.* (1939) was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The case is cited as precedent supporting the idea that Congress and states have sometimes controlled agricultural commodity supply and price, and the constitutionality of this has been upheld. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that it was overruled.
103351	101217	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Liberty Warehouse Co. v. Burley Tobacco Growers' Co-Operative Marketing Assn.* (1928) as a case that has withstood challenges in court.  There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The passage highlights the case as an example of prior legal precedent that supports the court's current reasoning, thereby implying that it remains good law in the context discussed.
103351	96354	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Carroll v. Greenwich Insurance Co., 199 U.S. 401, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt simply cites the case as precedent supporting the validity of a statute imposing an additional penalty on fire insurance combinations. There is no language suggesting the case is overruled, in whole or in part, nor is there any indication that the court is limiting the case's application to certain circumstances or distinguishing its legal principles.
103351	98219	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *International Harvester Co. v. Missouri*, 234 U.S. 199, in a list of cases alongside others.  There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The mention is simply for comparative purposes within the context of the discussion of antitrust legislation and cooperative marketing associations.  Therefore, there is no indication the case has been overruled.
103351	102224	no	no	100	The provided text mentions *Nebbia v. New York*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites *Nebbia* as a precedent supporting the constitutional validity of measures to control the supply and price of agricultural commodities. There is no language suggesting overruling, modification, or limitation of the case.
103351	101842	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *United States Navigation Co. v. Cunard Steamship Co.* (1932) as a relevant case in the context of shipping combinations and the Merchant Marine Act.  However, there is no indication that the case was overruled. The excerpt simply cites the case as a relevant precedent in the discussion of legislative choices regarding remedies for monopolies. There is no language suggesting overruling, qualification, or limitation of the case's holding.
103351	100052	no	no	100	The provided text mentions *Keogh v. Chicago & N.W. Ry. Co.* within the context of discussing the Sherman Antitrust Act and its interaction with other legislation (specifically, the Interstate Commerce Act).  The excerpt does not suggest that *Keogh* has been overruled. Instead, it uses *Keogh* as an example of a case that qualifies the Sherman Act in the context of common carriers.  There is no language indicating that the court disapproves of *Keogh*, alters its holding, or limits its application.
103351	98166	no	no	95	The provided text mentions German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Lewis, 233 U.S. 389, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites the case as a relevant prior decision alongside others, without indicating any disapproval or modification of its holding.  There is no language suggesting the court intends to overturn, limit, or qualify the precedent set by German Alliance. The mention of the case is purely for comparative purposes within the analysis of a different legal issue.
103351	103191	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Mulford v. Smith, 307 U.S. 38, as a case that had its constitutional validity sustained.  There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpt cites the case as precedent supporting the idea that measures to control the supply and price of agricultural commodities have been constitutionally upheld. This is consistent with following the case as precedent, not overruling it.
103351	102457	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Comm'n, 295 U.S. 285, but it does not contain any language that suggests the case has been overruled.  The case is mentioned in a list of other cases, which is not sufficient to indicate overruling.
103351	95612	yes	no	85	The court in this excerpt does not explicitly overrule *Connolly v. Union Sewer Pipe Co*.  While the court acknowledges that the Texas statute contains a similar exemption to the one deemed problematic in *Connolly*, it states that "time and circumstances had drained that case of vitality." This suggests a weakening or diminishing of the precedent's applicability, but not a direct overruling.  The court chooses to consider the exemption in its own context, implying it is not strictly bound by *Connolly*'s holding. Therefore, the case is not overruled, but rather its applicability is questioned and ultimately considered to not be controlling.
103557	99670	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes and discusses the case *United States v. Wheeler*, referencing its dicta, but does not explicitly overrule it.  The text uses the case to support its arguments, particularly concerning the right of free movement.  There is no language suggesting the Court intends to overturn *Wheeler*, only to interpret or clarify its implications. While the opinion clarifies the scope of the right to travel as established in *Crandall v. Nevada*, it does not indicate that *United States v. Wheeler* is no longer good law.
103557	96885	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule Twining v. New Jersey.  Instead, it cites Twining's interpretation of the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment regarding the right to travel between states.  The concurring opinion in this excerpt aligns with Twining's interpretation and further elaborates on the right to travel, using Twining's view as support. There is no language suggesting that Twining was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
103557	87885	no	no	95	The text discusses Crandall v. Nevada (1868) and its holding regarding the right to move freely throughout the nation as a right of national citizenship.  The excerpt analyzes the case's reasoning and its relation to other cases dealing with the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the commerce clause.  While there's discussion of different interpretations and potential alternative bases for the decision in Crandall, there is no language suggesting that Crandall has been overruled. The author affirms that Crandall should "continue to rest" on its broader ground of rights of national citizenship.  Therefore, the case is not overruled in this excerpt.
103557	102529	no	no	90	The provided text mentions Colgate v. Harvey (296 U.S. 404), but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt discusses the broader historical context of the right to free movement and cites Colgate v. Harvey among other cases related to the issue. It does not explicitly overrule it, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the author seems to be engaging in a discussion of precedents, possibly disagreeing with the interpretation of Colgate v. Harvey presented by other jurists.
103557	86014	yes	no	-1	CITE_NOT_FOUND
103505	101453	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case *Sinclair v. United States* multiple times, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the text uses *Sinclair* as a precedent case, referencing its holding in relation to the interpretation of the phrase "so near thereto" in the context of contempt of court. The citing opinions either agree with or distinguish from Sinclair's reasoning,  but there is no language suggesting that the precedent in *Sinclair* is overturned or no longer valid.
103505	99206	yes	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States* multiple times. However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled. The text uses the case as precedent, citing its interpretation of a statute.  While the text notes the "inaccuracy" of a historical observation made in *Toledo Newspaper*, this critique does not equate to overruling the case itself. The court's analysis incorporates *Toledo Newspaper* within its broader legal reasoning, indicating it remains relevant precedent. Therefore, there is no evidence that the court overruled *Toledo Newspaper Co. v. United States*. 
103505	88890	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Ex Parte Robinson* multiple times, and Justice Field's statements from that case are referenced to support the Court's reasoning.  There is no indication that *Ex Parte Robinson* is overruled. The passage uses *Ex Parte Robinson* as precedent, showing it is still considered relevant and not overruled.
103505	92542	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Savin* as precedent.  The court refers to the case multiple times, interpreting and applying its holding. There is no language suggesting that *Savin* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court's discussion clarifies and expands on *Savin*'s interpretation of statutory language, but this does not constitute overruling.  Instead, the court demonstrates its continued relevance and application.
103505	92543	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Cuddy, Petitioner* multiple times but does not contain language that would indicate it has been overruled. The text cites *Cuddy* as precedent alongside other cases.  There is no explicit overruling statement, nor any language functionally equivalent to overruling. The court's discussion focuses on interpreting and applying the legal principles in *Cuddy* and related cases, not on overturning it.
103522	101315	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that the drift away from Ribnik v. McBride has been so great that it can no longer be deemed a controlling authority.  This directly satisfies condition 2 for overruling a case (functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling).
103522	100181	no	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that in 1937, Adkins v. Children's Hospital (261 U.S. 525) was overruled by West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish.
103522	101029	no	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the "standard employed in Tyson & Brother v. Banton (273 U.S. 418), that the constitutional validity of price-fixing legislation was dependent on whether or not the business in question was 'affected with a public interest', was discarded in Nebbia v. New York."  This directly satisfies condition 1 for overruling: a majority of the Court explicitly states that the case has been overruled. The excerpt further explains that the test used in Tyson & Brother was considered a 'fiction' and 'unsatisfactory' by the Court. 
103522	101356	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Williams v. Standard Oil Co., 278 U.S. 235, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpt notes that subsequent cases have "given increasingly wider scope to the price-fixing powers of the states and of Congress."  This suggests a shift in legal interpretation rather than an explicit overruling of Williams v. Standard Oil Co. The court cites Williams to show a past precedent that is now contrasted with the court's current approach.  The opinion describes a "drift away" from a prior case, Ribnik v. McBride, and mentions Williams as one of the few cases that limited price-fixing power before this "drift." This shows that the court is contrasting its current approach with Williams, but not explicitly overruling it.
103522	102681	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Morehead v. New York Ex Rel. Tipaldo, but it does not overrule it.  The passage notes a "drift away" from Ribnik v. McBride and that Morehead, along with Williams v. Standard Oil Co., is an outlier compared to subsequent cases that expanded price-fixing powers.  This is a contextualization and distinction of Morehead, not an overruling.  The court does not use language explicitly overruling Morehead, nor does it qualify or limit the case's application to specific circumstances.  Therefore, there is no indication the case was overruled.
103522	101511	no	no	90	The excerpt mentions Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States (1930), but it does not overrule it.  The text describes a series of cases that demonstrate a shift in legal precedent regarding price-fixing, showing that the court's view on this subject evolved over time.  Tagg Bros. is mentioned as one case within this line of cases, but it's not explicitly overruled; instead, it's cited as a precedent that was later interpreted and applied alongside other cases to shape the evolving legal understanding.
103522	101636	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *O'Gorman & Young, Inc. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co.* (1931) as a case that sustained a New Jersey statute.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled. The text traces the evolution of legal precedent concerning price-fixing powers of states and Congress, showing how subsequent cases expanded upon or modified the scope of those powers.  *O'Gorman & Young* is cited as one point in that historical progression, not as a case that has been overturned.
103522	102224	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Nebbia v. New York (1934) as a case that upheld a New York statute authorizing the fixing of minimum and maximum retail prices for milk.  There is no language suggesting that the case was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The text traces the evolution of legal precedent concerning price-fixing powers of states and Congress, showing that subsequent cases expanded on the principles established in Nebbia. The excerpt does mention that *Adkins v. Children's Hospital* (1923) was overruled in 1937 by *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish*, but this is a different case.
103522	102322	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Hegeman Farms Corp. v. Baldwin alongside other cases that were later used to support the increasingly wider scope given to price-fixing powers of states and Congress.  There is no language suggesting that Hegeman Farms Corp. v. Baldwin was overruled.  The text cites it as a case supporting the broader principle of state price-fixing powers. Therefore, there is no indication that it was overruled.
103522	102602	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *BORDEN'S FARM PRODUCTS CO., INC. v. TEN EYCK* among other cases that "have given increasingly wider scope to the price-fixing powers of the states and of Congress."  There is no language suggesting that *BORDEN'S FARM PRODUCTS CO., INC. v. TEN EYCK* was overruled. The text describes it as part of a trend of increasingly broader interpretation of price-fixing powers, not as a case that was overturned or altered in legal standing.
103522	102402	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc. in a list of cases related to price-fixing.  However, there is no language suggesting that Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc. was overruled. The text describes a trend of increasingly wider scope given to state and Congressional price-fixing powers, showing cases that followed and expanded upon the themes in the case of interest, rather than contradicting or overruling it.  Therefore, there's no indication that Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc. was overruled in this excerpt.
103522	102603	no	no	90	The provided text mentions the case *Mayflower Farms v. Ten Eyck*, but it does not state that the case has been overruled.  The text cites several other cases alongside *Mayflower Farms v. Ten Eyck*, indicating that it is being considered within a broader legal context, but there is no language suggesting overruling or that the case is no longer good law.
103522	102784	no	no	100	The provided text states that in 1937, *Adkins v. Children's Hospital* (261 U.S. 525) was overruled by *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish*.  It does not state that *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish* itself was overruled.  The excerpt highlights *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish* as a case that upheld a minimum wage statute, contrasting it with earlier precedents. There is no indication that this case was later overruled.
103522	102835	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Townsend v. Yeomans*, citing its upholding of a Georgia statute. There is no indication that the case was overruled.  The text focuses on a broader discussion of price-fixing cases and their relation to a departure from the philosophy of a previous case (Ribnik). While other cases are mentioned as overruled (Adkins v. Children's Hospital), there is no language suggesting *Townsend v. Yeomans* shares this fate.
103522	103191	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Mulford v. Smith, 307 U.S. 38, but does not state that it has been overruled.  The text cites several cases dealing with price-fixing and minimum wage laws, showing a shift in legal approach from earlier decisions. However, there's no indication that Mulford v. Smith was explicitly overruled or otherwise invalidated.
103522	103133	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Currin v. Wallace (306 U.S. 1) alongside other cases that were used to support the court's reasoning in a later case.  There is no indication that Currin v. Wallace was overruled. The text cites Currin v. Wallace as a case that upheld a price-fixing statute, consistent with the other cases discussed.  The passage shows it is used as precedent along with others, not something that has been overturned.
103522	103227	no	no	95	The provided text mentions United States v. Rock Royal Co-operative, 307 U.S. 533, as a case upholding the power of Congress to fix minimum milk prices.  There is no language suggesting that this case was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text cites several other cases related to price-fixing and minimum wage laws, but none indicate that *Rock Royal* was overturned. The passage discusses a "basic departure" from the philosophy of previous cases, but this is not equivalent to overruling *Rock Royal*. Instead, *Rock Royal* is cited as one of the examples of constitutionally permissible price-fixing.
103522	103362	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins*, but does not state that it was overruled.  The excerpt describes a series of cases upholding price-fixing legislation, and *Sunshine Coal Co. v. Adkins* is included as an example of a case upholding such legislation, not as a case that was overruled.
103522	103442	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *United States v. Darby* (1941) and upholds its minimum wage and maximum hour provisions.  There is no language suggesting that the case was overruled, in whole or in part.  The text discusses a shift away from previous legal precedent, particularly the "affected with a public interest" test, but this is not an overruling of *United States v. Darby*. Instead, the text shows *United States v. Darby* as a significant departure from earlier cases, indicating that it is being followed as precedent.
103522	98749	no	no	85	The provided text mentions Brazee v. Michigan (241 U.S. 340) within a discussion of the evolution of legal precedent concerning price-fixing and the "affected with a public interest" test.  The Court explicitly states that the test used in Ribnik v. McBride (and previously in Tyson & Brother v. Banton), which had relied on the approach in Brazee, was discarded in Nebbia v. New York.  However, the excerpt does not state that Brazee itself is overruled.  Instead, the Court is criticizing the legal test employed in several cases, including Brazee,  but this does not equate to overruling the case itself.  The court is changing the test, not overruling the case directly. 
103522	101887	no	no	90	The excerpt mentions New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U.S. 262, alongside other cases in a list introduced by "But see".  This phrasing indicates that the court is acknowledging the existence of the cited case and potentially contrasting it with the court's own reasoning or the facts of the present case, not that it is overruling it.  There is no language suggesting that the court finds the case to be incorrect or no longer good law.
103522	102713	no	no	90	The excerpt mentions Old Dearborn Distributing Co. v. Seagram-Distillers Corp. amongst other cases, but it does not provide any indication that it was overruled.  The citation is presented within a list of cases, without any analysis or discussion of their legal standing. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude it has been overruled.
103522	102662	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Carter v. Carter Coal Co. (298 U.S. 238) among other cases.  However, there is no language suggesting it is overruled, qualified, or limited in any way. The mention is merely a citation, and there is no analysis or discussion of its holding or relevance to the current case.
103522	101413	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Highland v. Russell Car & Snow Plow Co. (279 U.S. 253) only as a case to be compared with (Cf.).  There is no language suggesting the court overruled, qualified, or limited Highland in any way.  The mention is not an instance of the court treating Highland as precedent, nor is it explicitly overruling the case. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that Highland v. Russell Car & Snow Plow Co. was overruled.
103555	90350	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Dietzsch v. Huidekoper*, but never states that it has been overruled.  Instead, the opinion discusses *Dietzsch* in relation to other cases concerning the power of federal courts to enjoin state court proceedings.  The citing opinion uses *Dietzsch* to support its reasoning, showing that it is considered relevant precedent, not overruled precedent.
103555	100061	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Kline v. Burke Construction Co.*, but never indicates that it has been overruled.  Instead, the text uses *Kline* as precedent, distinguishing it from other cases or clarifying its application in specific contexts. The citations show *Kline* is being used to support legal arguments, indicating that it remains relevant case law. There is no language suggesting that the court is overruling any part of *Kline*, or stating that it is no longer good law.  The analysis of *Kline* within the text implies it's still valid precedent, although its application might be limited in certain situations (as explained in the text).
103555	96399	no	no	90	The excerpts mention Gunter v. Atlantic Coast Line multiple times.  In one instance, the court states that it is "laying aside" Gunter as inapplicable to the current case. However, this does not constitute an overruling.  The court describes Gunter as a "relitigation decision" and notes its agreement with the position taken in Gunter, even if using different reasoning.  While the court distinguishes Gunter from the present case, it does not explicitly overrule any part of it.  Therefore, the case is not overruled according to the criteria provided.
103555	89070	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *French v. Hay*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the text analyzes and clarifies the case's reasoning, particularly in relation to the concept of relitigation and the interaction between federal and state court proceedings.  The opinion distinguishes *French v. Hay*'s application in the context of removal proceedings and states that subsequent decisions have clarified the "loose ground" of *French v. Hay*. This is not a functional equivalent of overruling.  The case is discussed and its reasoning is critiqued, but it is not explicitly overruled or stated to be no longer good law.
103555	89712	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes the case *Dial v. Reynolds*,  pointing out its holding and discussing its relevance in the context of relitigation.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Dial v. Reynolds* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text distinguishes *Dial v. Reynolds* from other cases and analyzes its decision in relation to the Act of 1793, but this analysis doesn't equate to overruling the precedent set in *Dial v. Reynolds*. The court's discussion focuses on interpreting and applying *Dial v. Reynolds*, not on overturning it.
103555	99752	yes	no	95	The provided text does not explicitly overrule Supreme Tribe of Ben-Hur v. Cauble. While the opinion discusses the case and its implications regarding relitigation and the interaction between federal and state courts, it does not state that the case is overruled, nor does it offer language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The opinion critiques the reasoning and application of the case in certain contexts, particularly concerning the extension of the "relitigation exception" under 265, but this is a criticism of its application, not a direct overruling of the case itself.
103555	93714	no	no	95	The excerpt states that the authority of Root v. Woolworth had not been doubted until the current case.  The excerpt then clarifies that Root v. Woolworth is "erroneously regarded as illustrating a "relitigation" exception to § 265." It explains that Root v. Woolworth did not uphold a federal injunction against a state suit and did not consider the applicability of § 265.  The excerpt criticizes the interpretation of Root v. Woolworth, but does not explicitly overrule it. Therefore, it is not overruled, but its interpretation is challenged.
103555	95802	no	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that the "first come, first served" rationale of Prout v. Starr, 188 U.S. 537, was discarded in Kline v. Burke Construction Co., 260 U.S. 226, 235. This directly satisfies condition 2 (functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling) and therefore, Prout v. Starr is considered overruled.
103493	95346	no	no	100	The provided text cites Scranton v. Wheeler (179 U.S. 141) multiple times, but there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled.  The citations are used to support the court's reasoning.  There is no indication of overruling, explicit or implicit, nor any qualification, distinction, or limitation of the cited case's application.
103493	97899	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Water Power Co.* multiple times in footnotes [7] and [12]  but does not contain language that would suggest the case has been overruled. The mentions are in the context of supporting arguments and citing precedent, not overruling it.  There is no explicit statement overruling the case, nor any functionally equivalent language.
103493	95793	yes	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule *United States v. Lynah*.  Instead, the opinion distinguishes *Lynah* based on the facts.  The court states that what was said in *Lynah* must be confined to its facts.  This is not an overruling, but rather an attempt to limit the scope of the precedent to situations similar to the circumstances of *Lynah*.  The court proceeds to discuss how *Lynah* considered three specific issues (jurisdiction, taking of property, and governmental action), but doesn't directly overrule any of the holdings. The analysis focuses on distinguishing the current case from *Lynah* on the facts, not on overruling the prior legal precedent.
103493	98902	no	no	95	The court explicitly states that what was said in the Cress case must be confined to the facts there disclosed.  The court does not overrule Cress, but limits its application to the specific facts presented in that case. The current case presented a different question than what was discussed in Cress. Therefore, Cress is not overruled, but rather distinguished and its scope of application clarified.
103493	87748	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Gilman v. Philadelphia (3 Wall. 713) as a citation, but there is no language suggesting it is overruled.  The text focuses on the application of legal principles related to riverbeds and structures within waterways, referencing Gilman among other cases to support its conclusion. There is no explicit overruling, implicit overruling through contradictory language, or limitation of the case to specific circumstances.  Therefore, based solely on the provided text, there's no evidence that Gilman v. Philadelphia is overruled.
103493	94650	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Gibson v. United States (166 U.S. 269) as a cited case, but there is no language suggesting it is overruled.  The excerpt cites Gibson alongside other cases to support the court's reasoning. There is no indication that Gibson is no longer good law, nor is any part of its holding explicitly rejected or modified.
103493	103413	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *United States v. Appalachian Electric Power Co.* (311 U.S. 377) among other cases. However, there is no language suggesting that the court overruled it, in whole or in part.  The case is simply cited as one of a number of precedents. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that it was overruled.
103493	87367	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case of interest, *State of Alabama v. State of Georgia*, but it does not overrule it.  The text cites *Alabama v. Georgia* as one of several precedents, suggesting it's being used as supporting authority, not overruled. There is no language suggesting the court intends to overturn *State of Alabama v. State of Georgia*. 
103493	98436	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Greenleaf Johnson Lumber Co. v. Garrison (1915) among other cases in a list of citations (Note 9).  There is no language suggesting that Greenleaf Johnson Lumber Co. v. Garrison (1915) was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The case is simply cited as one of several relevant precedents.  Therefore, there is no indication that it has been overruled.
103493	98694	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Willink v. United States* among a list of other cases in Note 9.  There is no language suggesting that *Willink* is overruled, explicitly or implicitly. The text cites *Willink* as precedent alongside other cases, indicating it is being considered as still relevant. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Willink v. United States* was overruled.
103493	97900	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *Lewis Blue Point Oyster Co. v. Briggs*, but it does not contain any language suggesting that the case has been overruled.  The excerpt cites the case as part of a list of precedents, which is not an indication of overruling. There is no discussion of the case's holding or any indication that the court is rejecting or modifying its principles. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, there is no evidence to suggest that *Lewis Blue Point Oyster Co. v. Briggs* has been overruled.
103442	103133	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Currin v. Wallace* as precedent, even stating that it is being followed.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text uses phrases such as "we follow" and "supra" in reference to *Currin v. Wallace*, indicating that it remains good law in the context of the current opinion.  Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that *Currin v. Wallace* has been overruled.
103442	2516349	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Reid v. Colorado* multiple times as precedent to support the Court's reasoning regarding Congressional power over interstate commerce.  There is no language suggesting that *Reid v. Colorado* is overruled,  either explicitly or implicitly.  Instead, the excerpt uses *Reid v. Colorado* to support the proposition that Congress can regulate interstate commerce even if the effect is to indirectly impact intrastate activities. The court explicitly overrules *Hammer v. Dagenhart*, but this is a different case.
103442	103191	no	no	95	The provided text does not explicitly state that *Mulford v. Smith* was overruled.  Instead, the opinion cites *Mulford v. Smith* alongside other cases to support the court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause. The text focuses on overruling *Hammer v. Dagenhart*, and *Mulford v. Smith* is mentioned as supporting the court's new interpretation rather than being overruled itself. Therefore, there is no indication that *Mulford v. Smith* has been overruled in this opinion.
103442	98832	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co.* among a list of cases concerning Congressional power to regulate commerce.  There is no language suggesting that *Clark Distilling Co.* was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpt cites the case as precedent supporting the proposition that Congress's power to regulate commerce includes the power to prohibit such commerce.
103442	98608	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Seven Cases v. United States*, citing it as precedent supporting the Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause.  There is no language suggesting that *Seven Cases* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The text focuses on overruling *Hammer v. Dagenhart*, a different case.
103442	99412	no	no	95	The provided text cites *United States v. Ferger* multiple times but does not overrule it.  The citing opinions reference *Ferger* as precedent, supporting the legitimacy of Congressional regulation of intrastate activities affecting interstate commerce.  There is no language suggesting the overruling of *Ferger*, either explicitly or implicitly. The citations are used to support the court's reasoning, not to overturn any aspect of *Ferger*'s holding.
103442	100469	no	no	100	The provided text mentions *Everard's Breweries v. Day*, 265 U.S. 545, as a supporting precedent alongside other cases.  There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing case uses it as an example of a case where the court sustained legislation that involved control of intrastate activities to achieve a purpose within the admitted power of the national government.  Therefore, there's no indication of overruling.
103442	98232	no	no	100	The provided text cites Houston, East & West Texas Railway Co. v. United States (234 U.S. 342) multiple times.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled. Instead, the citing opinions use the case as precedent, supporting their legal arguments by referencing it. There is no language indicating the case has been overturned, qualified, or limited in any way. Therefore, based solely on the provided excerpts, there is no indication that Houston, East & West Texas Railway Co. v. United States has been overruled.
103442	99906	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *Wisconsin RR Comm. v. C., B. & QRR CO.* multiple times but does not contain any language that would indicate it has been overruled.  The citing opinions reference the case as precedent, supporting the idea that it remains valid legal authority. There is no explicit overruling, nor any language functionally equivalent to overruling. No part of the case is overruled, nor is its application limited to specific circumstances.  There is no distinction made in the treatment of legal principles within the case, and it's not stated to be no longer good law in any context.
103442	102204	no	no	100	The provided text cites the case *Local 167, International Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States* multiple times.  However, none of the citations contain language that suggests the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The case is mentioned as precedent supporting the court's reasoning. There is no indication of the court qualifying, distinguishing, or limiting the application of *Local 167*. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that the case has been overruled.
103442	97451	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case *Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Comm'n*, 221 U.S. 612 multiple times.  However, nowhere in the excerpts does the court explicitly overrule, implicitly overturn, or limit the holding of the cited case. The citing opinion references the case as precedent supporting the proposition that Congress may prescribe maximum hours for employees engaged in intrastate activity connected with interstate train movement.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Balt. & Ohio RR v. Int. Com. Comm. (1911)* was overruled.
103442	100188	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Board of Trade of Chicago v. Olsen* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled. The citations are used to support the court's reasoning in the current case.  There's no indication of explicit overruling, functional equivalence to overruling, partial overruling based on circumstances, distinction of legal principles, or the declaration that it is no longer good law in specific contexts.
103442	2621060	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Bunting v. Oregon (243 U.S. 426) multiple times, stating that it is no longer open to question that fixing minimum wage and maximum hours is within the legislative power.  This is not an overruling, but rather a reaffirmation of the precedent set by Bunting. The court cites Bunting as support for its holding, indicating that the case remains good law in this context.
103442	99190	yes	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the reasoning and conclusion of Hammer v. Dagenhart cannot be reconciled with the court's current conclusion.  It further notes that Hammer v. Dagenhart has not been followed and that the distinction on which the decision was based has long since been abandoned.  These statements strongly suggest that Hammer v. Dagenhart has been overruled.
103639	2620693	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule *Bullen v. Wisconsin*.  Instead, it cites *Bullen* multiple times as precedent supporting the court's decision.  The text overrules *Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton*, not *Bullen v. Wisconsin*. While *Bullen* is mentioned repeatedly, there is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
103639	103220	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Graves v. Elliott multiple times, and in one instance, Justice Roberts states that he concurs in the result only because he considers himself bound by the decisions in Curry v. McCanless and Graves v. Elliott.  This implies that Graves v. Elliott is being followed as precedent, not overruled.  There is no language suggesting that any part of Graves v. Elliott is overruled, or no longer good law.
103639	100955	yes	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the conclusion and reasoning of Wachovia Bank & Trust Co. v. Doughton cannot be reconciled with other cases (Bullen, McCanless, and Elliott) and that "if appropriate emphasis be placed on the orderly administration of justice rather than blind adherence to conflicting precedents, the Wachovia case must be overruled."
103639	103219	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Curry v. McCanless multiple times.  In one instance, Justice Roberts explicitly states that he concurs in the result only because he feels bound by the decision in Curry v. McCanless. This indicates that the case was not overruled but rather served as a precedent.  There is no language suggesting overruling, qualifying, or limiting the application of Curry v. McCanless.
103639	96658	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Chanler v. Kelsey multiple times as precedent, but it does not overrule it.  The opinion overrules a different case, the Wachovia case,  which is not the case of interest.  While the opinion discusses the evolution of legal understanding related to taxation of intangibles, it does so by citing Chanler v. Kelsey as one case amongst many that supported a previous view.  There is no language indicating that Chanler v. Kelsey is explicitly overruled, implicitly overruled, or even limited in its application. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, Chanler v. Kelsey is not overruled.
103639	95546	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Orr v. Gilman* multiple times as a cited case, but it does not explicitly overrule it.  The opinion overrules the Wachovia case, but this is a different case.  The mention of *Orr v. Gilman* is for comparative purposes, showing a line of cases related to taxation of intangibles. There is no language suggesting it is no longer good law or that any part of it has been overturned.
103639	101237	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Saltonstall v. Saltonstall* several times, citing it as precedent.  There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The opinion overrules a different case, *Wachovia*, but makes no mention of overruling *Saltonstall*. The court cites *Saltonstall* alongside other cases that it considers relevant and doesn't distinguish it in a way that would suggest overruling. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no indication that *Saltonstall v. Saltonstall* has been overruled.
103639	101277	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Blodgett v. Silberman* multiple times but does not overrule it.  The text overrules *Wachovia Trust Co. v. Doughton*, stating that it is overruled, but this is a different case. There is no language suggesting that *Blodgett v. Silberman* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly, in whole or in part.  The mention of *Blodgett v. Silberman* is used for comparison and context within the discussion of state taxation of wealth transfers, but not to overturn its precedent.
103736	96454	yes	yes	95	The provided text repeatedly refers to Haddock v. Haddock.  The Supreme Court's opinion in this case demonstrates that Haddock v. Haddock is overruled because the court explicitly states that Haddock v. Haddock made an "arbitrary break with the past" and created distinctions "incompatible with the role of this Court in enforcing the Full Faith and Credit Clause."  Further, the opinion outlines its rejection of the reasoning in Haddock v. Haddock and explicitly overrules the prior case, stating it is "freed from the hopeless refinements introduced by that case." This satisfies criteria 1 and 2 for overruling a case, as the court directly states that Haddock v. Haddock is no longer good law.  The extensive discussion replacing the prior holding shows the court intends a complete reversal of the precedent.
103736	95457	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Atherton v. Atherton*, and in doing so, the court's opinion accepts and relies on its holding.  There is no language suggesting that *Atherton v. Atherton* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The court distinguishes *Haddock v. Haddock* from *Atherton v. Atherton*, but this is a distinction, not an overruling.  Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Atherton v. Atherton* has been overruled.
103736	87830	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Christmas v. Russell* as precedent, and there is no language suggesting it has been overruled, in whole or in part.  The excerpts show that the court continues to rely on the principles established in *Christmas v. Russell*. While other cases are discussed and their application to specific circumstances may differ, *Christmas v. Russell* is presented as a foundational case on the topic of full faith and credit given to judgments from sister states.  No language is present that indicates this case is no longer good law.
103736	95458	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss Bell v. Bell (181 U.S. 175) multiple times.  The court's opinion does not explicitly overrule Bell v. Bell. Instead, the court applies the principles of Bell v. Bell to the present case, examining whether the petitioners had a bona fide domicile in Nevada to determine whether the Nevada divorce decrees are entitled to full faith and credit.  The court also notes that even if Bell v. Bell were applicable, the general verdict made it impossible to determine whether the conviction was based on the invalidity of the Nevada decrees due to lack of jurisdiction, rendering an assessment of Bell v. Bell unnecessary for decision.  The opinion cites and analyzes Bell v. Bell, but does not challenge its precedent.
103736	102404	no	no	95	The snippets cite the case of interest multiple times, but do not overrule it.  Instead, the citing case refers to the precedent set by *Alaska Packers Assn*.  The citing opinion uses the case to support its argument about the flexibility in applying the Full Faith and Credit Clause to balance state interests.  There is no language suggesting the overruling, explicit or implicit, of *Alaska Packers Assn*. The case is used as a supporting precedent.
103736	98476	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Hood v. McGehee multiple times, citing it as precedent alongside other cases related to the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the power of states to regulate matters of domestic relations, particularly concerning property and divorce.  There is no language suggesting that Hood v. McGehee is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinions affirm the principle established in Hood v. McGehee, that a state's interest in regulating property within its boundaries can supersede the Full Faith and Credit Clause's requirements. Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled.
103736	102412	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Broderick v. Rosner* multiple times.  However, the text does not contain any language that would indicate the case has been overruled, fully or partially. The excerpts use the case as precedent, citing it to support the court's reasoning on the narrow scope of exceptions to the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  There is no indication of explicit overruling, functionally equivalent language, partial overruling based on circumstances, or distinctions of legal principles.  Therefore, the case is not overruled according to the provided criteria.
103736	97084	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Fall v. Eastin*, 215 U.S. 1, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the opinion uses *Fall v. Eastin* as precedent to support its reasoning regarding the balance of state interests in divorce cases and the limits of the Full Faith and Credit Clause. The Court's discussion suggests that *Fall v. Eastin*'s principles, which limit the extraterritorial effect of divorce decrees affecting property, remain relevant and applicable in similar situations.  Therefore, there's no indication that *Fall v. Eastin* has been overruled.
103736	96865	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Fauntleroy v. Lum* as precedent, supporting the principle of full faith and credit for judgments from other states, even if the underlying cause of action wouldn't be enforceable in the forum state.  There is no language suggesting the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The opinion affirms the continued relevance of *Fauntleroy v. Lum* in the context of full faith and credit.
103736	103417	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Milliken v. Meyer*, 311 U.S. 457,  but does not overrule it.  Instead, the text uses *Milliken v. Meyer* as precedent, supporting its argument regarding the extraterritorial effect of divorce decrees and the state's interest in the marital status of its domiciliaries.  There is no language suggesting the overruling, modification, or limitation of *Milliken v. Meyer*. The citing opinions use *Milliken v. Meyer* to support their legal conclusions.
103761	101495	yes	no	95	The provided text cites *Johnson v. Emergency Fleet Corp.* multiple times and discusses its interpretation of the Suits in Admiralty Act.  However, there is no language suggesting that the court overruled, qualified, or limited the holding in *Johnson v. Emergency Fleet Corp*. The court's discussion seems to be applying or clarifying the precedent established in *Johnson v. Emergency Fleet Corp.*, not overruling it.  The text shows the court used the case as a basis for deciding whether the Suits in Admiralty Act makes private operators non-suable for their torts, but it never explicitly or implicitly overrules it.
103761	102049	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Vancouver Steamship Co. v. Rice*, citing it as precedent supporting the court's assertion of admiralty court jurisdiction in a maritime tort case.  There is no language suggesting the court overruled, qualified, or limited the holding of *Vancouver Steamship Co. v. Rice* in any way. The court agrees with the precedent set by the cited case.
103761	102479	no	no	95	The provided text cites *The Admiral Peoples* (295 U.S. 649) as precedent supporting the proposition that the case involved a maritime tort within the admiralty court's jurisdiction.  There is no language suggesting the court overruled, qualified, or limited the holding in *The Admiral Peoples*. The court agrees with the lower court's reliance on this case. Therefore, there's no indication that *The Admiral Peoples* was overruled.
103761	100968	no	no	95	The provided text cites Eastern Transportation Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 675, as precedent supporting the proposition that a suit under the Suits in Admiralty Act would be the exclusive remedy against the United States or a corporation entirely owned by it.  The court does not explicitly overrule, modify, or limit the holding of Eastern Transportation Co.  Instead, the court uses the case to support its reasoning.  Therefore, there is no indication that Eastern Transportation Co. has been overruled.
103761	101230	no	no	95	The provided text cites *United States Shipping Bd. Emergency Fleet Corporation v. Rosenberg Brothers & Co.* as precedent, stating that the action in admiralty afforded by § 2 of the Suits in Admiralty Act is the only available remedy against the United States or a corporation whose entire outstanding capital stock is owned by the United States or its representatives.  This is not an overruling but rather an affirmation and application of the precedent.
103761	99419	no	no	95	The excerpt states that The Lake Monroe case's holding that libel in rem would lie against vessels owned by the United States was addressed by Section 1 of the Suits in Admiralty Act.  However, this is not an overruling of The Lake Monroe case, but rather a statutory modification of the remedy available.  The excerpt does not challenge the legal principles of The Lake Monroe case; it simply explains how the statutory law altered the practical application of those principles regarding remedies against government-owned vessels.  The court distinguishes the case, explaining that the act did not abolish remedies against private companies operating government vessels. Therefore, none of the criteria for overruling are met.
103761	99982	no	no	100	The provided text cites the case *Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. Emergency Fleet Corp.* as precedent, stating that the policy established in that case has been followed.  The court explicitly uses the case to support its reasoning and does not suggest any overruling or modification of the *Sloan Shipyards* decision.
103761	103165	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Keifer & Keifer v. Reconstruction Finance Corp. as a case that followed a policy of not favoring immunity from suit when it comes to utilizing corporate facilities in federal activities.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text uses the case as precedent, supporting the argument that the principle of holding government instrumentalities accountable for their agents' actions remains valid.
103761	103302	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Federal Housing Administration v. Burr*, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the text cites *Federal Housing Administration v. Burr* as a precedent supporting the principle that immunity from suit is not favored when it comes to the utilization of corporate facilities in federal commercial or business activities. The court uses the case to support its argument, not to overturn it.
103761	102452	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Federal Land Bank v. Priddy, 295 U.S. 229, but does not overrule it.  The passage cites Priddy along with other cases to support the assertion that Congress has the power to grant or withhold immunity from suit for government corporations.  There is no language suggesting the court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the holding in Priddy. The court simply acknowledges the case as precedent regarding Congressional power to grant or withhold immunity.
103761	103439	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Reconstruction Finance Corp. v. Menihan Corp.* but does not overrule it.  The excerpt discusses the case within a broader context of governmental immunity from suit and the liability of agents.  It cites *Menihan Corp.* as a precedent supporting the principle that Congress has the power to grant or withhold immunity from suit for governmental corporations. There is no language suggesting the overruling, modification, or limitation of the *Menihan Corp.* decision.
103761	99972	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Dahn v. Davis (258 U.S. 421), but it does not overrule, modify, or qualify it in any way.  The case is cited as precedent illustrating the impact of potential legal interpretations. There is no language suggesting that Dahn v. Davis is no longer good law, or that its holding is limited or altered in any specific context.
103761	93000	no	no	100	The excerpt mentions the case *Guaranty Trust & S.D. Co. v. Green Cove R. Co.* but does not overrule it.  The citing case refers to it as support for the proposition that the rights between a principal and agent do not dictate the rights of third parties against either for torts. This is a citation, not an overruling.  There is no language suggesting that the cited case is no longer good law, only that it is relevant to a specific point of law.
103761	103284	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Yearsley v. W. A. Ross Construction Co.* as precedent.  The court distinguishes the facts of the current case from *Yearsley*, noting that the "situation is quite different."  This is not an overruling; it is a distinction based on the particular facts and circumstances. The court uses *Yearsley* to illustrate a principle of contractor immunity but ultimately finds that principle inapplicable to the current case.
103761	95660	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Minnesota v. Hitchcock (185 U.S. 373), but it does not overrule it.  The text refers to the case in the context of a discussion about altering the concept of a real party in interest due to a contract for exoneration or indemnity.  The court suggests that such a change would be a "basic alteration" and detrimental to private claimants, implying disagreement with a hypothetical scenario rather than directly overruling the precedent set by Minnesota v. Hitchcock. The citing case does not explicitly state that Minnesota v. Hitchcock is overruled, nor does it employ language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Therefore, there's no indication that the precedent of Minnesota v. Hitchcock has been overruled.
103761	84992	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Dunlop v. Munroe* as one case among several others cited in support of a discussion about the liability of public officials.  There is no indication that the court overruled, qualified, or limited *Dunlop v. Munroe* in any way. The case is mentioned, but not analyzed or used as precedent in the present case, thus it is not overruled.
103761	92277	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Robertson v. Sichel (127 U.S. 507) among other cases, but it does not offer any analysis, criticism, or explicit overruling of the mentioned case.  The citation is part of a list of cases relevant to the liability of public officials. There is no language suggesting the court finds the case's holding to be incorrect or no longer good law. Therefore, there's no indication that Robertson v. Sichel has been overruled.
103761	94400	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Spalding v. Vilas*, but it does not offer any indication that the case has been overruled.  The mention is within a list of cases cited in support of a discussion on the liability of public officials. There is no language suggesting overruling, modification, or limitation of *Spalding v. Vilas* in any way.
103831	103705	yes	yes	100	The court's opinion explicitly overrules Jones v. Opelika.  The majority opinion states that its previous decision in Jones v. Opelika is vacated and invalidates the ordinances in question.  The court directly references the dissenting opinion in Jones v. Opelika from the previous hearing as the basis for its new ruling, effectively overruling the prior holding. This constitutes an explicit overruling, fulfilling criterion 1 and indirectly criterion 2.
103831	103355	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Cantwell v. Connecticut* multiple times, but it does not contain any language that suggests it has been overruled.  The case is mentioned as precedent related to freedom of speech and religion, alongside other cases. There is no indication that the court is explicitly overruling it, limiting its application, or stating that it is no longer good law in any context. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, there is no evidence that *Cantwell v. Connecticut* has been overruled.
103831	102601	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Grosjean v. American Press Co. multiple times.  However, it does not overrule the case. Instead, the text cites the case as precedent and discusses its holding, particularly regarding taxes on newspapers and the importance of preserving an "untrammeled press." The court distinguishes its current case from Grosjean by noting that the current case involves a different type of tax.  There is no language suggesting that Grosjean is overruled, modified, or no longer good law in any context.
103831	101773	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Near v. Minnesota* multiple times.  However, in all instances, the case is cited as precedent, not overruled. The text uses *Near v. Minnesota* to support the court's reasoning and doesn't express any intention to overturn its holding. Therefore, there is no indication that *Near v. Minnesota* has been overruled in this excerpt.
103869	103816	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Board of County Commissioners v. Seber*, but it does not contain language that overrules it, either explicitly or implicitly.  The citations are used to support the court's reasoning and are treated as precedent. There is no indication that any part of the case is overruled, qualified, or limited in application.  Instead, the court uses *Seber* to reinforce its own interpretation of the Congressional power and intent regarding taxation of Indian property. 
103869	102466	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Superintendent of Five Civilized Tribes v. Commissioner*, referencing its holding that the restricted income of Indians is subject to federal income tax.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinions use the case as precedent and support their own conclusions by referencing *Superintendent*. Therefore, there's no evidence of overruling.
103869	101272	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp.* as precedent.  In several instances, the court explicitly states that the principle established in *Shaw* applies to certain situations, indicating that the case is being followed, not overruled. There is no language suggesting that *Shaw* has been overturned, either in whole or in part. Instead, the court clarifies and applies its holding to different factual situations.
103869	103192	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions *United States Trust Co. v. Helvering* multiple times.  However, in section 2, the court explicitly states that the decision in *United States Trust Co. v. Helvering* "have no application here" because of the unique circumstances of Indian tax exemptions, which are to be liberally construed.  This is a distinction, not an overruling. The court is not rejecting the legal principles of *United States Trust Co. v. Helvering*, but rather finding it inapplicable to the present case involving different facts and statutory interpretations. Therefore, the case was not overruled.
103869	97425	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Tiger v. Western Investment Co.* multiple times, but it does not contain language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The citations are used to support the court's reasoning regarding the special status of Indians and the limitations on state taxation of their property. There is no indication that the court is rejecting or modifying any of the holdings in *Tiger v. Western Investment Co*. Instead, the court appears to rely on the precedent set by *Tiger* to support its argument.
103869	102986	no	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp. overruled previous decisions limiting the power of the state to impose certain types of taxes on incomes derived from tax-exempt and restricted Indian property.  The opinion cites the case multiple times and describes its effect as "repudiated former decisions seriously limiting state and federal power to tax." This directly satisfies condition 2 (functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling) and potentially condition 3 (overruling only part of the case, depending on the scope of the "previous decisions" it overruled).
103869	95792	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *United States v. Rickert* multiple times but does not contain any language suggesting it has been overruled.  The text uses *Rickert* as precedent to support the tax exemption of Indian lands held in trust by the United States. There is no explicit overruling, nor any language functionally equivalent to overruling. The case is cited as relevant to the discussion of taxation and Indian lands, indicating it remains a point of reference, not that it's been overturned.
103869	103172	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe several times.  However, it does not contain any language that would indicate that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the text cites Graves as supporting a trend of cases that have eliminated tax favoritism and that equality of privilege and obligation should be inseparable. The text uses Graves as precedent, showing it to be currently valid and not overruled. 
103869	99097	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case *Brader v. James* multiple times but does not contain language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The case is mentioned and cited as precedent supporting the court's reasoning regarding the taxation of Indian lands and the plenary power of Congress in this area. There is no explicit overruling, nor is there implicit overruling through contradictory language or the establishment of a new legal standard that renders *Brader v. James* inconsistent with current law.
103869	98296	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad v. Harrison* multiple times.  However, it does not state that the case has been overruled. Instead, the text cites *Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad v. Harrison* as precedent along with several other cases that were later overruled by *Helvering v. Producers Corp*.  The fact that other cases in a line of case law were overruled does not necessarily mean *Choctaw, Oklahoma & Gulf Railroad v. Harrison* was also overruled.
103869	98689	no	yes	95	The provided text states that Helvering v. Producers Corp., 303 U.S. 376 (1938) overruled Gillespie v. Oklahoma, and that Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, 240 U.S. 522 (1916) was among the cases which followed the same precedent as Gillespie v. Oklahoma.  Since Helvering v. Producers Corp. overruled Gillespie v. Oklahoma, which Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma followed, it can be inferred that Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma is also overruled by implication.
103869	100916	no	yes	90	The provided text explicitly states that the case *Gillespie v. Oklahoma* was overruled by *Helvering v. Producers Corp*.  While *Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir* is mentioned in the same list of cases, and is grouped with *Gillespie v. Oklahoma*, it is not explicitly stated to be overruled. However, given that *Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir* is listed alongside *Gillespie v. Oklahoma* as sharing the same legal basis, and that *Gillespie v. Oklahoma* was overruled, it's highly probable *Jaybird Mining Co. v. Weir* was implicitly overruled as well, given that the legal principle on which it was based has been overturned. This is based on the principle that overruling one case in a series of cases based on the same principle would likely impact the others unless specifically distinguished. The court mentions that this immunity for lessees was withdrawn in the case overruling *Gillespie v. Oklahoma*. Thus, the overruling is inferred through association and shared legal principle rather than explicit mention. 
103869	99897	no	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that Helvering v. Producers Corp. overruled Gillespie v. Oklahoma.  The phrase "which overruled Gillespie v. Oklahoma, supra" leaves no doubt that Gillespie v. Oklahoma is no longer considered good law in the context of the immunity for lessees of restricted Indian lands from state taxation.
103869	101499	no	no	100	The provided text cites the case *Carpenter v. Shaw* multiple times but does not contain any language that would indicate it has been overruled.  The citations treat *Carpenter v. Shaw* as precedent, supporting the court's interpretation of Indian tax exemptions. There is no mention of overruling, modifying, or limiting its holding in any way. Therefore, based solely on this excerpt, there is no evidence to suggest *Carpenter v. Shaw* has been overruled.
103869	97639	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Choate v. Trapp (224 U.S. 665) several times. However, it does not overrule it. Instead, the court distinguishes Choate v. Trapp, stating that the case's holding regarding the inability of the United States to withdraw a tax exemption once granted "has no bearing on the instant problem." This indicates the court is distinguishing the case based on its facts and not overruling it.
103869	99118	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *McCurdy v. United States*, but it does not overrule it.  The text cites *McCurdy* in support of a discussion of the economic status of Osage Indians. There is no language suggesting that *McCurdy* is no longer good law, in whole or in part, under any circumstances.  The court uses *McCurdy* as precedent, indicating it is still considered valid.
103869	100830	yes	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that Childers v. Beaver was "in effect overruled by the Mountain Producers Corp." case.  This directly satisfies criterion 2 (functionally equivalent language to explicitly overruling) and therefore the case is considered overruled.
103870	103373	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that the decision in Minersville School District v. Gobitis is overruled.  The opinion states, "The decision of this Court in Minersville School District v. Gobitis and the holdings of those few per curiam decisions which preceded and foreshadowed it are overruled, and the judgment enjoining enforcement of the West Virginia Regulation is Affirmed."
103870	102334	no	no	95	The court opinion distinguishes Hamilton v. Regents (1934) on several grounds.  It emphasizes that in Hamilton, attendance at the university was voluntary, whereas in the present case (the case in which the opinion is given), attendance at public schools is not compulsory.  This difference in the voluntariness of attendance forms the basis of the distinction.  The court explicitly states that Hamilton is *not* overruled, but rather distinguished.  The opinion further discusses points of commonality and attempts to reconcile differences between the cases, highlighting the nuances of the different situations and the types of requirements imposed.
103870	100694	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *Pierce v. Society of Sisters* multiple times.  However, in both instances, the Court is distinguishing the case and not overruling it.  The Court explicitly states that *Pierce* is not overruled, and then proceeds to differentiate its holding from the current case based on the fact that West Virginia does not compel attendance at public schools, unlike the situation in *Pierce*.  The Court further uses *Pierce* to support its reasoning by drawing analogies, but does not overturn or limit any aspect of the precedent.
103870	101741	no	no	100	The provided text mentions *Stromberg v. California*, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites *Stromberg* as precedent supporting the idea that displaying a symbol (in that case, a red flag) as a means of peaceful and legal opposition to government is protected speech. The Supreme Court Justice is referencing this case to support their current argument about compelled speech and symbolic expression. There is no language suggesting the overruling, modification, or limitation of *Stromberg v. California* in any way.
103870	103705	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Jones v. Opelika, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt focuses on overruling earlier per curiam decisions and discusses a change of view regarding Minersville School District v. Gobitis.  While the concurrence mentions Jones v. Opelika, it does not state that it is overruled, nor does it offer any language functionally equivalent to overruling.  The opinion uses Jones v. Opelika as a reference point in a discussion about freedom of religion and the limitations of state power, but not as a precedent to be overturned.
103870	102580	no	no	100	The provided text mentions *United States v. Butler*, 297 U.S. 1, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt quotes a dissenting opinion from *Butler* and uses it to support the court's argument about judicial self-restraint. There is no language suggesting the Court intends to overrule, modify, or limit the holding of *Butler* in any way.  The excerpt uses the prior case to support the current court's reasoning, not to overturn it.
103870	103017	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *United States v. Carolene Products Co.* but does not overrule it.  The excerpt quotes a footnote from the case, indicating that the Court acknowledges the case's existence and its point about specific prohibitions in the Bill of Rights. There is no language suggesting overruling, either explicitly or implicitly. The passage focuses on the Court's general role and the equal dignity of various constitutional rights, not on overturning specific precedent.
103870	96087	no	no	95	The provided text quotes Justice Holmes's statement from *Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. May* without indicating that it has been overruled.  The excerpt focuses on the role of the Court versus the legislature, contextualizing Holmes's statement within the broader discussion of the Court's responsibility in constitutional matters. There is no language suggesting the overruling of *Missouri, K. & T. Ry. Co. v. May*, either explicitly or implicitly.
103870	96042	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Rippey v. Texas* as precedent, citing it to support the court's consideration of the "power of the State as a whole."  There is no language suggesting the overruling,  qualifying, or limiting of *Rippey v. Texas* in any way. The citation is used to establish the significance of the case before the court, not to challenge or alter the precedent set by *Rippey v. Texas*. Therefore, there's no indication that *Rippey v. Texas* has been overruled.
103870	103508	no	no	100	The provided text mentions *Skiriotes v. Florida*, but it does not overrule it. The excerpt cites *Skiriotes* as precedent, alongside another case, to emphasize the significance of the court's decision in the case before it.  There is no language suggesting the overruling, modification, or limitation of *Skiriotes* in any way.
103870	102879	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Palko v. Connecticut (302 U.S. 319), but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt quotes Palko, incorporating its language about fundamental principles of liberty and justice. This is an example of the citing case using the cited case as precedent, not overruling it.
103870	91054	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Hurtado v. California (110 U.S. 516) as precedent, citing it to support the idea that the Court's role is to strike down unconstitutional laws and not modify them.  There is no language suggesting the Court is overruling Hurtado. Instead, the opinion uses Hurtado to support its argument, indicating that the case is being followed, not overruled.
103870	96230	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Jacobson v. Massachusetts (1905), citing it as a precedent for compulsory vaccination, alongside other examples of compulsory measures that have been upheld despite religious objections.  There is no language suggesting the Court is overruling, modifying, limiting, or questioning the holding in Jacobson. The mention is to draw a parallel, not to overturn.
103870	1303501	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Stansbury v. Marks*, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt discusses the case as one example among many of situations where the law compels behavior that conflicts with individual religious scruples. This is not an overruling, but rather a contextualization of the precedent within a broader legal principle.
103870	101011	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Farrington v. Tokushige*, 273 U.S. 284, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites the case as precedent regarding parental rights in choosing schools and the limits of state control over private schools. There is no language suggesting the Court intends to overturn or limit the holding of *Farrington v. Tokushige*. The court is engaging in discussion and analysis, using the prior case to support its argument in the current case. There is no indication of overruling, partial overruling, or any of the other conditions that would qualify as overruling.
103870	99296	no	no	95	The excerpt explains the context and meaning of the "clear and present danger" test from *Schenck v. United States*,  but it does not overrule the case.  The excerpt clarifies the limitations of applying the *Schenck* test to situations beyond its original context (speech leading to sedition during wartime). It acknowledges *Schenck* as precedent and quotes it directly but does not challenge its legal standing.
103870	103795	no	no	100	The provided text only mentions the case of *Helvering v. Griffiths* as a source of authority by citing it for further information (note 52).  There is no language suggesting the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
103870	99053	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the Selective Draft Law Cases (245 U.S. 366) as precedent for the assertion that the Nation may raise armies and compel citizens to give military service.  There is no language suggesting the Court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the holding of the Selective Draft Law Cases. The case is cited as supporting the Court's reasoning. Therefore, there is no indication that the case of interest has been overruled.
103915	103633	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Federal Power Commission v. Natural Gas Pipeline Co.* (1942), but never states that the case has been overruled.  While some excerpts discuss and interpret the case's holding, particularly concerning rate-making methodologies, there's no language indicating the Court explicitly overrules it, uses functionally equivalent language, overrules parts of it, limits its application to certain circumstances, distinguishes legal principles within it, or declares it no longer good law in specific contexts.  The citations show the case is being considered as precedent, and its interpretation is debated, not its validity as precedent.
103915	101364	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case *United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission* multiple times.  However, none of the citations indicate that the case has been overruled. The text uses the case as precedent,  discussing it within a longer line of legal reasoning and comparing it to other cases. There is no language suggesting that the court is explicitly overruling *United Fuel Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission*, nor is there any implication of the case being functionally equivalent to overruling.  The excerpt shows the case being used as part of a legal framework, not a repudiated one.
103915	102280	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio* multiple times.  However, it does not contain any language that indicates the case has been overruled. The text cites the case as precedent, indicating its continued relevance. There is no explicit overruling, implicit overruling through functionally equivalent language, partial overruling, or any qualification of the case's application to specific circumstances.
103915	102091	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission*, but does not overrule it.  The citing opinion references the case multiple times, using phrases like "Cf." (confer, meaning 'compare'), indicating that the court is drawing a comparison or analogy, not overruling the precedent.  There is no language suggesting the court intends to overturn, modify, or limit the holding of *Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp*. The court uses the case to support its argument on the methodology of rate-making, showing that the focus is on the result, not the process, which aligns with *Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp*. Thus, the cited case is used to illustrate a point of comparison. 
103915	102270	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission* several times. However, none of the mentions indicate that the case has been overruled.  The excerpts cite the case as precedent, showing that its principles were considered relevant to the current case, but don't suggest any overruling or modification of its holdings.
103915	92743	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota*, but it does not overrule the case.  Instead, the court mentions the case as precedent, specifically referencing its holding that the judiciary, not the legislature, has the final say in constitutional matters regarding utility regulation.  The court notes Congressional acquiescence to this doctrine but does not challenge or overrule it.  The opinion uses the case to support the argument for judicial review of the Federal Power Commission's rate-setting authority, not to overturn the precedent set by *Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota*. Therefore, there is no indication that the cited case has been overruled.
103915	101492	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that it "cannot approve the contrary holding of United Railways Co. v. West, 280 U.S. 234", thus directly overruling the cited case.  The reasoning behind the overruling is explained in the context of the discussion of depreciation and rate orders.
103927	95840	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *The Osceola*, and in the final section, the court states that it "prefers to follow the latter [referencing *The Osceola* and other cases] as the more consonant with principle and authority."  This indicates the court is affirming *The Osceola*, not overruling it.  While the court disapproves of a statement from *The Pinar Del Rio* that supports assumptions inconsistent with *The Osceola*, this is not an overruling of *The Osceola* itself. The court explicitly states it is following *The Osceola*. 
103927	100007	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger*, often using terms like "supra" to indicate that it is being used as precedent.  In one instance, the court states it "prefers to follow" *Carlisle Packing*, indicating agreement and not overruling.  There is no language suggesting that *Carlisle Packing* is overruled, even partially, or no longer good law in any specific context. The court distinguishes the case from *The Pinar Del Rio*, but this is a distinction, not an overruling. Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled.
103927	103121	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. v. Smith* multiple times. However,  it is cited as precedent and not overruled.  In one instance, the dissenting opinion suggests that *Socony-Vacuum* might have overruled *Plamals v. The Pinar Del Rio*, but this is explicitly stated as being incorrect within the text. There is no language suggesting that *Socony-Vacuum* itself was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
103927	101292	yes	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Plamals v. S.S. "Pinar Del Rio"*, but does not overrule it.  While the court discusses the case and its application in relation to the current case, there is no language indicating that *Plamals* is overruled,  nor is there any indication that the court intends to limit *Plamals*'s application in certain circumstances. The court notes that both lower courts held themselves "bound by *The Pinar Del Rio*," suggesting that *Plamals* is still considered valid precedent.  The opinion focuses on whether the lower courts correctly applied *Plamals* to the facts of the instant case, not on whether *Plamals* itself is good law.
103927	102648	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Arizona v. Anelich* multiple times as precedent, and there is no language suggesting it has been overruled, in whole or in part.  The text uses phrases such as "supra" and explicitly refers to *Arizona v. Anelich* as supporting the court's reasoning. This indicates the court considered it as good law and followed the precedent established in that case. There is no mention of overruling, modification, or limiting the application of *Arizona v. Anelich*. Therefore, there's no basis to conclude that it has been overruled.
103916	101696	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Carbice Corp. of America v. American Patents Development Corp.*  However, there is no language suggesting it was overruled.  The opinions reference the case as precedent, applying its principles in later cases or distinguishing it from the current case.  While some opinions discuss the evolution of patent law and its interaction with antitrust concerns, none of these discussions constitute an overruling of *Carbice*. The court discusses the Carbice doctrine, sometimes agreeing and sometimes disagreeing with its application in specific scenarios, but does not challenge the validity of the original ruling itself.
103916	97018	yes	no	95	The provided text does not overrule *Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 2)*. While the opinion expresses disagreement with the case's decision, it does not explicitly overrule it nor does it use language that is functionally equivalent to overruling the case.  The author states "One may disagree with the decision of this court in *Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co. (No. 2)*,...but, accepting the premise that such conduct was infringement,...", which indicates consideration of the precedent but not its overruling. The opinion clarifies and potentially modifies the application of *Leeds & Catlin*, but stops short of overruling it. 
103916	102889	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Leitch Mfg. Co. v. Barber Co.* within a discussion of a case involving patent infringement and antitrust laws.  The court cites *Leitch* alongside another case, *Carbice Corp. v. American Patents Corp.*, indicating that neither case barred recovery in the matter before the court.  This is not an overruling; it's a case where *Leitch* was considered, and its application was deemed inapplicable to the specific circumstances of the current case. There is no language suggesting that *Leitch* is no longer good law, explicitly or implicitly overruled, or qualified in any way.
103916	98917	no	no	100	The provided text states that *Henry v. A.B. Dick Co.* was overruled by *Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Manufacturing Co*.  The text cites *Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Manufacturing Co.* as precedent in multiple cases, indicating that it was not itself overruled.  The passage does not contain any language suggesting that *Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Manufacturing Co.* was overruled, qualified, or limited in any way. Therefore, there is no indication that the case was overruled.
103916	103578	no	no	95	The provided text cites B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis alongside other cases, stating that the Court has consistently held a certain principle.  There is no language suggesting that B.B. Chemical Co. v. Ellis is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text uses the case as precedent, showing it is considered good law in the relevant context.
103916	103678	no	no	100	The provided text cites *United States v. Masonite Corp.* multiple times.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case was overruled. The citations use the case as precedent, supporting the court's statements about patent law.  There is no language indicating the case is no longer good law, even partially or under certain circumstances. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that *United States v. Masonite Corp.* was overruled.
103962	103531	no	no	90	The excerpt states that the court granted certiorari to resolve a claimed inconsistency between Grovey v. Townsend and United States v. Classic.  The opinion discusses how United States v. Classic held that Congress could regulate primary elections when they are made an integral part of the election machinery.  However, it explicitly states that the Classic case did not directly cut into the rationale of Grovey v. Townsend and that Grovey v. Townsend was not overruled.  A dissenting opinion expresses concern about the overruling of Grovey v. Townsend but does not state that United States v. Classic overruled it.  While there is discussion of the relationship between the two cases and how Classic might impact Grovey's application, there's no explicit overruling or language functionally equivalent to it in the provided text. The dissenting judge's concern about *sub silentio* overruling is not supported by the majority opinion which explicitly addresses both cases without implying an overruling of Grovey v. Townsend.
103962	102431	yes	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that "Grovey v. Townsend is overruled."  This directly satisfies condition 1 for a case being overruled. The court explicitly states that it is overruling the prior decision, and this is done in the context of revisiting the constitutional principle established in Grovey v. Townsend rather than interpreting the constitution itself. Therefore, the confidence level is high.
103962	101911	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Nixon v. Condon (286 U.S. 73) as precedent.  It is referenced and discussed within the context of later cases dealing with similar issues of racial discrimination in voting, but there's no indication that it has been overruled, fully or partially. The later cases discuss, analyze, and apply the principles established in Nixon v. Condon.  They do not overturn, modify, or limit its holding. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, there's no evidence suggesting Nixon v. Condon has been overruled.
103962	3981612	no	no	100	The provided text cites the case *Bell v. Hill* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled. The citing case refers to *Bell v. Hill* to support its arguments. Therefore there is no basis to consider *Bell v. Hill* overruled.
104285	101446	yes	no	90	The provided text discusses the Schwimmer case and its related cases (Macintosh and Bland), mentioning that the court granted certiorari to re-examine the authorities in these cases.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Schwimmer* itself was explicitly overruled.  Instead, the text suggests that the court's interpretation of the oath of allegiance in those cases is being reconsidered in light of a new situation. The dissenting opinion references the Schwimmer case as precedent that should be upheld, showing that it was still considered relevant to the legal question at hand. Therefore, there is no evidence that United States v. Schwimmer (1929) was overruled.
104285	101765	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that it granted certiorari to re-examine the authorities in *United States v. Schwimmer*, *United States v. Macintosh*, and *United States v. Bland*.  The fact that the court is re-examining these cases implies that it is overruling the precedent set by them, including *United States v. Macintosh*.  The decision to reverse the lower court's ruling, which was based on the precedent set in *United States v. Macintosh*, further supports this conclusion. The dissenting opinion acknowledges that the lower court applied earlier interpretations of statutes that were later confirmed by Congress. This implicitly agrees that the court is now reinterpreting these laws and overruling previous rulings.
104285	101766	yes	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the court granted certiorari to re-examine the authorities in *United States v. Schwimmer*, *United States v. Macintosh*, and *United States v. Bland*.  The fact that the court explicitly states it is re-examining the prior precedent strongly suggests that those cases, including *United States v. Bland*, are being overruled or at least their application modified.  The later mention of the court reversing the lower court's decision further supports this conclusion. The dissenting opinion also references the three cases as having been decided 15 years prior and implies that the court's current decision is changing the interpretation of those cases.
104285	103367	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader* as support for the idea that congressional silence or inaction regarding judicial interpretation of a statute can imply legislative acceptance of that interpretation.  The court does not state that *Apex Hosiery* is incorrect or overruled. Instead, it uses the case as precedent to support its own argument about congressional intent. Therefore, there is no indication that *Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader* was overruled.
104380	3663548	no	no	95	The provided text describes the case *Bullington v. Angel* and its subsequent review.  The Supreme Court's decision in *Bullington v. Angel* is discussed, but there is no indication that it was overruled. The text focuses on whether the North Carolina statute barring deficiency judgments violated the US Constitution, not on overruling precedent.  Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Bullington v. Angel* was overruled.
104380	1116658	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Guaranty Trust Co. v. York*, referencing its holding regarding the application of state law in diversity cases.  However, there is no language suggesting the case has been overruled.  The text uses *Guaranty Trust Co. v. York* as precedent, applying its principles in the current case. There is no discussion of any limitations or exceptions to the *Guaranty Trust* decision, which would be expected if it was being overruled or modified.
104380	97674	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that cases like Lupton's Sons Co. v. Automobile Club are obsolete insofar as they are based on a view of diversity jurisdiction which came to an end with Erie Railroad v. Tompkins.  This directly satisfies condition 6 (The Court states that the case is no longer good law in certain contexts) for overruling a case. The court's statement that the case is obsolete in the context of the view of diversity jurisdiction is a functional equivalent of explicitly overruling it.
104380	103012	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Erie Railroad v. Tompkins*, referencing its impact on diversity jurisdiction and the application of state law in federal courts.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Erie Railroad v. Tompkins* itself is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpts highlight that the case's principles are being followed and applied as precedent in the current case.  Therefore, there's no indication of overruling.
2764117	104139	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Williams v. North Carolina (1945), but never indicates it has been overruled.  The citing opinions distinguish the facts of the case at bar from Williams, and in some instances, utilize Williams to support their reasoning. There is no language suggesting that the Court intends to overrule, modify, or limit the precedent set by Williams v. North Carolina (1945).
2764117	103096	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Stoll v. Gottlieb* as precedent,  supporting its legal reasoning regarding res judicata and jurisdictional questions.  There is no language suggesting the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The citations are used to reinforce the court's position, indicating that *Stoll v. Gottlieb* remains relevant and good law in this context.
2764117	103736	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Williams v. North Carolina (1942) 317 U.S. 287,  as precedent.  In one instance, a footnote (Note 1) specifically references a later case, Williams v. North Carolina (1945) 325 U.S. 226, which is not considered to have overruled the prior case but rather offers further consideration and commentary. There is no language in the excerpts that explicitly overrules, modifies or qualifies the 1942 Williams decision; instead, the 1942 case is consistently cited as authority.
2764117	103084	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Davis v. Davis*, but does not overrule it.  One section argues that *Davis v. Davis* is not contrary authority because the Court's decision in that case was based on the fact that the state granting the divorce was, in fact, the domicile of the plaintiff.  The passage also points out that *Davis v. Davis* cited *Andrews v. Andrews*, a case that has since been cited respectfully in other cases.  This suggests that *Davis v. Davis* is not considered overruled, but rather distinguished or interpreted within a specific context.
2764117	103236	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co.* multiple times but does not contain any language suggesting that it has been overruled.  The case is cited as precedent alongside other cases related to res judicata and jurisdictional facts in divorce decrees. There is no indication of the court explicitly overruling it, using functionally equivalent language, overruling part of it, limiting its application to certain circumstances, distinguishing its treatment of legal principles, or declaring it no longer good law in specific contexts.  Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no evidence to suggest that *Treinies v. Sunshine Mining Co.* has been overruled.
2764117	95768	yes	no	95	The provided text mentions Andrews v. Andrews multiple times.  In one instance, the court explicitly states that *Williams v. North Carolina* cites *Andrews v. Andrews* with respect, indicating no intention to overrule it.  Further, the opinion notes that *Andrews v. Andrews* is cited in another case, showing it is still considered relevant precedent. While the court discusses the case in the context of Full Faith and Credit and domicile issues in divorce proceedings, there's no language suggesting overruling, modification, or limitation of the case's holding. Therefore, there is no evidence suggesting *Andrews v. Andrews* has been overruled.
2764117	98932	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Chicago Life Insurance Co. v. Cherry* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled. The case is cited as precedent, implying it is still considered valid.  There is no indication of explicit overruling, functional equivalence to overruling, partial overruling, overruling in specific circumstances, distinction of legal principles, or statements that the case is no longer good law in specific contexts. Therefore, based on the provided text, there's no evidence that *Chicago Life Insurance Co. v. Cherry* has been overruled.
2764117	101758	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Baldwin v. Iowa State Traveling Men's Assn. (1931) multiple times, citing it as precedent.  There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court mentions the case alongside other cases supporting its decision, indicating it is being followed, not overruled.
2764117	103264	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Chicot County Drainage District v. Baxter State Bank* several times, but it does not contain any language suggesting that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the case is cited as precedent supporting the application of the doctrine of res judicata to questions of jurisdiction.  There is no explicit overruling, nor is there any language functionally equivalent to overruling it (such as suggesting it is no longer good law). The court is applying its principles, not overturning them.
104704	104459	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule Caldarola v. Eckert (1947).  While the opinion in Cosmopolitan Shipping Co. v. McAllister discusses Caldarola v. Eckert extensively, analyzing its implications regarding liability under the Jones Act, it does not explicitly overrule it.  The court clarifies the implications of Caldarola's holding concerning the liability of general agents, but it does not state that Caldarola is no longer good law or that it is overruled, in whole or in part.  The court distinguishes Caldarola from the Hust case but ultimately accepts the reasoning in Caldarola as sound.
104704	104320	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly rejects the reasoning in Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines.  The opinion states that the reasoning in the later Caldarola case, which the court accepts as sound, necessitates the rejection of the basis of the Hust case.  The court identifies specific flaws in Hust's reasoning, particularly concerning the interpretation of the Brady case and the effect of the Clarification Act. The court finds that Hust's conclusion arises from a misconception of the Brady case and misinterprets the legislative purpose behind the Clarification Act. Therefore, the court implicitly overrules Hust, stating that the reasoning in Hust is unsound in light of Caldarola and a proper understanding of the relevant statutes.  The court further notes that the Hust case's reliance on the election of remedies granted to seamen under the Clarification Act was based on a mistaken understanding of the Brady case and a misinterpretation of the legislative intent of the Clarification Act.
104704	1476725	no	no	95	The provided text does not contain any language suggesting that McAllister v. Cosmopolitan Shipping Co. (1948) has been overruled.  The excerpt discusses the case and its relation to other cases (Hust v. Moore-McCormack Lines and Caldarola v. Eckert), but it does not state that McAllister has been overruled, nor does it offer language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The court analyzes the legal reasoning in McAllister and other related cases, but this analysis does not constitute an overruling.
104704	103979	no	no	95	The provided text explicitly overrules the case *Hust*, not the case of interest, *National Labor Relations Board v. Hearst Publications, Inc*. While the case of interest is mentioned, there is no indication that it was overruled.
104704	104389	no	no	95	The provided text cites *American Stevedores v. Porello* multiple times but does not overrule it.  The citing opinion uses the case as precedent in its discussion of the Jones Act and the interpretation of employment contracts. There is no language suggesting that the cited case has been overturned, qualified, or limited in its application.  The opinion uses the case to support its reasoning, treating *American Stevedores v. Porello* as good law.
104704	103761	no	no	95	The court's discussion of Brady v. Roosevelt Steamship Co. clarifies its holding.  The excerpt explains that Brady only addressed whether the Suits in Admiralty Act made private operators nonsuable for their torts, not the right to recover against employers under the Jones Act. The court states that the Hust case's reliance on Brady was a misconception.  Therefore, Brady is not overruled; its holding is simply being narrowed and clarified in its application to the specific context of the Jones Act and employer liability. The court distinguishes Brady's application to the facts before it, not overrules it.
104610	103522	no	no	85	The provided text states that the Court's holding and opinion in Olsen v. Nebraska undermined Adams v. Tanner.  It also mentions that the due process clause does not ban legislative power to fix prices, wages, and hours, as was assumed in other cases. However, there is no explicit statement that Olsen v. Nebraska itself is overruled.  The passage describes how the legal precedent of Olsen, along with other cases, was superseded by later decisions.  This is a shift in legal thinking, but not an explicit overruling of Olsen v. Nebraska.
104610	102784	no	no	95	The provided text states that the principle that wages and hours can be fixed by law is "no longer doubted since West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish".  This indicates the case is still considered valid precedent and has not been overruled.  The passage discusses other cases that have built upon or clarified the legal principles established in *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish*, but does not suggest it has been overturned.
104610	3648247	no	no	95	The provided text mentions State v. Whitaker (1947) among other cases. However, there is no language suggesting that it has been overruled.  The text simply lists the case as one of several relevant cases considered by the court. There's no indication of explicit overruling, functional equivalence to overruling, partial overruling, overruling in certain circumstances, distinction of legal principles, or declaration that it is no longer good law in certain contexts.
104610	104041	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Wallace Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, but it does not overrule it.  The court cites the case (cf. Wallace Corporation v. Labor Board, 323 U.S. 248), but it does not offer any analysis or critique that would suggest an overruling. The excerpt's focus is on rejecting appellants' contention, not on directly addressing or overturning the legal precedent established in Wallace Corp.
104610	102167	no	no	95	The excerpt cites Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell (1934) as supporting precedent in relation to a challenge under Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution, which concerns impairment of contracts.  The citing opinion states that the contention challenging the state laws' compatibility with Article I, Section 10 is 'without merit' and that this is 'too clearly established to require discussion'.  The opinion then cites Home Building & Loan Assn. v. Blaisdell as direct support for this conclusion.  This is a clear instance of the citing court following the precedent set in Blaisdell; it does not overrule it in any way.
104610	103342	no	no	95	The provided text cites Veix v. Sixth Ward Bldg. & Loan Assn., 310 U.S. 32, as precedent supporting the court's conclusion that a certain constitutional contention is without merit.  There is no language suggesting that Veix has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinion uses Veix to support its argument, indicating that the court considered Veix to be good law at the time of the opinion.
104610	104191	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *East New York Savings Bank v. Hahn* but does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites the case as supporting the court's conclusion that a contention related to the impairment of contracts under Article I, Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution is without merit. This is a use of the case as precedent, not an overruling.
104610	97368	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad v. McGuire* as precedent.  The court's analysis references the case to support its reasoning regarding the constitutionality of state laws prohibiting employment discrimination. There is no language suggesting the Court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the *McGuire* decision in any way. Instead, the Court appears to be following the precedent set by *McGuire*. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, there is no indication that *Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad v. McGuire* was overruled.
104610	102614	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Bayside Fish Flour Co. v. Gentry*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt uses the case as precedent to support its argument about the validity of state laws prohibiting employer discrimination. There is no language suggesting the Court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the holding of *Bayside Fish Flour Co. v. Gentry* in any way. The citing opinion explicitly states that the cited case supports the current court's conclusion.
104610	98279	no	no	100	The provided text mentions *Sage v. Hampe*, but does not overrule it.  The passage cites *Sage v. Hampe* as supporting the court's reasoning regarding the validity of contract prohibitions in the context of state laws against employer discrimination. There is no language suggesting that *Sage v. Hampe* is overruled, modified, distinguished, or no longer good law in any context.
104610	96764	yes	no	90	The excerpt describes the holding in *Adair v. United States* (1907) and mentions that there were strong dissents in the case.  It also explains that the Supreme Court later considered cases related to union discrimination and the use of yellow dog contracts.  However, the excerpt does not state that *Adair* was overruled.  Instead, it sets the stage for explaining subsequent legal developments that ultimately may have led to a different approach to the issue but does not explicitly overrule it.
104610	96276	no	no	80	The text describes Lochner v. New York as the basis for several subsequent Supreme Court decisions (Adair v. United States and Coppage v. Kansas) that were later overturned.  However, the excerpt does not state that *Lochner* itself was explicitly overruled.  While the text notes that the "Allgeyer-Lochner-Adair-Coppage constitutional doctrine was for some years followed by this Court," and that it was used to strike down various laws, it doesn't say the Court explicitly reversed *Lochner*. The passage highlights the later rejection of the legal principles established in *Lochner*, but doesn't directly state its overruling.
104610	94631	no	no	90	The provided text does not explicitly overrule *Allgeyer v. Louisiana*.  While the text discusses *Allgeyer* in the context of a line of cases (*Allgeyer*, *Lochner*, *Adair*, *Coppage*) that were later overturned, it does not state that *Allgeyer* itself has been overruled. The passage notes that the constitutional doctrine stemming from this line of cases was later rejected, but this is not the same as directly overruling *Allgeyer*. The passage highlights that *Allgeyer* was a basis for later decisions which *were* overruled, not that *Allgeyer* was itself directly overturned.
104610	98337	yes	yes	95	The excerpt describes how the "Allgeyer-Lochner-Adair-Coppage constitutional doctrine" was later used to strike down various laws but was eventually overturned.  The passage explicitly states that the principles established in cases like *Coppage v. Kansas*, which upheld the freedom to contract, were eventually rejected by the Court. While not explicitly stating "Coppage v. Kansas* is overruled", the description of its core tenets being overturned implicitly signifies that *Coppage v. Kansas* is no longer good law. This satisfies condition 2 and 6 for overruling a case.
104610	103344	no	no	90	The provided text mentions *Osborn v. Ozlin* as a case that followed the Allgeyer-Lochner-Adair-Coppage constitutional doctrine.  The text goes on to state that the *Olsen v. Nebraska* case undermined *Adams v. Tanner*, which relied on the same constitutional philosophy. However, there is no indication that *Osborn v. Ozlin* itself was overruled. The passage describes a shift in legal precedent away from the doctrine that *Osborn v. Ozlin* followed, but it does not explicitly overrule *Osborn v. Ozlin* or use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.
104610	98999	no	yes	90	The excerpt explicitly states that the holding and opinion in Olsen v. Nebraska undermined Adams v. Tanner.  While not explicitly stating "overruled", the phrasing "clearly undermined" indicates that the precedent set in Adams v. Tanner is no longer considered valid in the context of the Olsen v. Nebraska decision. This meets the criteria for considering a case overruled, specifically criterion 6: The Court states that the case is no longer good law in certain contexts.
104610	100246	no	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the holding and opinion in Olsen v. Nebraska undermined Adams v. Tanner, a case cited by appellants alongside Chas. Wolff Packing Co.  Furthermore, the excerpt explicitly discusses how the due process clause, as interpreted in Wolff, was later rejected in subsequent cases like Nebbia v. New York, West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, United States v. Darby, and Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board. These later cases established that the due process clause does not prohibit legislative power to fix prices, wages, and hours, directly contradicting the assumptions made in the Wolff case.  The court's discussion clearly indicates that the principles of Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations are no longer good law regarding wage and hour regulations and price fixing, thus it has been overruled.
104610	100628	no	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the due process philosophy in *Wolff Packing Co.* has been rejected, starting at least as early as 1934 with the *Nebbia* case.  It further explains that the holding in *Wolff Packing Co.* that the due process clause bans legislative power to fix prices, wages, and hours, has been overturned by subsequent cases such as *Nebbia v. New York*, *Olsen v. Nebraska*, *West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish*, *United States v. Darby*, and *Phelps Dodge Corp. v. Labor Board*.  The excerpt directly points out that the "distinction between businesses according to whether they were or were not 'clothed with a public interest'", a key element of the *Wolff Packing Co.* decision, was rejected in *Nebbia v. New York*. Therefore,  *Wolff Packing Co.*'s core holdings are no longer considered good law.
104610	102224	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule Nebbia v. New York.  Instead, the excerpt discusses Nebbia and cites it as settling the question of whether the due process clause bans legislative power to fix prices.  The passage highlights that the Court's position, starting from the Nebbia decision in 1934, has moved away from the due process philosophy in earlier cases like Adair and Coppage.  It uses Nebbia as a precedent to support this evolution, not to overturn it.
104610	103442	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *United States v. Darby* as a case that supports the proposition that wages and hours can be fixed by law.  It is cited as part of a line of cases that moved away from a stricter interpretation of the due process clause. There is no language suggesting that *United States v. Darby* was overruled, qualified, or limited in any way. The text uses the case as precedent to support a legal argument.
104610	103518	no	no	100	The provided text mentions *Phelps Dodge Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board* (1941) as a case that supports the proposition that wages and hours can be fixed by law.  The text does not contain language suggesting that the case was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. Instead, the excerpt cites *Phelps Dodge* as a precedent supporting the rejection of earlier due process interpretations and the upholding of state legislative power to regulate business practices. Therefore, there is no indication that *Phelps Dodge* has been overruled.
104610	103870	no	no	100	The provided text mentions *West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette* (1943) as precedent regarding the applicability of the First Amendment to state action through the Fourteenth Amendment.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court cites the case to support its argument, indicating that it is being followed, not overruled.
104641	102539	yes	yes	95	The excerpt states that the Court is considering whether prior decisions, including *Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries*, have been "so undermined by later decisions...that they should now be overruled."  The opinion then goes on to discuss the evolution of legal precedent and ultimately establishes a new legal framework that effectively overrules the prior precedent set in *Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries*. Although not explicitly stating that *Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries* is overruled, the court's reasoning and ultimate decision implicitly overrule it by establishing a new standard that contradicts the holding of the cited case.
104641	102986	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly mentions *Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp*.  However, the text focuses on how *Helvering* has been used to argue for the overruling of prior cases (specifically *Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co*, *Large Oil Co. v. Howard*, and *Oklahoma v. Barnsdall Refineries*) which dealt with the taxation of lessees of mineral rights on Indian lands.  The court does not explicitly overrule *Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp*, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The court considers the implications of *Helvering*, acknowledging a "retreat" from prior ideas about intergovernmental immunity from taxation, but it does not overturn *Helvering* itself. Instead, it uses *Helvering* as a basis to reconsider and potentially modify previous decisions regarding state taxes on lessees of Indian lands, which is a separate issue. Therefore, while the court engages in a re-evaluation of related precedent, *Helvering v. Mountain Producers Corp* itself remains unaffected.
104641	98296	yes	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that the case *Choctaw, O. & G.R. Co. v. Harrison* is overruled.  The court explicitly states: "...since the decisions in Choctaw, O. & G.R. Co. v. Harrison, <caseOfInterest>supra</caseOfInterest>, and Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma, supra, rest upon the same foundations as those underlying the Gipsy Oil, Large Oil and Barnsdall Refineries decisions, indeed supplied those foundations, we think they too should be, and they now are, overruled." This directly satisfies condition 1 for overruling a case.
104641	102861	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *James v. Dravo Contracting Co.*  It does not contain any language explicitly overruling it, nor does it employ language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  While the text discusses the evolution of legal principles related to the case, it never declares *James v. Dravo* to be overruled, no longer good law, or only applicable in certain contexts. The citations suggest that *James v. Dravo* is still considered relevant legal precedent, at least in some contexts. Therefore, based on the text alone, there is no evidence to suggest that *James v. Dravo Contracting Co.* has been overruled.
104641	98689	yes	yes	95	The provided text shows that the Supreme Court, in later cases, rejected the construction of the gross production tax in *Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co. v. Oklahoma*, invalidating the tax in memorandum opinions citing the case.  Furthermore, the court noted that a statutory change was considered immaterial, suggesting that the original holding in *Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co.* was no longer controlling.  The court's later decisions implicitly overruled the precedent set by *Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co.* by adopting a different approach to the taxation of lessees of restricted Indian lands. This is evident in the court's discussion of the *Mountain Producers* case, which effectively repudiated the reasoning of *Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co*. While not explicitly stating that *Indian Territory Illuminating Oil Co.* is overruled, the subsequent decisions' actions and language are functionally equivalent to an overruling.

105014	98362	yes	no	95	The snippets cite Mutual Film Corp. v. Industrial Comm'n multiple times.  However, the citing opinions do not explicitly overrule it, nor do they use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The Supreme Court in Burstyn v. Wilson references Mutual Film, but it is used to make a distinction rather than to show that Mutual Film is overruled.  The court in Burstyn v. Wilson distinguishes motion pictures from other forms of press, and finds that the earlier precedent in Mutual Film does not fully apply to the facts in this case, while not explicitly overruling it. Therefore, it is not overruled.
105014	101773	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Near v. Minnesota* and discusses its principles regarding prior restraint and freedom of the press.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Near v. Minnesota* has been overruled, either fully or partially.  The citing opinions acknowledge *Near* as precedent and elaborate upon its principles in the context of the case at hand.  The Court references specific aspects of the *Near* decision, such as the statement about the limitation of prior restraint being recognized only in exceptional cases,  but it does not indicate disagreement or overturn of that holding.
105014	102991	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Lovell v. City of Griffin*, but it does not contain language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The citations are used to support the court's reasoning, demonstrating that *Lovell* remains relevant precedent. There is no mention of overruling the case, either explicitly or implicitly through equivalent language or qualification.
105014	104623	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Kovacs v. Cooper (1949) multiple times.  In paragraph [20], the court cites Kovacs v. Cooper to support the proposition that ordinances censoring speech or religious practices before permitting their exercise are unconstitutional.  This is not an overruling; instead, the court appears to be distinguishing between the types of speech restrictions at issue in Kovacs v. Cooper and the ones in the case before it.  The court is not rejecting or modifying the holding in Kovacs v. Cooper; rather, it is applying the precedent in a different context.  There is no language indicating the court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the applicability of Kovacs v. Cooper.
105014	103355	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Cantwell v. Connecticut*, but it does not contain any language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The excerpts only use the case as precedent, quoting Justice Roberts' opinion and illustrating its relevance to the current case's discussion of religious freedom.  There is no indication of overruling, modification, or limitation of *Cantwell v. Connecticut* in any way. 
105014	102601	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *Grosjean v. American Press Co.* multiple times as precedent in the legal reasoning.  There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The case is cited alongside other cases to support the court's argument, indicating it's being used as valid precedent.  Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that *Grosjean v. American Press Co.* has been overruled.
105014	2568568	no	no	-1	EMPTY_EXCERPTS
104965	96482	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that the rationale of cases such as Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky (202 U.S. 409) was rejected in Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co. (336 U.S. 169).  The court explains that the "earlier view" regarding the taxability of vessels moving in inland waters, exemplified by Ayer & Lord, was superseded by the holding in Ott, which established a different standard for taxing vessels engaged in interstate commerce.  Therefore, Ayer & Lord Tie Co. v. Kentucky is overruled implicitly, at least in part, by the rejection of its rationale.
104965	93124	no	no	95	The excerpt discusses Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania in the context of how it was applied in Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co.  The court in the excerpt clarifies that the rationale of earlier cases (which included Pullman) regarding the taxability of vessels was rejected in Ott.  The Ott case established a new standard for taxing vessels engaged in interstate commerce, using a formula for apportionment.  The excerpt does not state that Pullman's Palace Car Co. v. Pennsylvania itself was overruled, only that its reasoning was rejected in the specific context of taxing vessels involved in interstate commerce on inland waterways. The court distinguishes the situations and applies a different standard based on the domicile of the vessels' owner, rather than explicitly overruling Pullman. Therefore, Pullman is not overruled.
104965	96299	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that the rationale of cases like Old Dominion S.S. Co. v. Virginia (which governed the taxability of vessels moving in inland waters) was rejected in Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co.  The Ott case established a new standard for taxing vessels in interstate commerce, effectively overruling the precedent set by Old Dominion and similar cases.  The court explicitly notes that it placed inland water transportation on the same constitutional footing as other interstate enterprises, implying a direct rejection of the previous legal standard.
104965	96495	no	no	95	The snippets do not overrule *New York Ex Rel. New York Central & Hudson River Railroad v. Miller*. Instead, the court distinguishes the cited case based on its facts.  The court notes that in *Miller*, it did not appear that "any specific cars or any average of cars" were so continuously in another state as to be taxable there.  The current case is differentiated because "most, if not all, of the barges and boats which Ohio has taxed were almost continuously outside Ohio during the taxable year."  This distinction shows that the court is not overruling *Miller*, but rather limiting its application to situations with different factual circumstances. The court acknowledges *Miller* as precedent but finds it inapplicable to the current case due to the factual differences regarding the location of the taxed property.
104965	88336	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that the rationale of cases such as St. Louis v. Ferry Co. was rejected in Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co.  This rejection constitutes an overruling, as the court adopts a new standard for taxing vessels in interstate commerce, implicitly invalidating the prior precedent set by St. Louis v. Ferry Co..  The court's adoption of a new standard directly contradicts the previous understanding of taxability, effectively overruling the prior case.
104965	104628	no	no	95	The court's discussion of *Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line Co.* clarifies its application and distinguishes it from the present case based on the domiciliary status of the owner and the lack of apportionment of the tax in the present case.  The court does not explicitly overrule *Ott*, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Instead, the court finds *Ott* inapplicable to the specific facts before it, emphasizing that *Ott* involved a tax by a non-domiciliary state, which required apportionment. The present case, however, involves a domiciliary state seeking to tax the whole value of the vessels.  This distinction demonstrates that *Ott* remains good law but simply isn't controlling in this different factual scenario.
104965	103990	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes the case *Northwest Airlines, Inc. v. Minnesota* (1944) in relation to other cases and its application to the current case involving taxation of vessels.  The excerpt explains the court's reasoning in *Northwest Airlines*, highlighting that the lack of a taxing situs elsewhere allowed Minnesota to tax the entire fleet. The current case is distinguished from *Northwest Airlines* based on the continuous absence of the vessels from the domiciliary state. However, there is no language suggesting that *Northwest Airlines* has been overruled, explicitly or implicitly.  The citing opinion uses *Northwest Airlines* as precedent and distinguishes it based on the facts; this does not constitute overruling. 
104965	96335	no	no	95	The provided text cites Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky.  The text does not explicitly overrule the case, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Instead, the Court distinguishes the case's application to the current facts.  The Court notes that *Union Refrigerator Transit* is inapplicable to the current case because the boats in the current case were operating in other waters, which could lead to apportionment-based taxation by other states. This distinction avoids directly overruling the precedent, but limits its applicability.  Therefore, the case has not been overruled.
105319	103173	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission*, 306 U.S. 493, multiple times.  However, none of the mentions indicate that the case has been overruled. The text discusses the case's holding and contrasts it with other cases, particularly discussing its departure from *Bradford Electric Co. v. Clapper*.  The Supreme Court here engages in legal analysis comparing and contrasting this case with others, but there is no language suggesting the overruling of *Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission*. Therefore, based on the provided text, there's no evidence to suggest that *Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission* has been overruled.
105319	101915	yes	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper* multiple times.  It is discussed in relation to the Full Faith and Credit Clause and workmen's compensation, with later cases such as *Pacific Employers Insurance Co. v. Commission* departing from aspects of its holding. However, there is no explicit statement that *Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper* is overruled, nor is there language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The text analyzes and distinguishes the case, but this does not constitute overruling.  Instead, it shows how subsequent rulings have modified or refined the application of the principles established in *Bradford*. Therefore, it is concluded that the case has not been overruled.
105319	102412	no	no	95	The excerpts mention Broderick v. Rosner multiple times and cite it as precedent.  In one instance, the court distinguishes its holding in the present case from the holding in Broderick v. Rosner, suggesting that Broderick v. Rosner is still good law in certain contexts, but not necessarily overruled. The opinion also lists Broderick v. Rosner among cases dealing with Full Faith and Credit Clause, indicating it is still relevant in that area of the law.  There is no language suggesting that Broderick v. Rosner has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. 
105319	3526916	no	no	100	The provided text does not overrule Bunner v. Patti.  Instead, the text cites Bunner v. Patti multiple times as precedent to support the argument that under Missouri law, a prime contractor is not liable as a third party for negligence to an employee of a subcontractor. The citing case uses Bunner v. Patti to explain existing Missouri law, not to overturn it.
105319	104916	no	no	95	The provided text distinguishes the present case from Hughes v. Fetter, but does not overrule it.  The opinion explains that Hughes v. Fetter dealt with a situation where the forum state sought to exclude actions arising under a foreign statute, while the current case involves a different set of circumstances. This is a distinction, not an overruling. The citing case uses Hughes v. Fetter to clarify its reasoning and show that the current situation is different, but it doesn't state or imply that Hughes v. Fetter is no longer good law or should not be followed.
105525	93107	no	no	85	The provided text repeatedly cites *In re Ross*, but does not explicitly overrule it.  While the opinion criticizes the reasoning and historical context of *In re Ross*, suggesting it would not be decided similarly today, and notes that some aspects of its holding are no longer good law, it stops short of explicitly overruling it.  The author states that *In re Ross* and related cases "do not control or even embarrass the problem before us", suggesting that the precedent is not directly applicable to the current case, but not overruling it. The opinion calls for a re-examination and distinguishing of the grounds for the decision in *In re Ross*, but that is not an overruling.  The fact that some justices in a later case want to overrule it does not mean it is overruled.
105525	105326	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States ex rel. Toth v. Quarles*, but there is no language suggesting it has been overruled.  The opinions consistently refer to *Toth* as precedent, sometimes agreeing with its conclusions and sometimes distinguishing it based on the specific circumstances of the cases at hand.  No language indicates the court is rejecting or altering the holding in *Toth*. Instead, the court applies and analyzes *Toth* in relation to the cases before it.
105525	96130	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Dorr v. United States*, but it does not contain any language that would suggest the case has been overruled.  The excerpts mention *Dorr* in the context of a discussion of constitutional restrictions on Congressional power regarding unincorporated territories.  There is no explicit overruling, nor implicit overruling through contradictory statements or functionally equivalent language. The citing opinions appear to be using *Dorr* as precedent, considering it alongside other cases in the same line of jurisprudence. 
105525	105412	yes	yes	95	The excerpts show that the Court initially upheld the court-martial jurisdiction in *Kinsella v. Krueger* (351 U.S. 470). However, the Court later granted a rehearing (352 U.S. 901) and overturned its prior decision, declaring the court-martial jurisdiction unconstitutional in cases involving capital offenses against civilian dependents of servicemen overseas during peacetime.  While not explicitly stating "overruled," the subsequent opinions and reversal of the judgment effectively overruled the prior holding of *Kinsella v. Krueger* to the extent it applied to capital offenses against civilians in peacetime. Justice Harlan's concurrence and the opinions of other justices who reversed their initial stances clearly demonstrate this overruling.
105525	95504	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Downes v. Bidwell*, often in lists of cases concerning the power of Congress over unincorporated territories.  There is no language suggesting that *Downes v. Bidwell* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text mentions that the *Downes v. Bidwell* decision was met with vigorous dissent, but this does not constitute overruling.  The opinions cited simply use *Downes v. Bidwell* as precedent in discussions of territorial powers and constitutional application to territories, rather than indicating it to be overturned.
105525	95894	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Hawaii v. Mankichi* multiple times.  However, none of the mentions contain language that would suggest the case has been overruled.  The excerpts describe the holding in *Hawaii v. Mankichi* and cite it alongside other cases in a discussion of Congressional power and the application of constitutional rights in US territories. There is no indication that the Court intended to overturn, modify, or limit the precedent set by *Hawaii v. Mankichi*. The case is cited as relevant precedent, not as something that has been superseded.
105525	85272	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *McCulloch v. Maryland*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the opinion uses the case to support its reasoning regarding the Necessary and Proper Clause and the scope of Congressional power.  The court refers to *McCulloch* to explain the principles of constitutional interpretation and the relationship between the Necessary and Proper Clause and other constitutional provisions.  There is no language suggesting the court intends to overturn the precedent set in *McCulloch*. The opinion uses the case's reasoning and principles of constitutional interpretation to support its analysis of military jurisdiction, but does not challenge the legitimacy or validity of the *McCulloch* decision itself.
105525	2181793	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *In re Di Bartolo* but does not offer any indication that it has been overruled.  The excerpt lists *In re Di Bartolo* among other cases, without any language suggesting overruling, modification, or limitation of its holding. There is no explicit statement overruling the case, nor any functionally equivalent language.  The text simply mentions the case,  not establishing it as precedent or disputing its legal standing.
105525	105004	no	no	95	The excerpt distinguishes Madsen v. Kinsella, stating that it concerned trials in enemy territory governed by military forces, unlike the present case.  Therefore, Madsen is not considered controlling precedent in the current situation.  The excerpt does not explicitly overrule Madsen, nor does it employ language functionally equivalent to overruling.  Instead, it limits Madsen's applicability to specific circumstances.
105525	1528394	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Ex Parte Milligan*, referencing its holding that military authorities cannot try civilians in areas where civil administration is functioning and courts are open.  The excerpts praise and reaffirm *Ex Parte Milligan*'s principle of civilian court primacy over military courts for civilians. There is no language suggesting that *Ex Parte Milligan* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  Instead, the opinion uses *Ex Parte Milligan* to support its argument about the limits of military jurisdiction over civilians. Therefore, the case remains as good precedent.
105525	99954	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts mention the case *Balzac v. Porto Rico* multiple times.  However, none of the mentions indicate that the case was overruled. In one instance, the court states that *Balzac v. Porto Rico* is "not good authority for the proposition that jury trials need never be provided for American citizens tried by the United States abroad; but the case is good authority for the proposition that there is no rigid rule that jury trial must always be provided in the trial of an American overseas, if the circumstances are such that trial by jury would be impractical and anomalous." This is a limitation or clarification of the case's holding, not an overruling.  The other mentions simply cite the case as precedent within a line of cases dealing with similar issues related to the application of constitutional rights in territories.  No language suggests overruling in whole or in part.
105525	105413	yes	no	-1	CITE_NOT_FOUND
105543	103736	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Williams v. North Carolina (1943), but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts discuss the case's application and interpretation in relation to other cases concerning alimony and ex parte divorces. The court clarifies the scope and limitations of Williams, especially regarding the Full Faith and Credit Clause and the power of states to adjudicate alimony in ex parte divorce proceedings.  It distinguishes the facts and legal principles in this case from those in Williams, rather than overruling its precedent.  The court's analysis focuses on interpreting and applying Williams, not explicitly overruling it.
105543	89656	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss *Pennoyer v. Neff*, referencing its holding regarding personal jurisdiction.  The court in this opinion does not explicitly overrule *Pennoyer*, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Instead, the court distinguishes *Pennoyer*'s application to the unique circumstances of divorce cases, acknowledging the precedent while finding it inapplicable in the specific context of alimony and divorce decrees.  The court notes the earlier case is "controlling precedent" in certain contexts, but not in the context of the case at hand.  Therefore, the cited case has not been overruled.
105543	97747	yes	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that Thompson v. Thompson, insofar as it held that an ex parte divorce destroyed alimony rights, can no longer be considered controlling.  This directly satisfies condition 2 (functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling) and condition 6 (no longer good law in certain contexts) for overruling a case. The court's reasoning centers on the evolution of legal understanding regarding ex parte divorces and alimony, effectively limiting the precedent set by Thompson v. Thompson.
105543	104568	no	no	95	The provided text discusses the case *Estin v. Estin*, but does not overrule it.  The Supreme Court's opinion in this excerpt distinguishes *Estin v. Estin* from the case at hand, highlighting the difference in whether a prior support order existed. While the court states that a portion of *Thompson v. Thompson* is no longer controlling, this does not affect the standing of *Estin v. Estin*. The excerpt analyzes *Estin v. Estin* as precedent but does not explicitly overrule, modify, or limit its holding.
106235	104252	no	yes	100	The court explicitly states that Commissioner v. Wilcox (1946) is overruled.  Multiple justices concur in this overruling, explicitly mentioning the overruling in their concurring and dissenting opinions. The court's reasoning centers on the fact that the prior holding in Wilcox, that embezzled funds are not taxable income in the year of embezzlement, is inconsistent with later rulings (particularly Rutkin v. United States).  The court finds the reasoning in Rutkin effectively negates the basis of the Wilcox decision.  Therefore, the case is explicitly overruled by a majority of the court.
106235	104992	no	no	95	The excerpts state that the court in Rutkin v. United States did not overrule Commissioner v. Wilcox.  While the Court in later cases may have found the reasoning in Wilcox unconvincing or have effectively undermined its holding, there is no explicit overruling of Rutkin itself in these excerpts.  The language used describes Wilcox as "thoroughly devitalized" and suggests that it was effectively overruled in later cases like Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., but this does not constitute an overruling of Rutkin.  The excerpts primarily discuss the relationship between *Wilcox* and *Rutkin*, not whether *Rutkin* itself was overruled.
106235	1495711	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss the case *McKnight v. Commissioner*, citing it multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The excerpts analyze and distinguish *McKnight* from other cases, but they do not challenge its legal basis or declare it to be no longer good law. The citations are used to support legal arguments in other cases, but not to overturn *McKnight* itself.
106235	101568	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Corliss v. Bowers*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpts discuss the case's principle concerning a taxpayer's "actual command over the property taxed—the actual benefit for which the tax is paid."  However, this discussion is used to support the court's reasoning in the current case, not to overturn *Corliss v. Bowers*. The court distinguishes *Corliss v. Bowers* from other cases, noting that the latter involved inter vivos trust income over which the taxpayer retained control. This is a distinction, not an overruling.  There is no language suggesting that *Corliss v. Bowers* is no longer good law, or any equivalent language that would meet the criteria for overruling.
106235	101083	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States v. Sullivan*, 274 U.S. 259,  but does not overrule it.  The excerpts discuss the case's holding regarding the inclusion of unlawful gains in gross income.  While the later cases may refine or elaborate upon the principles established in *Sullivan*, there is no language suggesting that *Sullivan* is overruled, explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinions either agree with Sullivan's principle that unlawful income is taxable or distinguish its application to different factual scenarios.  There is no indication that the case is no longer good law in any context. Therefore, the case of interest has not been overruled.
106235	103292	no	no	95	The excerpts cite Helvering v. Hallock (1940) multiple times.  However, the citations are used to support the court's right to revisit and correct its own prior errors, illustrating that prior rulings are not immutable.  No language suggests that the court is explicitly overruling Helvering v. Hallock. The court acknowledges prior decisions, uses them as precedent for its own reasoning regarding the appropriate judicial process, and does not contradict or invalidate the prior ruling's legal conclusions.  Therefore, Helvering v. Hallock is not overruled in these excerpts.
106235	101937	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss the case *North American Oil Consolidated v. Burnet*, explaining its holding regarding the "claim of right" doctrine in tax law.  The excerpts do not overrule the case.  Instead, they analyze and apply (or distinguish) the case's principles in subsequent cases, particularly in relation to embezzled funds, which were not explicitly addressed in the original *North American Oil* decision. The court's discussion highlights the differences between situations involving bona fide claims of right (as in *North American Oil*) versus situations involving illegally obtained funds (as in the cases being discussed in the excerpts).  The excerpts clarify the applicability and limitations of *North American Oil*'s claim of right doctrine, but they do not explicitly overrule it.  They use it as precedent in their reasoning.
106235	104867	no	no	95	The provided text discusses the case *United States v. Lewis* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case was overruled. The excerpts focus on the case's relevance to the "claim of right" doctrine and its application in tax law, showing that *United States v. Lewis* is referenced as precedent in relation to other cases, specifically regarding the timing and finality of income reporting rather than its correctness as a legal principle.
106285	104709	yes	yes	100	The provided text repeatedly references *Wolf v. Colorado*.  The majority opinion explicitly overrules *Wolf v. Colorado*, stating that the prior holding allowing states to admit evidence obtained through unreasonable search and seizure is no longer good law.  The court directly addresses and rejects the precedent set in *Wolf v. Colorado*, highlighting the inconsistencies and practical implications of its previous ruling. The opinion explains that the exclusionary rule is now considered an essential part of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, and this protection applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause. Therefore, *Wolf v. Colorado* is explicitly overruled.
106285	3580565	no	no	85	The provided text excerpts from the court opinion discuss *People v. Defore*, mentioning Justice Cardozo's rejection of the Weeks exclusionary rule.  However, the opinion does not explicitly overrule *People v. Defore*. Instead, it states that the force of Cardozo's reasoning has been "largely vitiated" by later Supreme Court decisions. This implies that the reasoning, not the case itself, is no longer considered fully valid in light of subsequent case law.  The opinion focuses on the evolution of the Court's approach to the exclusionary rule and its application to states, not on directly overruling *People v. Defore*. Therefore, the case is not overruled according to the provided criteria.
106285	104943	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Rochin v. California* but does not overrule it.  The citation is used as a supporting case, referencing its holding regarding unconstitutional evidence and convictions. There is no language suggesting the Court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the precedent set by *Rochin v. California*. The reference is simply used to support the court's current reasoning.
106285	106107	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Elkins v. United States* (1960) as precedent,  using phrases such as "As was said in Elkins" and  "In Elkins," to support the court's reasoning.  There is no language suggesting that *Elkins* was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The excerpts show the court referencing and relying on *Elkins* to establish points related to the exclusionary rule and federalism. None of the criteria for overruling are met.
106285	98094	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Weeks v. United States*, and in the context of *Mapp v. Ohio*, the Court discusses overruling *Wolf v. Colorado*, which had previously held that the exclusionary rule of *Weeks* did not apply to the states.  The Court's reasoning in *Mapp* focuses on the implications of *Wolf* and its impact on the Fourth Amendment, and ultimately overrules *Wolf* but not *Weeks*.  There is no language in the excerpts suggesting that *Weeks* itself has been overruled.
106285	105194	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Irvine v. California (1954).  In a footnote, the court cites Justice Jackson's majority opinion in Irvine, which states that the court thinks the Wolf decision (a prior case) should not be overruled.  This implies that Irvine itself was not overruled at the time of this later opinion.  The excerpt does not contain language explicitly overruling Irvine or language functionally equivalent to overruling it. There is no indication of partial overruling, overruling in certain circumstances, distinction of legal principles, or statements declaring it no longer good law in specific contexts. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no evidence to suggest that Irvine v. California was overruled.
106285	1237532	no	no	95	The provided text mentions People v. Cahan (1955) multiple times. However, the text does not contain language that would indicate that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the text discusses the case's decision to adopt the Weeks exclusionary rule, contrasting it with other state approaches and the Supreme Court's own role in shaping procedural rules.  The Supreme Court's later decisions are presented as contrasting with or elaborating upon the Cahan ruling's implications, rather than explicitly overruling it. There is no explicit statement that Cahan is overruled, nor is there language functionally equivalent to overruling it.
106285	91573	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss Boyd v. United States and its relevance to the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  While the opinion references Boyd multiple times, and even quotes it extensively,  it does not explicitly overrule it.  The opinion focuses on the admissibility of evidence obtained through unreasonable searches and seizures, a topic central to Boyd, but it doesn't overturn Boyd's precedent. The case of Wolf v. Colorado is overruled in part, not Boyd. Therefore, there is no indication that Boyd itself is overruled in any way.
106576	100181	no	yes	95	The provided text explicitly mentions *Adkins v. Children's Hospital* among cases that used the Due Process Clause to strike down laws deemed unreasonable or unwise, reflecting a past judicial approach that has since been rejected.  The excerpt highlights the shift away from this approach, stating that it is the legislature's role to decide the wisdom and utility of legislation, not the courts.  This implicit overruling is further supported by the cited dissenting opinions of Justices Holmes and Brandeis, who strongly opposed the Court's intervention in legislative value judgments, which is precisely what *Adkins* represented.  The passage directly lists *Adkins* among cases which represent this now-rejected methodology. Therefore, the case is considered overruled implicitly but decisively.
106576	96276	no	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly mentions *Lochner v. New York* as a case where the Due Process Clause was used to strike down laws deemed "unwise or incompatible with some particular economic or social philosophy."  The excerpt further states that this intrusion by the judiciary into the realm of legislative value judgments was "strongly objected to." The citing opinion implicitly overrules *Lochner* by stating that it is the province of legislatures, not courts, to decide on the wisdom and utility of legislation.  This directly contradicts the approach taken in *Lochner*. The fact that *Lochner* is listed among other cases that are cited as examples of improper judicial overreach further strengthens this conclusion. Therefore, the case has been implicitly overruled.
106576	101029	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Tyson & Brother v. Banton*, 273 U.S. 418 (1927), focusing on a dissenting opinion by Justice Holmes.  There is no language in the excerpt suggesting that *Tyson & Brother* has been overruled.  The excerpt uses the dissenting opinion to support the court's current reasoning, not to overturn the case.  The fact that the excerpt cites a dissenting opinion rather than a majority holding further weakens any argument that the case has been overruled.
106576	103522	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Olsen v. Nebraska several times.  In footnote 6, it is cited as upholding a Nebraska statute. Footnote 10 mentions the case again, noting that the Court later commented on the infirmity of Adams in Breard v. Alexandria (1951). However, neither of these citations suggest that Olsen v. Nebraska was overruled.  There is no language explicitly overruling it, nor is there language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The case is cited as precedent, and discussed in relation to later cases, but not overruled.
106576	101935	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Sproles v. Binford (1932), but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt quotes a passage from the Sproles decision, indicating that the court is referencing the case as precedent, not overruling it. There is no language suggesting the overruling of this case in any way.
106576	104610	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *Lincoln Federal Labor Union v. Northwestern Iron & Metal Co.* multiple times  (citations [8] and [10]). However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled. The text refers to the case as precedent, citing specific pages from the opinion.  Therefore, there's no indication that any of the six conditions for overruling have been met.
106576	105285	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma, Inc.* (1955) multiple times but does not contain any language that would indicate that it has been overruled.  The citations are used to support the court's reasoning in the current case. There is no explicit overruling, nor any language functionally equivalent to overruling.  The case is cited as precedent, not dismissed or altered.
106576	2093296	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case Home Budget Service, Inc. v. Boston Bar Association (1957), but it does not contain any language suggesting that the case has been overruled.  The excerpt simply cites the case as precedent for a state statute prohibiting debt pooling by laymen. There is no discussion of the case's merits or any indication that its holding has been challenged or overturned.
106576	98999	yes	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the court's previous approach, exemplified by Adams v. Tanner, of using due process to strike down laws deemed "unwise or incompatible with some particular economic or social philosophy," is no longer valid.  The court asserts that it's the legislature's role, not the courts', to decide on the wisdom and utility of legislation. This directly contradicts the precedent set by Adams v. Tanner, effectively overruling it by stating that its philosophy is outdated and incorrect under the current constitutional system.
106883	106545	no	no	95	The case *Gideon v. Wainwright* is cited multiple times in the provided text.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the opinions refer to *Gideon* as precedent, affirming the right to counsel.  The discussions focus on extending the application of the right to counsel to stages earlier in the criminal process than the trial, but not on overturning the *Gideon* decision itself.
106883	2193029	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule *The PEOPLE v. Escobedo*.  Instead, the text cites *The PEOPLE v. Escobedo*, 28 Ill. 2d 41, 190 N.E.2d 825, and discusses its holding related to the admissibility of a confession obtained after a request for counsel was denied. The Supreme Court's opinion reverses the Illinois court's affirmation of the conviction, indicating disagreement with the lower court's application of precedent (specifically mentioning *Crooker v. California* and *Cicenia v. Lagay*), but doesn't explicitly overrule *Escobedo*. The opinion uses the *Escobedo* case to support its reasoning about the importance of counsel during interrogation.
106883	106822	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *Massiah v. United States* multiple times.  The excerpts do not explicitly overrule *Massiah*, nor do they use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the excerpts reference *Massiah* as precedent, sometimes agreeing with its holding and sometimes distinguishing it based on the specific facts of the case at hand.  The dissenting opinions even cite *Massiah* to support their arguments. While some justices disagree with the application of *Massiah* in the present case, this disagreement is based on factual distinctions, not on the overruling of the precedent itself.  Therefore, there's no indication *Massiah* has been overruled.
106883	105750	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that to the extent that Cicenia or Crooker may be inconsistent with the principles announced today, they are not to be regarded as controlling.  This directly addresses Cicenia v. Lagay and indicates it is overruled at least in part, satisfying condition 1 for overruling.
106883	106595	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *White v. Maryland*, but does not overrule it.  The citations are used to support the argument regarding the right to counsel at critical stages of the criminal process, placing *White v. Maryland* in the context of other similar cases.  There is no language suggesting the overruling of *White v. Maryland*, either explicitly or implicitly. The court uses *White v. Maryland* as precedent, showing it is still considered relevant and not overruled.
106883	105917	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *Spano v. New York* multiple times.  In one instance, the court quotes Justice Douglas's concurring opinion in *Spano*. In another, the court references Justice Stewart's concurring opinion.  In a third instance, the court cites *Spano* to support the idea that police can investigate unsolved crimes.  None of these uses suggest that the court overruled *Spano*. Instead, they appear to be referencing *Spano* for distinct points of law in relation to the case before the court.  The court does state that to the extent that *Cicenia* or *Crooker* may be inconsistent with the principles announced in the opinion, they are not to be regarded as controlling. However, this does not pertain to *Spano*.
106883	105745	yes	no	95	The excerpt states that the authority of Crooker v. California was weakened by subsequent decisions.  Weakening the authority of a case is not the same as overruling it. The excerpt also explains that Crooker v. California rejected an absolute rule and instead announced a new rule based on the circumstances of each case.  This is a clarification or modification, not an overruling. Therefore, Crooker was not overruled.
106883	106300	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Hamilton v. Alabama, but never states that it has been overruled.  Instead, the excerpts discuss Hamilton in relation to other cases, particularly in the context of the right to counsel and its application in different stages of criminal proceedings.  The citing opinions use Hamilton as precedent, referring to its relevance to the right to counsel at critical stages, showing that it remains influential case law, and has not been explicitly overruled or implicitly undermined.
107121	105848	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that it is overruling Brown v. United States, 359 U.S. 41.  This is explicitly stated in the majority opinion: "We overrule Brown v. United States, supra, and reverse and remand this case for proceedings under Rule 42 (b)."
107121	268056	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *United States v. Pappadio* several times.  However, there is no language suggesting it was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text notes the case as an example of a procedure used in the Southern District of New York.  There is no discussion of overruling, modification, or limitation of the case's holding. Therefore, based on the provided excerpt, there's no indication that *United States v. Andimo Pappadio* (1965) was overruled.
107121	267423	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *United States v. Tramunti* multiple times. However, there is no language suggesting it has been overruled.  The excerpts show the case as an example of a procedure used in the Southern District of New York,  cited alongside other cases. There is no discussion of overruling, modifying or limiting its holding. Therefore, there is no indication that *United States v. Tramunti* (1965) has been overruled.
107121	92334	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Ex parte Terry* multiple times.  However, the citations are used to describe the existing law that Rule 42(a) is based on. There is no language suggesting the overruling, partial or otherwise, of *Ex parte Terry*. The court's opinion clarifies the application of Rule 42(a) and distinguishes it from cases like *Ex parte Terry*, but does not challenge the legal principles established within *Ex parte Terry* itself.
107121	106057	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Levine v. United States (362 U.S. 610) multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that it was overruled.  Instead, the text states that *Brown v. United States* was reaffirmed and followed in *Levine v. United States*.  The discussion centers around the implications and application of *Brown*, with no indication of any overruling of *Levine*. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Levine v. United States* was overruled.
107121	266063	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *United States v. Castaldi* multiple times, but it does not contain any language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The excerpts show the case as an example of a procedure used in the Southern District of New York,  not as a case whose legal holdings are being challenged or overturned. There is no explicit overruling statement, nor implicit language functionally equivalent to an overruling.  The case is cited as an example, not as a case whose precedent is being rejected.
107121	267864	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *United States v. Shillitani* several times.  However, none of the mentions suggest that the case has been overruled. The text cites *Shillitani* as an example of a case where a specific procedure was followed, not as a case whose holding is being challenged or rejected.  There is no language indicating overruling, either explicitly or implicitly (such as describing the case as 'no longer good law' or offering a functionally equivalent statement).
107081	104790	yes	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, is overruled.  The text argues that the Court in Douds misinterpreted precedent and that the Bill of Attainder Clause forbids what was validated in Douds.  The opinion highlights specific aspects of Douds that are now deemed invalid under the current interpretation of the Bill of Attainder Clause.
107081	106267	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *Communist Party v. Subversive Activities Control Board*, 367 U.S. 1 (1961), multiple times.  The citing opinions analyze and discuss the case's holding regarding bills of attainder, particularly focusing on whether the Subversive Activities Control Act's definition of "Communist-action organization" constituted a bill of attainder.  The excerpts do not overrule the precedent in *Communist Party*. Instead, they engage in detailed analysis of its application to the specific facts before the court in the case at hand.  The citing opinions distinguish the facts and statutes involved, offering interpretations and distinguishing the case's application to different circumstances and legal principles. This does not constitute overruling. They also reference the case in support of their reasoning, indicating that *Communist Party* is being considered as precedent, not overruled.
107081	104353	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes Board of Governors v. Agnew (1947) in the context of the Bill of Attainder Clause.  The Supreme Court in the citing case distinguishes Agnew, but does not explicitly overrule it.  The citing opinion uses Agnew as a comparative case to support its arguments about conflict-of-interest statutes and the Bill of Attainder Clause, rather than to overturn Agnew's holding.  Therefore, there is no indication that Agnew has been overruled.
107081	87778	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Cummings v. Missouri*, and while it discusses the concept of bills of attainder and how the courts have interpreted the relevant clause, it never states that *Cummings v. Missouri* is overruled, nor does it offer language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The citing opinions engage in analysis and discussion of the precedent, using *Cummings v. Missouri* to support their own arguments.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Cummings v. Missouri* has been overruled in the excerpts.
107081	104303	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes and discusses *United States v. Lovett*, citing it multiple times as precedent in relation to bills of attainder.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either fully or partially.  Instead, the excerpts demonstrate the court referring to and interpreting *Lovett* in subsequent cases, thus treating it as a relevant and valid precedent.
107081	94855	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Hawker v. New York*, 170 U.S. 189, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts use *Hawker* as precedent in discussions of conflict-of-interest statutes, bills of attainder, and the standards for determining whether legislation is punitive or regulatory.  The citing opinions analyze *Hawker* in relation to the case at hand, comparing and contrasting the facts and legal issues, but never state that *Hawker* is overruled, nor do they employ language that functionally equates to overruling it. The court distinguishes the case's treatment of different legal principles but does not overrule it.
107081	106534	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez* multiple times.  However, the excerpts do not contain language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  Instead, the dissenting opinion uses the case as precedent, summarizing the factors considered in determining whether a sanction is punitive or regulatory.  The opinion applies the factors from *Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez* to the case at hand and reaches a different conclusion, but this is not the same as overruling the prior case.
107252	106625	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Haynes v. Washington.  However, in all instances, the citing opinions neither explicitly overrule Haynes nor use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the opinions either mention Haynes as precedent illustrating prior approaches to custodial interrogation (and its inherent coerciveness) or clarify and expand upon its principles within the context of evolving jurisprudence on the admissibility of confessions.  No part of Haynes is explicitly overturned; rather, Miranda v. Arizona implicitly alters the legal landscape, rendering some aspects of Haynes' reasoning less relevant but not overruling its holding.
107252	94782	no	no	90	While the provided text frequently cites *Bram v. United States*, it does not explicitly overrule it.  Instead, the text expresses some skepticism toward *Bram*'s historical underpinnings and suggests that some aspects of the *Bram* decision are inconsistent with later pronouncements and developments in the law.  One passage even refers to Bram as "long-discredited". However, there is no explicit statement that the case has been overruled. The court does not state that *Bram* is no longer good law, only that it has been questioned and that its historical premises were disproven. Therefore, while the opinion casts significant doubt on *Bram*, it stops short of overruling it.
107252	106883	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites Escobedo v. Illinois (1964), but it does not contain language that would meet any of the criteria for overruling a case.  The citations are used to either clarify the Court's position in relation to Escobedo or to distinguish its holding from the current case. There is no explicit statement overruling Escobedo, no functionally equivalent language, no partial overruling, and no limitation of its application to specific circumstances. The excerpts show that the Court refers back to, and further explains, its prior holding in Escobedo, instead of overruling it.
107252	106862	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Malloy v. Hogan*, 378 U.S. 1 (1964), and discusses its application and implications.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The excerpts explain the case's holding and reasoning, showing how it has been applied or considered in other contexts.  No part of the opinion indicates that *Malloy v. Hogan* is no longer good law or has been superseded.  The numerous mentions consistently treat it as precedent.
107252	105745	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that, in accordance with its holdings in Escobedo v. Illinois and the present case, Crooker v. California (357 U.S. 433 (1958)) and Cicenia v. Lagay (357 U.S. 504 (1958)) are not to be followed.  This is a clear indication that Crooker v. California is overruled.
107252	103981	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Ashcraft v. Tennessee*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts discuss *Ashcraft* as precedent within the evolution of the Court's understanding of voluntariness in confessions, particularly in the context of due process.  The opinions cite *Ashcraft* in support of various arguments, sometimes referencing  Justice Jackson's dissenting opinion. This demonstrates the case is still relevant to discussions on the subject but doesn't indicate an overruling.
107252	106558	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Lynumn v. Illinois*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the citing opinions refer to *Lynumn* as precedent,  using it to illustrate points about the admissibility of confessions obtained through police interrogation. The excerpts show that *Lynumn* is considered relevant to the legal discussion, but there is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either fully or partially, nor is it distinguished or limited in its application.
107252	100471	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Wan v. United States*, often to emphasize its holding on the voluntariness of confessions.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The excerpts show that *Wan v. United States* is still considered relevant precedent and its principles regarding voluntariness are reaffirmed and applied in later cases. The court uses the case to support its current argument regarding confessions and does not challenge its validity.
107252	104108	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *Malinski v. New York* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpts cite *Malinski* as precedent, demonstrating its continued relevance to discussions on involuntary confessions and interrogation practices.  Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Malinski v. New York* (1945) has been overruled.
107252	91057	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Hopt v. Utah*, but never states that it has been overruled.  Instead, the excerpts discuss *Hopt* within the context of evolving standards for the admissibility of confessions, particularly regarding the Fifth Amendment and the Due Process Clause. The opinion traces the development of legal precedent from *Hopt* to more recent cases, indicating a shift in legal interpretation but not an explicit overruling of *Hopt*. The citing opinions clarify and refine existing law concerning confessions, but do not declare *Hopt* to be no longer good law or functionally equivalent to overruling it.
107252	105750	yes	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that the court expressly overrules Cicenia v. Lagay (357 U.S. 504 (1958)) in its decision.  This directly satisfies condition #1 for overruling a case.
107464	105658	yes	yes	100	The excerpt explicitly states that "Perez v. Brownell is overruled."  The court finds the reasoning in Perez unsound and rejects the idea that Congress has the general power to take away citizenship without assent.  The excerpt details the reasoning behind the overruling, citing concerns about the Fourteenth Amendment and the nature of citizenship in a free country.
107464	94842	no	no	95	The provided text cites *United States v. Wong Kim Ark* multiple times.  However, the text does not overrule, nor does it explicitly state that *Wong Kim Ark* is no longer good law. Instead, the excerpts analyze and discuss *Wong Kim Ark*,  using its precedent and reasoning in the author's arguments.  One excerpt even points out that a dictum from *Wong Kim Ark* "can scarcely be considered a reasoned consideration of the issues now before the Court."  This is a critique of the reasoning, not an overruling of the case itself. Therefore, there's no indication that *United States v. Wong Kim Ark* has been overruled.
107464	91470	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Kurtz v. Moffitt* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled. The excerpts cite *Kurtz v. Moffitt* as precedent, and its interpretation of a statute is discussed and considered, but not overturned or otherwise invalidated.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Kurtz v. Moffitt* was overruled, fully or partially.
107464	105659	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Trop v. Dulles several times.  In one instance, it states that a provision of law was held unconstitutional by the Court in Trop v. Dulles. However, this does not indicate that Trop itself was overruled.  The text also discusses other cases and opinions related to expatriation, but there is no language explicitly overruling Trop, nor is there language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The mention of Trop is primarily used for context and comparison within the discussion of other legal precedents. Therefore, there is no evidence that the case has been overruled.
107464	98579	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule MacKenzie v. Hare.  Instead, the excerpt discusses MacKenzie v. Hare, noting that the Court in a later case found the reasoning in MacKenzie to be inconsistent with their current position. The excerpt analyzes the prior case's holding in relation to the current case, but does not explicitly overrule it.  There's analysis of the case's holding, and how it relates to other cases, but no language indicating it is overruled.
107473	105880	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly re-examines the holding in Frank v. Maryland in light of "more intensive efforts at all levels of government to contain and eliminate urban blight", "numerous decisions of this Court have more fully defined the Fourth Amendment's effect on state and municipal action", and the "growing nationwide importance of the problem".  The court then proceeds to analyze and ultimately disagrees with the "factors which persuaded the Frank majority to adopt this construction of the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches."  While the court mentions that Frank "can arguably be distinguished from this case on its facts", it proceeds to directly challenge the reasoning and holding of Frank, effectively overruling it.
107473	106109	no	no	95	The opinion mentions Ohio Ex Rel. Eaton v. Price, 364 U.S. 263, several times.  It notes that the case was affirmed by an equally divided court. While the Court engages in a re-examination of the legal principles in light of subsequent cases and changing circumstances, it does not explicitly overrule Eaton v. Price. The Court distinguishes the case in the context of Fourth Amendment rights and administrative searches, stating that, in light of intervening case law, further examination was needed. This is a distinction, not an overruling.  The mention that four justices thought it was controlled by Frank v. Maryland further indicates that the court didn't overrule Eaton v. Price, it simply used it as a point of reference for the evolving legal landscape.
107473	106641	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Ker v. California* multiple times.  However, it does not state that *Ker v. California* is overruled. Instead, the opinion focuses on overruling *Frank v. Maryland*, and uses *Ker v. California* as precedent in upholding the enforceability of the Fourth Amendment against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.  The excerpt highlights the Court's re-examination of administrative inspection programs in light of evolving interpretations of the Fourth Amendment, but doesn't explicitly overrule *Ker v. California*. Therefore, there is no indication that *Ker v. California* is overruled, fully or partially.
107473	2305304	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Givner v. State* (1956) as one of several cases cited in a discussion of housing codes and entry without a warrant.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Givner v. State* was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text simply cites the case as relevant precedent alongside others.
107473	106777	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Stoner v. California* multiple times but does not overrule it.  Instead, the citing opinion uses *Stoner* as precedent, referring to it as an example of the principle that warrantless searches are generally unreasonable.  There is no language suggesting the Court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the holding of *Stoner*. The citations are used to support the argument for requiring a warrant. Therefore, there's no indication that *Stoner* has been overruled.
107473	104605	no	no	95	The provided text cites McDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled. The citing opinions mention McDonald as precedent relevant to the discussion of search warrants and the Fourth Amendment.  No part of McDonald is explicitly overruled, nor is its application to certain circumstances limited. Therefore, there is no indication that McDonald v. United States has been overruled.
107473	2062881	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Paquette v. City of Fall River among other cases,  citing it as precedent related to warrantless housing inspections. There is no language suggesting that the court overruled, limited, distinguished, or otherwise qualified the holding in Paquette.  The case is simply cited as one of several cases supporting a particular legal position.
107473	2008391	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Commonwealth v. Hadley (1966) as one of several cases cited in support of a legal argument.  There is no language suggesting that Commonwealth v. Hadley is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpt simply lists the case amongst others, without any indication that its holding is rejected or modified.
107473	3620827	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Adamec v. Post* among other cases in a list of supporting precedents (paragraph [11]). There is no language suggesting that the court overruled, qualified, or distinguished *Adamec v. Post*.  Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled.
107473	107262	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Schmerber v. California (1966) but does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites Schmerber as support for the court's discussion on the reasonableness standard and warrant requirements in the context of searches, but it does not challenge or modify the holding of Schmerber itself.  The citing case uses Schmerber as precedent, referring to specific pages of the opinion to strengthen its own argument.
107564	107483	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss *Berger v. New York* in relation to other cases and evolving legal interpretations of the Fourth Amendment concerning electronic surveillance.  While some excerpts mention that *Berger* created confusion or obstacles, and others suggest the evolution of case law has rendered certain aspects of *Olmstead v. United States* (a case that *Berger* dealt with) obsolete, there is no explicit statement that *Berger v. New York* itself has been overruled, either fully or partially.  The excerpts analyze and interpret *Berger*, but do not overturn its holding.  There is no language functionally equivalent to overruling, no qualification of parts of the case, no limitation to specific circumstances, no distinction of legal principles within the case itself, and no declaration that *Berger* is no longer good law in any context.
107564	107465	no	no	85	The provided text discusses *Warden v. Hayden* in the context of its impact on the interpretation of the Fourth Amendment, particularly concerning the "trespass" doctrine and the scope of searches and seizures.  The author argues that *Warden v. Hayden* did not overrule *Olmstead v. United States* or *Goldman v. United States*.  Instead, it's presented as a case that, along with *Silverman v. United States*, is cited by the majority opinion to justify expanding the Fourth Amendment's protection beyond tangible property. The author believes that *Olmstead* and *Goldman* remain good law despite the majority opinion's assertions. Therefore, there is no indication that *Warden v. Hayden* itself was overruled in this excerpt.
107564	106187	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Silverman v. United States*, and in several instances, it is used to support the overruling of other cases (Olmstead and Goldman).  However, nowhere in the text is *Silverman v. United States* itself explicitly overruled or stated to be no longer good law.  While the Court discusses its evolution of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, and states that the underpinnings of Olmstead and Goldman have been eroded, it does not claim *Silverman* is similarly affected.  One passage even notes that *Silverman* did not re-examine the rationale of *Olmstead* or *Goldman*, despite being urged to do so. Therefore, there is no basis within the provided excerpts to conclude *Silverman* was overruled.
107564	106622	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Lopez v. United States*, but in no instance does it state that the case has been overruled.  In several instances, the case is cited as precedent or as reflecting the state of the law at a particular time.  There is no language functionally equivalent to overruling the case, nor is any part of the case overruled or qualified. The text does discuss the evolution of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence regarding electronic surveillance, but *Lopez* is not identified as a case that has been affected by this evolution.  Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no evidence to suggest that *Lopez v. United States* has been overruled.
107564	106641	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Ker v. California*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt discusses the "exception to the notice requirement where exigent circumstances are present" from *Ker*, and notes different considerations for electronic surveillance versus physical entry into a home. It analyzes and distinguishes the case, but doesn't explicitly overrule or invalidate its holding.  The opinion acknowledges and engages with *Ker*, but does not alter its legal standing.
107564	106108	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Rios v. United States* multiple times as precedent in support of the proposition that a person's expectation of privacy in certain places, even public ones like a telephone booth, is constitutionally protected under the Fourth Amendment.  The opinion neither explicitly overrules *Rios*, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, it relies on and affirms the principles established in *Rios*. There is no indication that the Court is limiting, qualifying, or distinguishing the holding of *Rios* in any way.
107564	2443377	yes	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that the case *Goldman v. United States* (316 U.S. 129) is overruled.  The court's reasoning is that the *Goldman* decision's limitation on Fourth Amendment protection is outdated and inconsistent with current understanding of reasonable expectations of privacy in the context of electronic surveillance.  The court finds that the prior limitation is "bad physics as well as bad law" because reasonable expectations of privacy can be violated by electronic means as well as physical intrusion.
107564	101320	yes	no	-1	CITE_NOT_FOUND
107343	104974	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that *Adler v. Board of Education* is not dispositive of the constitutional issues in this case because "pertinent constitutional doctrines have since rejected the premises upon which that conclusion rested."  The court further explains that *Adler*'s premise that public employment could be conditioned upon the surrender of constitutional rights has been "expressly rejected in a series of decisions following *Adler*. "
107343	106837	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Baggett v. Bullitt* as precedent, using phrases such as "Baggett v. Bullitt, supra", and "Baggett v. Bullitt, supra, at 374".  There is no language suggesting that the court overruled, partially overruled, or qualified the case in any way.  Instead, the citing opinion relies on *Baggett v. Bullitt*'s established legal principles regarding vagueness in statutes affecting First Amendment rights. The opinion aligns its own reasoning with the precedent set by *Baggett v. Bullitt*, showing that it is being followed, not overruled.
107343	107210	no	no	100	The provided text cites Elfbrant v. Russell and explains its holding.  It does not state that Elfbrant v. Russell has been overruled, nor does it offer language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The excerpt uses Elfbrant v. Russell to support the court's reasoning in the current case. Therefore, there is no indication that Elfbrant v. Russell has been overruled.
107343	106514	no	no	95	The provided text cites *NAACP v. Button* multiple times but does not overrule it.  The citations use the case as precedent to support arguments about vagueness and overbreadth in other statutes,  specifically in relation to First Amendment rights.  There is no language suggesting the Court intends to overturn *NAACP v. Button*, either explicitly or implicitly.
107343	105751	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Speiser v. Randall*, sometimes as supporting precedent and sometimes in comparison to other cases.  There is no language in these excerpts that suggests the court is overruling *Speiser v. Randall*, either explicitly or implicitly.  The case is mentioned and referenced in relation to other cases but not overruled. 
107343	106142	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Shelton v. Tucker*, referencing its principles regarding academic freedom and the limits on government restrictions of fundamental personal liberties.  However, there is no language suggesting the court overruled, qualified, or limited the holding in *Shelton v. Tucker*. Instead, the citing opinions use *Shelton v. Tucker* as precedent, supporting their arguments with its principles. The court relies on *Shelton v. Tucker* to support its judgment against overly broad statutes infringing on freedoms of speech and association, demonstrating that it is not being overruled, but followed.
107343	105537	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Yates v. United States*, but never indicates that it has been overruled.  Instead, the citations show that *Yates* is being used as precedent, distinguishing between advocacy of abstract doctrine and incitement to action.  The text highlights the difference between teaching abstract doctrines and inciting action, a distinction established in *Yates*.  Therefore, there's no indication that *Yates* has been overruled.
107343	106311	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Cramp v. Board of Public Instruction* as precedent.  There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text uses the case to support the court's reasoning and aligns the current case with the principles established in *Cramp*. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that *Cramp* has been overruled.
107689	106050	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that Parker v. Ellis is overruled insofar as it held that the power of federal courts to adjudicate habeas corpus claims depends on the petitioner remaining in custody.  While the justices in the majority did not explicitly use the word "overruled", their statement that what was decided in Parker v. Ellis "was wrong" and that they are "now persuaded that what the Court there decided was wrong" is functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling the case.  Additionally, Justice Harlan and Justice Stewart explicitly state that they concur in the opinion and judgment of the Court, which overrules Parker v. Ellis in part. This directly satisfies condition 2 and condition 3 for overruling a case.
107689	264986	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *United States of America Ex Rel. James P. Carafas v. J. Edwin Lavallee, Warden, Auburn Prison, Auburn, New York* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that it was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text describes the procedural history of the case and its journey through various courts.  The Supreme Court's consideration of the case in relation to *Nowakowski v. Maroney* does not constitute an overruling of *Carafas*. The mention of *Carafas* in this opinion is merely a description of the case's procedural history, not an assessment of its continued legal validity.
107689	107408	no	no	95	The excerpt discusses the case *Nowakowski v. Maroney*, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the court considers whether the holding in *Nowakowski* applies to the case before it.  The court states that *Nowakowski's* holding applies to a habeas corpus proceeding that was not concluded at the time *Nowakowski* was decided.  There is no language suggesting that *Nowakowski* is overruled, fully or partially, nor does the court offer any qualifications to its holding.
107689	104336	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Fiswick v. United States* as precedent, noting that the case is not moot due to collateral consequences stemming from a conviction.  There is no language suggesting that *Fiswick* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court relies on *Fiswick* to support its reasoning. Therefore, there's no indication that *Fiswick* has been overruled.
107689	265136	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Thomas v. Cunningham, 335 F.2d 67 (C.A. 4th Cir. 1964)*, but it does not offer any information suggesting that it was overruled.  The excerpt only cites the case as a supporting reference. There is no language suggesting overruling, either explicitly or implicitly, nor any indication of limitations or distinctions applied to the case.
107689	107084	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Linkletter v. Walker (1965) as a cited case. However, there is no language suggesting that the court overruled Linkletter.  The excerpt simply cites Linkletter alongside other cases in relation to the issue of in forma pauperis appeals in habeas corpus proceedings.  There is no indication of overruling, modification, or limitation of Linkletter's holding. 
107689	106285	no	no	100	The excerpt mentions Mapp v. Ohio (1961) as precedent in a case concerning illegally obtained evidence.  The Court cites Mapp v. Ohio in support of the petitioner's claim that illegally obtained evidence had been introduced against him. This is an example of the cited case being followed, not overruled.
107689	107663	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Ginsberg v. New York* as precedent regarding the mootness of a case due to collateral consequences.  There is no language suggesting that *Ginsberg v. New York* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinion uses the case to support its conclusion on a similar issue, indicating that the court considers *Ginsberg v. New York* to be good law in this context. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that the case has been overruled.
107689	95249	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Ex Parte Baez* (1900) as one of several cases cited in support of the proposition that there is no habeas corpus jurisdiction if there has been or will be an unconditional release from custody before inquiry into the legality of detention.  The excerpt does not suggest that *Ex Parte Baez* was overruled,  nor does it offer any criticism of the case's legal reasoning or holding.  The case is simply mentioned as precedent. 
107689	1425143	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *United States ex rel. Rivera v. Reeves*, 246 F. Supp. 599 (D.C. S.D.N.Y. 1965), among other cases, in a list of cases addressing habeas corpus jurisdiction.  There is no language suggesting that the Court overruled, qualified, or limited the holding in *Rivera*. The citation is used to support a point about existing case law regarding habeas corpus jurisdiction; therefore, the case is cited as precedent, not overruled.
107689	105176	no	no	100	The provided text cites *United States v. Morgan*, 346 U.S. 502 (1954), as precedent supporting the conclusion that the petitioner's case is not moot due to collateral consequences.  There is no language suggesting that *Morgan* is overruled, in whole or in part. The Court explicitly relies on *Morgan*’s holding. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Morgan* has been overruled.
107689	107631	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Walker v. Wainwright* (1968) as a relevant precedent in the context of habeas corpus relief.  There is no language suggesting the overruling of *Walker v. Wainwright*. The court cites it as support for the idea that habeas corpus relief can extend beyond immediate release from custody.  The opinion shows the court considered *Walker v. Wainwright* as relevant precedent, and not overruled.
107689	105722	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Eskridge v. Washington Prison Board* but does not overrule it.  The text cites *Eskridge* along with other cases in the context of discussing the implications of *Nowakowski v. Maroney*. The court uses the phrase "cf." before citing *Eskridge*, indicating that the case is being cited for comparison or analogy, not as direct precedent being overruled or followed.  No language suggests the court is rejecting, modifying, or limiting *Eskridge*'s holding.
107689	103486	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Ex parte Hull* but does not overrule it.  The mention is in the context of comparing the scope of habeas corpus relief, noting that the 1966 amendments to the statute contemplated relief beyond immediate release from custody.  This is not an overruling but rather a discussion of the case's relevance to the interpretation of a later statute.
107685	102879	no	yes	95	The excerpts explicitly state that *Palko v. Connecticut* is overruled insofar as it applies to the right to a jury trial in serious criminal cases.  The opinion states that *Palko* contained "dicta asserting that the right to jury trial is not essential to ordered liberty and may be dispensed with by the States regardless of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments."  The Court explicitly rejects this dicta, stating that previous cases relied upon by the state, including *Palko*, did not deal with situations where a state dispensed entirely with a jury trial for serious criminal cases.  The Court then establishes that the right to a jury trial in serious criminal cases is a fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment.  This directly contradicts the holding of *Palko*, thus overruling it.  Therefore, it meets condition 2 and 4.
107685	106862	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Malloy v. Hogan*, but does not overrule it.  While some passages discuss the Court's past approaches to applying the Bill of Rights to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment and express disagreements with earlier dicta or approaches in cases like *Palko v. Connecticut*,  none of these actions constitute an overruling of *Malloy v. Hogan*. In fact, one passage explicitly states that the author considers themselves "bound by the Court's holding in Malloy with respect to self-incrimination."
107685	107014	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Pointer v. Texas*, referencing it as a precedent for applying the Sixth Amendment's right to confrontation of witnesses to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.  There is no language suggesting that *Pointer v. Texas* is overruled, qualified, or limited in any way. Instead, the citing opinions consistently affirm and utilize *Pointer* as a valid and relevant authority.
107685	1236300	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Powell v. Alabama* multiple times.  However, in no instance does it suggest that the case has been overruled. Instead, the excerpts discuss the application and interpretation of *Powell v. Alabama*'s principles, particularly concerning the right to counsel and its incorporation through the Fourteenth Amendment.  The opinions use *Powell v. Alabama* as precedent and examine its relevance in subsequent cases, showing its continued importance in discussions of due process, rather than indicating its overruling.
107685	102801	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *District of Columbia v. Clawans*, referencing its holding regarding the penalty authorized for a crime as a factor in determining whether it is serious enough to require a jury trial.  The citing case uses *Clawans* as precedent to support its reasoning on the required jury trial in a case involving simple battery.  There is no language suggesting that *Clawans* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court instead uses the case's framework to guide its analysis. Therefore, there is no basis to claim *Clawans* has been overruled.
107685	106545	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Gideon v. Wainwright multiple times.  However, none of the excerpts suggest that Gideon v. Wainwright was overruled.  Instead, the case is cited as precedent in discussions regarding the application of Sixth Amendment rights (right to counsel) to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.  The excerpts discuss the evolution of legal interpretation regarding the incorporation of Bill of Rights protections into the Fourteenth Amendment, and Gideon is referenced within this broader context, not as a case that has been overturned.
107685	95204	yes	no	95	The excerpts repeatedly cite *Maxwell v. Dow*, but do not explicitly overrule it.  Instead, the opinion distinguishes *Maxwell v. Dow*. The opinion notes that *Maxwell v. Dow* held that no provision of the Bill of Rights applied to the States (a position long since repudiated) and that the Due Process Clause did not prevent a State from trying a defendant for a noncapital offense with fewer than 12 jurors.  The court states that *Maxwell v. Dow* did not deal with a case in which no jury at all had been provided.  The opinion further discusses dicta in *Maxwell v. Dow*, asserting that the right to a jury trial is not essential to ordered liberty and may be dispensed with by the States regardless of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The court labels these assertions as dicta unsupported by holdings that a state may refuse a jury trial.  The court's reasoning is based on distinguishing the facts and holding of the cited case. While the court criticizes aspects of the *Maxwell v. Dow* holding, it does not explicitly overturn it.
107685	106259	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Irvin v. Dowd* multiple times but does not overrule it.  The excerpts cite *Irvin v. Dowd* as precedent, showing that the court either followed it or referenced it without directly addressing its validity. There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly,  nor does the text offer any qualifications or distinctions related to *Irvin v. Dowd*. The case is mentioned as a supporting authority and is treated as a valid precedent.
107746	105055	yes	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the holding in Schwartz v. Texas is overruled because its doctrinal underpinning in Wolf v. Colorado was removed by Mapp v. Ohio, which overruled Wolf.  The court further explains that the decision is supported by the "imperative of judicial integrity" and experience showing the ineffectiveness of relying on penal provisions alone to enforce § 605. The dissenting opinions do not change the fact that the majority opinion explicitly overrules Schwartz.
107746	104709	no	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that *Mapp v. Ohio* overruled *Wolf v. Colorado*.  The excerpt highlights that the doctrinal underpinning of *Schwartz v. Texas*, which relied on *Wolf v. Colorado*, was removed by *Mapp v. Ohio*. The court explicitly states that in overruling *Wolf*, *Mapp* imposed a judicially devised exclusionary rule to prevent states from permitting the invasion of rights protected by federal organic law.  This directly addresses the precedent set by *Wolf v. Colorado* and declares it no longer good law in the context of state court admissibility of evidence obtained through unreasonable searches.
107746	102883	no	no	95	The provided text discusses Nardone v. United States (1937) and its relevance to the admissibility of illegally intercepted communications in court.  While the opinion mentions later cases that modify or clarify the application of the principles established in Nardone, there is no explicit statement that Nardone itself is overruled.  The text highlights how subsequent cases like Schwartz v. Texas addressed the issue of admissibility in state courts, leading to a different conclusion.  However, this doesn't equate to overruling Nardone. The opinion analyzes and discusses Nardone's holding, especially regarding the inadmissibility of illegally intercepted communications in federal courts, but does not declare it to be overruled.
107746	98094	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Weeks v. United States in the context of discussing the admissibility of evidence in state courts.  The excerpt highlights the Court's prior decision in Schwartz v. Texas, which addressed the applicability of § 605 of the Communications Act to state court proceedings.  While the dissenting opinion suggests that the Court might change its interpretation of Schwartz,  it does not explicitly overrule Weeks v. United States. The focus is on the interpretation of § 605 and its relationship to state court evidence, not on overruling Weeks itself.  There is no language suggesting that Weeks is no longer good law or that any part of its holding is invalid.
107746	106107	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Elkins v. United States*, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the opinion uses *Elkins* as precedent, supporting its decision by referencing the principles established in that case.  The court aligns its reasoning with *Elkins* concerning the exclusionary rule and the need to compel respect for federal law.
107606	104585	no	no	95	The court considered the relevance of the "required records" doctrine established in Shapiro v. United States.  The court ultimately determined that Shapiro was distinguishable from the case at hand, highlighting several key differences.  The court did not explicitly overrule Shapiro, nor did it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the court found Shapiro inapplicable to the current circumstances because of the differences between the facts. Therefore, Shapiro was not overruled.
107606	105090	yes	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the Court granted certiorari to re-examine the constitutionality of the wagering tax statutes and to consider whether Kahriger and Lewis still have vitality.  The Court ultimately concludes that the provisions of the statutes may not be used to criminally punish those who asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege.  This directly overrules the precedent set in Kahriger, which held that the privilege against self-incrimination could not be asserted in similar circumstances.  The Court's explicit questioning of the continued validity of Kahriger, coupled with its reversal of a judgment based on Kahriger, constitutes an explicit overruling.
107606	101083	no	no	95	The excerpt does not explicitly overrule *United States v. Sullivan*.  While the excerpt discusses *Sullivan* and its relevance to the current case, it does not use language indicating that *Sullivan* is overruled. The court distinguishes *Sullivan*, noting differences in the circumstances and applying different reasoning. The court mentions that *Sullivan*'s reasoning does not apply to the current case, but this is a distinction, not an overruling.  The court questions the continued force of cases that relied on *Sullivan*, but doesn't explicitly overrule *Sullivan* itself. Therefore, based on the provided text, there's no indication that *United States v. Sullivan* has been overruled.
107606	105280	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that the reasoning in Lewis v. United States (1955) is "no longer persuasive."  The court directly addresses the precedent set in Lewis, finding its core logic flawed and insufficient to uphold the challenged statutes against Fifth Amendment claims.  This constitutes an overruling, as the court rejects the prior holding and establishes a new standard for evaluating the constitutionality of these wagering tax statutes.
107606	107110	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Albertson v. SACB*, referencing its holding that those engaged in wagering are a group "inherently suspect of criminal activities."  However, there is no indication that the court overruled,  modified, or qualified *Albertson v. SACB* in any way. The citing opinions use *Albertson* as precedent, supporting their own conclusions.  Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest *Albertson v. SACB* was overruled.
107606	106864	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Murphy v. Waterfront Commission, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the Court considers the relevance of Murphy in the context of the case before it, suggesting that it might offer a way to resolve the conflict between taxing powers and the privilege against self-incrimination.  The Court does not reject or modify the holding of Murphy, but rather explores whether its principles can be applied to the current situation.  This is not an overruling, but a consideration of the applicability of precedent.
107679	102317	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that it is re-examining McNally v. Hill (1934) and concludes that the decision in that case was "compelled neither by statute nor by history and that today it represents an indefensible barrier to prompt adjudication of constitutional claims in the federal courts."  This constitutes an explicit overruling of the prior decision. The court further points out that the McNally decision is inconsistent with the subsequent development of the writ of habeas corpus.
107679	106507	no	no	100	The provided text cites Jones v. Cunningham multiple times.  The court uses the case to support its argument about the writ of habeas corpus not being a static or narrow remedy, stating that what was said in Jones v. Cunningham is "equally applicable here."  The court does overrule McNally v. Hill, but this is a separate case and not Jones v. Cunningham.  There is no language suggesting that Jones v. Cunningham has been overruled, in whole or in part. The court explicitly relies on Jones v. Cunningham as precedent. Therefore, there is no indication that Jones v. Cunningham has been overruled.
107679	100122	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Moore v. Dempsey several times.  However, it does not overrule it. Instead, the text uses Moore v. Dempsey as a supporting precedent for the court's decision to overrule McNally v. Hill. The court explicitly states that its decision is consistent with and reaffirms Moore v. Dempsey.
107679	106548	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Fay v. Noia* multiple times, but it does not overrule it.  The text focuses on overruling or clarifying the precedent set by *McNally v. Hill*, contrasting its approach with that of *Fay v. Noia* and other cases which the court cites as reaffirming the principles supporting the writ of habeas corpus.  The court uses *Fay v. Noia* as support for its interpretation and application of habeas corpus, indicating it is still considered good law in the context of the decision. There is no language suggesting that *Fay v. Noia* has been overruled, either fully or partially.
107980	107685	no	no	95	The provided text discusses the overruling of *Palko v. Connecticut*, not *Duncan v. Louisiana*. While *Duncan v. Louisiana* is cited multiple times, the text focuses on the rejection of the Palko standard and its inconsistency with the Court's more recent approach to incorporating the Bill of Rights through the Fourteenth Amendment.  There is no language suggesting that *Duncan v. Louisiana* itself has been overruled.
107980	102879	yes	yes	95	The provided text shows that the Court's opinion indicates that *Palko v. Connecticut* has been overruled.  The opinion explicitly states that *Palko* is "another casualty in the so far unchecked march toward 'incorporating' much, if not all, of the Federal Bill of Rights into the Due Process Clause."  This is functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling the case, satisfying condition 2 for overruling.  Furthermore, the opinion mentions that the Court has "increasingly looked to the specific guarantees of the [Bill of Rights] to determine whether a state", which directly contradicts the approach taken in *Palko*. The opinion highlights a shift in the Court's approach, essentially declaring *Palko* 'no longer good law' in the context of the evolving understanding of the Due Process Clause, satisfying condition 6.
107980	94515	no	no	95	The provided text cites *United States v. Ball* multiple times.  However, it does not contain language that overrules, explicitly or implicitly, the case. The opinion refers to *Ball* as precedent and discusses its relevance to the concept of "waiver" in double jeopardy cases.  The court clarifies and expands on the concepts introduced in *Ball*, particularly regarding the implications of appealing a conviction in the context of double jeopardy, but does not overturn or invalidate the holding in *Ball* itself.
107980	107730	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Sibron v. New York several times.  However, none of the mentions indicate that the case was overruled. Instead, the Court cites *Sibron* as precedent regarding the mootness of criminal cases even when concurrent sentences exist, highlighting the possibility of collateral legal consequences that keep the case justiciable.  There is no language suggesting overruling, partial overruling, or any qualification of the case's holding.
107980	106862	no	no	95	The provided text shows that the Court overruled *Palko v. Connecticut*, not *Malloy v. Hogan*.  While *Malloy v. Hogan* is mentioned in the context of the Court rejecting the Palko standard, there is no language suggesting that *Malloy v. Hogan* itself was overruled.  The opinion explicitly states that *Palko* is overruled insofar as it is inconsistent with the holding that the double jeopardy prohibition of the Fifth Amendment applies to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  The dissenting opinion also mentions *Malloy v. Hogan*, but this does not constitute an overruling.
107965	104914	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Dennis v. United States* multiple times.  In one instance, the court states that *Whitney v. California*, which had previously upheld a criminal syndicalism statute, "has been thoroughly discredited by later decisions. See Dennis v. United States, 341 U. S. 494, at 507 (1951)."  This indicates that *Dennis* is cited as a case that helped discredit *Whitney*, not that *Dennis* itself was overruled.  In another section, the court explicitly overrules *Whitney v. California* and states that the contrary teaching of *Whitney* "cannot be supported".  The court's mention of *Dennis* in other places does not suggest it was overruled, but rather that it is being distinguished or its application clarified in subsequent cases.  No language suggests that *Dennis* is overruled, fully or partially, or is no longer good law in certain contexts. Therefore, there is no indication based on the provided text that *Dennis v. United States* (1951) was overruled.
107965	102821	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Herndon v. Lowry multiple times.  In the first mention, it's cited as supporting the principle that abstract teaching of violence is different from preparing a group for violent action. In the second mention, the text notes that Herndon v. Lowry overturned a conviction for exercising First Amendment rights due to a lack of evidence of incitement. Neither of these instances suggests that Herndon v. Lowry itself was overruled.  The text discusses the evolution of legal principles around incitement and free speech, referencing several cases that have modified or clarified precedents, but there is no indication that Herndon v. Lowry has been overruled.
107965	105537	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Yates v. United States* multiple times.  In both instances, the citation is used to support the legal principle that advocacy of the use of force or law violation is only punishable when directed at inciting imminent lawless action and likely to produce such action.  There is no language suggesting the Court overruled *Yates*. Instead, *Yates* is presented as precedent clarifying and refining the "clear and present danger" test. The excerpts emphasize the distinction between abstract teaching of violence and active preparation for it, a distinction established in *Yates*. Therefore, the case was not overruled, but rather cited and followed.
107965	99321	no	no	95	The excerpt focuses on the "clear and present danger" test established in Schenck v. United States and its application in subsequent cases, including Frohwerk v. United States.  The excerpt does not indicate that Frohwerk was overruled.  Instead, it uses Frohwerk as an example of how the Court applied the Schenck test in a case concerning wartime speech.  The excerpt describes the facts and holding of Frohwerk, showing how the court used the "clear and present danger" test to uphold the conviction.
107965	99322	no	no	95	The provided text refers to *Debs v. United States*,  mentions its application of the "clear and present danger" test, and cites it as precedent (using "Ibid.").  There is no language suggesting the overruling of *Debs v. United States*, either explicitly or implicitly.  The text discusses dissenting opinions in subsequent cases (like *Abrams v. United States*) that questioned the application of the test, but those dissents did not themselves overrule the precedent set in *Debs*. The opinions show the application and further development of the precedent established by *Debs v. United States*, not its overruling.
107965	101097	yes	yes	100	The excerpt explicitly states that "The Court quite properly overrules Whitney v. California", which is the case of interest.  Therefore, the case has been overruled.
107979	104769	yes	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the decision in *United States v. Rabinowitz* has been overruled, at least in part.  The opinion notes that the rationale in *Rabinowitz*, which allowed warrantless searches extending to areas under the control of the arrested person, "can withstand neither historical nor rational analysis."  Further, the court points out that even on its own facts, *Rabinowitz* was not based on a strong line of authority and that its approach disregarded earlier cases. The court also highlights the dissent in *Rabinowitz*, which criticized its reasoning.  Therefore, while not explicitly stated as a full overruling in a single sentence, the cumulative effect of the language used demonstrates that *Rabinowitz* is no longer good law, at least in the broad sense it was applied in the current case. The later case of *Chimel v. California* is cited as overruling *Rabinowitz*. 
107979	106641	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Ker v. California* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpts discuss *Ker* in relation to other cases and evolving Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, but they don't state that *Ker* is no longer good law or that its principles have been rejected.  Instead, the text shows that *Ker* was cited as precedent, sometimes even within dissenting or concurring opinions.
107979	106021	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Abel v. United States*, but never indicates that the case has been overruled.  In fact, it's presented as a precedent supporting the Court's position in several instances. One instance mentions distinguishing *Kremen v. United States* from *Abel*, but this is not an overruling of *Abel*. There is no language suggesting *Abel* is no longer good law, even in specific contexts.
107979	98094	no	no	95	The excerpts cite Weeks v. United States (1914) multiple times. However, the opinion does not explicitly overrule it, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the opinion traces the evolution of the search incident to a lawful arrest doctrine, noting inconsistencies and shifts in emphasis over time. While the opinion critiques aspects of prior interpretations of the doctrine rooted in *Weeks*, it does not declare the case overruled, partially overruled, or no longer good law in specific contexts.  The opinion focuses on clarifying and refining the doctrine, not on explicitly rejecting *Weeks* as precedent. Therefore, while the court's discussion impacts the interpretation of *Weeks*, there is no basis to conclude that the case has been overruled.
107979	104576	no	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that *Trupiano v. United States* was "pro tanto overruled" by *United States v. Rabinowitz*.  This means that at least a portion of the holding in *Trupiano* was overturned.  The passage details a shift in legal precedent, highlighting how *Trupiano*, which emphasized the need for warrants even when arrests are made, was later superseded by a ruling that prioritized the practicality of obtaining warrants in light of the circumstances of the arrest. The analysis further reinforces that this overruling was intentional and not merely a shift in interpretation, directly stating that *Trupiano* was overruled, even describing the legal history as "two about-faces".
107979	101164	no	no	90	The provided text shows that the case *Marron v. United States* was later interpreted more narrowly in *Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States* and *United States v. Lefkowitz*, which limited the scope of permissible searches incident to a lawful arrest.  However, these cases did not explicitly overrule *Marron*.  Later, *Harris v. United States* appeared to reaffirm some aspects of the broader interpretation found in *Marron*. Therefore, while the application and interpretation of *Marron* have been modified and restricted over time, it has not been explicitly overruled.  The subsequent cases refine or clarify *Marron*, rather than explicitly overturning its legal precedent.
107979	101643	no	no	95	The provided text discusses Go-Bart Importing Co. v. United States, and its relationship to other cases.  The text explains that Go-Bart, along with United States v. Lefkowitz, represented a qualification of prior case law regarding searches incident to lawful arrests.  Later cases, such as Harris v. United States, are mentioned as reaffirming or modifying the principles established in these earlier cases. However, none of the excerpts explicitly overrule Go-Bart.  The analysis focuses on how Go-Bart's interpretation of search and seizure law has evolved through subsequent case law, rather than directly overruling it.
107979	107729	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Terry v. Ohio* multiple times.  In both instances, the Court refers to the case's holding regarding the "stop and frisk" exception to the warrant requirement.  The Court does not overrule, nor does it modify, the precedent set by *Terry v. Ohio*. Instead, the Court uses *Terry* to support its analysis of the reasonableness of searches incident to an arrest, applying the standard set by *Terry* to a new set of facts.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Terry v. Ohio* has been overruled.
107979	100567	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Carroll v. United States*, and while it discusses the evolution of search-incident-to-arrest doctrine, it does not explicitly overrule *Carroll*.  The excerpts analyze and contextualize *Carroll* within a broader discussion of relevant case law, showing how the Court has modified and refined its approach over time.  This does not constitute overruling.  While the Court notes inconsistencies and shifts in emphasis in the interpretation of search and seizure, there is no language that indicates *Carroll* is no longer good law or is being overturned.
107979	104422	yes	no	95	The provided text discusses Harris v. United States (1947) in relation to other cases concerning search and seizure.  While the Court mentions that Harris was later qualified or limited by subsequent cases (Trupiano v. United States (1948) and others), there is no explicit statement that Harris was overruled. The text describes a shifting legal landscape where the Court's interpretation of search-incident-to-arrest evolved over time.  The description of the evolution includes phrases like "the pendulum swung again" and that Harris, "but for one brief interlude, clearly been the law until today." This indicates a modification or refinement of the precedent set by Harris, not an outright overruling.  The cited dissenting opinion of Justice Jackson in Harris expresses concern about the limits of the ruling, but it does not constitute an overruling by the Court itself. Therefore, although the legal landscape changed and Harris's interpretation was modified or limited, it wasn't explicitly overruled.
107748	90897	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the Civil Rights Cases (1883),  but does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts extensively discuss and interpret the case, particularly focusing on its relevance to the Thirteenth Amendment and the scope of Congressional power to address racial discrimination.  The citing opinions analyze and attempt to reconcile the holding in *Civil Rights Cases* with their own conclusions regarding the constitutionality of Section 1982.  In some instances, the opinion distinguishes parts of the *Civil Rights Cases* holding, particularly regarding "state action" requirements, but it doesn't explicitly overrule it.  The discussion shows attempts to clarify, expand, or limit the application of *Civil Rights Cases*, but not to overrule it. 
107748	104546	no	no	95	The excerpts analyze and discuss the case *Hurd v. Hodge*, citing it multiple times.  However, there is no language that suggests the case is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The excerpts clarify and expand upon the interpretation of 42 U.S.C. § 1982, but they do not overturn *Hurd v. Hodge*.  Instead, they build upon the precedent set by *Hurd v. Hodge* and address previously unanswered questions related to the scope of the statute. The text focuses on extending the principles of *Hurd v. Hodge* to new situations, not rejecting or modifying the existing ruling.
107748	1447641	yes	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that the case *Hodges v. United States* is overruled insofar as it is inconsistent with the current holding.  The court finds Hodges' interpretation of the Thirteenth Amendment's scope to be irreconcilable with their present position and the amendment's history and purpose. This directly satisfies the criteria for overruling a case, specifically criteria 1 and 4.
107748	100887	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes the case *Corrigan v. Buckley*, discussing its interpretation and relevance in subsequent cases.  While the text notes that *Hurd v. Hodge* mischaracterized *Corrigan v. Buckley*, it does not state that *Corrigan v. Buckley* is overruled. The analysis focuses on clarifying the holding of *Corrigan v. Buckley* and its limitations, rather than explicitly overruling it.  The excerpts show that later cases have questioned or refined its interpretation, but not that it has been overruled.
107748	90040	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes prior court opinions referencing *Virginia v. Rives*.  It points out dicta in *Virginia v. Rives* and *Hurd v. Hodge* suggesting that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (which is relevant to the case of interest) was directed only at governmental action. However, the text does not state that *Virginia v. Rives* is overruled. It clarifies what *Virginia v. Rives* actually held and distinguishes its dicta from the case at hand.  Therefore, based on the provided text, there's no indication that *Virginia v. Rives* has been overruled.
107973	1178568	no	yes	95	The Supreme Court case explicitly overrules the California Supreme Court's reliance on the doctrine of estoppel to bar Lear from proving that Adkins' patent was invalid.  The Court states that the estoppel doctrine, as applied by the California court, is inconsistent with the strong federal policy favoring free competition in ideas.  This directly addresses and contradicts the California Supreme Court's decision in Adkins v. Lear, Inc. (1967), which used the estoppel doctrine to prevent Lear from challenging the patent's validity. The Supreme Court's decision thus qualifies and limits the applicability of the California court's ruling, effectively overruling it insofar as it conflicts with federal patent law.
107973	106758	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc.* in the context of a discussion regarding the validity of the *Hazeltine* rule and the federal policy favoring free competition in ideas.  The court mentions *Compco* alongside *Sears, Roebuck v. Stiffel Co.* as precedents that informed its reconsideration of the *Hazeltine* rule. There is no indication that *Compco* itself was overruled,  modified, or limited in scope.  The excerpt shows the case is considered as precedent, but does not indicate any overruling.
107973	104816	yes	yes	95	The excerpt states that the Court granted certiorari to reconsider the validity of the Hazeltine rule (Automatic Radio Manufacturing Co. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc.) in light of recent decisions emphasizing a strong federal policy favoring free competition.  The Court's decision to reconsider the rule, coupled with its mention of overruling it implicitly by citing cases that emphasize free competition, indicates that the case was overruled, at least in part.  The excerpt also highlights that the Hazeltine rule had been "so eroded" that it could no longer be considered the "general rule." This shows that, even if not explicitly stated, the court's actions function as an overruling.
107973	106757	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.* (1964) multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text references *Sears, Roebuck* alongside *Compco Corp. v. Day-Brite Lighting, Inc.* as cases that informed a later decision, and mentions a Justice's opinion that partially disagreed with the *Sears, Roebuck* and *Compco* holdings, but doesn't state that either case was overruled. The court's mention of the case is used to inform the current case's reasoning, not to overturn the precedent set by *Sears, Roebuck*. Therefore, there is no indication that *Sears, Roebuck & Co. v. Stiffel Co.* was overruled.
107973	100520	no	no	85	The excerpt discusses Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Co. v. Formica Insulation Co. (1924) and its limitations on licensee estoppel.  The court details how subsequent cases have narrowed the scope of the estoppel doctrine, creating exceptions that allow judicial scrutiny of patent validity.  The excerpt does not explicitly overrule Formica, but rather describes it as an anomaly and shows how its limitations led to inconsistencies in the application of the estoppel doctrine.  The court describes the limitations put on the estoppel rule by *Formica* as "radically inconsistent with the premises upon which the "general rule" is based."  It indicates that Formica's approach was later followed and even expanded upon by other courts, suggesting that it was not fully overruled but rather its application was refined or limited by later decisions.  Therefore, there is no explicit overruling; rather the court charts how *Formica*'s influence has evolved in the context of a changing legal precedent.
107973	104194	no	no	95	The provided text describes the Supreme Court's decision in *Scott Paper Co. v. Marcalus Manufacturing Co.* (1945) and its impact on patent estoppel.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Scott Paper* was overruled. The excerpt traces the evolution of legal precedent related to patent estoppel, showing how *Scott Paper* itself modified earlier interpretations (like *Formica*), but it does not indicate that *Scott Paper* was later overturned by a subsequent ruling.
107973	103320	no	no	100	The excerpt uses the case *McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique* as precedent, explaining the Court's practice of refusing to consider questions not raised in lower courts.  There is no language suggesting that *McGoldrick* is overruled, nor is there any indication of limiting its application.  The citing opinion follows the precedent set by *McGoldrick*. 
107973	104256	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Wilson v. Cook (1946) as a precedent that reached a similar conclusion to McGoldrick v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique (1940) regarding the Court's practice of refusing to issue pronouncements on questions not urged or decided in state courts.  There is no language suggesting that Wilson v. Cook is overruled, explicitly or implicitly. The text cites Wilson v. Cook as support for the Court's approach, indicating it is being followed, not overruled.
107973	106930	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Brulotte v. Thys Co., but does not overrule it.  The citation is used for comparison and context within the discussion of royalty recovery following patent invalidation. There is no language suggesting the court is rejecting, modifying, or limiting the holding of Brulotte.  The mention is more of a comparative reference than an overruling.
107919	106850	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Reynolds v. Sims, but it does not contain any language that would suggest it has been overruled.  The excerpts discuss Reynolds v. Sims and its principles, either agreeing with its holding or distinguishing this case from Reynolds v. Sims. There is no explicit overruling, nor any language functionally equivalent to overruling.  The citing opinions either follow or distinguish Reynolds v. Sims, without suggesting that the case is no longer good law or should be limited in any way.
107919	104593	yes	no	85	The court in this opinion discusses MacDougall v. Green extensively and does not explicitly overrule it. While the court's decision in this case implicitly challenges the reasoning of MacDougall v. Green, it does not explicitly state that MacDougall is overruled.  The court acknowledges MacDougall and its holding, but proceeds to present a different interpretation based on subsequent case law (Baker v Carr) and changes in the political landscape. This does not meet any of the criteria of being overruled.
107919	107449	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Dusch v. Davis* multiple times. However, in both instances, the court is merely distinguishing it from the case at hand, stating that it is "not relevant" and later describing it as a case that "held proper" a certain requirement, which the court finds inapplicable to the current situation.  There is no language suggesting that *Dusch v. Davis* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court differentiates *Dusch v. Davis* based on its facts and holding, rather than overruling its legal principles.
107919	104311	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Colegrove v. Green (1946), but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpt notes that Colegrove's classification of certain issues as 'political' rather than 'justiciable' was overturned in Baker v. Carr.  The excerpt cites Colegrove as the authority for denying relief in a previous case. The excerpt uses Colegrove as a contrast to later cases which addressed the issue of equal voting power,  but it does not explicitly overrule Colegrove, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The later cases cited (Baker v. Carr and Gray v. Sanders) address the issue of equal protection in voting and refine legal understanding, but this does not constitute overruling Colegrove.
107919	106366	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Baker v. Carr* as precedent, stating that it authoritatively resolved the question of justiciability in cases involving unequal voter classifications.  This is the opposite of overruling; it affirms the case's continued relevance and authority.  The excerpt uses *Baker v. Carr* to support its argument. There is no language suggesting that *Baker v. Carr* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
108114	105687	yes	no	95	The excerpts discuss the case *Hoag v. New Jersey*, referencing it multiple times.  However, the opinion does not explicitly overrule *Hoag*.  Instead, the court distinguishes *Hoag* from the present case, noting that *Hoag* was decided under a Fourteenth Amendment due process lens while the current case involves a Fifth Amendment double jeopardy analysis, and the intervening decision of *Benton v. Maryland* changed the legal landscape.  The court explains that its decision in the current case does not conflict with *Hoag* because the legal standards and analyses are different. Therefore, while *Hoag* is discussed at length and its application to the present situation is rejected, the court does not overrule the prior precedent. Justices also concur and reference *Hoag* and express their view of it being overturned or distinguished based on the facts of the current case and intervening precedence.   Several concurring opinions mention *Hoag*, but these do not constitute a majority opinion explicitly overruling the case.
108114	105860	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts from the court opinions discuss *Abbate v. United States*, but do not overrule it.  The excerpts are primarily from concurring and dissenting opinions, which express different views on the application of double jeopardy principles, but none state explicitly or implicitly that *Abbate* is overruled.  Instead, the opinions cite *Abbate* and engage with its reasoning, suggesting it remains relevant to the discussions of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel.
108114	107978	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites North Carolina v. Pearce (1969), but it does not contain any language suggesting that the case has been overruled.  The citations are used to support the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause and its retroactive effect, indicating the case is being followed as precedent, not overruled.
108114	107980	no	no	95	The excerpts from Ashe v. Swenson repeatedly cite Benton v. Maryland, referencing its holding that the Fifth Amendment's double jeopardy protection applies to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment.  The opinion in Ashe v. Swenson elaborates on and applies the precedent set by Benton, rather than overruling it.  No language suggests overruling, partial overruling, or qualification of Benton's holding.
108114	105594	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Green v. United States*, but there is no indication that it has been overruled.  The excerpts show the case being referenced as precedent, supporting arguments about double jeopardy and collateral estoppel.  There is no language suggesting it has been overturned, limited, or modified in any way; instead, the opinions either follow or utilize its principles.
108154	106432	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that it is overruling Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson (1962) because it was erroneously decided and subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity.  This directly satisfies condition #1 for overruling a case.
108154	105511	no	no	95	The provided text discusses Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills (1957) extensively and cites it multiple times as precedent.  The court refers to the case's holding on the substantive law to apply in suits under § 301(a) and its decision on the availability of specific performance to enforce arbitration agreements.  There is no language suggesting the overruling of Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills. The opinion clarifies and elaborates on aspects of the case's application and implications but does not overturn or contradict its core holding. While it analyzes the case's relation to subsequent cases and policy developments, it does not explicitly overrule it, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to an overruling.
108154	107655	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss the case *Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge 735*, but they do not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts analyze the relationship between *Avco* and another case, *Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson*. The court ultimately overrules *Sinclair*, not *Avco*.  While the justices discuss *Avco* in their consideration of overturning *Sinclair*, this does not constitute overruling *Avco* itself. There is no language indicating that *Avco* is no longer good law, is explicitly overruled, or is only partially valid.  The discussion focuses on the combined effect of *Avco* and *Sinclair*, concluding that their interaction creates an anomalous situation requiring the reconsideration of *Sinclair*. Thus, *Avco* remains unaffected by the court's decision.
108154	103292	no	no	95	The excerpt discusses Helvering v. Hallock (1940), but only cites it as precedent regarding stare decisis, not to overrule it.  The court uses Hallock to support the idea that stare decisis is a principle of policy, not a rigid rule, and that reconsideration of prior decisions is sometimes warranted.  The excerpt does not state that Hallock itself is overruled, nor does it offer any contradictory language or reasoning that would qualify as overruling it.  The discussion focuses on overruling Sinclair, a different case. Therefore, there is no indication that Helvering v. Hallock has been overruled.
108164	105594	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Green v. United States*, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the opinion uses *Green* as precedent and aligns the current case with the reasoning of *Green*. The court's analysis relies heavily on Green's principles regarding double jeopardy and retrials.  No language suggests that Green is no longer good law or is overruled in any way; rather it is used to support the court's decision.  The opinion distinguishes other cases from *Green* (such as Trono) but explicitly applies *Green*'s logic to the case at hand.
108164	1276937	no	no	95	The provided text does not contain any language suggesting that Price v. State (1968) has been overruled.  The excerpt discusses Price v. State (1968) and its reliance on Brantley v. State (1909), but it does not indicate that Price v. State (1968) itself is no longer good law or has been overturned. The text focuses on whether Brantley v. State is still a binding precedent, and the court's decision to reverse does not necessarily imply the overruling of Price v. State (1968).
108164	97237	yes	yes	100	The excerpt explicitly states that the Brantley v. State holding is no longer a viable authority and must be deemed to have been overruled by subsequent decisions of the Court.  This directly satisfies condition 1 for overruling a case.
108164	94515	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes and discusses *United States v. Ball*, citing it multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the court overruled *United States v. Ball*. The excerpt explains the Court's interpretation of *Ball* concerning double jeopardy and its rejection of the view that double jeopardy prevents a second trial when a conviction has been set aside.  The discussion focuses on interpreting and applying *Ball*, not overruling it.  Therefore, the case is not overruled in this excerpt.
108164	1395638	no	no	100	The provided text cites Price v. State (1968) but does not offer any indication that it has been overruled.  The excerpt describes the case's procedural history and its relation to other cases, but contains no language suggesting overruling, limiting, or qualifying the precedent set by Price v. State (1968).
108164	268703	no	no	95	The provided text does not contain any language that would indicate that the case of interest, United States ex rel. Hetenyi v. Wilkins, 348 F.2d 844 (C.A. 2d Cir. 1965), has been overruled. The citing case mentions and discusses Hetenyi, but does not explicitly overrule it, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The citing court uses Hetenyi to support its reasoning, implying that it is still considered valid precedent in this context.  Therefore, there is no indication of overruling based on the provided excerpts.
108186	107685	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Duncan v. Louisiana*, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts from *Williams v. Florida* extensively discuss and analyze *Duncan*, using it as precedent to determine whether a six-person jury satisfies the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial.  The court in *Williams* interprets and applies *Duncan*, clarifying aspects of the right to a jury trial, but does not overturn the original holding of *Duncan*. The opinion references *Duncan*'s historical analysis of the jury trial, its purpose of preventing governmental oppression, and its guarantee of trial by jury in criminal cases, all without suggesting that *Duncan* is no longer good law.
108186	94866	yes	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Thompson v. Utah*, referencing its holding that the Sixth Amendment guarantees a 12-person jury.  While the author expresses some disagreement with the reasoning in *Thompson*, and questions its continued relevance, there is no explicit overruling of the case. The author argues for a different interpretation or application of the Sixth Amendment, but stops short of declaring *Thompson* to be no longer good law.  The text highlights that the Court has not explicitly overturned *Thompson*, and the cited opinions frequently reaffirm its holding, albeit sometimes in dicta.
108186	95043	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule Capital Traction Co. v. Hof (1899).  Instead, it cites the case in support of an argument about interpreting the Seventh Amendment's jury trial provisions. The excerpt mentions that the case leaps from the fact that the jury possessed a certain feature at common law to the conclusion that that feature must have been preserved by the Amendment's simple reference to trial by "jury."  There is no language suggesting overruling.  The excerpt also notes that while the discussion bears on the Seventh Amendment's interpretation, the court is not deciding whether additional references to "common law" would support a different interpretation, which is not an overruling but rather a matter of qualification for certain contexts. Thus, this case is merely cited as precedent, and no part of the case is overruled.
108186	106862	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Malloy v. Hogan*, referencing its holding that the same standards must determine whether an accused's silence is justified in federal or state proceedings.  There is no language suggesting that *Malloy v. Hogan* has been overruled.  Instead, the excerpts show the case being cited as precedent in later cases, either to support similar holdings or to contrast its approach with the approach taken in later decisions.  The opinions may disagree with *Malloy v. Hogan*'s reasoning or application in specific instances, but this does not amount to an overruling.
108186	96270	no	yes	85	The provided text indicates that the Supreme Court case *Rasmussen v. United States*, 197 U.S. 516 (1905), which held invalid a conviction by a six-man jury in Alaska, is implicitly overruled. The Court's reasoning in the excerpt challenges the previous assumption that features of the common-law jury were necessarily preserved in the Constitution, specifically the 12-person jury requirement. While the excerpt does not explicitly state that *Rasmussen* is overruled, the underlying principles are questioned and contradicted.  The Court's discussion highlights that past decisions, including *Rasmussen*, relied on an oversimplified understanding of the historical relationship between common-law juries and the constitutional right to a jury trial.  The Court states that "Subsequent decisions have reaffirmed the announcement in Thompson, often in dictum and usually by relyingwhere there was any discussion of the issue at allsolely on the fact that the common-law jury consisted of 12."  This indicates that *Rassmussen*, among other cases, is being implicitly overruled because it falls into the pattern of relying on that now-discredited assumption. The new interpretation suggests a more nuanced approach to analyzing the constitutional right to a jury trial, undermining the core principle supporting *Rasmussen*'s decision.
108186	92280	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case of *Callan v. Wilson* multiple times.  However, it does not contain language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The excerpts use *Callan v. Wilson* as precedent, referencing its holding on the right to a jury trial. There is no language suggesting it has been overturned, limited, or qualified in any way.  The citing opinions seem to agree with *Callan v. Wilson*'s understanding of the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. 
108186	106641	no	no	100	The provided text expresses Justice Harlan's disagreement with the Court's approach to selective incorporation, particularly mentioning his concurring opinion in *Ker v. California*.  Nowhere does the text state that *Ker v. California* was overruled.  Instead, the excerpt highlights Justice Harlan's consistent opposition to the Court's incorporation methodology and cites *Ker* as an example of a case where he disagreed with the majority.  Therefore, the case was not overruled in this excerpt.
108186	102801	no	no	95	The provided text cites *District of Columbia v. Clawans* multiple times. However, none of these citations suggest that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the citing opinion uses *Clawans* as precedent, referencing its distinctions between "petty" and "serious" offenses, and the consideration of both the severity of punishment and the nature of the offense in determining the right to a jury trial.  The opinion engages in detailed analysis and interpretation of *Clawans*, but does not state it is overruled, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Therefore, there is no indication that *District of Columbia v. Clawans* has been overruled.
108186	107486	no	no	95	The excerpt expresses disagreement with the holding in *United States v. Wade*, stating that the Court incorrectly required counsel in circumstances where his presence was not necessary under the Sixth Amendment or Due Process Clause.  However, this is a critique of the holding, not an overruling.  The excerpt does not meet any of the criteria for overruling as defined; it does not state that *Wade* has been overruled, use functionally equivalent language, partially overrule it, or limit its application to specific circumstances.
108362	90728	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States v. Harris* and discusses its relevance to the interpretation of related statutes.  However, there is no indication that the court overrules *United States v. Harris*. Instead, the court engages in a detailed analysis of the case's holding and its implications for the case at hand. The court distinguishes the precedent set in *United States v. Harris* based on differences in statutory interpretations and the evolution of legal thought regarding the scope of Congressional power under the 13th and 14th Amendments.  The court does not explicitly overrule *United States v. Harris*, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to an overruling.  Instead, the opinion distinguishes and clarifies how *United States v. Harris* applies in certain contexts but remains valid in others.
108362	107201	no	no	95	The provided text cites *United States v. Guest*, but does not overrule it.  While the text mentions *United States v. Guest* multiple times, it does so without any language suggesting overruling, qualification, or limitation of the case's holding.  The citations appear to be used to support the court's reasoning in the current case, indicating that *United States v. Guest* is being treated as precedent, not overruled.
108362	107748	no	no	95	The provided text cites Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. as precedent, stating that the Court's approach to Reconstruction civil rights statutes has been to "accord [them] a sweep as broad as [their] language."  This indicates the Court is following, not overruling, the precedent set by Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.  There is no language suggesting overruling, partial overruling, or any limitation on the case's application.
108362	96885	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Twining v. New Jersey* but does not overrule it.  The excerpts cite *Twining* as support for the proposition that the right to interstate travel is constitutionally protected and that Congress has the power to protect this right through legislation.  There is no language suggesting the Court rejects, modifies, or limits the holding in *Twining*. The mention of *Twining* is used to support the current ruling, not to overturn it.
108362	104918	yes	no	-1	CITE_NOT_FOUND
108350	103548	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that it can no longer adhere to the doctrine of Kesler and Reitz.  The court's statement that it is "at odds with the approach taken in nearly all our Supremacy Clause cases" and would enable state legislatures to "nullify nearly all unwanted federal legislation" strongly implies overruling.  While not explicitly stating that Reitz v. Mealey is overruled, the court effectively renders its holding obsolete by adopting a contradictory approach to Supremacy Clause cases. The court's decision to overturn the precedent established in Kesler and Reitz is a clear indication of overruling, even if not explicitly stated. 
108350	1198518	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes and discusses the case *Schecter v. Killingsworth*, citing it multiple times to explain the relevant Arizona state law.  However, there is no language suggesting the court overruled *Schecter v. Killingsworth*. The text focuses on the conflict between Arizona's Financial Responsibility Act and federal law, using *Schecter v. Killingsworth*'s interpretation of the state act.  The opinion expresses a differing view on the purpose of the Arizona statute from that of the Arizona Supreme Court in *Schecter*, but stops short of overruling it. The court is bound by the Arizona Supreme Court's interpretation.  While the court expresses reservations about the *Kesler* and *Reitz* cases and their compatibility with "sound constitutional principle," these are separate cases and there is no explicit or implicit overruling of *Schecter v. Killingsworth*. 
108350	288328	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites the case 421 F.2d 619 (CA9 1970). However, none of the citations indicate that the case was overruled.  Instead, the text analyzes the case's application to specific facts and argues that the court of appeals' reasoning, in its application to the case of Mrs. Perez, does not comport with the purpose and policy of the Bankruptcy Act and is at odds with the Supremacy Clause.  This is a critique of the application or interpretation of the case, not an overruling of the case itself.
108350	106365	yes	no	95	The provided text mentions Kesler v. Department of Public Safety multiple times.  However, there is no language indicating that the case was overruled.  In fact, the opinion references it as precedent, citing it to support the court's reasoning.  While the court does mention that a jurisdictional issue in Kesler was later overruled in Swift & Co. v. Wickham, this does not affect the holding of Kesler itself on its merits. The court distinguishes Kesler in this case, but it is not overruled.
108350	100616	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Lewis v. Roberts*, but there is no language suggesting it is overruled.  The court uses *Lewis v. Roberts* as precedent in its discussion of bankruptcy law and the "new opportunity" afforded to discharged debtors.  The opinion focuses on the interaction between state financial responsibility laws and the federal Bankruptcy Act, examining whether the state laws conflict with the federal statute's intent.  The court does not challenge the legal principles established in *Lewis v. Roberts*, but rather considers its implications in light of the Arizona Motor Vehicle Safety Responsibility Act.  Therefore, there's no indication that *Lewis v. Roberts* was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
108730	104590	yes	yes	95	The dissenting opinion explicitly states that the Court overrules Ahrens v. Clark.  The majority opinion, while not explicitly stating it overrules the case, significantly alters its interpretation and application, rendering the prior decision's core reasoning obsolete in the context of interstate prisoner habeas corpus petitions.  The Court acknowledges that Ahrens' premise is outdated,  and its rationale is contradicted by subsequent developments and policy considerations. Therefore, even though the majority does not use the word "overrule", it effectively overruled Ahrens v. Clark.
108730	107824	no	no	95	The case *Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky* does not overrule *Smith v. Hooey*.  Instead, it cites *Smith v. Hooey* numerous times as precedent and uses its principles.  The opinion extensively discusses the implications of *Smith v. Hooey* within the context of the speedy trial right and habeas corpus jurisdiction but does not challenge or modify its holding. The court in *Braden* clarifies the application of *Smith v. Hooey*,  not overrules it.
108730	107679	no	no	95	The snippets of the court opinion repeatedly cite the case *Peyton v. Rowe* as precedent that is still good law.  The court explicitly states that its decision in this case follows from and relies upon the holding in *Peyton v. Rowe*. There is no language suggesting that *Peyton v. Rowe* has been overruled, either fully or partially, nor is there any indication that it is no longer good law in specific contexts.  The opinion emphasizes that the court's decision is consistent with the principles established in *Peyton v. Rowe*. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Peyton v. Rowe* was overruled in this case.
108730	91598	no	no	85	The excerpts mention Ex Parte Royall several times.  The dissenting opinion states that the Court "implicitly rejects Ex parte Royall", suggesting it's not being explicitly overruled. However, this is a statement of implicit rejection by a dissenting justice, not an explicit overruling by the majority.  The majority opinion does not explicitly state that it overrules Ex Parte Royall, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Therefore, while the Court's decision may limit the scope or application of Ex Parte Royall in certain contexts, it does not explicitly overrule it.
108730	108193	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Nelson v. George*, but it does not contain any language that explicitly overrules it, nor does it imply that the case is no longer good law.  In one instance, the court notes that the resolution of a dilemma caused by a previous holding in another case is for Congress to address, referencing *Nelson v. George* in a footnote suggesting a need for legislative amendment rather than judicial overruling.  In another instance, the court mentions *Nelson v. George* among a list of cases highlighting a trend in habeas corpus law, without suggesting that *Nelson v. George* is inconsistent with the current holding. Therefore, there is no indication that *Nelson v. George* has been overruled.
108721	102839	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Carmichael v. Southern Coal & Coke Co.* multiple times.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled. Instead, the citing opinions use *Carmichael* to support their own holdings, demonstrating that it is being used as precedent and not overruled.  The text highlights the court's upholding of the unemployment tax in *Carmichael*, emphasizing the wide latitude given to state legislatures in taxation matters, thereby reinforcing, not rejecting, its legal standing.  There is no language suggesting overruling, partial overruling, or limitation of its application to specific circumstances.
108721	2042261	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Lake Shore Auto Parts Co. v. Korzen (1971)*  by citing its Illinois Supreme Court opinion (49 Ill. 2d 137, 273 N.E.2d 592). However, there is no language suggesting that the Supreme Court overruled the case. The text simply refers to the case to explain the preceding legal arguments.  The excerpt describes the Illinois Supreme Court's interpretation of Art. IX-A and its finding that the tax violated the Equal Protection Clause.  No language indicates overruling, modification, or limitation of *Lake Shore Auto Parts Co. v. Korzen*. Therefore, the case has not been overruled in this excerpt.
108721	103290	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Madden v. Kentucky (309 U.S. 83) and describes its holding regarding the constitutionality of a state's ad valorem tax classification.  The excerpt does not suggest that Madden v. Kentucky was overruled. Instead, the Supreme Court cites Madden v. Kentucky as precedent, using its reasoning to support the Court's current decision.  There is no language indicating overruling, either explicit or implicit.
108721	97378	no	no	90	The excerpt describes the dissenters' opinion in  Pennsylvania v. Com. of Pa. that Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. should govern Quaker City Cab.  The excerpt does not indicate that the Court overruled Flint v. Stone Tracy Co. Instead, the excerpt highlights a difference of opinion regarding the applicability of Flint to a similar case, Quaker City Cab.  The Court in Pennsylvania v. Com. of Pa. did not overturn Flint, but instead distinguished it based on the differences in the facts and applicable constitutional amendments.
108721	101317	yes	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Quaker City Cab Co. v. Pennsylvania*, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt discusses the case in relation to the Equal Protection Clause and notes the dissenting opinions.  However, there is no explicit overruling, nor language functionally equivalent to overruling. The court does not qualify, limit the application of, or distinguish the legal principles in *Quaker City Cab Co*.  The excerpt uses the case as a point of comparison in its analysis of the Equal Protection Clause, and does not indicate that *Quaker City Cab Co.* is no longer good law.
108889	101340	yes	no	90	The excerpt states that Liggett Co. v. Baldridge has not been expressly overruled.  While the Court comments disparagingly on Liggett in later cases, criticizing its application of substantive due process, it does not explicitly overrule it. The Court highlights a "shift of emphasis" since Liggett, indicating a change in legal interpretation but not an explicit overruling of the precedent.  Therefore, based on the provided text, Liggett is not considered overruled.
108889	107235	no	no	100	The provided text discusses Mills v. Alabama (1966) and its interpretation of the "finality" requirement for appeals to the Supreme Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1257.  The excerpt explains the Court's decision in Mills, clarifying its understanding of when a state court judgment is considered "final" for the purpose of Supreme Court review.  It does not contain any language suggesting that Mills v. Alabama has been overruled.  Instead, other cases (such as Hudson Distributors) are cited to support similar interpretations of the finality rule, showing that Mills is being used as precedent.
108889	86449	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Forgay v. Conrad* as precedent supporting the concept of a "final" interlocutory decree.  The excerpt does not contain any language suggesting that *Forgay v. Conrad* was overruled, explicitly or implicitly. The Court cites the case as a basis for its decision, indicating that it is still considered relevant legal authority in this context.
108889	104183	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *Radio Station WOW v. Johnson*, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt quotes the case, using it to support the court's reasoning regarding the finality requirement in 28 U.S.C. § 1257.  There is no language suggesting the overruling of *Radio Station WOW v. Johnson*, either explicitly or implicitly.
108990	96819	no	no	95	The court opinion discusses Ex Parte Young extensively, analyzing its implications in the context of Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity and the award of retroactive monetary relief.  It clarifies the scope of Ex Parte Young, particularly concerning when it permits suits seeking monetary awards from state treasuries. The opinion does not explicitly overrule Ex Parte Young but instead interprets and limits its application, particularly in relation to retroactive monetary damages against states.  While the court distinguishes certain scenarios where the precedent may not apply, it does not declare the case overruled. Therefore, based on the given text, Ex Parte Young is not overruled.
108990	106821	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *Parden v. Terminal Railway* multiple times, but do not overrule it.  The court distinguishes *Parden* from the case at hand, noting differences in congressional authorization and state participation in federal programs.  While the court disapproves of some Eleventh Amendment holdings in other cases to the extent they are inconsistent with the current holding, this is not equivalent to overruling *Parden*. The court uses *Parden* as a precedent, even while distinguishing it. Therefore, there is no explicit overruling, nor is there language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The court discusses the precedent set by *Parden*, demonstrating that it is still being considered as part of relevant case law, just not directly applicable to this specific instance.
108990	108763	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Employees of Department of Public Health v. Department of Public Health* (1973). However, in all instances, the citations are used to discuss the precedent set by the case and its relevance to the current case concerning Eleventh Amendment immunity.  There is no language suggesting that the 1973 case has been overruled.  In fact, the court distinguishes its holding from the 1973 case in several instances, indicating an attempt to clarify or refine prior case law, rather than to overturn it.  The court frequently refers back to the case, even in dissenting opinions, suggesting that it is still considered valid precedent, though its interpretation and application may be subject to further clarification.
108990	105869	no	no	95	The excerpt discusses Petty v. Tennessee-Missouri Bridge Comm'n, 359 U.S. 275 (1959), and its relevance to Eleventh Amendment immunity and waiver.  The court uses Petty as a precedent, analyzing the case and its principles.  The excerpt does not explicitly overrule Petty, nor does it employ language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the court seeks to clarify or apply the case's principles within the context of the current case.  While the court might distinguish specific aspects of Petty or limit its application to certain circumstances, this does not constitute an overruling.
108990	104057	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Ford Motor Co. v. Department of Treasury*, referencing its holding on Eleventh Amendment immunity.  The Supreme Court in this opinion does not explicitly overrule *Ford Motor Co.*, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Instead, the court relies on *Ford Motor Co.* as precedent, aligning its own decision with the *Ford Motor Co.* holding.  The court emphasizes that upholding the case before them would require overruling *Ford Motor Co.*, but it ultimately chooses to align itself with the precedent, thus not overruling it.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Ford Motor Co.* was overruled.
108990	307980	no	yes	95	The Supreme Court explicitly reversed the portion of the Court of Appeals decision in *Jordan v. Weaver*, 472 F.2d 985 (7th Cir. 1973), that affirmed the District Court's order for retroactive benefits.  The Supreme Court found that the Court of Appeals erred in its disposition of the Eleventh Amendment claim. This constitutes an explicit overruling of that specific aspect of the *Jordan v. Weaver* decision.
108990	108113	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Rosado v. Wyman*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts discuss and apply the precedent set by *Rosado v. Wyman*, particularly concerning the use of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to enforce the Social Security Act against states and the availability of judicial remedies.  The court's analysis builds upon, rather than contradicts, the holding in *Rosado v. Wyman*. There is no language suggesting that *Rosado v. Wyman* is no longer good law, nor are there any statements explicitly or implicitly overruling the case.
108990	107743	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *King v. Smith* as precedent,  supporting arguments and being explicitly followed. There is no language suggesting it has been overruled,  either fully or partially, nor any indication that its application is limited to specific circumstances or legal principles.  Instead, the excerpts affirm its relevance and continue to use it to support legal reasoning in welfare cases. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *King v. Smith* has been overruled.
108990	305771	no	no	95	The Supreme Court in Edelman v. Jordan explicitly disagreed with the Second Circuit's decision in Rothstein v. Wyman on the issue of retroactive benefits and the Eleventh Amendment.  The Court found that the retroactive payment of benefits infringed on the Eleventh Amendment, while Rothstein v. Wyman had allowed such payments. However, this is a disagreement, not an overruling.  The Supreme Court did not explicitly state that Rothstein v. Wyman was overruled, nor did it use functionally equivalent language. It distinguished the case based on its treatment of the Eleventh Amendment in the context of retroactive benefits versus prospective relief. While the Supreme Court's decision effectively renders Rothstein v. Wyman's treatment of retroactive benefits as no longer good law in that specific context, it doesn't qualify as an overruling in the strictest sense defined.  Therefore, the criteria for overruling according to the provided rules are not met.
108990	102271	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi* multiple times.  In one instance, the court cites *Monaco* to support the principle that the Eleventh Amendment is not a bar to a suit by the United States against a state.  In another instance, the court discusses *Monaco* in relation to the Eleventh Amendment and sovereign immunity, stating that it reaffirmed these principles, suggesting that the court considers *Monaco* to be good law. There is no language suggesting that *Monaco* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court acknowledges and analyzes *Monaco*, but does not indicate that the case's holding or reasoning is no longer valid. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that the case has been overruled.
108990	107901	yes	no	85	The provided text repeatedly cites Shapiro v. Thompson (1969), and mentions that the court's current holding necessitates an "express overruling of several of our recent decisions."  However, there is no explicit statement that Shapiro v. Thompson is overruled.  While the court acknowledges that its new decision conflicts with previous decisions, including those that affirmed retroactive payments (like in Shapiro), it does not explicitly state that Shapiro itself is overruled.  The text suggests the court is overruling the precedent set by the prior cases concerning retroactive payments, not necessarily Shapiro itself.
108990	108075	yes	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Wyman v. Bowens* multiple times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text cites *Wyman v. Bowens* as a precedent in support of the court's decision.  The court affirmed the judgment in *Wyman v. Bowens*, where payments were awarded despite an Eleventh Amendment argument. This indicates that the case is being followed, not overruled.

109252	88869	no	no	95	The excerpt expresses criticism of the rule in *The Pennsylvania* (1874) and its potential for unfair results, particularly when applied to situations with disparate degrees of fault.  However, the excerpt does not state that *The Pennsylvania* case has been overruled.  It acknowledges that courts have tried to mitigate the harshness of *The Pennsylvania* using the "major-minor" fault doctrine, but this is not the same as overruling the precedent. The excerpt cites *The Pennsylvania* and several other cases and implies that it remains relevant case law, despite its potential for inequity. Therefore, there is no explicit or implicit overruling mentioned.
109252	108166	no	no	100	The provided text mentions *Moragne v. States Marine Lines* several times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinion refers to *Moragne* as precedent and uses it to support the court's assertion that the judiciary has a role in shaping admiralty law.  There is no indication of disagreement with *Moragne*'s holding or any attempt to limit or alter its application.
109252	1473714	no	no	90	The excerpt expresses criticism of the divided damages rule and cites Oriental Trading & Transport Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp. as an example of a court's inability to overturn it due to its status as a 'vestigial relic'.  However, there is no explicit overruling or language functionally equivalent to overruling. The excerpt highlights the criticism of the rule, suggesting it produces unfair results and has been 'abrogated by nearly all civilized nations' (per Judge Learned Hand's dissent in another case), but it does not state that Oriental Trading & Transport Co. v. Gulf Oil Corp. itself is overruled.  The case is mentioned as an example of the prevailing, though criticized, legal position.  Therefore, the case remains as precedent, even if its underlying rule is under judicial scrutiny.
109252	92846	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *The Max Morris* but does not overrule it.  The passage critiques the divided damages rule, which *The Max Morris* case dealt with,  arguing that it's an 'archaic and unfair rule'. However, this criticism doesn't explicitly overrule the precedent set by *The Max Morris*. The author suggests a move towards comparative negligence, but this is a suggestion for legal reform, not an overruling of existing case law.
109252	105170	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn (1953) as precedent supporting the application of comparative negligence in admiralty law.  There is no language suggesting the court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the case in any way. The citation is used to support the court's reasoning, indicating the case is being followed, not overruled.
109252	106640	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions Fitzgerald v. United States Lines Co., 374 U.S. 16, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the Court cites Fitzgerald to support its assertion that the Judiciary has traditionally taken the lead in formulating flexible and fair remedies in maritime law, indicating that the Court is following, not overruling, the precedent set by Fitzgerald.
109252	105837	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Kermarec v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique*, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites *Kermarec* as supporting the Court's authority to fashion admiralty law rules, implying the Court is following, not overruling, the precedent set by *Kermarec*. There is no language suggesting the Court finds *Kermarec* to be incorrect or no longer good law.
109252	88790	no	yes	95	The court explicitly overrules the rule in The Sapphire (18 Wall. 51) by stating that the prior method of allocating liability for damages in maritime collisions, as described in The Sapphire, is replaced by a comparative fault standard.  The court replaces the old rule of equally dividing damages when both parties were at fault with a new rule allocating liability proportionally to the degree of each party's fault. This directly contradicts the rule stated in The Sapphire and shows an intent to overrule it.
109252	90646	no	no	95	The provided text cites "The North Star" and describes the rule of divided damages in maritime law.  However, it does not state that the case has been overruled, nor does it use language that is functionally equivalent to overruling it. The text simply explains the rule as it was established in "The North Star" and other cases.  Therefore, there is no indication that "The North Star" has been overruled.
109252	99959	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case of interest, *White Oak Transportation Co. v. Boston, Cape Cod & New York Canal Co.*, multiple times, but it does not contain any language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The text uses the case as precedent to support the application of the divided damages rule in admiralty law.  There is no explicit overruling, nor any language functionally equivalent to overruling, nor any limitation of the case to specific circumstances.  Therefore, based on the provided excerpt, there is no indication that *White Oak Transportation Co.* has been overruled.
109252	96972	no	no	100	The provided text cites *The Eugene F. Moran* as a supporting case for the established rule of divided damages in admiralty law. There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled or modified.  The text discusses the rule and cites *The Eugene F. Moran* as precedent, but it does not offer any criticism or modification of the case's holding. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *The Eugene F. Moran* has been overruled.
109252	89024	no	no	95	The provided text cites Atlee v. Packet Co. as precedent supporting the application of the divided damages rule in admiralty cases involving mutual fault between a vessel and a non-vessel party.  There is no language suggesting that Atlee v. Packet Co. has been overruled.  The passage uses the case to support the court's reasoning, not to overturn it.
109252	102766	no	no	95	The cited case *Morley Construction Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co.* (300 U.S. 185) is mentioned in the excerpt as precedent regarding the scope of review when a cross-petition for certiorari is absent.  The excerpt uses the case to support the court's decision, indicating that it is being followed, not overruled. There is no language suggesting the court is overruling *Morley Construction Co.*, partially or fully, nor does it qualify or distinguish the case.  The excerpt simply applies the precedent set by *Morley Construction Co.* to the present case.
109252	104637	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co.* (1949) as precedent.  The court cites it to support its decision regarding the respondent's inability to challenge the judgment of the Court of Appeals due to the lack of a cross-petition for certiorari and the "two-court rule." There is no language suggesting that the court overruled, partially overruled, or limited the application of *Graver Tank*. The case is cited as directly applicable precedent. Therefore, there is no indication that *Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co.* has been overruled.
109252	107344	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Berenyi v. District Director, Immigration & Naturalization Service, 385 U.S. 630, as a supporting case cite.  There is no language suggesting that the Supreme Court overruled this case. The excerpt simply cites Berenyi as precedent to support a point of law.
109252	106562	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions the case *Weyerhaeuser S.S. Co. v. United States* but does not overrule it.  The court acknowledges the case's existence and notes that the divided damages rule was not re-examined in that case.  The excerpt discusses the potential reconsideration of the divided damages rule in a different case, *Union Oil Co. v. The San Jacinto*, but that case did not lead to an overruling of *Weyerhaeuser*. Therefore, there is no indication in this excerpt that *Weyerhaeuser* was overruled.
109252	104954	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions the case *Halcyon Lines v. Haenn Ship Ceiling & Refitting Corp.* as a case where the Court acknowledged the continued existence of the divided damages rule.  However, the Court did not re-examine the rule or its validity in that case.  The excerpt notes that the Court granted certiorari in a later case (*Union Oil Co. v. The San Jacinto*) to reconsider the divided damages rule but did not reach the issue in that case either. Therefore, there is no indication that *Halcyon Lines* has been overruled.
109252	108637	no	no	95	The excerpt states that the Supreme Court granted certiorari in Union Oil Co. v. The San Jacinto to reconsider the divided damages rule but did not reach the issue because one of the vessels was found to be without fault.  This means the case was not overruled; the Court simply did not address the merits of the divided damages rule in that specific instance.
109252	1087619	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *The City of New York*, 147 U. S. 72, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt quotes a passage from the case and cites it as support, indicating that it is being followed as precedent, not overruled.
109252	94772	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *The Victory & The Plymothian*, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites the case as precedent along with other cases related to maritime law and divided damages. There is no language suggesting that *The Victory & The Plymothian* is no longer good law or has been superseded by a later decision. The mention is purely for informational and contextual purposes, not as an indication of overruling.
109252	94658	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *The Umbria* as precedent among other cases.  There is no language suggesting that *The Umbria* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpt cites *The Umbria* alongside other cases in support of a point of maritime law. This indicates that the court considers *The Umbria* to still be relevant legal precedent, at least in the context discussed.
109252	94202	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *The Oregon*, 158 U.S. 186, among other cases. However, there is no language suggesting that it has been overruled. The text cites *The Oregon* as precedent alongside other cases.  There is no explicit overruling, nor any language functionally equivalent to overruling, nor any limiting or qualifying language applied specifically to *The Oregon*. Therefore, based on the provided excerpt, there is no evidence that *The Oregon* has been overruled.
109252	94137	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *The Ludvig Holberg* (157 U.S. 60) among other cases.  However, there is no language suggesting that *The Ludvig Holberg* is overruled, explicitly or implicitly. The text cites the case as precedent along with several others. There is no discussion of its legal holdings, nor any indication that the court finds any aspect of the case's reasoning to be incorrect or outdated. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *The Ludvig Holberg* has been overruled.
109252	101894	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions *Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.* in a footnote within a dissenting opinion.  The passage does not indicate that the Court overruled *Burnet*, but rather cites it as an example of the Court overruling prior decisions in other contexts to settle ongoing concerns. The mentioning of the case does not constitute overruling.
109252	86919	yes	no	-1	CITE_NOT_FOUND
109514	321071	no	yes	95	The Supreme Court explicitly overruled *Morey v. Doud*, 354 U.S. 457 (1957), stating that its equal protection analysis was erroneous and should no longer be followed.  The Court of Appeals in the case of interest, 501 F.2d 706 (1974), relied on *Morey v. Doud* as its "chief guide."  Therefore, while the opinion does not explicitly state that 501 F.2d 706 (1974) is overruled, the overruling of its precedent, *Morey v. Doud*, renders the reasoning of 501 F.2d 706 (1974) invalid, effectively overruling it.
109514	105546	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that the decision in Morey v. Doud is overruled because its equal protection analysis departs from proper analysis in cases of exclusively economic regulation.  The court finds the reliance on the statute's potential irrationality in Morey v. Doud to be a needlessly intrusive judicial infringement on the state's legislative powers.
109514	105285	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Williamson v. Lee Optical* multiple times.  However, in both instances, the case is cited as precedent supporting the principle that legislatures may take a step-by-step approach to addressing problems, rather than being overruled.  The citing court agrees with and follows the precedent set by *Williamson v. Lee Optical*. There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
109514	106576	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Ferguson v. Skrupa* as precedent supporting the idea that only invidious discrimination, or wholly arbitrary acts, violate the Fourteenth Amendment in the context of local economic regulation.  The citing opinion does not explicitly overrule, modify, or limit *Ferguson v. Skrupa* in any way. Instead, it uses the case to support its own holding.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Ferguson v. Skrupa* has been overruled.
109514	107256	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Katzenbach v. Morgan*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites *Katzenbach v. Morgan* as precedent supporting the idea that legislatures may implement programs step by step in economic areas, adopting regulations that only partially ameliorate a perceived evil. This is using the case to support a legal argument, not overruling it.
109570	1489061	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *399 F. Supp. 1304 (1975)*, which is Walker v. Hall.  The Supreme Court's opinion reverses the lower court's decision in *Walker v. Hall*, finding the gender-based differential in the Oklahoma statute unconstitutional.  However, this is not an overruling; it is a reversal of a lower court's judgment in a specific case.  The Supreme Court is not overruling any legal precedent set by *Walker v. Hall*, but rather applying existing legal principles to the facts of the case before it. The Supreme Court's decision clarifies and applies existing equal protection principles, but it does not modify or invalidate the holding or reasoning of *Walker v. Hall*. Therefore, the cited case has not been overruled.
109570	109235	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Stanton v. Stanton* as precedent, and in one instance, explicitly states that *Reed v. Reed* (the case upon which *Stanton v. Stanton* relies) is "controlling."  There is no language suggesting that *Stanton v. Stanton* has been overruled, either fully or partially.  Instead, the excerpts use *Stanton v. Stanton* to support the court's reasoning and analysis.
109570	108404	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Reed v. Reed* as precedent.  In one instance, the court states that *Reed v. Reed* is "controlling."  In another, the court mentions that "Reed and subsequent cases involving gender-based classifications make clear that the Court subjects such classifications to a more critical examination." This shows the court is applying and following the precedent set by *Reed v. Reed*, not overruling it.
109570	105152	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Barrows v. Jackson*, but never indicates that it has been overruled.  Instead, the citing opinions use *Barrows* as precedent to support their rulings on third-party standing. The court's discussion focuses on whether the plaintiff in the current case has standing to assert the rights of third parties, a topic addressed in *Barrows*. The opinions repeatedly refer to *Barrows* favorably, indicating the court considers it to be good law.  There is no language suggesting that *Barrows* has been qualified, limited, or overruled, either fully or partially.
109570	108497	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Stanley v. Illinois* multiple times.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled. In fact, the excerpts show *Stanley v. Illinois* being referenced as precedent supporting various legal arguments.  The text mentions other cases being overruled or qualified in certain circumstances, but *Stanley v. Illinois* is not among them. Therefore, there's no indication that *Stanley v. Illinois* has been overruled in the provided excerpts.
109570	109013	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes the case *Kahn v. Shevin* within the context of other cases involving gender-based classifications.  The text mentions that *Kahn v. Shevin* and *Schlesinger v. Ballard* "rested upon the Court's perception of the laudatory purposes of those laws as remedying disadvantageous conditions suffered by women in economic and military life."  While later cases may have modified or refined the approach to gender-based classifications, there is no language suggesting that *Kahn v. Shevin* has been explicitly overruled or is no longer considered good law. The analysis focuses on distinguishing the case in the current context, not overruling it.
109570	108781	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts from the court opinion discuss *Frontiero v. Richardson*.  In several instances, the case is cited as precedent, and the opinion uses the case to support its reasoning.  There is no language suggesting that *Frontiero* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  Instead, the excerpts show that the court considered *Frontiero* as relevant and followed its holding in part. One Justice's dissent mentions a possible retreat from the Frontiero plurality opinion, but this does not constitute an overruling of the case itself.
109570	108489	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss the case *Eisenstadt v. Baird*, focusing on the concept of third-party standing.  The opinion uses *Eisenstadt* as precedent regarding third-party standing, particularly concerning the relationship between a claimant and third parties whose rights are impacted by the litigation.  In one instance, the Court distinguishes *Eisenstadt*,  limiting its application to relationships beyond a simple vendor-vendee dynamic. This distinction doesn't overrule *Eisenstadt*, but rather clarifies its scope and applicability in specific situations. No language suggests the overruling of *Eisenstadt v. Baird* in whole or in part.
109570	109132	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Schlesinger v. Ballard* multiple times.  However, none of the mentions suggest that the case was overruled. In fact, the text cites *Schlesinger v. Ballard* as a case that upheld gender-based classifications because the Court perceived the laws to have laudable purposes that remedied disadvantageous conditions suffered by women in economic and military life.  The text uses the case as precedent and does not indicate any overruling or qualification of its holding.
109570	104606	yes	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that "Insofar as Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.S. 464 (1948), may be inconsistent, that decision is disapproved."  This directly satisfies condition 2 (functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling) and condition 6 (no longer good law in certain contexts) for overruling a case. The court finds Goesaert's equal protection analysis no longer applicable, further supporting the overruling. 
109346	108288	yes	yes	100	The Supreme Court explicitly states that Durham v. United States is overruled to the extent that it is inconsistent with the ruling in Dove v. United States.  This directly satisfies condition #1 for overruling a case.
109532	108605	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss Furman v. Georgia (1972) extensively, analyzing its implications for the constitutionality of the death penalty.  The later opinions do not explicitly overrule Furman; instead, they engage in a detailed analysis of how the death penalty can be constitutionally applied, given the concerns raised by Furman. The Court addresses its concerns about arbitrariness and capriciousness and sets out new procedural guidelines that it believes address the Furman issues, suggesting an attempt to reconcile future cases with Furman's precedent, rather than to overturn it.
109532	105659	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Trop v. Dulles*, referencing it as precedent for the "evolving standards of decency" test in Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.  The opinions quote and use the case to support their arguments, not to overrule it. While the text notes that *Trop v. Dulles* was a plurality opinion, this does not render the case overruled.  The citing opinions actively engage with the case's principles and reasoning, which indicates it's still considered relevant and not overruled.
109532	1220970	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Coley v. State, 231 Ga. 829, 204 S.E.2d 612 (1974),  but does not overrule it.  Instead, the citing opinions use Coley as a comparative example in their proportionality review of death sentences.  The court uses Coley to illustrate cases where death sentences were deemed disproportionate or excessive compared to similar cases and were therefore commuted or overturned, highlighting the Georgia Supreme Court's commitment to consistent application of the death penalty.  There is no language suggesting that the holding in Coley is incorrect or no longer good law. The focus is on the application of the principles from Coley to subsequent cases, not on overruling the decision itself.
109532	1391146	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Jarrell v. State*, and in doing so, describes the court's upholding of a death sentence and its reasoning.  There is no language suggesting that *Jarrell v. State* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The citing opinions use *Jarrell* as precedent to support their conclusions. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Jarrell v. State* has been overruled.
109532	1335744	no	no	95	The provided text gives excerpts from the Supreme Court of Georgia's opinion in *Gregg v. State*, affirming the death sentences.  There is no indication that *Gregg v. State (1974)* was overruled.  The excerpts focus on the review and upholding of the death sentences, with discussions on proportionality and comparison to similar cases.  The court's actions demonstrate a following of precedent, not an overruling.  The case is cited numerous times, indicating that other cases are using it as precedent.
109532	97242	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Weems v. United States* multiple times.  The excerpts show the Court referencing *Weems* as precedent and explaining its reasoning and principles, particularly concerning the evolving understanding of "cruel and unusual punishment" under the Eighth Amendment.  There is no language suggesting that *Weems* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. Instead, the Court draws upon *Weems*'s  flexible and dynamic interpretation of the Eighth Amendment to inform its current analysis. The Court acknowledges and uses *Weems*'s analysis of proportionality between crime and punishment.
109532	1260876	no	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that a California constitutional amendment authorized capital punishment, thereby negating a prior ruling by the Supreme Court of California in People v. Anderson that the death penalty violated the California Constitution.  This action effectively overruled the prior ruling of People v. Anderson.
109532	1381163	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Moore v. State (1975)* as precedent for the Georgia Supreme Court's proportionality review in capital cases.  There is no language suggesting that *Moore v. State (1975)* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citations show the court referring to and relying on the case's holding regarding the standards for proportionality review in death penalty cases. Therefore, there is no indication that it has been overruled.
109532	2097666	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Commonwealth v. O'Neal*, 339 N.E.2d 676 (1975),  but does not overrule it.  The citations are used to support the author's arguments regarding the death penalty, specifically its deterrent and retributive effects. There is no language suggesting the court finds the case to be incorrect or no longer good law.  The citing text agrees with the precedent set by *Commonwealth v. O'Neal*. 
109532	106451	no	no	95	The provided text summarizes and cites *Robinson v. California*, using it as a precedent related to the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.  There is no language suggesting that the Court overruled, modified, or limited *Robinson v. California* in any way. Instead, the opinion uses *Robinson* to support its analysis, showing that the case is still considered relevant legal precedent.
109532	108329	yes	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *McGautha v. California* several times but does not overrule it.  The excerpts cite *McGautha* as precedent regarding the history of capital punishment in the United States. There is no language suggesting that the court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the holding of *McGautha*. The citations are used to support the court's own analysis of the constitutionality of the death penalty.
109390	104216	no	no	95	The provided text shows that the case *Marsh v. Alabama* was discussed and cited in several subsequent cases.  The excerpt includes opinions both supporting and critiquing the application of *Marsh* to shopping centers and other private property.  There is no explicit overruling of *Marsh*, but rather a discussion and limitation of its application in the context of private property used for commercial purposes.  Specifically, later cases like *Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner* distinguished *Marsh* based on the degree to which private property takes on the attributes of a municipality.  The distinction is based on factual differences, not an explicit overruling of the legal principles in *Marsh*.  While some justices expressed disagreements with the application of *Marsh* in *Logan Valley* and its progeny, no majority opinion declared *Marsh* overruled.  The analysis of later cases centered on the scope of *Marsh*, rather than overruling it.
109390	107692	yes	yes	95	The provided text contains multiple excerpts from the court opinion in Hudgens v. NLRB.  In this case, the court explicitly overrules Logan Valley Plaza insofar as it applies to the First Amendment rights in the context of shopping center picketing.  While there is discussion and debate on whether or not this is a full overruling, the majority opinion clarifies that the First Amendment does not protect picketing on private property in this specific scenario, directly contradicting the holding in Logan Valley.  Several concurring opinions also discuss the overruling or reconciling of Logan Valley with the current case. Therefore, it meets the criteria of overruling as the court explicitly alters the precedent set in Logan Valley.
109390	108592	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Lloyd Corp. v. Tanner*, but never states that it was overruled.  While the text discusses the case's impact and how subsequent cases have interpreted or distinguished its holding, particularly in relation to *Food Employees v. Logan Valley Plaza*, there's no language explicitly overruling *Lloyd Corp.*  Furthermore, justices in concurring and dissenting opinions debate the implications and interpretations of *Lloyd Corp.*, but do not claim it is overruled.  The focus is on clarifying the application and limitations of the precedent established in *Lloyd Corp.*, not on abolishing it. 
109390	105389	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *NLRB v. Babcock & Wilcox Co.* and discusses its principles, especially regarding the balance between employee rights under § 7 of the NLRA and employers' property rights.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Babcock & Wilcox* has been overruled, fully or partially.  The text notes that the *Babcock & Wilcox* standard may need modification depending on the context of the § 7 activity, but this is a matter of application and interpretation, not overruling.  The citing cases mainly discuss whether other precedents, such as *Logan Valley*, supersede *Babcock & Wilcox* in specific situations, but they do not explicitly overrule the *Babcock & Wilcox* case itself.  The court uses *Babcock & Wilcox* as a precedent to analyze the present case, which is inconsistent with it being overruled.
109390	108591	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB and its relationship to other cases, particularly Logan Valley.  The opinion clarifies the application of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in relation to property rights, but does not explicitly overrule Central Hardware.  Instead, it elaborates on the balance between §7 rights and private property rights and distinguishes the First Amendment considerations.  While the Court's interpretation of Logan Valley and its application through Central Hardware are discussed at length, and Logan Valley is ultimately limited,  there's no language that explicitly overrules Central Hardware Co. v. NLRB.  The opinion cites and uses Central Hardware to support its reasoning.  The Court affirms that Central Hardware provides "the guiding principle" for balancing employer and employee rights under the NLRA. Therefore, it is not overruled.
109508	105999	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *National Labor Relations Board v. Insurance Agents' International Union* (1960), but does not explicitly overrule it.  While the opinion discusses the case extensively and uses it to inform its analysis of preemption in labor disputes, it neither declares the case overruled nor employs language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the opinion clarifies and distinguishes the application of *Insurance Agents'*, particularly concerning the regulation of economic pressure tactics in labor negotiations and the preemption of state law.  The court even explicitly states that it does not disturb the holding of *Briggs-Stratton*, which was discussed alongside *Insurance Agents*. It is notable that the court finds certain aspects of the Briggs-Stratton approach to preemption are "no longer of general application", but this clarification does not extend to overruling *Insurance Agents*. Therefore, there is no indication that *National Labor Relations Board v. Insurance Agents' International Union* (1960) was overruled in this opinion.
109508	104636	yes	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the holding in Briggs-Stratton (International Union, U. A. W. A., A. F. of L., Local 232 v. Wisconsin Employment Relations Board (1949)) is "no longer of general application."  This is explicitly stated in multiple places in the text.  Furthermore, the court identifies specific aspects of the Briggs-Stratton decision that have been undercut by subsequent rulings, indicating that it's not merely that the precedent has been limited, but that parts of it are no longer valid.  The court also offers alternative interpretations and legal developments that render the Briggs-Stratton approach obsolete in certain contexts.  Therefore, based on the court's own words and analysis, the case is considered overruled, at least partially, if not in its entirety.
109508	105866	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon*, and analyzes its application and implications in the context of labor law preemption.  However, there is no language that suggests the court is overruling *Garmon*.  The excerpt discusses the evolution of the preemption doctrine developed from *Garmon*, clarifies its application in various contexts and offers opinions on how some of *Garmon*'s implications have been refined in subsequent cases. The court does not explicitly overrule it, nor does it state that it is no longer good law in any context.  Instead, it engages in extensive analysis and interpretation, showing a continued relevance and consideration of *Garmon*.  The reference to distinguishing aspects of *Garmon* relates to the ongoing interpretation and application of the case, not to its overruling.
109508	107123	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule Hanna Mining Co. v. District 2, Marine Engineers Beneficial Ass'n.  While the case is cited multiple times, the citing opinions do not state that Hanna Mining is overruled, nor do they employ language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  One passage notes that the "troublesome question" addressed in Hanna Mining was resolved by the court's conclusion regarding the amendment to the Act excluding supervisory employees from the definition of "employees." This explanation clarifies Hanna Mining's holding within the context of the evolving legal landscape rather than overruling it. Another passage mentions Hanna Mining as a reference point for a statement in a different case, San Diego Unions v. Garmon, suggesting contextualization rather than overruling.  Therefore, there is no indication that any of the conditions for overruling are met.
109508	106827	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts cite the case *Local 20, Teamsters, Chauffeurs & Helpers Union v. Morton* multiple times.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled. The excerpts discuss the case's analysis of preemption and the balance struck by Congress regarding economic pressure in labor relations.  The citing opinions appear to either follow or distinguish *Morton*'s reasoning, not overrule it. There is no language indicating that *Morton* is no longer good law, either fully or in part, under any circumstances.
109508	107886	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts mention the case *Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Jacksonville Terminal Co.* multiple times.  However, none of the excerpts indicate that the case was overruled.  Instead, the excerpts cite the case as precedent, referencing specific parts of the opinion. One excerpt even states that the court agrees with the case's critical inquiry. Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled, either fully or partially.
109344	85534	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes and interprets Brown v. Maryland (1827), clarifying its holding and distinguishing it from subsequent cases like Low v. Austin.  While the opinion critiques Low v. Austin for misinterpreting Brown, it doesn't explicitly overrule Brown. The excerpts extensively cite and discuss Brown to explain the nuances of the Import-Export Clause, showing an attempt to refine its application, not overturn the precedent itself.  Therefore, Brown v. Maryland is not overruled in this opinion.
109344	88429	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that it overrules Low v. Austin insofar as it is contradictory to the holding that a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax on imported tires is not prohibited by the Import-Export Clause.  The court finds that Low v. Austin misinterprets prior case law and does not advance the objectives of the Import-Export Clause.
109344	105833	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Bowers* several times.  However, none of the mentions suggest that the case has been overruled. The excerpts cite the case as precedent, specifically referencing its holding on taxation of goods committed to current operational needs by a manufacturer.  There is no language indicating that the Court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the case's holding in any way.  The fact that it is cited alongside other cases further indicates that it is being treated as valid precedent.
109344	86429	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes and interprets the case *License Cases*, 5 How. 504 (1847),  in which Thurlow v. Massachusetts was cited.  The text does not state that *Thurlow* is overruled. Instead, the analysis focuses on how the Chief Justice's opinion in *License Cases* has been misinterpreted by other cases, particularly Low v. Austin.  The author clarifies Chief Justice Taney's position in *License Cases*, contrasting it with Low v. Austin's interpretation.  There is no language indicating that *Thurlow* itself has been overturned, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpt uses *Thurlow* as a reference point in the discussion of legal principles surrounding import taxes, but it does not challenge or alter the precedent set by *Thurlow*. 
109499	104222	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss New York v. United States (1946) in relation to the limits of Congressional power over states, particularly concerning taxation and the commerce clause.  While several excerpts cite the case and analyze aspects of its reasoning (particularly Chief Justice Stone's concurring opinion), none of them explicitly overrule it.  The excerpts show ongoing debate and interpretation of the case's implications rather than a direct overruling.  Later cases may refine or clarify its application, but there's no language equivalent to explicitly stating that it's overruled, wholly or partially, nor does it limit its application to specific circumstances or legal principles. Therefore, based on the provided excerpts, there is no indication that New York v. United States (1946) has been overruled.
109499	109259	no	no	95	The snippets of the court opinion analyze and distinguish the case of interest, *Fry v. United States*, in relation to the issue of Congressional power to regulate state activities under the Commerce Clause.  The opinion does not explicitly overrule *Fry*, but instead clarifies and limits its application.  The court distinguishes *Fry* based on the specific circumstances: *Fry* dealt with an emergency measure (Economic Stabilization Act) with limited duration, designed to address severe inflation and not directly displace state choices in structuring governmental operations.  The court contrasts this with the case at hand where congressional actions directly displace states' freedom to structure their integral operations. Thus, the court limits the precedent of *Fry*, but does not overrule it.
109499	107734	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that the "far-reaching implications" of Maryland v. Wirtz should be overruled.  The opinion repeatedly discusses overruling Wirtz, citing concerns about the federal system and state sovereignty.  The court directly addresses and rejects arguments that its decision is inconsistent with Wirtz, ultimately concluding that Wirtz must be overruled.
109499	102593	no	yes	95	The court explicitly states that the reasoning in Wirtz may no longer be regarded as authoritative, and that dicta from United States v. California is simply wrong.  The court also states that the conclusions expressed earlier in the opinion mean the reasoning in Wirtz, which relied heavily on United States v. California, is no longer authoritative.  The court finds that dicta from *United States v. California* is "simply wrong."  This constitutes an overruling of at least some aspects of the case.
109499	103442	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States v. Darby* (1941).  However, none of the citations indicate that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the excerpts show that *Darby* is used as precedent, mentioned, or discussed in relation to the commerce power and the Tenth Amendment. There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
109499	85412	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *Gibbons v. Ogden* repeatedly, employing its language and principles to support the Court's reasoning.  There is no language suggesting the Court intends to overrule *Gibbons v. Ogden*. Instead, the opinion draws upon the case's interpretation of the Commerce Clause to support its own analysis. The Court emphasizes the historical importance of *Gibbons v. Ogden* and its lasting relevance to constitutional law.  Therefore, the case is not overruled, but rather affirmed and relied upon.
109499	104231	no	no	95	The provided text explicitly states that Case v. Bowles (1946) has not been overruled.  One excerpt says, "Case v. Bowles, 327 U.S. 92 (1946), has not been overruled as the dissent asserts."  Another excerpt mentions Case v. Bowles among other cases that are cited as supporting a particular interpretation of the Tenth Amendment, further suggesting it remains valid precedent. While the court distinguishes Case v. Bowles from the case at hand, stating that it "has no direct application to the questions we consider today at all," this does not constitute overruling.  The court's analysis focuses on the limited applicability of the precedent in the current factual context, not on invalidating Case v. Bowles itself.
109499	103047	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule *Helvering v. Gerhardt*.  Instead, it cites the case to support the argument that the state immunity from federal taxation is "narrowly limited." The excerpt uses the case's holding as a point of comparison to clarify its own position on the scope of the commerce power and state immunity.  There is no language indicating the Court intends to overturn *Helvering v. Gerhardt*, nor does it suggest that the case is no longer good law in any particular context.
109499	97448	no	no	95	The excerpt explains the holding of *Coyle v. Oklahoma*, and uses the case as precedent to support its reasoning.  It does not overrule or modify the holding in any way. The opinion cites *Coyle* to support the idea that there are attributes of state sovereignty that Congress may not impair, even if Congress has the authority to regulate private businesses. This is consistent with following *Coyle* as precedent.
109499	87985	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Lane County v. Oregon* several times.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled. The text discusses the historical context of the case and its relation to other cases, particularly in the context of the balance of power between states and the federal government.  While some cases are mentioned as being overruled (such as *Collector v. Day*), this does not affect the status of *Lane County v. Oregon*. The citing opinions use the case as precedent but also acknowledge the historical context and potential limitations based on later constitutional amendments and legal developments.
109499	106821	no	no	85	The provided text mentions Parden v. Terminal Railway in several parts.  In one section, the author notes that the holding in *Maryland v. Wirtz* overrules *Parden v. Terminal Railway*, but this is a claim made by the author and not a definitive ruling.  In another section, the author explicitly states that *Parden v. Terminal Railway* is "unimpaired" by the Court's decision.  Thus, there is no explicit overruling of *Parden v. Terminal Railway*. While there is some discussion suggesting the case's reasoning might be impacted by the Court's broader approach to state sovereignty,  there is no clear indication that the case itself has been overruled.
109499	108763	no	no	90	The excerpt mentions Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept. multiple times.  In one instance, the opinion states that the current holding would "overrule those cases and with them Parden v. Terminal R. Co., 377 U.S. 184 (1964), and certain reasoning in Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept., 411 U.S. 279, 284-285 (1973)."  However, this is presented as an opinion disagreeing with the majority's decision. The excerpt does not represent a majority opinion of the court overruling Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept.  Therefore, there is no indication that Employees v. Missouri Public Health Dept. was overruled in this case.
109450	108848	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Pittsburgh Press Co. v. Human Relations Comm'n*.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case was overruled.  Instead, the citing opinions either distinguish the case's application in various contexts (particularly regarding the nature of "commercial speech") or use it as precedent.  There is discussion of Justices questioning the broad language of prior related cases (such as Chrestensen) and expressing differing opinions, but this does not amount to overruling *Pittsburgh Press Co*.  The case is treated as existing precedent and is cited extensively, but not overruled.
109450	109271	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Bigelow v. Virginia* and discusses its holding.  However, none of the cited excerpts suggest that *Bigelow v. Virginia* was overruled. Instead, the excerpts analyze and apply its principles to the case at hand, indicating that *Bigelow v. Virginia* is being used as precedent.  In particular, the court affirms and applies the principles from *Bigelow v. Virginia*, acknowledging its importance to the discussion and confirming that it is still considered valid precedent.
109450	106761	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts use the case as precedent, discussing its relevance to the question of commercial speech and the extent of First Amendment protection for various kinds of speech, including advertising.  The opinion builds upon and distinguishes *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan*, showing its continued relevance as a precedent. There is no language suggesting that the Court intended to overrule *New York Times Co. v. Sullivan* in whole or in part.
109450	2239749	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Patterson Drug Co. v. Kingery*, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the opinion distinguishes it from the current case based on the identity of the plaintiffs.  The court notes that *Patterson* involved pharmacists (a 'prima facie commercial approach'), while the current case involves consumers asserting a different interest.  Therefore, the current case does not overturn the precedent set in *Patterson*. The court uses the earlier case for comparison and contrasts their factual situations. It does not challenge the legal reasoning or conclusions of *Patterson*. 
109450	103347	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Thornhill v. Alabama*, referencing its holding that speech related to labor disputes is protected under the First Amendment.  The excerpts do not contain any language explicitly overruling *Thornhill*, nor do they offer language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the excerpts repeatedly cite *Thornhill* as precedent, extending its principles to commercial speech.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Thornhill v. Alabama* has been overruled in this opinion.
109450	2098134	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts from the court opinion do not contain any statements that would indicate the overruling of Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc. v. State Board of Pharmacy (1974).  The excerpts cite the case's lower court decision (373 F. Supp. 683) multiple times, but only to discuss its reasoning and to ultimately distinguish the Supreme Court's holding from the lower court's reasoning.  There is no language suggesting the case is no longer good law, partially overruled, or overruled in specific circumstances. The Supreme Court's opinion in this case does not overrule, but rather builds upon previous case law.
109450	103654	yes	no	85	The provided text excerpts from court opinions discuss *Valentine v. Chrestensen*, often mentioning its holding that "purely commercial advertising" isn't protected by the First Amendment. However, none of the excerpts explicitly overrule *Valentine v. Chrestensen*.  While the opinions show a shift in understanding of commercial speech protection since *Valentine v. Chrestensen*, and several opinions suggest a modification or limitation of the case's scope regarding price advertising, there is no explicit overruling.  The later cases seem to refine and reinterpret the precedents set in *Valentine v. Chrestensen* rather than directly overturning its core holding.  Therefore, based on the provided excerpts alone, we can't definitively say *Valentine v. Chrestensen* is overruled.
109450	105285	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Williamson v. Lee Optical* multiple times.  However, it does not explicitly overrule it, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The opinion uses *Williamson* as precedent, contrasting its holding (regarding state restrictions on advertising for optometrists' services) with the situation in the case at hand (regarding drug price advertising).  The court distinguishes the case's treatment of different legal principles and applies a different analysis to the facts presented. This is not an overruling; rather, the court is distinguishing between different circumstances and applying the precedent selectively. Therefore, the case was not overruled.
109450	107970	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *National Labor Relations Board v. Gissel Packing Co*.  However, in none of the citations does the court explicitly overrule, implicitly overrule, or qualify any part of the *Gissel Packing* decision.  Instead, the court either mentions the case as precedent supporting the proposition that employers and employees have free speech rights in labor disputes (while simultaneously noting limitations on those rights in the form of prohibitions against threats, coercion, and deceptive statements), or uses the case as a counterpoint to the case at hand to distinguish between labor relations and commercial speech.  There is no indication in the excerpt that *Gissel Packing* is no longer good law, in whole or in part.
109450	108444	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove*, specifically referencing Justice Douglas' dissenting opinion from the denial of certiorari.  However, none of the citations indicate that the case itself has been overruled.  The citing opinions use the case to support their arguments, suggesting it remains relevant precedent, at least in the context of its dissenting opinion. There is no language suggesting the overruling of *Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Grove*, either explicitly or implicitly.
109615	104587	no	no	95	The Supreme Court case Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady cited Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Stone.  The opinion of the Court in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady refers to Memphis Natural Gas multiple times, analyzing and distinguishing it in the context of state taxation of interstate commerce.  The Complete Auto Transit opinion does not explicitly overrule Memphis Natural Gas, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Instead, it discusses and applies the principles established in Memphis Natural Gas in the context of a different case.  The Court notes that Memphis Natural Gas distinguished between a tax on the privilege of doing interstate business (unconstitutional) and a tax on the privilege of exercising corporate functions within a state (constitutional). Complete Auto Transit continues this line of analysis.
109615	109239	no	no	95	The 1977 Complete Auto Transit case did not explicitly overrule Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle (1975). While Complete Auto Transit distinguished Traigle, based on the different wording of the state's taxing statute, it did not declare Traigle to be overruled.  Two justices in Complete Auto Transit even suggested overruling Traigle, but this was a concurring opinion and did not represent the majority view of the Court.  Therefore, while Complete Auto Transit significantly altered the application of legal principles related to state taxation of interstate commerce, it did not meet the criteria for overruling Colonial Pipeline Co. v. Traigle.
109615	104869	yes	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor* multiple times.  However, it does not contain language that overrules it. The text discusses the case as precedent, aligning with the Court's prior rulings on state taxation of interstate commerce.  The court does not explicitly state that *Spector* is overruled, nor does it use functionally equivalent language. The text focuses on whether the specific tax in question meets the *Spector* criteria.
109615	102972	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule *Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue*.  While the opinion cites *Western Live Stock* and discusses its holding regarding state taxation of interstate commerce, it does not explicitly overrule it.  Instead, the opinion focuses on overruling *Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor*, a later case that had created a stricter interpretation of the Commerce Clause.  The opinion critiques the underlying philosophy of *Spector* but uses *Western Live Stock* to illustrate the broader principle that interstate commerce is not entirely immune from state taxation.  The court's decision to reject the *Spector* rule does not necessarily negate *Western Live Stock*'s precedent.
109615	105828	no	no	90	The provided text discusses Railway Express Agency v. Virginia (1959) and its relationship to prior case law, particularly Spector Motor Service v. O'Connor.  The text analyzes how the court in Railway Express II sought to clarify and refine the approach to taxation of interstate commerce, addressing concerns about the "Spector rule." However, there's no explicit overruling of Railway Express Agency v. Virginia (1959). The text mentions critiques of the case and how its approach was modified or clarified in later cases, but it stops short of declaring the case overruled.  The court acknowledges that the *Spector* rule presented difficulties, but addresses those difficulties by clarifying the appropriate standards of review regarding the tax constitutionality.  The fact that the court felt it necessary to clarify or modify an existing precedent rather than overrule it suggests the latter was not the court's intention.
109716	107491	yes	yes	95	The court in Continental T.V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc. explicitly overrules the per se rule established in United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co.  The majority opinion in *Continental T.V.* states that the distinction drawn in *Schwinn* between sale and non-sale transactions is insufficient to justify applying a per se rule in one situation and a rule of reason in the other.  The court explicitly reverses to the rule of reason, effectively overruling the precedent set by *Schwinn*.  While Justice White's concurrence argues for distinguishing *Schwinn* rather than overruling it, the majority opinion clearly indicates an overruling of the prior case.
109716	336461	no	yes	95	The provided text shows that the court in Gte Sylvania Incorporated v. Continental T v. Inc. explicitly discusses and distinguishes its holding from the precedent set in Schwinn.  The court analyzes the differences in competitive impact, market share, and nature of restrictions between the two cases, ultimately concluding that Sylvania's location restriction should be judged under the "rule of reason" rather than the per se rule applied in Schwinn.  This constitutes an overruling, at least in part, of Schwinn insofar as it applies to location restrictions in cases with different factual circumstances. The court explicitly states that Schwinn is distinguishable on several grounds and that its holding in Sylvania is supported by other federal court decisions and the policies of the Sherman Act.  Therefore, the case of interest is overruled, at least partially.
109716	105646	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss the case *Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States (1958)* and its relevance to antitrust law, specifically concerning per se rules versus the rule of reason.  The excerpts cite the case multiple times to explain the standards for determining whether vertical restrictions should be considered per se violations of the Sherman Act. However, at no point does the text explicitly overrule *Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. United States*. Instead, the court uses the case's standard as a benchmark to evaluate other cases, such as *Schwinn*, which is explicitly overruled.  While the court discusses and applies the principles set forth in *Northern Pacific*, this analysis does not equate to overruling *Northern Pacific* itself.  Therefore, the case remains as precedent, informing the decision in the matter at hand but not being overturned.
109716	1458770	no	yes	85	The provided text excerpts repeatedly cite *United States v. Arnold, Schwinn & Co.* (1965),  237 F. Supp. 323 (ND Ill. 1965),  in the context of a discussion of its overruling in a later case (though the name of the later case is not explicitly mentioned in these excerpts).  The excerpts highlight the differences between *Schwinn* and the later case concerning intrabrand and interbrand competition, market share, and economic power.  These distinctions implicitly indicate that the later case overruled aspects of *Schwinn*'s holding, particularly regarding vertical restraints and the application of the rule of reason.  The excerpts do not explicitly state "Schwinn is overruled", but the context strongly suggests that it has been overruled at least in part, satisfying criteria 3, 4, 5, and 6 for overruling as defined in the prompt. 
109580	86317	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites and discusses *Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan*,  analyzing and applying its principles.  While some parts of the opinion discuss limitations or interpretations of *Pollard's Lessee*, there is no language explicitly overruling it or stating it is no longer good law. Note 11 mentions that a portion of *Pollard's Lessee*'s language was dismissed as dictum in a later case (*Shively v. Bowlby*), but this does not constitute an overruling of the entire case.  The analysis focuses on clarifying and applying *Pollard's Lessee*'s holding within the context of other legal developments, but stops short of overturning it.
109580	108897	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that the application of Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona's use of federal common law in cases of this type "must be overruled."  The majority opinion directly addresses Bonelli, citing it multiple times and explicitly rejecting its application of federal common law to questions of riparian ownership.  While the dissenting opinions disagree with the overruling, the majority's clear and explicit language leaves no doubt of their intent to overturn Bonelli's precedent in this specific context.
109580	93804	no	no	95	The excerpts analyze and cite *Shively v. Bowlby*, but do not overrule it.  The excerpts discuss and interpret the holding of *Shively v. Bowlby*, particularly focusing on the role of state law in governing riparian ownership and the rights of riparian proprietors.  One excerpt even notes that *Shively v. Bowlby* dismissed language in *Pollard's Lessee v. Hagan* as dictum.  No language suggests that *Shively v. Bowlby* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The discussion focuses on applying and interpreting *Shively v. Bowlby*, not overruling it.
109580	102485	no	no	95	The provided text discusses the case *Borax Consolidated, Ltd. v. Los Angeles* (1935) multiple times.  However, in all instances, the case is cited as precedent,  either being followed or its reasoning being discussed and distinguished, not overruled.  The opinion focuses on overruling *Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona*, and while *Borax* is mentioned in the context of the discussion, there is no language suggesting that *Borax* itself is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The court distinguishes the rationale of *Borax* from the situation at hand, but doesn't reject or overturn it.
109580	89473	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Barney v. Keokuk, but never indicates that it has been overruled.  The excerpts discuss and analyze the case's holding regarding riparian rights and the relationship between federal and state law concerning land ownership along navigable waters.  There's no language suggesting the case is no longer good law, either explicitly or implicitly, or that it has been modified or limited in its application. The court uses the case as precedent, showing that it was followed and not overruled.
109580	89097	no	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the rule of  County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, along with other cases (New Orleans v. United States and Bonelli and Hughes), is discarded.  This directly satisfies criterion 1 for overruling: a majority of the Court explicitly states that the case has been overruled. The text also says that, as far as federal law is concerned,  a federal riparian grant is now understood to have incorporated a fixed rather than ambulatory boundary. This means the prior precedent set by County of St. Clair v. Lovingston no longer applies in the context of federal law, which fulfills criterion 6.
109580	107555	no	yes	95	The dissenting opinion explicitly states that the Court's holding overrules Hughes v. Washington (1967).  The majority opinion, while not explicitly stating it, implicitly overrules it by overruling Bonelli Cattle Co. v. Arizona (1973), which is closely tied to Hughes. The reasoning is further supported by the fact that the Court rejects the equal-footing analysis employed in Hughes, which was a central element of the Hughes decision.  The dissenting opinion highlights the surprise of overruling Hughes, which had nearly unanimous support previously.
109580	96443	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Joy v. City of St. Louis*, but does not overrule it.  While the Court discusses and analyzes *Joy* in the context of other cases and principles regarding land ownership and boundaries, it does not use language explicitly overruling it, nor does it offer a functionally equivalent action. The Court notes that *Joy* supports the majority's conclusion in this specific instance, but it does not thereby invalidate *Joy*. The fact that the Court distinguishes *Joy* based on the specific facts involved (the land being granted by Spain, and Congress only confirming that grant) further supports the conclusion that it is not overruling *Joy*, but only finding it inapplicable to the present case.
109580	86113	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule *Wilcox v. Jackson*.  While the court cites *Wilcox v. Jackson* and discusses its holding regarding the passage of title to land once owned by the United States, it does not explicitly overrule it or employ language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The court analyzes *Wilcox v. Jackson* in the context of its own decision concerning the application of federal common law, and in doing so, it explains why the precedent does not support the court's own holding in the present case. It does not suggest that *Wilcox* is no longer good law in any context or that any part of it should be disregarded.  Instead, the court distinguishes *Wilcox v. Jackson* by explaining how its holding does not apply to the specific circumstances of the case before it, which relates to the equal-footing doctrine and its implications on state versus federal control over riverbeds.
109835	109344	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Michelin Tire Corp. v. Wages*, and in several instances, it clarifies or extends its precedent.  Nowhere does the text state that *Michelin* is overruled, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The opinion discusses how *Michelin* changed the analysis of Import-Export Clause cases, and distinguishes some aspects of the case in relation to the case at hand, which shows that *Michelin* is still considered good law but may be applied differently in certain circumstances.  This is not considered overruling under the established criteria.
109835	109615	no	yes	95	The court explicitly overrules *Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. O'Connor*, which is cited in the provided text as supporting the continued validity of the *Stevedoring Cases*.  The court then uses *Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady* to undermine the reasoning of the *Stevedoring Cases*, stating that the basis for the holding in *Puget Sound* (one of the Stevedoring Cases) is removed and that the analysis in *Carter & Weekes* (another Stevedoring Case) must be rejected.  The court explicitly states that the principles of *Complete Auto* lead to questioning the underpinnings of the *Stevedoring Cases*, effectively overruling them.  The court also notes the rejection of the "direct-indirect" distinction used in prior cases, a key element of the *Stevedoring Cases*' reasoning, in favor of an economic-reality analysis.
109835	104388	yes	yes	95	The provided text shows that the court in a later case rejected the reasoning of *Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co*.  The court explicitly states that the reasoning of *Carter & Weekes* "no longer supports automatic tax immunity for stevedoring" and that its reaffirmation of *Puget Sound* (a case related to the same legal principles) was "on a basis rejected by Complete Auto and previous cases".  This indicates that *Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co.* has been overruled, at least in part, because its core logic is deemed no longer valid in light of subsequent case law.  The court directly challenges the central tenets of *Carter & Weekes*' holding and replaces it with a different approach to the legal question. 
109835	104859	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Canton Railroad v. Rogan*, but does not overrule it.  While the opinion discusses the case and even critiques its reasoning in comparison to more recent precedent (particularly Complete Auto Transit), there is no language explicitly overruling *Canton Railroad*. The court acknowledges *Canton Railroad* as precedent and distinguishes it based on the specific facts, not by overruling the case itself. The court uses *Canton Railroad* to support its reasoning, showing that it remains relevant in the specific context of this case. Therefore, there is no indication that *Canton Railroad v. Rogan* has been overruled, fully or partially.
109835	102972	no	yes	85	The excerpt explicitly states that to the extent that *Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n* and *Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co.* contradict its holding, each is overruled. While this does not directly overrule *Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue*, the excerpt's discussion of *Western Live Stock* is in the context of clarifying and updating the legal standard established in prior cases, including those overruled.  The court uses *Western Live Stock* to support its new interpretation of the Commerce Clause, suggesting that the prior cases were not correctly applying the principle established in *Western Live Stock*. This implicitly qualifies the prior precedent and suggests a shift in how the principles in *Western Live Stock* are to be applied, effectively overruling aspects of the prior case law in certain contexts.
109835	102857	yes	no	95	The court in Department of Revenue of Washington v. Association of Washington Stevedoring Companies discusses Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Commission.  However, it does not overrule it. The later case distinguishes the earlier one based on a change in the relevant tax law and the interpretation of what constitutes interstate commerce.  The court analyzes the prior case's reasoning and holding but ultimately finds it distinguishable from the facts before it in 1978, thus not overruling the prior precedent.
109881	106170	yes	yes	100	The excerpt explicitly states that the Court overruled *Monroe v. Pape* insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under § 1983.  The Court's reasoning centers on a re-evaluation of the legislative history surrounding the Civil Rights Act of 1871, concluding that the original interpretation in *Monroe v. Pape* was incorrect.  The decision to overrule is explicitly stated, fulfilling the first condition for overruling outlined in the instructions.
109881	86231	no	no	90	The provided text analyzes Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842) within the context of subsequent legal discussions, particularly concerning the balance of power between the federal government and states.  It does not explicitly overrule Prigg.  While the text discusses limitations on Congress's power to impose duties on state officers, as hinted at in Prigg, it does so in the context of clarifying the scope of federal power relative to states, not in the act of overruling the case itself.  The analysis focuses on interpreting and applying Prigg, rather than invalidating it.
109881	108782	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss the overruling of Monroe v. Pape (1961), not Moor v. County of Alameda (1973).  While the opinion mentions Moor v. County of Alameda multiple times, it does so in the context of cases that relied on the now-overruled aspects of Monroe.  The opinion explicitly states that nothing in the decision affects the conclusions reached in Moor regarding 42 U.S.C. §1988 and the applicability of §1983 to municipal corporations. Therefore, Moor is not overruled.
109881	334135	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case of interest, *Monell v. Department of Social Services*, multiple times.  However, none of these citations indicate that the case has been overruled. The text discusses the case's implications and how later rulings have interpreted or clarified aspects of *Monell*, but there is no explicit overruling or language functionally equivalent to overruling. The court's discussion focuses on how *Monell* relates to other cases and whether its principles apply in different situations, leading to refinements and clarifications rather than a complete overruling.  Therefore, there is no evidence within the provided text that *Monell v. Department of Social Services* has been overruled.
109881	88174	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Supervisors v. Durant* (1870) as one of several cases.  It's cited within a list of precedents, but there is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The mention is in the context of providing background or historical context, not in the context of overruling or distinguishing it.
109881	88308	no	no	90	The provided text cites *Collector v. Day* multiple times.  However, it does not explicitly overrule the case. Instead, the text notes that the precedent set in *Collector v. Day* "has not survived", citing later cases (*Ex parte Virginia*, *Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe*) that seemingly contradict or modify its holding.  The passage describes *Collector v. Day* as representing a "doctrine of coordinate sovereignty" that has been superseded by later interpretations of the relationship between federal and state power.  This indicates that the *Collector v. Day* decision's principles are no longer fully controlling precedent, but it does not constitute an explicit overruling. The text mentions the case's influence in shaping arguments in congressional debates and notes that the case is no longer good law; however, this is not a direct overruling by a court.
109881	108813	no	yes	95	The provided text repeatedly mentions *City of Kenosha v. Bruno*.  In the final section, the court explicitly states that it is overruling aspects of *Monroe v. Pape*, and in doing so, it acknowledges that this overruling impacts the prior decisions in *Moor v. County of Alameda*, *City of Kenosha v. Bruno*, and *Aldinger v. Howard*. The court notes that these cases relied on aspects of *Monroe v. Pape* that are now overruled.  Therefore, while not explicitly stating that *City of Kenosha v. Bruno* is overruled, the court's action functionally overrules it insofar as it applied principles from *Monroe v. Pape* that are now rejected. This satisfies criteria 3 and 6 for overruling.
109881	108375	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents* several times.  However, in no instance does it state that *Bivens* is overruled, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the court cites *Bivens* as relevant precedent when considering whether to imply a cause of action directly from the Fourteenth Amendment.  The court is discussing whether to create a cause of action similar to that in *Bivens*, not whether to overturn *Bivens* itself.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Bivens* has been overruled.
109881	108913	no	no	95	The provided text cites Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur multiple times.  However, in no instance does the text suggest that LaFleur has been overruled.  The case is cited as precedent in the discussion of the constitutionality of the policies regarding maternity leave. There is no language indicating that the Court is overruling, modifying, or limiting the holding of LaFleur in any way. The citations treat LaFleur as valid precedent.
109881	109574	no	no	95	The provided text overrules *Monroe v. Pape*, not *Mt. Healthy City School District Board of Education v. Doyle*.  While *Mt. Healthy* is mentioned multiple times, the opinion clarifies that the question of municipal liability under §1983 was left open in that case and is being addressed separately in the current opinion.  The court explicitly overrules *Monroe v. Pape* insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under § 1983.  There is no language suggesting that *Mt. Healthy* itself is overruled, either fully or partially.
109881	90041	no	no	90	The provided text mentions *Ex parte Virginia* multiple times.  However, it does not state that the case has been overruled. Instead, the text notes that precedent from *Ex parte Virginia*, along with other cases (like *Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe*), "has not survived." This statement indicates that the legal principles established in these cases are no longer fully applicable in the context of the current legal discussion, but it does not constitute an explicit overruling.  The court uses the case as precedent but notes that its application is limited.  The passage highlights the evolution of legal interpretation and how previously established precedents may be subject to future qualifications or limitations depending on the specific context of the cases. This is different from explicitly overruling a case.
109881	109503	no	no	85	The provided text repeatedly cites *Aldinger v. Howard* as precedent, and while the Court revisits the interpretation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 concerning municipal liability, it does not explicitly overrule *Aldinger*.  The opinion discusses *Aldinger* in the context of a broader reevaluation of *Monroe v. Pape*, but the Court does not state that *Aldinger* is no longer good law or offer a functionally equivalent statement of overruling.  The Court's analysis focuses on the implications of *Monroe* and its subsequent interpretations, leaving *Aldinger*'s status largely unchanged within the presented text. Therefore, there's no clear indication that *Aldinger v. Howard* has been overruled.
109895	109631	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States v. Martin Linen Supply Co.* (1977) as precedent.  The excerpts show that the court relies on the case's interpretation of double jeopardy law. There is no language suggesting that the court overruled, qualified, or limited the application of *Martin Linen*. In fact, the dissenting opinion explicitly mentions that the majority opinion overrules other cases (Jenkins and Lee), but *Martin Linen* is not among those mentioned.
109895	109688	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Lee v. United States*, but it does not overrule the case.  Instead, the excerpts discuss and apply the principles established in *Lee*, particularly regarding the double jeopardy clause and appeals from judgments favorable to the defendant.  The text even notes that a later case overrules principles established in *Lee* and *Jenkins*, but *Lee* itself is not directly overruled. The majority of the citations are used to support legal arguments rather than to declare *Lee* as overruled.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Lee v. United States* (1977) was overruled in the snippets provided.
109895	109200	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States v. Wilson*, 420 U.S. 332 (1975), but does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts either mention the case as precedent (supporting the proposition that the government may appeal a favorable judgment for the accused if the appeal wouldn't necessitate a retrial) or use it to illustrate a point about the balance between the government's right to appeal and the defendant's interest in avoiding multiple prosecutions.  There is no language suggesting the overruling of *Wilson*, either explicitly or implicitly.  The cases cited alongside *Wilson* seem to be used for comparative analysis and do not affect the precedent set by *Wilson*. 
109895	109201	yes	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the Court overrules the principle recognized in Jenkins and Lee.  The opinion clarifies that while the government may not appeal from judgments of acquittal (where reversals would necessitate new trials), appeals will be allowed from other final judgments favoring the accused. This directly overrules the precedent set in *United States v. Jenkins*, at least in part, by changing the permissible scope of government appeals in criminal cases.
109895	105594	no	no	95	The provided text overrules the case *Jenkins*, not *Green v. United States (1957)*.  While *Green v. United States (1957)* is cited multiple times, there is no language suggesting it has been overruled. The court uses *Green* to support its reasoning regarding the Double Jeopardy Clause but does not challenge or modify its holding.
109895	94515	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States v. Ball*, and in each instance, it is used to support the Court's reasoning.  There is no language suggesting that *Ball* has been overruled, in whole or in part.  Instead, the Court explicitly affirms the holding of *Ball* in at least one instance.  The fact that the Court distinguishes the circumstances of the current case from those in *Ball* does not constitute overruling.  The Court acknowledges and builds upon the precedent set by *Ball*, confirming its continued relevance. 
109895	109773	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Arizona v. Washington*, but it does not contain any language suggesting that the case has been overruled.  The excerpts cite *Arizona v. Washington* as precedent,  referencing its analysis of "manifest necessity" in mistrial declarations. There is no indication of overruling, partial or full, nor is there any qualification, distinction of legal principles, or statements that the case is no longer good law in specific contexts.
109895	96129	no	no	95	The provided text discusses Kepner v. United States (1904) and its relevance to double jeopardy.  While the opinion mentions a dissenting opinion in Kepner that suggested a different approach to double jeopardy, the majority opinion in the case of interest is cited, not overruled.  The excerpt does not contain language explicitly overruling Kepner, nor does it offer functionally equivalent language.  No part of the case is qualified or overruled, nor does it limit Kepner's application to specific circumstances.  The court does not distinguish different legal principles within Kepner, nor does it declare it to be no longer good law in any context. Therefore, based on the provided text, Kepner v. United States has not been overruled.
109895	109204	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule *Serfass v. United States*.  Instead, it overrules *Jenkins v. United States*, a different case. While *Serfass* is mentioned multiple times, the excerpts only use it as precedent and to clarify points of law, not to overturn it.  There is no language suggesting that *Serfass* is no longer good law, is partially overruled, or is overruled in specific contexts.  The text highlights that *Jenkins* was wrongly decided and that the court's understanding of the Double Jeopardy Clause has evolved, but these changes do not affect the legal standing of *Serfass*.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Serfass* has been overruled.
109895	108233	no	no	95	The provided text cites *United States v. Jorn*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpts use the case as precedent, specifically referencing Jorn's statement regarding a defendant's motion for mistrial removing barriers to reprosecution. This demonstrates that the court is *following*, not overruling, the cited case.  There is no language suggesting the court is explicitly overruling Jorn, nor is there any indication of partial overruling, qualification, or contextual limitation of Jorn's holding. 
109895	106359	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Fong Foo v. United States* as precedent,  supporting the court's reasoning on double jeopardy.  There is no language suggesting it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court relies on *Fong Foo* alongside other cases to establish its understanding of double jeopardy principles. Therefore, there is no indication that *Fong Foo* has been overruled.
110063	94405	yes	yes	100	The excerpt explicitly states that "Geer v. Connecticut, 161 U.S. 519 (1896), on which the Court of Criminal Appeals relied, is overruled."  Later in the excerpt, the court further clarifies:  "We hold that time has revealed the error of the early resolution reached in that case, and accordingly Geer is today overruled."  The court directly and explicitly overrules the case of interest, Geer v. Connecticut.
110063	100325	no	no	95	The provided text overrules the case *Geer v. Connecticut*, not the case of interest, *Lacoste v. Department of Conservation of Louisiana*. Although *Lacoste* is cited multiple times, there is no language suggesting it has been overruled.  The court distinguishes *Lacoste* from *Geer*, finding *Lacoste* more compatible with cases that oppose *Geer*'s view.  This is not the same as overruling *Lacoste*. The court analyzes *Lacoste* to understand the state's power to regulate wildlife but does not challenge the legal holding of *Lacoste* itself.
110063	101328	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel*, and in each instance, it is used as precedent to strike down state regulations that discriminate against interstate commerce.  No language suggests that the case itself has been overruled. Instead, the court relies on its principles to support its decisions in subsequent cases.  The text explicitly distinguishes *Foster-Fountain Packing* from *Geer v. Connecticut*, but this is not the same as overruling *Foster-Fountain Packing*.  The court uses *Foster-Fountain Packing* to support the idea that states cannot use their claimed ownership of natural resources to discriminate against out-of-state businesses in the context of interstate commerce.
110063	104652	no	no	95	The provided text overrules the case *Geer v. Connecticut*, not the case of interest, *H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond*.  While *H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond* is cited multiple times, there is no language suggesting it has been overruled.  The citations are used to support various points about the Commerce Clause, but not in a way that indicates the court is rejecting the precedent set by *H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond*. Therefore, based solely on the provided text, there is no indication that *H. P. Hood & Sons, Inc. v. Du Mond* has been overruled.
110063	97421	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.* as a precedent that has influenced subsequent Commerce Clause jurisprudence.  The excerpts show that the *West* decision's analysis became the dominant approach in later cases dealing with state regulation of natural resource exports.  No language suggests that *West* was overruled, either fully or partially. Instead, its reasoning and principles have been affirmed, applied, and distinguished in later cases.  The excerpts show that *West* is still considered good law and has been followed in later decisions. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *West* has been overruled.
110063	108085	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.* and uses its formulation to analyze Commerce Clause challenges.  No language suggests that *Pike* itself is overruled, modified, or limited in any way.  Instead, the court uses *Pike* as the controlling precedent in its analysis.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.* has been overruled.
110063	109662	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule *Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc*.  While *Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc*. is cited multiple times, the excerpts focus on overruling *Geer v. Connecticut*.  The text uses *Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc*. to support the argument that the "ownership" theory in *Geer* was a legal fiction and that modern analysis should focus on whether state police powers conform with federal laws and the Constitution.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Douglas v. Seacoast Products, Inc*. itself has been overruled.
110063	109868	no	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that the court overruled Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm'n.  Justice Rehnquist's dissent specifically mentions the majority opinion overruling Baldwin.  Therefore, condition 1 for overruling is met.
110063	109916	no	no	100	The provided text cites the case of *City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey* (1978) and uses it as precedent in applying the principle from *Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc*.  There is no language suggesting that *City of Philadelphia v. New Jersey* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The text uses the 1978 case to support the court's current holding. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that it has been overruled.
110063	104563	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Toomer v. Witsell*, often in conjunction with discussions of state regulations on natural resources and interstate commerce.  However, none of the citations suggest that *Toomer* itself has been overruled.  Instead, the excerpts show *Toomer* being cited as precedent,  clarified, or its reasoning being applied or distinguished in later cases.  One excerpt even notes that the ownership theory in *Geer*, which *Toomer* addressed, is open to question, but this does not constitute overruling *Toomer* itself. Therefore, there's no indication that the case has been overruled, either fully or partially.
110212	105789	yes	no	95	The Supreme Court in Trammel v. United States (1980) did not explicitly overrule Hawkins v. United States (1958).  While Trammel extensively discussed and analyzed Hawkins,  it ultimately modified the spousal privilege, shifting the control of the privilege from the defendant to the witness-spouse.  This is a significant change, but it's not an outright overruling. The Court acknowledged the criticisms of Hawkins and the evolving understanding of the spousal privilege, leading to its modification rather than its complete invalidation.  The court noted that Hawkins left room for future changes based on reason and experience, and that is exactly what Trammel did. Therefore, Hawkins remains good law, albeit modified by Trammel.
110212	102164	no	no	95	The provided text discusses Funk v. United States (1933) and its impact on spousal disqualification in federal courts.  The excerpts explain that Funk abolished the testimonial disqualification, allowing a spouse to testify on behalf of a defendant. However, the court's discussion of Funk does not indicate that it was overruled. Instead, the excerpts cite Funk as precedent supporting the idea that courts should adapt rules to modern conditions, even if it means abandoning ancient ones. The court in the citing case refers to Funk to justify a similar reconsideration of a current rule, not to overturn Funk itself.
110212	106048	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Wyatt v. United States (1960)* as accord with the holding in *Hawkins v. United States*.  There is no language suggesting that *Wyatt* is overruled,  modified, or no longer good law in any context. The excerpt acknowledges *Wyatt*'s existence and notes an exception within it, but this is not the same as overruling the case.  Instead, the citing text uses *Wyatt* as supporting precedent.
110212	102181	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Wolfle v. United States*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the court distinguishes *Wolfle* and *Blau v. United States*, stating that its holding does not disturb those cases because the privilege at issue in *Wolfle* and *Blau* (confidential marital communications) is not at issue in the current case.  The court acknowledges *Wolfle* by citing it and explicitly notes that its decision today does not affect the precedent set in *Wolfle*. Therefore, there is no indication that *Wolfle v. United States* has been overruled.
110212	86090	no	no	95	The provided text describes the historical application of spousal disqualification in the case of Stein v. Bowman (1839) and its later overruling in Funk v. United States (1933).  However, the excerpt does not state that Stein v. Bowman was overruled.  Instead, it places Stein v. Bowman within the historical context of a legal principle that was later modified and abolished. The passage explains how the rule in Stein v. Bowman, which barred spousal testimony, was eventually changed, but doesn't explicitly state that the Stein v. Bowman case itself has been overruled.
110212	104845	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Blau v. United States* multiple times.  In footnote 5, the court explicitly states that its holding does not disturb *Blau*. This strongly indicates that the court did not overrule *Blau v. United States*. The court's mention of *Blau* is in the context of the confidential marital communications privilege, which is a distinct legal issue from the primary focus of the cited opinion.
110325	106022	yes	yes	100	The Supreme Court explicitly overruled the "automatic standing" rule of Jones v. United States.  The Court stated that the automatic standing rule of Jones v. United States is overruled. The Court's reasoning is that defendants charged with crimes of possession may only claim the benefits of the exclusionary rule if their own Fourth Amendment rights have been violated.  This directly contradicts the holding in Jones, which allowed defendants charged with possessory offenses to challenge the legality of a search without having to show their own Fourth Amendment rights were violated.
110325	107636	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss the case *Simmons v. United States*, but do not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts analyze how *Simmons* impacted the "automatic standing" rule established in *Jones v. United States*. The Court acknowledges *Simmons* and its implications for self-incrimination, but ultimately focuses on the erosion of the underlying principles of *Jones*, not on overruling *Simmons* itself.  The Court discusses how *Simmons* eliminated the "self-incrimination dilemma" but later considers whether it fully resolved concerns surrounding the use of suppression hearing testimony for impeachment purposes, not implying that *Simmons* is overruled.
110325	108760	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes and discusses Brown v. United States (1973), but it does not overrule it.  The excerpts cite Brown, often in the context of its limitations or distinctions from other cases.  There's no language suggesting the court intends to overturn Brown. The author uses Brown as precedent, showing that it is being followed, or at least considered and not explicitly rejected.
110325	107872	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Alderman v. United States multiple times. However,  it does not contain language explicitly overruling it, nor does it offer functionally equivalent language. Instead, the text cites Alderman as precedent that the Court has declined to expand the Jones rule to other classes of offenses.  Therefore, the case has not been overruled. The citing opinions use Alderman to support their holdings, suggesting it remains relevant legal precedent at the time of the citing case.
110563	109615	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady* and uses its four-part test as the standard for evaluating the Montana tax.  The Supreme Court affirms the use of the Complete Auto Transit test, and states that any contrary statements in previous cases are disapproved. However, this is not equivalent to overruling *Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady*. The court uses the prior case as precedent.  No language in the excerpt suggests that *Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady* is no longer good law or is overruled in any way. The court instead uses the case to provide the framework of analysis.
110563	109835	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Department of Revenue v. Ass'n of Washington Stevedoring Companies (1978)*.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the citing opinions refer to the 1978 case as precedent, analyzing its application and implications in relation to subsequent Commerce Clause challenges.  There is no language suggesting it was overruled, partially overruled, or no longer good law in specific circumstances.
110563	877181	no	no	95	The excerpts provided do not overrule *Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State* (1980).  Instead, the excerpts discuss the case and cite it multiple times as precedent while analyzing the constitutionality of a Montana coal severance tax under the Commerce Clause. The Supreme Court's analysis focuses on whether prior cases, such as *Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co*, *Oliver Iron Mining Co. v. Lord*, and *Hope Natural Gas Co. v. Hall*, were correctly decided and if the *Complete Auto Transit* test should apply.  While the Court disapproves of "any contrary statements in Heisler and its progeny", it does not explicitly overrule *Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State* itself. The opinion uses *Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State* as a basis for comparison and analysis, but does not state that the case is overruled, no longer good law, or functionally equivalent to overruling. Therefore, there is no indication that *Commonwealth Edison Co. v. State* has been overruled.
110563	104253	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Nippert v. Richmond* multiple times. However, it does not contain language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The text cites *Nippert* as precedent, showing that the court's analysis in the current case draws upon the principles established in *Nippert*. There is no language suggesting it is no longer good law or that any part of it has been overturned.
110563	110488	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Maryland v. Louisiana (1981) several times, but it does not overrule it.  The citing case uses Maryland v. Louisiana as precedent in the discussion of Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes. There is no language suggesting the overruling of any part of the case, nor any indication that the case is no longer good law in any context.  The case is cited as an example of a case which has addressed similar issues regarding Commerce Clause and discriminatory tax treatment. Therefore, it is being used as a valid precedent.
110563	102972	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Western Live Stock v. Bureau of Revenue*, but it does not contain language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The excerpts show the Court acknowledging the precedent set by *Western Live Stock*, specifically its statement that "interstate commerce may be required to 'pay its way.'"  The opinion uses this principle in the context of evaluating modern Commerce Clause challenges. This does not meet any of the criteria for considering *Western Live Stock* as overruled.
110563	106846	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *General Motors Corp. v. Washington*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpts cite the case as precedent supporting the principle that a state's "just share of state tax burden" includes costs of providing services like police and fire protection. There is no language suggesting that the case is overruled, explicitly or implicitly. The opinion uses the case to support its argument, suggesting it is still considered good law in this context.
110563	103186	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Clark v. Paul Gray, Inc.* alongside other cases within a discussion of taxes on interstate commerce.  The court distinguishes the present case, involving a general revenue tax, from those cases (including *Clark*) which involved "user" fees or taxes designed as specific charges for state-provided services.  The court does not explicitly overrule *Clark*, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Instead, the court limits *Clark*'s applicability to a different factual scenario. Therefore, it is not overruled, but rather distinguished.
110563	100063	yes	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co. (1922) approach is disapproved.  The court states that Heisler's "mechanical" approach is disapproved.  This directly satisfies condition 2 (functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling) and potentially condition 1 (explicitly overruled, although not in the strongest possible terms) for the criteria of overruling a case. The case is not simply being distinguished or limited to certain circumstances; instead, its core methodology is rejected.
110563	105195	no	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that cases *Puget Sound Stevedoring Co. v. State Tax Comm'n* (302 U.S. 90 (1937)) and *Joseph v. Carter & Weekes Stevedoring Co.* (330 U.S. 422 (1947)), along with *Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Co. v. Calvert* (347 U.S. 157 (1954)), were overruled in *Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos.* This directly satisfies condition 1 for overruling a case.  The passage indicates that the cited case was overruled, and the reason for this was to establish a 'consistent and rational method of inquiry' in Commerce Clause challenges concerning state taxes, focusing on the 'practical effect'.
110563	102777	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Ingels v. Morf*, but does not overrule it.  The opinion distinguishes *Ingels* from the current case by noting that *Ingels* and similar cases dealt with "user fees or taxes" designed as specific charges for state-provided services, unlike the general revenue tax at issue in the present case.  The Court cites *Ingels* as an example of a type of case different from the one before it, not as a case to be overruled.
110799	2226827	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes State Ex Rel. Douglas v. Sporhase (1981), but does not overrule it.  The opinion discusses the case extensively, particularly its holding that groundwater is not an article of commerce under Nebraska law.  However, there is no language explicitly overruling the case, nor is there any language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the opinion critiques the reasoning of Sporhase in relation to the Commerce Clause and other legal precedents, offering a different interpretation and clarifying distinctions.  It does not declare Sporhase to be no longer good law, nor does it limit its application to specific circumstances. Therefore, the case remains as precedent, although its interpretation and application are being debated.
110799	1818257	no	no	95	The excerpts describe the case *City of Altus v. Carr* and its summary affirmance by the Supreme Court.  However, there is no language explicitly overruling the case or indicating it is no longer good law. The Court clarifies that the summary affirmance did not necessarily endorse the lower court's reasoning but only agreed with the result.  Further, the Court notes inconsistencies between *City of Altus v. Carr* and another case (*Hudson County*), but this is a distinction, not an overruling.  Therefore, the case was not overruled.
110799	96834	yes	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss the case *Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter* (1908) in the context of later cases concerning interstate water transfer.  While the later cases address similar legal questions about the regulation of water as an article of commerce and the Commerce Clause, none of the excerpts explicitly overrule *Hudson County Water Co*.  The excerpts analyze and compare *Hudson County Water Co.* to subsequent cases to clarify their respective holdings on similar issues, but they don't declare it to be overruled or no longer good law.  The citing opinions distinguish *Hudson County Water Co.* based on differences in the facts and applicable state law, or cite it as a relevant but not controlling precedent, but this does not qualify as overruling.
110799	97421	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co.* and discusses its relevance to the Commerce Clause.  However, there is no language suggesting the Court explicitly overrules it, uses functionally equivalent language, overrules or qualifies part of it, overrules it in certain circumstances, distinguishes its treatment of legal principles, or declares it no longer good law in specific contexts. While the Court's discussion considers *West* in light of a more modern understanding,  it doesn't challenge the precedent itself. The mention of Justice Holmes' dissent in *West* is not an overruling; rather, it acknowledges a differing opinion within the Court's history on the matter.  The analysis instead centers on whether the principle established in *West* applies to the specific facts of the case at hand.
110799	94405	no	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the court, three years prior to the current opinion, expressly overruled Geer v. Connecticut.  The opinion notes that the theory of public ownership upon which Geer was premised has been rejected. Although the exact language of the overruling is not provided, the explicit statement that Geer was overruled is sufficient to classify it as such. The fact that the overruling is mentioned in the context of contrasting it with a later case (City of Altus) further supports this conclusion.
110719	110119	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *Arkansas v. Sanders* multiple times.  However, none of the citations indicate that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the citing opinions either distinguish the case (by focusing on the specific facts of *Sanders*, such as the lack of probable cause to search the vehicle itself), or reaffirm the principle established in *Sanders* that the warrant requirement applies to containers found in vehicles.  The opinions discuss and refine the application of the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, clarifying its scope and limitations in relation to containers, but they do not explicitly overrule *Arkansas v. Sanders*.  One concurring opinion mentions dissatisfaction with the Court's vacillation on automobile searches, but this does not constitute overruling *Sanders*.
110719	100567	no	no	95	The Supreme Court in *United States v. Ross* (1982) referenced *Carroll v. United States* (1925) multiple times.  However, it did not overrule *Carroll*.  Instead, *Ross* clarified and extended the scope of the automobile exception to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement established in *Carroll*. *Ross* addressed the issue of searching containers within a vehicle that was lawfully stopped based on probable cause.  The Court in *Ross* held that a warrantless search of an automobile, if justified by probable cause, could extend to containers within the vehicle, even if not in plain view. This is because the Court believed that limiting searches to only what is in plain view would severely undermine the automobile exception's effectiveness in preventing the destruction or removal of evidence. The decision in *Ross* built upon *Carroll*, did not contradict or invalidate *Carroll*, rather it expanded upon its interpretation.
110719	109714	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States v. Chadwick*, often in the context of cases that either distinguish it (by focusing on differences between searching vehicles and containers) or reaffirm its principles regarding warrant requirements for searching containers.  While the Court discusses and analyzes *Chadwick*, there's no indication that it is being overruled, fully or partially.  The cases mentioned alongside *Chadwick* refine and clarify the application of its principles, rather than overturning it. The analysis focuses on the nuances of the 'automobile exception' to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement and how it applies (or doesn't apply) to searches of containers within vehicles.   There is no language suggesting that *Chadwick* is no longer good law, in any context.  Instead, the text clarifies the scope and limitations of *Chadwick's* holding.
110719	110558	yes	yes	95	The provided text shows that the court reconsidered the decision in Robbins v. California.  While not explicitly stating "overruled," the court's invitation to reconsider Robbins, along with the subsequent majority opinion that effectively contradicts the core holding of Robbins regarding the search of containers within vehicles, signifies an overruling.  Justice White's dissent explicitly states that he "would not overrule Robbins,"  further highlighting that the majority opinion does in fact overturn the precedent set by Robbins.
110719	108184	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Chambers v. Maroney*, but it does not contain language that would indicate the case has been overruled.  The excerpts discuss the case's application and interpretation within the broader context of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence concerning automobile searches.  While the Court's approach to warrantless searches in vehicles is discussed and refined in subsequent cases, there is no explicit overruling or language functionally equivalent to overruling *Chambers v. Maroney*. The citing opinions appear to either distinguish *Chambers* from the specific circumstances of the cases at hand or reaffirm its holding in some contexts. 
110719	392944	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss and analyze the case *United States v. Ross*, 456 U.S. 798 (1982), and its interpretation by lower courts, particularly the Court of Appeals.  The excerpts show disagreements and different interpretations of *Ross* among judges and courts.  However, none of the excerpts explicitly overrule *United States v. Albert Ross, Jr.* (1981). The excerpts focus on the interpretation and application of *Ross*, highlighting the challenges in applying its principles consistently and the ongoing debate about its scope and limitations.  Therefore, there is no evidence that *United States v. Albert Ross, Jr.* (1981) has been overruled.
110719	108377	no	no	95	The excerpts mention Coolidge v. New Hampshire several times.  However, in all instances, the case is cited as precedent that the court either chooses to follow or distinguish from the current case.  There is no language suggesting that Coolidge v. New Hampshire has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court uses Coolidge to support its reasoning, but does not challenge the validity or applicability of Coolidge itself.
111218	104463	yes	yes	95	The court opinion explicitly discusses and analyzes *United States v. Yellow Cab Co*.  While not using the word "overruled", the court's reasoning and subsequent holdings effectively negate the precedent set in *Yellow Cab*.  The opinion directly challenges the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, which originated from *Yellow Cab*,  and replaces it with a new standard.  The court identifies multiple instances where *Yellow Cab* was relied upon, indicating that it will not be followed as precedent in the future.  This is a functional equivalent to explicitly overruling it, fulfilling criterion 2 for overruling.
111218	104915	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States* (1951) as precedent.  While the author expresses some skepticism about the continued relevance of the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine in the context of *Timken*, there is no language suggesting the case itself has been overruled. The author notes that the result in *Timken* could potentially be reached on different grounds, but this does not constitute overruling.  The citing opinions repeatedly reaffirm the principle from *Timken* that common ownership or control does not shield corporations from antitrust liability. The analysis focuses on refining and questioning the reasoning behind *Timken*, not explicitly overruling it.
111218	104839	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes the case *Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc.* in the context of intra-enterprise conspiracy and antitrust law.  The opinion discusses the limitations of the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine and suggests that the result in *Kiefer-Stewart* could be reached on alternative grounds today, given the development of antitrust law.  However, there is no explicit overruling of *Kiefer-Stewart*. The court critiques the reasoning in *Kiefer-Stewart*, pointing out that it didn't fully consider all possible antitrust violations, but it does not declare the case overruled, nor does it explicitly overturn any aspect of its holding. The court suggests alternative ways of reaching a similar outcome, implying the case is not fully relevant as precedent in the current context, but this is not an overruling.
111218	107732	no	no	90	The provided text discusses Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp. in the context of the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine.  The author analyzes the case's holding, suggesting that the result in Perma Life Mufflers could be reached through alternative grounds and questioning whether the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine was necessary to its conclusion. However, there is no explicit overruling, nor language functionally equivalent to overruling. The analysis is a critique of the reasoning behind the decision, not a declaration that the case is no longer good law.  The author points out inconsistencies between the case and a new rule being introduced in the current court opinion but does not overrule the cited case. Therefore, based on the provided text, Perma Life Mufflers is not overruled.
111218	102041	no	no	90	The provided text analyzes *Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt discusses the case's relevance to later antitrust cases, particularly regarding intra-enterprise conspiracies.  While the author suggests that *Appalachian Coals*' support for a broad interpretation of intra-enterprise conspiracy is minimal, and some statements might be considered dicta, there's no explicit overruling or language functionally equivalent to overruling. The analysis critically examines the application and interpretation of *Appalachian Coals* in subsequent cases, but stops short of declaring it overruled. 
111218	104037	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes and discusses the case *United States v. Crescent Amusement Co.* in relation to other cases, particularly concerning the Sherman Act and anti-competitive practices among affiliated corporations.  However, there is no explicit language indicating that *Crescent Amusement Co.* has been overruled. The excerpts cite and interpret *Crescent Amusement Co.*, sometimes agreeing or disagreeing with its holding but not stating it's overruled, or even explicitly modifying its application.  The analysis focuses on the consistency or inconsistency of *Crescent Amusement Co.*'s precedent with newer cases, not on overruling it. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude the case has been overruled.
111218	1292673	no	no	-1	EMPTY_EXCERPTS
111218	106009	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *United States v. Parke, Davis & Co.* multiple times.  However, none of the mentions indicate that the case has been overruled. The excerpts cite the case as precedent,  reinforcing its holding regarding resale price maintenance and the Sherman Act.  There is no language suggesting overruling, qualification, or limitation of the case's application to specific circumstances.  The court uses the case to support its own arguments, indicating it remains relevant precedent.
111218	409686	no	yes	95	The provided text shows that the court explicitly overrules the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, stating that the coordinated acts of a parent and its wholly-owned subsidiary cannot constitute a combination or conspiracy under Section 1 of the Sherman Act.  The court acknowledges that its new rule is inconsistent with previous decisions, including the cited case (691 F.2d 310 (1982)), which the court cites multiple times and uses to highlight the shift in legal understanding.  The court's explicit overruling of the established doctrine renders the cited case's interpretation of the law no longer valid.
111103	102987	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Helvering v. Mitchell*, often to support the principle that a prior criminal acquittal does not bar a subsequent civil action for monetary penalties or forfeitures, due to differences in burdens of proof.  No language in the excerpts suggests the Court overruled *Helvering v. Mitchell*.  Instead, the case is used as precedent, particularly in distinguishing it from *Coffey v. United States*.  The opinion explicitly reaffirms the principles established in *Helvering v. Mitchell*. Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled.
111103	110331	no	no	100	The provided text cites the case *United States v. Ward* multiple times, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the text uses the case as precedent in analyzing whether a forfeiture under Section 924(d) is criminal or civil in nature.  The court applies the "Ward test" from *United States v. Ward*, indicating the case is still considered good law and is being followed as precedent, not overruled.
111103	106534	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez.  Instead, the excerpt from *United States v. Ward* cites *Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez* as a source for a list of considerations relevant to determining whether a statutory scheme is punitive or remedial in nature.  The Court uses the list of factors set out in *Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez* as a helpful tool in its analysis but does not overrule it in any way.  The text explicitly states that the list from *Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez* is neither exhaustive nor dispositive, which would be inconsistent with an overruling.
111103	407595	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule the case of interest, *United States v. One Assortment of 89 Firearms*. Instead, the text describes the case's reversal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  The Supreme Court later granted certiorari and reversed the Fourth Circuit's decision.  This is not an overruling of the original case, but rather a resolution of the conflict between the lower court's decision and the Supreme Court's interpretation of the law.  The excerpt details the differing opinions regarding the nature of the forfeiture proceeding (criminal vs. civil), and the applicability of double jeopardy and collateral estoppel.  No language is used which indicates that the case is no longer good law or that it is explicitly overruled.
111103	108643	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule *One Lot Emerald Cut Stones v. United States*.  Instead, the excerpt discusses the case and its application of principles from *Helvering v. Mitchell*, distinguishing it from *Coffey v. United States*. The text suggests that *Coffey* may be problematic or confusing, but it does not explicitly overrule *One Lot Emerald Cut Stones*, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The excerpt uses the case as precedent in supporting the idea that an acquittal on criminal charges doesn't automatically bar a civil forfeiture action. Therefore, the case remains valid.
111103	106087	no	no	95	The excerpt uses Flemming v. Nestor (1960) as precedent in determining whether a statutory scheme is so punitive in purpose or effect as to negate Congress' intention to establish a civil remedial mechanism.  The court cites Flemming's emphasis on requiring "clear proof" that the purpose and effect of a forfeiture are punitive to override Congress's preference for civil sanctions.  This is not an overruling, but rather a direct application and affirmation of the precedent set by Flemming v. Nestor.
111103	8178595	yes	no	-1	CITE_NOT_FOUND
111308	109499	yes	yes	100	The Supreme Court explicitly overrules National League of Cities v. Usery (1976) in the provided text.  The majority opinion states: "National League of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833 (1976), is overruled." This directly satisfies condition #1 for a case being overruled.
111308	110881	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *EEOC v. Wyoming* multiple times.  In several instances, it is cited as precedent in discussions surrounding the overruling of *National League of Cities*.  However, there is no language in the excerpts that explicitly overrules *EEOC v. Wyoming*, nor does it use functionally equivalent language to do so. The text uses the case to illustrate points about federalism and the Commerce Clause. It does not suggest the case is no longer good law in any context or that any part of its legal reasoning is invalid.
111308	110516	no	no	95	The provided text discusses Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc. (1981) in the context of the overruling of National League of Cities v. Usery (1976).  Hodel is cited multiple times as a case that followed and applied the principles established in National League of Cities. Although National League of Cities was overruled, there is no indication within the provided text that Hodel itself was overruled. The excerpts show Hodel being cited as precedent,  reaffirming the principles later overturned in National League of Cities. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that Hodel was overruled, either fully or partially.
111308	110673	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co.* (1982).  The excerpts show the case was referenced and its reasoning discussed, particularly regarding the interpretation of "traditional governmental functions" in relation to the National League of Cities case. However, there is no indication that *United Transportation Union v. Long Island R. Co.* was overruled.  Instead, the court opinion uses the case as precedent and clarifies or refines its application.  The discussions surrounding the case focus on its interpretation and application, rather than its overruling.
111308	104222	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *New York v. United States*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts describe the case as a landmark decision that abandoned the "governmental" vs. "proprietary" functions distinction in intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine.  The citing opinions refer to and endorse aspects of the *New York v. United States* decision, particularly Justice Frankfurter's observation regarding the process of constitutional adjudication.  There is no language suggesting the overruling, modification, or limitation of *New York v. United States*. The case is cited approvingly and its holding is reaffirmed in the context of discussing federalism and the Commerce Clause.
111308	110718	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *FERC v. Mississippi*.  In several instances, the Court uses the case to support or reaffirm principles related to federalism and state sovereignty. There is no indication that *FERC v. Mississippi* itself was overruled.  Instead, the excerpts discuss the overruling of *National League of Cities v. Usery*, a different case. While *FERC v. Mississippi* is discussed in the context of the overruling of *National League of Cities*, it is used as a precedent, not as a target for overruling. Therefore, there is no evidence to suggest that *FERC v. Mississippi* was overruled.
111308	109259	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Fry v. United States*, but never states that it has been overruled.  While the text discusses the evolution of legal standards concerning the balance of power between federal and state governments in the context of the Commerce Clause, and mentions cases that have modified or clarified precedent in this area, none of these actions explicitly overrule *Fry*. The citations to *Fry* seem to be used to support various arguments in the citing opinions, but not in a way that indicates it is no longer good law or has been superseded by conflicting precedent.
111308	107734	no	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that *National League of Cities* overruled *Maryland v. Wirtz*.  This is explicitly stated multiple times.  Therefore, according to the provided criteria, *Maryland v. Wirtz* is considered overruled.
111308	2239255	no	yes	95	The case *Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority*, 469 U.S. 528 (1985) effectively overruled the District Court's decision in *San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority v. Donovan* (1983), which is the case of interest.  The Supreme Court in *Garcia* explicitly reconsidered and overruled the principles of the Tenth Amendment as set forth in *National League of Cities v. Usery*, 426 U.S. 833 (1976), a case heavily relied upon by the District Court in *Donovan*.  The *Garcia* court's decision directly impacted the legal reasoning in the District Court's *Donovan* ruling, rendering its conclusion on the application of the Tenth Amendment and the immunity of SAMTA from federal wage regulations obsolete.  Although *Donovan* is not explicitly named, the overruling of *National League of Cities* undermines the legal basis of the lower court's judgment in *Donovan*. The Supreme Court's action in *Garcia* implicitly overruled the *Donovan* court's interpretation and application of the Tenth Amendment and therefore the case of interest has been overruled.
111308	102330	no	no	90	The provided text discusses Helvering v. Powers (1934) in the context of the evolution of the distinction between "governmental" and "proprietary" functions in relation to state immunity from federal taxation.  While the text notes that the "governmental-proprietary" distinction was later deemed "untenable" in New York v. United States (1946), it does not explicitly state that Helvering v. Powers was overruled. The excerpt uses Helvering v. Powers as an example of a case applying the then-current (and later rejected) distinction.  There's no language indicating it was overturned, but rather that the underlying legal principle upon which it was based was later found to be flawed. Therefore, the case wasn't overruled, but the legal reasoning behind the decision was.
111308	96357	no	yes	95	The provided text explains that the distinction in South Carolina v. United States (1905) between "governmental" and "proprietary" functions, which the court used to determine state immunity from federal taxation, was later deemed "untenable" and abandoned in New York v. United States (1946).  The excerpt highlights the inconsistency and lack of principled basis for the distinction used in South Carolina, leading to its eventual overruling. The inability to provide a consistent and justifiable standard for this distinction is presented as the primary reason for its rejection.  Therefore, while not explicitly stated as overruled, the case's central holding is functionally overruled by the later case's rejection of its core principle.
111404	91894	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly rejects a proposition from Ex Parte Bain.  The court acknowledges Bain's general proposition regarding the impermissibility of adding offenses to an indictment but rejects the specific holding that striking unnecessary allegations invalidates the indictment. The court explicitly states that this aspect of Bain is rejected and no longer valid, thus overruling it in part.  This satisfies condition 3 and partially condition 2 for overruling a case.
111404	105978	no	no	95	The Supreme Court in this opinion distinguishes Stirone v. United States, clarifying that Stirone stands for the proposition that the offense proved at trial cannot broaden the charges in the indictment.  The current case involves a narrowing of the indictment's charges, which is a different situation and does not overrule Stirone. The court explicitly states that Stirone is distinct from the present case, and that the present case is more akin to other cases where a narrowing, not a broadening, of the indictment's charges has occurred. Therefore, the court does not overrule Stirone; it distinguishes it.
111404	423986	no	yes	95	The court explicitly overrules the case of interest, 715 F.2d 1360 (1983), by stating that its result conflicts with prior decisions interpreting the Fifth Amendment's Grand Jury Clause.  The court directly addresses and rejects the reasoning of the Court of Appeals in 715 F.2d 1360 (1983), which vacated Miller's conviction based on a perceived variance between the indictment and the proof at trial.  The Supreme Court finds that the indictment gave Miller sufficient notice of the charges against him and that there was no prejudicial surprise.  This constitutes an explicit overruling of the lower court's decision.
111404	102436	no	no	100	The provided text cites the case *Berger v. United States* multiple times but does not contain any language that would indicate it has been overruled.  The citations are used as supporting precedent. There is no explicit overruling, implicit overruling through functionally equivalent language,  or limitation of the case to specific circumstances.  Therefore, based solely on the provided text, there is no evidence that *Berger v. United States* has been overruled.
111404	106407	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Russell v. United States*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites *Russell* as precedent, referring to pages 763-764 of the opinion. There is no language suggesting that the Court disapproves of, limits, or alters the holding of *Russell*. The citation is used to support the argument being made in the current case.
111404	103976	no	no	95	The provided text cites *United States v. Ballard*, 322 U.S. 78 (1944), in the dissenting opinions of other cases.  It does not contain any language that suggests the Court is overruling, modifying, or limiting *Ballard* in any way.  The citations are used to support arguments made in later cases, but this does not constitute an overruling. There is no explicit overruling language, nor any implication that *Ballard* is no longer good law.
111404	100951	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Salinger v. United States* multiple times.  However, nowhere does it explicitly state that *Salinger v. United States* is overruled, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The text cites *Salinger* as precedent and discusses its holding in the context of other cases regarding grand jury indictments. While the Court rejects a particular interpretation of *Ex parte Bain*,  it does so without explicitly mentioning or impacting *Salinger*. Therefore, there's no indication that *Salinger* has been overruled.
111555	110478	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly overrules Parratt v. Taylor to the extent that its holding that negligent acts causing unintended loss of or injury to life, liberty, or property implicate the Due Process Clause.  The court states that it agrees with Justice Powell's concurring opinion in Parratt that negligent acts by state officials, although causing loss of property, are not actionable under the Due Process Clause. This directly addresses and alters the precedent set by Parratt.
111555	111252	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule Hudson v. Palmer.  While the text mentions *Hudson v. Palmer* multiple times, it focuses on overruling *Parratt v. Taylor*. The court's discussion of *Hudson v. Palmer* is contextual and uses it as precedent in the analysis of procedural due process in the context of negligent actions by state officials. There is no language suggesting that *Hudson v. Palmer* itself is overruled, even partially or in specific circumstances.
111555	109635	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule *Ingraham v. Wright*.  While *Ingraham v. Wright* is cited multiple times, the court's analysis focuses on overruling *Parratt v. Taylor*, not *Ingraham*. The court clarifies its understanding of the Due Process Clause and its implications for negligent acts by state officials, but this does not constitute an overruling of *Ingraham*. The court uses *Ingraham* as a reference point within its discussion of the Due Process Clause's historical application and its understanding of the Clause's protection against arbitrary state action.  No language suggests that *Ingraham* is no longer good law or is overruled in any specific context.
111555	109561	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Estelle v. Gamble* multiple times.  However, in no instance does the citing opinion overrule, modify, or limit the holding of *Estelle v. Gamble*. The excerpts simply mention and apply the case's principle regarding "deliberate indifference" in the context of Eighth Amendment violations. There is no language suggesting that *Estelle v. Gamble* is no longer good law or that its holding is limited in any way.
111555	109097	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Wolff v. McDonnell* multiple times. However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled.  The citing opinion uses *Wolff* to illustrate a point about the distinction between deliberate actions and negligence, it does not challenge the legal principles established in *Wolff*. Therefore, there's no indication of overruling, partial or otherwise.
111555	110132	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case *Baker v. McCollan* multiple times.  However, the text does not contain language that would indicate that *Baker v. McCollan* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The citations are used to support the court's reasoning in the current case, treating *Baker v. McCollan* as precedent.  There is no language suggesting it is no longer good law, or that it has been qualified or limited in any way. One citation is in a dissenting opinion; this does not constitute an overruling of the cited case.
111555	87021	no	no	95	The excerpts cite South v. Maryland and interpret its holding.  The court's disagreement with the petitioner's interpretation of South v. Maryland does not equate to overruling the case. The court clarifies its understanding of South v. Maryland, stating that it "does not have its source in the Federal Constitution." This is a limiting interpretation but not an overruling.  The court does not explicitly state that South v. Maryland is overruled, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling the case. No part of the case is overruled, nor is the case overruled insofar as it applies to certain circumstances.  The court does not distinguish the case's treatment of different legal principles or declare it "no longer good law" in specific contexts. Therefore, based on the provided text, South v. Maryland has not been overruled.
111555	106170	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Monroe v. Pape* as precedent multiple times to support the argument that a plaintiff may invoke § 1983 regardless of state remedies when a federal constitutional right is violated.  The excerpt does not contain any language that overrules, modifies, or limits the holding of *Monroe v. Pape*.  Instead, it uses the case to support its reasoning. Therefore, there is no indication that *Monroe v. Pape* has been overruled.
111555	108430	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Groppi v. Leslie* several times. However, it does not contain any language that would suggest the case has been overruled.  The mentions are for comparative purposes or as examples within the court's discussion of procedural due process. There is no explicit overruling, nor is there any language functionally equivalent to overruling, nor any indication that the case is no longer good law in certain contexts.
111555	110169	no	no	100	The excerpt mentions the case *Martinez v. California* but does not overrule it.  The excerpt refers to *Martinez* to support the idea that a state's immunity statute does not violate the Due Process Clause simply because it defeats a state law tort claim.  The citing opinion even later notes that sovereign immunity cannot protect conduct violating federal constitutional guarantees, which is consistent with the holding in *Martinez*. There is no language suggesting the overruling, modification, or limitation of *Martinez v. California*. 
111940	87371	yes	yes	100	The Supreme Court in Puerto Rico v. Branstad explicitly overrules Kentucky v. Dennison.  The Court states that it is reconsidering the holding in Kentucky v. Dennison and that the propositions concerning the limitation of federal judicial power stated in Kentucky v. Dennison in 1861 do not retain their validity.  The Court further notes that the second holding of Kentucky v. Dennison rests upon a foundation with which time and the currents of constitutional change have dealt much less favorably, and that it may stand no longer. Justice Scalia's concurrence also supports the overruling, specifying that the case is overruled insofar as it interpreted the predecessor of 18 U.S.C. § 3182. This satisfies criteria 1 and 4 for overruling.
111940	109961	no	no	95	The provided text cites Michigan v. Doran (1978) to support the interpretation of the Extradition Clause as creating a mandatory duty to deliver up fugitives.  The text explicitly states that the passage of time has revealed no occasion for doubt regarding this interpretation, and it reaffirms the conclusion from prior cases.  There is no language suggesting that Michigan v. Doran has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court's actions are consistent with following the precedent set by *Michigan v. Doran*. 
111940	105312	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Brown v. Board of Education (1955) as a precedent for the court's assertion that federal courts can compel state officials to obey the Constitution.  There is no language suggesting that Brown v. Board of Education has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The passage cites Brown as a relevant case supporting the court's holding, not as a case whose ruling is being altered or rejected.
111940	111492	no	no	95	Justice O'Connor's concurrence mentions Jean v. Nelson, but it does not overrule it.  The opinion focuses on overruling Kentucky v. Dennison.  While Jean v. Nelson is cited, there is no language suggesting it is overruled, modified, or no longer good law in any context. The mention of Jean v. Nelson is only for comparative purposes within the context of the Extradition Clause discussion.
111940	105221	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Brown v. Board of Education (1954) as a case that supports the principle that long-standing practices incompatible with the Constitution cannot override constitutional requirements.  This is not an overruling; it's a citation supporting the court's decision by demonstrating a precedent for upholding constitutional mandates despite contrary practices. The excerpt does not offer any language suggesting that Brown v. Board of Education is overruled or modified in any way.
111940	105766	no	no	100	The provided text mentions Cooper v. Aaron (1958) as a case that has imposed upon state officials a duty to obey the requirements of the Constitution.  There is no language suggesting that Cooper v. Aaron has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpt cites Cooper v. Aaron as a precedent for the principle that federal courts may compel state officials to obey constitutional requirements.  Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled in any way.
111940	96519	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Appleyard v. Massachusetts* as precedent supporting the mandatory nature of the Extradition Clause.  There is no language suggesting the overruling, in whole or in part, of *Appleyard*. The court explicitly reaffirms the conclusions in *Appleyard* regarding the mandatory nature of the Extradition Clause.
111940	467594	no	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the Court reverses the Court of Appeals' decision which affirmed the District Court's reliance on Kentucky v. Dennison.  The Court granted certiorari to consider whether the propositions in Kentucky v. Dennison retain validity, implying a direct challenge to its precedent. By stating "We reverse", the Court implicitly overrules the aspects of Kentucky v. Dennison that were applied by the lower courts in this case, thus satisfying the criteria for an overruled case.
111940	111916	no	no	100	The provided text cites the case California v. Superior Court of California, 482 U.S. 400 (1987), and states "We reaffirm the conclusion that the commands of the Extradition Clause are mandatory, and afford no discretion to the executive officers or courts of the asylum State. See California v. Superior Court of California, 482 U.S. 400, 405-406 (1987)."  This shows the court is following the precedent set by the cited case, not overruling it.
111940	99021	no	no	100	The provided text refers to Biddinger v. Commissioner of Police, 245 U.S. 128 (1917), as precedent supporting the mandatory nature of the Extradition Clause.  The court explicitly reaffirms the conclusions of Biddinger. There is no language suggesting that Biddinger has been overruled, either fully or partially, nor is there any indication that the court is limiting its application to certain circumstances or distinguishing its legal principles.
111940	110926	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Kolender v. Lawson (1983), but does not overrule it. Justice O'Connor's concurrence cites the case as relevant precedent, along with others.  No language suggests that Kolender v. Lawson is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The court overrules Kentucky v. Dennison, but this is a different case.
111940	102605	no	no	95	The excerpt discusses overruling *Kentucky v. Dennison*, not *Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority*.  Justice O'Connor mentions *Ashwander* in a concurring opinion, citing it as precedent along with other cases.  There is no language suggesting that *Ashwander* is overruled, modified, or limited in any way. The fact that *Ashwander* is cited as precedent indicates it's not considered overruled.
111940	110322	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Maine v. Thiboutot (1980), but it does not overrule, or even discuss, the case.  The excerpt uses the case as precedent to support the argument that Puerto Rico can invoke the power of federal courts to enforce rights created by federal statutes. There is no language suggesting the case is overruled in whole or in part, nor is there any indication of the court distinguishing it or limiting its application to specific circumstances. The court simply cites the case as supporting its holding.
111940	109490	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Examining Bd. of Engineers, Architects and Surveyors v. Flores De Otero* (1976), but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt cites the case as support for the proposition that Puerto Rico's change to Commonwealth status did not remove its power to demand extradition under the Extradition Act.  There is no language suggesting that the court disapproves of the prior holding in *Flores de Otero*. Therefore, the case is referenced but not overruled.
111940	96819	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Ex Parte Young*, citing it as a case establishing the principle that federal courts can enjoin unconstitutional actions by state officials.  There is no language suggesting that *Ex Parte Young* has been overruled. The excerpt instead uses *Ex Parte Young* as precedent supporting the court's current position.  The text focuses on overruling or qualifying the precedent of *Dennison v. State of Alabama*, not *Ex Parte Young*. 
111940	96915	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case of *New York ex rel. Kopel v. Bingham*, but it does not overrule it.  In fact, the court explicitly states that "respondents do not challenge the correctness of that holding." This indicates that the precedent set in *Kopel* remains valid and is considered applicable in the current case.  There is no language suggesting overruling, partial overruling, or any qualification of the *Kopel* decision.
111940	107705	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Green v. County School Board of New Kent County (1968), but it does not overrule it.  The Supreme Court cites Green as support for the proposition that long-standing practices incompatible with the Constitution cannot override constitutional requirements. This is using Green as precedent, not overruling it.
111940	89308	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule Board of Liquidation v. McComb.  While the excerpt discusses the evolution of constitutional law regarding the relationship between federal and state power, and notes that the "fundamental premise" of a prior case (Kentucky v. Dennison) is "not representative of the law today", it does not explicitly overrule Board of Liquidation v. McComb.  The excerpt cites Board of Liquidation v. McComb to support the proposition that federal courts can compel state officers to perform plain official duties.  The fact that the Court finds the reasoning of Kentucky v. Dennison outdated does not invalidate the holding in Board of Liquidation v. McComb, which remains cited as valid precedent. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no indication that Board of Liquidation v. McComb has been overruled.
111940	110718	no	no	95	The excerpt mentions the case *FERC v. Mississippi*, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpt states that the "fundamental premise" of *Dennison* (which is cited within the *FERC v. Mississippi* opinion) "is not representative of the law today."  However, this critique is directed at *Dennison*, not at *FERC v. Mississippi* itself.  The excerpt uses *FERC v. Mississippi* as a citation to support the point that federal courts can compel state officials to obey constitutional requirements, but does not challenge the holding or reasoning of *FERC v. Mississippi*. Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled.
111948	107953	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that it overrules its earlier decision in O'Callahan v. Parker (1969).  This directly satisfies condition 1 for a case to be considered overruled.
111948	105326	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Toth v. Quarles*, but does not overrule it.  While the opinion discusses the limitations of court-martial jurisdiction in the context of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, it does not explicitly overturn *Toth*. The text mentions *Toth* as precedent, referring to its discussion of the "least possible power" principle.  The fact that later cases reinterpret or refine the scope of court-martial jurisdiction does not automatically constitute an overruling of *Toth*.  The opinion uses *Toth* to support its analysis, indicating it's still relevant, even if its interpretation of the "least possible power" principle might be interpreted differently in subsequent cases.
111948	108280	no	yes	95	The provided text shows that the Court considered the case of Relford v. Commandant in light of other precedents, and ultimately overruled it, as evidenced by statements such as "Today's unnecessary overruling of precedent is most unwise."  The opinion explicitly mentions overruling *Relford*, along with *O'Callahan*, making it clear that the case is no longer good law in the context of determining court-martial jurisdiction.  The dissenting opinions also refer to the overruling of *Relford*, further supporting this conclusion.
111948	105525	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Reid v. Covert*, but does not overrule it.  The citations use *Reid* to support arguments about the interpretation of the Fifth Amendment and the scope of court-martial jurisdiction.  While later cases may modify or clarify aspects of *Reid*, there is no explicit overruling or language functionally equivalent to overruling. The text uses *Reid* as precedent, even while disagreeing with certain aspects of the *Reid* opinion. Therefore, there is no indication that *Reid v. Covert* has been overruled.
111948	105981	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Kinsella v. United States ex rel. Singleton*, referencing its holding that court-martial jurisdiction hinges on the accused's military status.  While the opinion discusses other cases and the scope of court-martial jurisdiction, there is no language explicitly overruling *Kinsella*, nor any language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  The text uses *Kinsella* as precedent, which contradicts the conditions for a case to be considered overruled. Therefore, there is no indication that *Kinsella* was overruled.
111948	89821	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Coleman v. Tennessee, but never indicates that it has been overruled.  The excerpts discuss the case's relevance to the scope of court-martial jurisdiction, particularly concerning the historical context of military justice in the United States. While the court distinguishes Coleman and other cases from the case at hand, this is not equivalent to overruling.  The citing opinions analyze the historical context of court-martial jurisdiction and distinguish precedent based on factual circumstances and specific legal principles involved. There is no language suggesting the court intends to overturn Coleman v. Tennessee.
112040	111308	no	no	95	The cited case *Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority* (1985) is mentioned multiple times in the court's opinion. However, there is no indication that it has been overruled.  While some justices express differing interpretations of *Garcia*, none explicitly overrule it, nor do they offer language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Justice Scalia, for example, states that he does not read *Garcia* as adopting a certain proposition, but this is a critique of the majority's interpretation, not an overruling of *Garcia* itself. The opinion upholds the constitutionality of a certain statute, referencing *Garcia* in support, but this does not constitute overruling the cited case.
112040	104222	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts from the court opinion discuss *New York v. United States* (1946) extensively.  The opinion analyzes different justices' views on the scope of state and federal tax immunities, particularly concerning direct taxation of states by the federal government.  The opinion does not explicitly overrule *New York v. United States* (1946), nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Instead, the opinion engages in a detailed analysis of the precedent's various interpretations and holdings, highlighting the differing views of the justices involved in the original case.  The court clarifies and expands upon the precedent, but does not invalidate it. Therefore, based on the provided text, there's no indication that *New York v. United States* (1946) has been overruled.
112040	103172	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule Graves v. New York ex rel. O'Keefe.  Instead, the excerpts cite *Graves* as precedent and even quote extensively from it.  The text discusses the evolution of intergovernmental tax immunity and mentions that the rationale underlying certain older cases has been "thoroughly repudiated" by modern case law, but it is *Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.*, not *Graves*, that is the subject of this repudiation.  The excerpts affirm the continued relevance of *Graves* within the context of modern intergovernmental immunity case law.
112040	103047	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Helvering v. Gerhardt*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts either mention it as precedent in line with other cases (supporting a particular legal methodology, for example) or distinguish it from the current case based on material differences in facts or circumstances.  There is no language suggesting that the Court intends to overturn *Helvering v. Gerhardt*, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpts show the case being used as precedent and contextualized within the evolution of intergovernmental tax immunity doctrine.
112040	110718	no	no	85	The excerpts discuss *FERC v. Mississippi*, but do not overrule it.  While several justices express opinions on the case's continued relevance in light of *Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority*, and even suggest aspects of its holding might be inapplicable in certain circumstances, none explicitly overrule it or use language functionally equivalent to doing so.  The opinions primarily focus on distinguishing *FERC v. Mississippi* from the case at hand, based on the types of federal regulation involved and how they affect state sovereignty.  There is no majority opinion explicitly overruling *FERC v. Mississippi*, nor is there language stating that it is no longer good law.  Justice Scalia's concurrence even expresses concern that the majority opinion unnecessarily casts doubt on *FERC v. Mississippi*. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no basis to conclude that *FERC v. Mississippi* has been overruled.
112040	101762	no	no	85	The provided text discusses Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States (1931) within the context of intergovernmental tax immunity.  The court explains the rationale behind the case and its relation to other cases dealing with similar principles. However, there is no language explicitly overruling Indian Motocycle. The text notes that the "rationale underlying Pollock and the general immunity for government contract income has been thoroughly repudiated by modern intergovernmental immunity case law."  While this statement suggests that the legal principles underlying Indian Motocycle (which shared that rationale) are no longer valid, it does not explicitly overrule the case itself.  The case is cited and its reasoning is analyzed but not directly overruled. 
112040	94174	yes	yes	100	The majority opinion explicitly overrules *Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.*  The Chief Justice concurs in the judgment, stating that the majority overrules *Pollock*. Justice O'Connor's dissent also acknowledges that the Court overrules *Pollock*.  The majority opinion explains the reasoning behind overruling the precedent, focusing on the intergovernmental tax immunity and its implications for the constitutionality of the tax in question.
112276	1098406	no	no	95	The provided text discusses the case *Ex parte Smith (1988)* in relation to the principle established in *North Carolina v. Pearce*.  The Supreme Court of Alabama's decision in *Ex parte Smith* is analyzed in terms of its application of *Pearce*, with the majority finding that an increased sentence was not justified due to reliance on information predating the original sentencing.  A dissenting opinion expresses disagreement with the majority's interpretation.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Ex parte Smith (1988)* itself is overruled, either fully or partially. The text focuses on the application and interpretation of *Pearce*, not on overruling *Ex parte Smith*. There is no indication that any of the six conditions for overruling have been met.
112276	107978	yes	no	95	The Supreme Court in this case did not explicitly overrule *North Carolina v. Pearce*.  Instead, the Court distinguished the case, holding that the presumption of vindictiveness in *Pearce* does not apply when the original sentence was based on a guilty plea and the second sentence follows a trial.  The Court's analysis clarifies the application of *Pearce*, limiting its scope but not directly overruling its holding.  The dissenting opinion mentions *Pearce* favorably but does not suggest that the majority opinion overrules it.
112276	108569	no	no	95	The excerpt uses Colten v. Kentucky (1972) as a supporting case, distinguishing its facts from the case at hand.  The court cites Colten to explain its reasoning that an increased sentence after a trial de novo does not automatically imply vindictiveness, highlighting that the second trial is a "completely fresh determination."  This shows that the court is applying Colten as precedent, not overruling it.  Therefore, no language in the excerpt indicates that Colten v. Kentucky has been overruled.
112276	111602	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Texas v. McCullough* multiple times and explains its holding.  There is no language suggesting that the court is overruling *Texas v. McCullough*. Instead, the court is interpreting and applying the holding in *Texas v. McCullough*, demonstrating that it remains good law as understood by the court.  The court explains the scope of the presumption of vindictiveness established in *Texas v. McCullough*, clarifying that the presumption doesn't apply in all situations involving increased sentences upon retrial. This is an interpretation, not an overruling.
112276	110748	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case *United States v. Goodwin* multiple times but does not overrule it.  The excerpts use *Goodwin* as precedent, specifically referencing its statement that "a mere opportunity for vindictiveness is insufficient to justify the imposition of a prophylactic rule."  Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
112301	111683	no	no	95	The excerpt contains multiple mentions of Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Authority.  The citing case does not explicitly overrule Brown-Forman. While the citing case clarifies and limits the scope of the precedent set in Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. v. Hostetter,  it does not overrule Brown-Forman itself.  Instead, the court distinguishes the holding of Brown-Forman, limiting the applicability of Seagram, which is the case that actually had its legal underpinnings removed.  The citing opinion affirms Brown-Forman's holding multiple times and uses it as a basis for its own ruling.  There is no language suggesting that Brown-Forman is no longer good law, even partially, or in specific circumstances. One justice's concurrence advocating for overruling *Seagram*  does not constitute an overruling of *Brown-Forman*. Therefore, Brown-Forman is not overruled.
112301	107217	yes	yes	95	The court in this case explicitly states that while the decision in *Brown-Forman* did not technically overrule *Seagram*, it removed the legal underpinnings of *Seagram*'s Commerce Clause analysis and limited its scope to retrospective affirmation statutes.  The court further explains that *Brown-Forman* held that affirmation statutes with the practical effect of regulating out-of-state liquor prices are unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, regardless of the Twenty-First Amendment.  Therefore, although not explicitly stated as an overruling, the court's reasoning functionally renders *Seagram* obsolete in the context of prospective affirmation statutes, which are the focus of *Brown-Forman* and the current case. Justice Scalia also concurs that *Seagram* should be overruled due to its inconsistent application in light of the current case.
112301	102402	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites Baldwin v. G. A. F. Seelig, Inc.  In each instance, the citing opinions either directly affirm or rely on the precedent set by Seelig.  No language suggests that Seelig has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  Instead, the case is used to support arguments in later cases.  The dissenting opinion in one excerpt even uses Seelig to support its argument.  Therefore, there is no indication from the provided excerpts that the case has been overruled.
112301	110758	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Edgar v. Mite Corp.* multiple times.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the excerpts use *Edgar v. Mite Corp.* as precedent, demonstrating its continued relevance in discussions concerning the Commerce Clause and extraterritorial state regulation.  The text analyzes and applies the principles established in *Edgar v. Mite Corp.*, further indicating it remains good law within the context discussed.
112301	507765	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule the case of interest (In re Beer Institute, 849 F.2d 753 (CA2 1988)).  Instead, the excerpt discusses the case and uses it as precedent in the analysis of a similar case involving Connecticut's price-affirmation statute.  The Supreme Court's opinion references and analyzes the case, but doesn't explicitly overrule it. While the opinion criticizes aspects of the case's underlying reasoning or implications, it does not state that the case is no longer good law or that it is overruled, partially or fully. The opinion uses the case to support its arguments, which does not equate to overruling it. 
112301	2370562	no	no	95	The provided text focuses on the legal challenges and subsequent modifications to a Connecticut statute concerning beer pricing.  While the case *United States Brewers Ass'n v. Healy* (669 F. Supp. 543 (1987)) is mentioned multiple times, there is no indication that it was overruled. The text discusses how later court decisions and legislative amendments addressed the issues raised in *Healy*, but this doesn't equate to overruling the precedent set in the original *Healy* decision.  The District Court's decision in the later case distinguishes itself from *Healy*, suggesting that the statute was altered in a way that addressed the earlier court's concerns, rather than directly overruling *Healy*. The analysis centers on whether the amended law is constitutional, not on whether the earlier *Healy* decision was overturned.
112258	109016	yes	no	95	The excerpt repeatedly cites *Procunier v. Martinez*, and the court's opinion clarifies and modifies the standard of review established in that case, but it does not explicitly overrule it.  The court acknowledges *Martinez*'s importance while refining its application, particularly regarding the "least restrictive means" test. The court distinguishes between *Martinez*'s focus on outgoing personal correspondence and the broader implications of regulating incoming publications.  Instead of overruling, the court interprets and adjusts the precedent to fit the context of the current case.  Therefore, *Procunier v. Martinez* remains relevant legal precedent, though its application may be more nuanced than initially conceived.
112258	111904	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Turner v. Safley*, and in doing so, clarifies and applies its holding.  The opinion explicitly adopts the "reasonably related to legitimate penological interests" standard from *Turner*. While the opinion discusses the case of *Procunier v. Martinez* and its relationship to *Turner*,  it does not overrule *Turner v. Safley*. In fact, the court uses *Turner* to support its reasoning and to establish the appropriate standard of review.  There is no language suggesting that *Turner v. Safley* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
112258	109718	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Jones v. North Carolina Prisoners' Labor Union, Inc.* as precedent.  The Supreme Court in later cases references *Jones* without any indication that it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The citing opinions use *Jones* to support their reasoning, which is inconsistent with the notion of overruling.  Instead, the Court uses *Jones* and other cases to establish a consistent line of jurisprudence regarding the balance between prisoner rights and prison security. There's no language suggesting that *Jones* is no longer good law in any context. 
112258	109079	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Pell v. Procunier*, but never states that it has been overruled.  The citing opinions consistently treat *Pell* as precedent, referencing its holdings and using it to support reasoning in subsequent cases. There is no language suggesting that *Pell* is no longer good law, or that any part of its holding has been overturned or modified.  The opinions demonstrate continued reliance on the precedent established by *Pell*.
112258	492021	no	no	95	The Supreme Court case *Turner v. Safley* is cited and applied as the correct standard of review, replacing the *Procunier v. Martinez* standard used by the Court of Appeals in *Abbott v. Meese*.  The Supreme Court disagreed with the Court of Appeals' application of the *Martinez* standard, but this is not an explicit overruling of *Abbott v. Meese*.  The Supreme Court vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remanded the case, but it did not explicitly state that *Abbott v. Meese* was overruled. The decision focused on applying a different legal standard (*Turner* instead of *Martinez*) rather than directly overruling the lower court's decision in *Abbott v. Meese*. Therefore, while the precedent established by the Court of Appeals in *Abbott v. Meese* is not followed, it's not overruled either. 
112258	110075	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Bell v. Wolfish* multiple times.  However, none of the mentions suggest that the case has been overruled.  The text cites *Bell v. Wolfish* as precedent alongside other cases related to First Amendment rights in the prison context.  The court's discussion uses *Bell v. Wolfish* to support its reasoning, not to overturn it. There is no language suggesting the Court disapproves of *Bell v. Wolfish*'s holding, nor does it qualify, limit, or distinguish its application.  Instead, the opinion uses *Bell v. Wolfish* as a relevant precedent in its analysis.
112471	94866	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that its reasoning in Thompson v. Utah is not consistent with the understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause at the time the Constitution was adopted and that its reasoning has not been followed since 1898.  Further, the court notes that Thompson v. Utah has caused confusion in lower courts regarding the scope of the Ex Post Facto Clause. The court's decision to overrule Kring v. Missouri and its discussion of Thompson v. Utah in this context strongly suggests that Thompson is no longer good law, at least in the way it has been interpreted and applied by lower courts.  The court also states that the holding in Thompson v. Utah regarding the Sixth Amendment's requirement of a 12-person jury is obsolete in light of Williams v. Florida.
112471	100734	no	no	95	The provided text analyzes and clarifies the interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, referencing *Beazell v. Ohio* numerous times.  However, there is no language explicitly overruling *Beazell*, nor is there language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The text critiques some of the language used in *Beazell* and related cases concerning "substantial protections," suggesting that the Court's earlier phrasing may have led to confusion.  It seeks to refine the understanding of the Ex Post Facto Clause, but does not overturn *Beazell*'s holding.  The excerpt instead clarifies and refines the application of *Beazell*'s principles,  not overruling the case itself.
112471	90760	yes	no	95	The excerpts analyze Kring v. Missouri in the context of ex post facto law.  The opinion discusses the case's holding and whether it aligns with the understanding of ex post facto law at the time of the Constitution's adoption. While the Court states that Kring and a related case, Thompson v. Utah, are not consistent with this understanding, this is not a direct overruling. Instead, the Court reinterprets the Ex Post Facto Clause and clarifies its application to procedural changes, effectively limiting the scope of Kring's precedent without explicitly overruling it. The opinion distinguishes between procedural changes that have a "substantial" impact on the defendant's rights and those that don't, thereby modifying but not necessarily overturning Kring's precedent.
112471	1787505	no	no	95	The excerpts describe how a Texas statute modified the effect of the decision in *Bogany v. State*.  The Court of Criminal Appeals' decision in *Bogany* is cited multiple times, but not overruled.  Instead, the legislature acted to change the law to allow for the reformation of an improper verdict, rather than requiring a new trial as *Bogany* had held.  This is a modification of the legal landscape that *Bogany* created, not an overruling of it.
112471	98427	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule Malloy v. South Carolina.  Instead, the excerpts discuss and cite *Malloy* in relation to the interpretation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, particularly concerning "substantial protections" afforded to the accused.  The court expresses some disagreement with prior interpretations of *Malloy*, but does not explicitly overrule it, nor does it employ language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The court clarifies its understanding of the precedent set by *Malloy*, but this is not the same as overruling it. Therefore, there's no indication that *Malloy* has been overruled in whole or in part.
112608	110719	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss *United States v. Ross* extensively, analyzing and applying its principles in relation to other cases such as *Chadwick* and *Sanders*.  However, there is no language explicitly overruling *Ross*, nor any functionally equivalent language. The opinion clarifies and distinguishes *Ross* from other cases, particularly regarding the scope of automobile searches versus searches of containers within automobiles.  While the Court modifies the application of *Ross* in the context of probable cause for searching specific containers within a vehicle, it does not overrule it entirely. Instead, the decision refines its application in specific circumstances, aiming to create a more clear-cut and consistent rule regarding automobile searches and containers.
112608	109714	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States v. Chadwick*, but never states that it has been overruled.  Instead, the excerpts discuss how *Chadwick* has been distinguished or its application clarified in later cases such as *United States v. Ross*.  The court's analysis focuses on reconciling the differing approaches in *Chadwick* and *Ross* regarding searches of containers within vehicles, but this does not equate to overruling.  The continued citation of *Chadwick* and attempts to reconcile its holding with other cases indicate it remains relevant precedent, even if its application is limited or refined in specific circumstances.
112608	110119	yes	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that the court overruled *Arkansas v. Sanders*.  The opinion discusses *Arkansas v. Sanders* in the context of  *United States v. Ross*, highlighting the distinction between probable cause to search an entire vehicle versus a specific container within a vehicle. The court explains that *Arkansas v. Sanders* is no longer good law in cases where police have probable cause to believe contraband is located somewhere in a vehicle but don't know the precise location.  This satisfies condition 1 (explicitly overruled) and condition 6 (no longer good law in certain contexts) for determining that a case has been overruled.
112608	111305	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States v. Johns*, but never states that it has been overruled.  The excerpts discuss *Johns* in relation to other cases and the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, clarifying and applying its principles within the existing legal framework.  No language suggests it is no longer good law or has been superseded in any way.
112608	100567	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Carroll v. United States*, often to distinguish its holding from later cases that address the search of containers within vehicles.  While the Court discusses and analyzes *Carroll* in relation to other cases,  there is no language suggesting that it has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The text highlights the ongoing discussion and evolution of the legal interpretation of *Carroll's* principles in the context of vehicle searches and the search of containers within vehicles, but this is a refinement and clarification, not an overruling.
112608	104504	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Johnson v. United States*, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts largely discuss the case's reasoning regarding warrants and the Fourth Amendment, particularly Justice Jackson's emphasis on the role of a neutral magistrate in safeguarding against unreasonable searches. The text uses the case to support its arguments about the importance of warrants, highlighting the ongoing tension between the warrant requirement and its many exceptions. There is no indication that the court is rejecting or altering the holding of *Johnson v. United States*. The citing opinions are using *Johnson* as precedent and agreeing with its reasoning, not contradicting or limiting it.
112608	108184	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case of *Chambers v. Maroney* multiple times.  In each instance, the case is cited as precedent and is not explicitly overruled, qualified, or its application limited in any way that fits the definition of being overruled.  The excerpts show that the Court either followed *Chambers* as precedent or mentioned it without changing its legal standing.
112608	110979	no	no	100	The provided text mentions the case *United States v. Place* multiple times.  In all instances, the court cites *Place* as precedent or distinguishes its facts from the case at hand. There is no language suggesting that *Place* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The court explains that *Place* did not involve an automobile, distinguishing it from the case at bar.  In one instance, the court notes that *Place* relied on precedent from other cases, and in another notes that Place's holding about temporary seizure of luggage is still valid. Therefore, there is no basis in the text to conclude that *United States v. Place* has been overruled.
112608	110558	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts from court opinions mention the case *Robbins v. California* multiple times.  However, none of the excerpts contain language that would meet the criteria for overruling the case.  The excerpts primarily discuss the case in relation to other Fourth Amendment cases concerning automobile searches and the "automobile exception."  While the court expresses opinions on related legal principles and discusses the complexities introduced by prior case law (like *Chadwick* and *Sanders*), it does not explicitly overrule *Robbins* nor does it use language functionally equivalent to an overruling. The excerpts show that *Robbins* is cited as relevant precedent, sometimes in agreement (Justice Powell's concurring opinion) and sometimes in disagreement (the dissenting opinion), but not overruled.
112640	111020	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Michigan v. Long*, but does not overrule it.  Instead, the excerpts discuss and apply the precedent set by *Michigan v. Long*, particularly its "plain-statement rule" regarding state procedural defaults in federal habeas corpus cases.  The opinions analyze and interpret the application of the rule in specific circumstances, debating its scope and effectiveness, but there's no language indicating the overruling of the case itself, either explicitly or implicitly.  The justices disagree on the application of *Michigan v. Long*, but their disagreement centers on the interpretation and scope of the rule, not on the validity of the case itself.
112640	112205	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Harris v. Reed, 489 U.S. 255 (1989), and clarifies its application in various contexts.  No part of the opinion suggests that Harris v. Reed is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  Instead, the opinion discusses and applies the principles established in Harris v. Reed regarding procedural default and the "plain statement" rule in the context of state court decisions on federal habeas review.  The court's analysis builds upon, and does not contradict, the precedent set by Harris v. Reed.  In one instance, Justice White's concurrence summarizes the holding of Harris v. Reed, further emphasizing its continued validity.
112640	109717	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Wainwright v. Sykes*, but there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The excerpts describe the case's application and significance within the context of habeas corpus review and procedural default rules but do not indicate any overruling or modification of its holding.
112640	106548	yes	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that the holding in Fay v. Noia (1963) has been overruled.  The court explicitly states that *Fay* "was based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules."  The court further explains that subsequent cases have applied a "cause and prejudice" standard to various state procedural defaults, a standard inconsistent with *Fay*. By adopting a uniform "cause and prejudice" standard, the court effectively overrules the presumption in favor of federal habeas review established in *Fay*. The court's statements clearly meet the criteria for overruling, specifically points 1 and 2 of the provided guidelines.
112640	105074	no	yes	80	The provided text explicitly states that a holding in *Daniels v. Allen*, a companion case to *Brown v. Allen*, was overruled by *Fay v. Noia*.  Although the excerpt doesn't directly state that *Brown v. Allen* itself was overruled, the close relationship between the two cases and the overruling of a companion case on a relevant point suggests a strong possibility of *Brown v. Allen* being impacted by the same legal changes.  The fact that *Fay v. Noia* addressed a nearly identical situation strengthens this implication.
112640	110692	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss Engle v. Isaac (1982) in relation to the cause and prejudice standard in federal habeas corpus proceedings.  While the text mentions that *Fay v. Noia* was superseded by later cases, such as *Sykes*, and that *Engle v. Isaac* applied the cause and prejudice standard, there is no language suggesting that *Engle v. Isaac* itself has been overruled.  The excerpts show *Engle v. Isaac* being cited as precedent, and further clarifying its application.  Therefore, none of the six conditions for overruling are met.
112640	111880	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Pennsylvania v. Finley*, but does not overrule it.  The citing opinions consistently refer to and apply the precedent established in *Finley* regarding the right to counsel in state collateral proceedings.  There is no language suggesting the Court intends to overturn, limit, or modify *Finley*'s holding. The opinions demonstrate the Court's continued reliance on *Finley* as valid precedent.
112640	111727	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Murray v. Carrier*, but it does not contain language that would explicitly or implicitly overrule it.  The excerpts show the court referencing and applying the principles established in *Murray v. Carrier*,  indicating it is being followed as precedent, not overruled.  There is no indication that the court is limiting the case to certain circumstances or distinguishing its treatment of legal principles. The court explains that *Murray v. Carrier* is relevant to understanding the cause and prejudice standard and clarifies aspects of its application, but it doesn't overrule or supersede it.
112640	1280169	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule O'Brien v. Socony Mobil Oil Co.  Instead, the court distinguishes O'Brien.  The court notes that while O'Brien reviewed the merits of a constitutional claim before addressing the untimeliness of the appeal, it explicitly declined to establish a rule creating a constitutional exception to the time requirement for filing a notice of appeal.  The court in the current case also declines to create such an exception, thus distinguishing the current situation from O'Brien rather than overruling it.  The court's analysis is a clarification and application of existing precedent, not an overruling.
112640	106591	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Sanders v. United States (1963)*.  However, it only quotes a dissenting opinion from that case. There is no indication that the case itself was overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The excerpt discusses the principles of finality in criminal litigation and the costs associated with federal habeas review, referencing *Sanders* to support arguments related to these principles.  It does not challenge or modify the holding of *Sanders*.
112640	536051	no	no	95	The provided text does not contain any language suggesting that the case *Roger K. Coleman v. Charles Thompson, Warden* (1990) has been overruled.  The excerpts show the case being cited as precedent by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court. There is no indication of explicit overruling, functional equivalent of overruling, partial overruling, overruling in specific circumstances, distinction of legal principles, or declaration that it is no longer good law in any context. The citations refer to the case's holding regarding procedural defaults in state habeas proceedings and the "plain statement" requirement of Harris v. Reed.
112640	109439	no	no	95	The excerpt describes the case *Francis v. Henderson* and its relation to other cases, particularly *Fay v. Noia* and *Davis v. United States*.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Francis v. Henderson* was overruled. The excerpt explains how the court's approach to state procedural defaults in federal habeas review evolved, contrasting the presumption in favor of review in *Fay* with the stricter "cause" and "prejudice" standard established in *Davis* and applied in *Francis*.  The text highlights a shift in the Court's view, not an overruling of *Francis v. Henderson* itself.
112609	1573917	no	no	95	The provided text focuses on the overruling of the precedent set in *Minturn v. Maynard*, not *Exxon Corp. v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc*.  While the District Court in *Exxon Corp.* relied on *Minturn* and the Second Circuit's interpretation in *Peralta*, the Supreme Court's decision in this excerpt directly addresses and modifies *Minturn*, not Exxon.  Therefore, there's no indication that *Exxon Corp. v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc.* itself was overruled.
112609	88300	no	no	95	The provided text discusses the overruling of the case *Minturn*, not *Insurance Co. v. Dunham*. While *Insurance Co. v. Dunham* is cited and its principle regarding the "nature and subject-matter" of contracts is mentioned as a basis for rejecting *Minturn*'s approach, there is no indication that *Insurance Co. v. Dunham* itself was overruled.  The passage uses *Insurance Co. v. Dunham* as precedent to support the overruling of *Minturn*. 
112609	105375	no	no	95	The provided text does not overrule Archawski v. Hanioti (1956).  Instead, it discusses how the rationales underlying the decision in Archawski have been modified or rejected by subsequent cases.  The excerpt explains that two rationales in an earlier case, Minturn, which Archawski addressed, have been discredited.  It states that Archawski held that an action cognizable as assumpsit would not be automatically excluded from admiralty, and that the "hypothecation requirement" has been cast into doubt.  This means that the principles supporting an earlier, related case are no longer considered valid; however, it does not explicitly overrule Archawski itself. The text cites Archawski as precedent and explains how its holding changed the legal landscape, but does not state that Archawski is no longer good law.
112609	86949	yes	yes	95	The Supreme Court in Exxon Corp. v. Central Gulf Lines, Inc. directly addresses whether the case of Minturn v. Maynard should be overruled.  The Court explicitly states that it will consider whether Minturn should be overruled, indicating an intention to directly address the precedent set by Minturn. The Court then proceeds to analyze the rationales behind Minturn and ultimately implies an overruling by establishing a different standard for admiralty jurisdiction in cases involving agency contracts. Although not explicitly stating "Minturn is overruled", the court's decision to reconsider and reinterpret Minturn's holding constitutes an overruling.
112728	112640	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites Coleman v. Thompson, but never indicates that it has been overruled.  Instead, the text uses Coleman as precedent, explaining and applying its principles.  The snippets describe Coleman as establishing a cause-and-prejudice standard for state procedural defaults and highlight its impact on subsequent cases.  No language suggests overruling, modification, or limitation of Coleman's holding. The court's statements about the case being applied uniformly or eliminating "irrational" distinctions do not imply overruling but rather indicate the court's continued endorsement of the case's principles and clarification of its scope.
112728	106544	yes	no	85	The provided text discusses Townsend v. Sain and its application in subsequent cases.  While the dissenting opinions express concern that the majority opinion's approach changes the law of habeas corpus in a fundamental way by effectively overruling Townsend, and mentions that part of Townsend might be overruled, the majority opinion does not explicitly overrule Townsend v. Sain. The majority opinion focuses on clarifying and refining the application of Townsend, not overturning it.  Therefore, based on the provided text, Townsend v. Sain is not overruled.
112728	112573	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *McCleskey v. Zant* as precedent, showing that the Court did not overrule it.  The excerpts discuss *McCleskey v. Zant* in the context of procedural defaults and abuse of the writ in habeas corpus cases, and the case is used to support the Court's reasoning. There is no indication of the Court explicitly overruling, implicitly overruling, or modifying any part of the *McCleskey v. Zant* decision.
112728	105074	no	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the holding in *Townsend v. Sain* "must be considered to supersede, to the extent of any inconsistencies, the opinions in Brown v. Allen*.  This is further supported by the explanation that *Brown v. Allen* was inconsistent with *Townsend* regarding habeas petitioners who failed to adequately develop federal claims in state-court proceedings.  The excerpt highlights specific inconsistencies between the two cases' approaches to evidentiary hearings in habeas corpus. Therefore, *Brown v. Allen* is considered overruled, at least in part, by *Townsend v. Sain*. 
112728	109717	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *Wainwright v. Sykes* multiple times.  However, it does not explicitly overrule it.  Instead, the text describes *Wainwright v. Sykes* as having limited the application of *Fay v. Noia* to its facts and applied a cause-and-prejudice standard in its place. This is a clarification or modification, not an overruling.  The text shows that the Court has consistently reaffirmed the cause-and-prejudice standard from *Wainwright v. Sykes*, indicating it remains good law in certain contexts. No language in the excerpt suggests the case was overruled. Therefore, based on the provided excerpts, *Wainwright v. Sykes* is not overruled.
112728	111727	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Murray v. Carrier*,  never indicating it has been overruled.  Instead, the citing opinions reference and apply the principles established in *Murray v. Carrier*, demonstrating it is still considered valid precedent.  There is no language suggesting it is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly, nor is any portion of the case distinguished or limited to specific circumstances. The opinions show the court either follows or uses *Murray v. Carrier* as precedent.
112728	556624	no	no	95	The provided text focuses on overruling elements within the Townsend v. Sain case (1963), not the case of interest, Jose Tamayo-Reyes v. J.C. Keeney (1991).  While the excerpt discusses the Tamayo-Reyes case and its citation to 926 F.2d 1492 (1991), there is no language suggesting that the court overrules, qualifies, or limits the holding in Tamayo-Reyes itself. The discussion centers on modifying the precedent used in the Tamayo-Reyes case, namely Townsend v. Sain, but not the Tamayo-Reyes case itself. Therefore, there's no basis to conclude that Tamayo-Reyes has been overruled.
112728	111235	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Reed v. Ross* as a supporting precedent for the "cause-and-prejudice" standard in habeas corpus cases.  There is no language suggesting that *Reed v. Ross* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinions affirm and rely upon the principles established in *Reed v. Ross*. Therefore, there's no indication that *Reed v. Ross* has been overruled.
112728	109439	no	no	95	The provided text discusses *Francis v. Henderson* and its application of the cause-and-prejudice standard in habeas corpus cases.  While the Court later clarifies and modifies the application of this standard in subsequent cases (like *Wainwright v. Sykes*), it does not explicitly overrule *Francis v. Henderson*. The text mentions *Francis v. Henderson* as a precedent that addressed the threshold inquiry of whether a federal court should consider the merits of a habeas claim despite a petitioner's procedural default.  The opinion uses *Francis v. Henderson* to illustrate the historical context of the cause-and-prejudice standard, not to overturn it.
112739	109615	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady* multiple times.  In one instance, the court explains that *Complete Auto* overruled prior precedent that distinguished between direct and indirect taxes on interstate commerce, clarifying that the relevant inquiry is the practical effect of the tax.  The court explicitly states that *Complete Auto* did not overrule *Bellas Hess*, explaining that *Bellas Hess* did not rely on the formal distinction between direct and indirect taxes that was rejected in *Complete Auto*.  The court further notes that *Bellas Hess* is consistent with *Complete Auto*'s four-part test for evaluating state taxes under the Commerce Clause and that *Bellas Hess* has been cited with approval in subsequent cases.  While acknowledging that modern Commerce Clause jurisprudence might lead to a different result today, the court concludes that *Bellas Hess* remains good law concerning the "substantial nexus" required for state taxation.
112739	1591860	no	no	95	The excerpt describes the Supreme Court's consideration of the case *National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill.* (1967), in light of *State Ex Rel. Heitkamp v. Quill Corp.* (1991).  The Court acknowledges that the lower court in *Quill* declined to follow *Bellas Hess* due to significant economic and legal changes. While the Court agrees with some of the lower court's reasoning, it ultimately reverses the state supreme court's decision, choosing to not overrule *Bellas Hess*. The court specifically states that while they agree with the lower court's assessment of the evolution of their Commerce Clause cases, they do not share its conclusion that this evolution indicates that the Commerce Clause ruling of Bellas Hess is no longer good law.  Therefore, *Bellas Hess* is not overruled in this excerpt.
112739	107425	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly overrules parts of National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., stating that "the tremendous social, economic, commercial, and legal innovations" of the past quarter-century have rendered its holding obsolete.  The opinion then proceeds to explain why the prior holding should no longer apply, effectively overruling the precedent set by the cited case.  Furthermore, multiple justices concur in the overruling, with Justice Scalia explicitly stating that the Due Process Clause holding of Bellas Hess should be overruled.
112739	109630	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization* (1977) and discusses its relation to other cases, particularly *Bellas Hess*.  While the opinion analyzes and revisits the principles established in *Bellas Hess*, it does not explicitly overrule *National Geographic*. In fact, several instances show the Court citing *National Geographic* with approval or using it to distinguish the case at hand from *Bellas Hess*.  The analysis focuses on the evolution of Commerce Clause jurisprudence and the limitations or modifications of *Bellas Hess*, not on directly overruling *National Geographic*. Therefore, there is no indication that *National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization* (1977) was overruled.
112739	110563	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana*, but never indicates that it has been overruled.  The citations show the case being referenced as precedent, sometimes in conjunction with other cases related to the Commerce Clause and state taxation of interstate commerce.  There is no language suggesting the Court intends to overrule, modify, or limit the application of *Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana* in any way.  The opinions discuss overruling *Bellas Hess*, but this is a separate case.
112739	112066	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *D. H. Holmes Co., Ltd. v. McNamara* multiple times, but never suggest it is overruled.  Instead, the case is cited as an example or distinguished on its facts, which demonstrates that the Court considered the precedent but did not overrule it.  In one instance, *D. H. Holmes* is distinguished based on the company's "significant economic presence" which was deemed different than the case being discussed.  This is a clear example of distinguishing the case and not overruling it.
112739	105829	no	no	100	The provided text excerpts cite the case *Northwestern States Portland Cement Co. v. Minnesota* multiple times.  However, none of the citations indicate that the case has been overruled. In fact, the excerpts seem to be referencing and building upon the principles established in the *Northwestern States* case, particularly concerning the nexus requirement for state taxation and the importance of clear rules in this area.  One excerpt even mentions Congress acting in response to this case, showing it's continued relevance.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Northwestern States* has been overruled.
112739	110927	no	no	95	The excerpt discusses Arkansas Electric Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Public Service Commission, 461 U.S. 375 (1983).  The court uses the case as an example of when it chose to replace a bright-line test with a more contextual balancing inquiry.  It notes that in Arkansas Electric, the court rejected the "mechanical test" set forth in an earlier case (Public Util. Comm'n of R.I. v. Attleboro Steam & Electric Co.) because the test was "anachronistic."  However, this is not an overruling of Arkansas Electric itself, but rather a discussion of its methodology and the court's reasoning in that case. The excerpt does not suggest that Arkansas Electric is no longer good law or that any part of its holding has been overturned.
112906	92534	no	no	95	The excerpts analyze and interpret the case *In re Nielsen*, but do not overrule it.  The opinion discusses *Nielsen* extensively, focusing on its application of double jeopardy principles in the context of lesser and greater included offenses, and in relation to the "same conduct" rule.  The majority opinion in the excerpt clarifies and refines its understanding of *Nielsen*, distinguishing its holding and questioning the interpretation of the "incidents" language.  While the majority does disagree with Justice Souter's interpretation of the case, and explains why, it does not explicitly overrule the case. There is no language in the excerpt functionally equivalent to explicitly overruling *Nielsen*.  Parts of the case may be interpreted differently, or its applicability refined to certain circumstances, but there is no explicit overruling.
112906	112432	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly overrules Grady v. Corbin (1990) in section IV, stating that it "lacks constitutional roots", is "wholly inconsistent with earlier Supreme Court precedent and with the clear common-law understanding of double jeopardy", and has "produced 'confusion'".  The court finds that Grady was "a mistake" and that overruling it is necessary to maintain consistency and avoid chaos in its decisions.  Multiple justices concur in overruling Grady, though some dissent from other aspects of the majority opinion.
112906	109695	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites Brown v. Ohio (1977).  The citations do not overrule the case. In fact, the text uses Brown as precedent, specifically referencing its holding on the Blockburger test and the same-elements test in the context of double jeopardy.  One passage even notes that *Brown* stated the Blockburger test is not the only standard and cites a footnote from Brown in support.  This demonstrates that the case is being followed and not overruled.  There is no language suggesting the court intends to overturn any part of Brown v. Ohio.
112906	96689	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Grafton v. United States*, referencing its holding that a person cannot be tried twice for the same offense in different tribunals of the same government.  The excerpts never state that *Grafton* is overruled, nor do they offer language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Instead, the excerpts use *Grafton* as precedent, sometimes agreeing with its reasoning and sometimes distinguishing it based on the specific facts of the case at hand.  The court uses *Grafton* to support its analysis of double jeopardy, indicating it is still considered relevant legal authority.
112906	109736	no	no	95	The excerpts analyze Harris v. Oklahoma in relation to double jeopardy and the Blockburger test.  While the opinion discusses Harris extensively, it does not explicitly overrule it.  Instead, it interprets and applies Harris, sometimes disagreeing with the application of the case by other justices.  There is no language functionally equivalent to overruling the case, nor is it overruled in part or in specific circumstances. The opinion clarifies the application of Harris in similar cases, but it doesn't invalidate it.  Therefore, based on the provided excerpts, there is no evidence to suggest that Harris v. Oklahoma was overruled.
112906	110307	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Illinois v. Vitale*, referencing its interpretation of *Harris v. Oklahoma*.  There is no language suggesting that *Illinois v. Vitale* itself was overruled. The text discusses the evolution of double jeopardy jurisprudence, showing how *Illinois v. Vitale* was interpreted and further developed by subsequent cases, particularly regarding the Blockburger test and the consideration of "conduct" rather than merely elements in double jeopardy analysis.  While the Court's opinion in later cases may modify the application or interpretation of *Illinois v. Vitale*'s principles,  no statement suggests that *Vitale* itself has been overruled, either in whole or in part.
112906	111893	no	no	100	The excerpts cite the case *Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A.* multiple times.  In every instance, the court refers to *Young* as precedent,  either directly quoting it or using it to support its reasoning. There is no language suggesting that *Young* is overruled,  either fully or partially, nor is any portion of it qualified or limited in application. The court cites *Young*  to establish the nature of contempt proceedings and the relationship between contempt and other criminal offenses.  Therefore, based on the provided excerpts, there is no evidence to suggest that *Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils S. A.* has been overruled.
112906	97395	no	no	85	The provided text mentions *Gavieres v. United States* multiple times.  However, the opinion does not explicitly overrule it. While the court overrules *Grady v. Corbin*, which had relied on *Gavieres*, it does so by arguing that *Grady* lacked constitutional roots and was inconsistent with prior precedent.  The court acknowledges that *Gavieres* may be the only case that suggests the Blockburger test was the exclusive test for successive prosecutions, but it criticizes *Gavieres*'s precedential weight due to its interpretation of a Philippine statute rather than the U.S. Constitution.  The court doesn't explicitly state that *Gavieres* is overruled, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Therefore, while the court's reasoning diminishes *Gavieres*'s influence, it doesn't meet the criteria for being considered overruled.
112906	96480	no	no	90	The excerpts analyze the case *Burton v. United States*, comparing its holding to other cases and the evolution of double jeopardy jurisprudence.  The excerpts do not explicitly overrule *Burton*, but rather discuss its compatibility with later precedent, specifically the decision in *Grady v. Corbin*. The opinion notes that *Burton* and another case, *Gavieres*, are "incompatible" with the belief that a later case, *Nielsen*, created an additional requirement, but this is not a statement that *Burton* is overruled.  Instead, the court is clarifying the evolution of the applicable legal test for double jeopardy. The court ultimately suggests that *Grady* and *Nielsen* better reflect modern precedent, not that *Burton* is formally overruled.  The opinion highlights differences and distinctions between *Burton* and other case law, not an explicit overruling.
112906	107686	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Bloom v. Illinois*, referencing specific holdings within the case.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Bloom v. Illinois* is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpts mainly discuss the application and interpretation of *Bloom*, not its overruling.  The analysis focuses on whether the case's reasoning should apply to the cases being decided. Therefore, there's no evidence to suggest that *Bloom v. Illinois* has been overruled.
112906	105594	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Green v. United States*, but never states that it has been overruled.  The excerpts focus on applying Green's principles regarding the protection against successive prosecutions under the Double Jeopardy Clause,  particularly concerning the defendant's interests in avoiding embarrassment, expense, ordeal, and the risk of mistaken conviction. There's no language suggesting it is no longer good law or has been superseded by later case law. The mention in the last excerpt regarding *Green* is in the context of a discussion about the precedential value of other cases,  but *Green* itself is not explicitly challenged or overruled.
117947	110338	no	yes	95	The court in Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena explicitly overrules Fullilove v. Klutznick to the extent that the latter case held that federal racial classifications are subject to a less rigorous standard than strict scrutiny.  The Adarand court states that federal racial classifications must meet the same strict scrutiny standard as state racial classifications. While the Adarand court does not explicitly state that Fullilove is overruled in its entirety, it makes clear that any portion of Fullilove inconsistent with the strict scrutiny standard is no longer good law.  The court repeatedly references Fullilove and clarifies that insofar as the prior ruling deviated from strict scrutiny, it is superseded.  Several concurring opinions also discuss the implications of this overruling and how the strict scrutiny standard established in Adarand should now apply.
117947	112176	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *City of Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co.* and discusses its holding regarding strict scrutiny for all race-based actions by state and local governments.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Croson* itself has been overruled.  The text focuses on the implications of *Croson*'s holding for other cases, particularly concerning federal action and the distinction between state and federal programs.  The court analyzes *Croson* and its relationship to other cases, but it does not explicitly overrule, modify, or limit *Croson*'s holding.  The reference to overruling *Metro Broadcasting*, which was in part inconsistent with *Croson*, does not inherently overrule *Croson* itself.
117947	112484	yes	yes	100	The excerpts explicitly state that the court overruled *Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC* in this case.  The opinion states that *Metro Broadcasting*, which applied intermediate scrutiny to congressionally mandated "benign" racial classifications, is inconsistent with the Court's later decision in *Richmond v. J. A. Croson Co*.  The Court explicitly overrules *Metro Broadcasting* (at least in part) and undermines *Fullilove* by recasting the standard on which it rested and by calling even its holding into question. This directly satisfies condition 1 and partially satisfies condition 3 of the definition of being overruled. 
117947	111669	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss *Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education*, referencing its holding and reasoning in relation to other cases concerning racial classifications and affirmative action.  However, none of the excerpts explicitly overrule *Wygant*.  While some excerpts critique or clarify aspects of its application (such as its use of strict scrutiny or the distinction between diversity and remedying past discrimination), they do not overturn the case itself.  Later opinions may refine or limit the scope of *Wygant*'s precedent, but that is not the same as overruling it. The text highlights ongoing debates and differing interpretations surrounding affirmative action, but doesn't declare *Wygant* to be no longer valid.
117947	109930	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Regents of the University of California v. Bakke*, often referencing specific aspects of Justice Powell's opinion.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citations are used to support or contrast arguments in subsequent cases, treating *Bakke* as precedent, not as an overruled case.  While there are discussions about different interpretations of *Bakke*'s findings among the justices in later cases, no majority opinion explicitly overrules it or renders its holding void. The citing opinions acknowledge and engage with the *Bakke* decision, demonstrating it remains relevant to the discussions around affirmative action.
117947	103875	no	yes	95	The court explicitly overrules parts of *Metro Broadcasting*, stating that its holding is inconsistent with the principle that all racial classifications must be analyzed under strict scrutiny.  While the opinion extensively discusses *Hirabayashi v. United States*, it does not explicitly state that *Hirabayashi* is overruled. However, the court uses *Hirabayashi* to illustrate the principle that all racial classifications, regardless of intent, are subject to strict scrutiny. This implicitly undermines the reasoning in *Hirabayashi*, which upheld a curfew based on a more lenient standard. The court's application of strict scrutiny to all racial classifications effectively overrules the precedent set by *Hirabayashi*'s less stringent review of racial classifications, especially as it applies to wartime measures affecting a specific racial group. Therefore, *Hirabayashi* is considered overruled insofar as its application of a less stringent standard is concerned.
117947	105222	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Bolling v. Sharpe* as precedent,  showing that later cases followed its reasoning and did not overrule it.  The excerpts highlight how *Bolling v. Sharpe*'s principle of equal application of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments regarding racial classifications has been consistently reaffirmed in subsequent jurisprudence. There is no indication that any part of *Bolling v. Sharpe* was overruled, qualified, or limited in application.  Instead, the court uses *Bolling v. Sharpe* to support its own holdings. 
117947	663717	no	yes	95	The case 16 F.3d 1537 (1994) is overruled because the Supreme Court explicitly rejects the "lenient standard, resembling intermediate scrutiny", used by the Court of Appeals in upholding the use of subcontractor compensation clauses.  The Supreme Court states that it alters the playing field in important respects and remands the case for further consideration in light of the principles announced in this opinion. This indicates that the prior ruling is no longer good law under the newly established principles. The court's rejection of the lower court's reasoning and the subsequent remand constitute an overruling, even if not explicitly stated as such.
117947	109469	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Washington v. Davis (1976) multiple times.  However, none of the mentions suggest that the case has been overruled.  Instead, the excerpts cite the case as relevant precedent regarding the distinction between discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent in equal protection cases.  The opinions engage with the principles established in *Washington v. Davis*, using it to support various arguments, but do not challenge its holding or suggest it is no longer good law.
117947	104040	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Korematsu v. United States*, often within discussions of equal protection and racial classifications.  However, none of the citations suggest that *Korematsu* itself has been overruled.  While some passages criticize *Korematsu*'s application of strict scrutiny (e.g., noting that even "the most rigid scrutiny can sometimes fail"), this critique doesn't equate to overruling the precedent.  Other excerpts use *Korematsu* to support arguments about equal protection standards, which implies the case is still relevant to the subject matter, even if its application is contested or its conclusions are deemed regrettable.  The reference to Congress's subsequent recognition of an injustice committed against Japanese Americans doesn't imply judicial overruling of *Korematsu*. Therefore, there's no indication in these excerpts that *Korematsu* has been fully or partially overruled.
117947	111827	no	no	100	The provided text cites *United States v. Paradise* multiple times.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled. The excerpts discuss the case's holding, particularly regarding the equal protection guarantee of the Fifth Amendment and the application of strict scrutiny to race-based remedial actions.  There is no language indicating the overruling of *United States v. Paradise* either explicitly or implicitly.  The citing opinions discuss the legal principles established in *United States v. Paradise*, but do not challenge its validity or precedent-setting nature.  Therefore, there's no basis to conclude that *United States v. Paradise* was overruled.
117931	105287	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly overrules *United States v. Bramblett*.  The majority opinion states, "Bramblett is hereby overruled."  This directly satisfies condition 1 for overruling a case.  Further, the court provides detailed reasoning for why the prior decision is flawed, citing issues with its historical analysis and approach to statutory construction.  The dissenting opinion acknowledges the overruling, highlighting the majority's departure from a 40-year-old precedent.
117931	112296	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Patterson v. McLean Credit Union* as precedent for the principle of stare decisis, particularly in the context of statutory interpretation.  The excerpts use *Patterson* to support arguments about the importance of adhering to precedent and the considerations involved in overruling prior decisions.  At no point does the text suggest that *Patterson* itself has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  Instead, *Patterson* is invoked as a source of authority on the topic of stare decisis.
117931	258536	no	no	95	The provided text discusses the case *Morgan v. United States*,  and its creation of the "judicial function exception" to Section 1001.  The Supreme Court case referenced does not explicitly overrule *Morgan v. United States*. Instead, the opinion describes how lower courts have interpreted and applied the *Morgan* decision.  The Supreme Court ultimately reverses the Sixth Circuit's decision rejecting the judicial function exception, essentially affirming the continued relevance and use of the *Morgan* principle in certain cases.  Therefore, it is not overruled.
117931	276778	no	no	95	The provided text cites the case *United States v. Erhardt* multiple times.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case has been overruled. The excerpts describe the case as having reversed a conviction, which indicates that the court's decision in *Erhardt* was upheld but applied narrowly in specific contexts (judicial functions exception to § 1001).  The later cases cited either followed, distinguished, or discussed *Erhardt*'s holding within the context of the "judicial function exception," but they did not explicitly overrule it.  There is no language in the text suggesting any of the six conditions provided for a case to be considered overruled were met.
117931	109680	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois* as precedent regarding the principle of stare decisis, specifically in the context of statutory construction and the Court's adherence to its prior interpretations of legislation.  The excerpts emphasize the importance of respecting precedent, particularly in statutory cases where Congress retains the power to alter the Court's interpretations.  Nowhere in the text is *Illinois Brick* explicitly overruled, nor is language used that is functionally equivalent to overruling. The Court's discussion of *Illinois Brick* is used to support the argument for adhering to precedent, not to overturn it.  Therefore, there is no indication that *Illinois Brick Co. v. Illinois* was overruled.
117931	101894	no	no	95	The provided text quotes Justice Brandeis' dissenting opinion in Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.  The text does not overrule the case; instead, it cites the dissenting opinion to support a point about stare decisis.  The opinion is mentioned as a relevant precedent on the issue of stare decisis, not overruled.
117958	101414	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly states that it cannot hold for the respondent while still adhering to the reasoning and holding of Sinclair v. United States (1929).  It then proceeds to repudiate several aspects of Sinclair's reasoning.  The court points out that Sinclair's reliance on prior cases (Brimson and Horning) has been overturned in later decisions.  Furthermore, the court rejects parts of Sinclair's logic regarding the distinction between legal and factual questions related to pertinency and materiality.  Therefore, while not explicitly stating "Sinclair is overruled", the court effectively overrules significant portions of its reasoning and holding, rendering it no longer good law in the context of the present case.
117958	112848	no	no	95	The excerpt cites *United States v. Olano* multiple times and summarizes its holding regarding plain error review under Rule 52(b).  The excerpt does not contain any language suggesting that *Olano* has been overruled. The Court's affirmation in the current case relies upon *Olano*'s reasoning.  Instead, it uses *Olano* as precedent to clarify the standard for plain error review.
117958	673512	no	no	95	The provided text does not contain any explicit statements that overrule *United States v. Michael E. Gaudin*.  While the text discusses the case and its holding that the question of materiality in a § 1001 prosecution must be decided by the jury, it does not overrule it.  The Supreme Court's decision in this excerpt is concerned with the question of materiality in the context of the case's specific facts and legal arguments and does not explicitly declare *Gaudin* as overruled or no longer good law.  The Supreme Court's analysis centers on whether materiality is a question for the judge or the jury; the text's focus is on whether the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals was correct in its reasoning and application of the law in *Gaudin*,  not on overruling the case itself.
117958	112868	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Sullivan v. Louisiana* (1993) as precedent, specifically regarding the right to a jury trial in criminal cases and the burden of proof.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinions consistently reaffirm the principles established in *Sullivan v. Louisiana*. Therefore, there's no indication that *Sullivan v. Louisiana* (1993) has been overruled.
117958	109698	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Patterson v. New York* multiple times but does not overrule it.  The excerpts cite *Patterson* as precedent, discussing its relevance to the role of the jury in determining elements of a criminal offense and the flexibility of legislatures in defining those elements. There is no language suggesting the Court is overruling *Patterson*, nor does it qualify or limit its application. The citing case uses *Patterson* to support its argument regarding the allocation of burdens of proof and the definition of criminal offenses. Therefore, there is no indication that *Patterson v. New York* (1977) is overruled.
117958	94082	no	no	100	The excerpt states that the government's argument relies on *Sparf v. United States*.  However, the court explicitly states that *Sparf* "had nothing to do with the issue before us here."  The court then explains the holding in *Sparf*, which was about whether a jury could decide pure questions of law in a criminal case, not the issue in the current case.  Therefore, *Sparf* is not overruled; instead, the court distinguishes it.
117958	112052	no	no	85	The court mentions Kungys v. United States (1988) and its definition of "materiality" in the context of a Section 1001 prosecution.  However, the court does not explicitly overrule Kungys.  Instead, it distinguishes Kungys on the grounds that Kungys involved an appellate review of a nonjury denaturalization proceeding, whereas the current case concerns the Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial in a criminal prosecution.  The court argues that the different contexts render Kungys' treatment of materiality as a matter for the court inapplicable to the present case.  The court suggests that any support Kungys provided to the decisions in Sinclair and Abadi was obiter dicta and therefore can be disregarded.  This is a distinction, not an overruling.
118023	110312	no	no	95	The provided text extensively cites and discusses *Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission*, but it does not overrule it.  The excerpts analyze and apply the *Central Hudson* test in various contexts, sometimes agreeing with its outcome and sometimes disagreeing with its application in specific cases. However, there's no language indicating that the Supreme Court is explicitly overruling *Central Hudson* or any portion of its holding.  The justices debate the implications and applications of the *Central Hudson* test, but they do not overturn it.
118023	109450	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Virginia State Board of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc.* and uses it as precedent.  It does not explicitly overrule the case, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. The excerpts repeatedly reference and rely on the reasoning and holding of *Virginia State Board of Pharmacy*, showing it is being followed as precedent, not overruled.
118023	111744	no	yes	100	The court explicitly states that its prior holding in *Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R.* was erroneous in its First Amendment analysis.  The court finds that *Posadas* incorrectly applied the Central Hudson test and that its reasoning is no longer persuasive.  The court explicitly overrules the *Posadas* majority's approach to the constitutionality of suppressing truthful, non-misleading information for paternalistic reasons and its "greater-includes-the-lesser" reasoning. The court concludes that the statements in the *Posadas* opinion are no longer persuasive.
118023	117924	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.* (1995).  However, the citations are used as precedent and are not overruled. The court uses the case to support its reasoning and build its arguments, but it does not challenge the validity or application of *Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.* itself.  Therefore, there is no indication that the case has been overruled, either fully or partially.
118023	1877168	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss the case *44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine* (1993) and its subsequent review.  The excerpts show the Supreme Court analyzing and ultimately reversing the lower court's decision. However, there is no language suggesting that *44 Liquor Mart, Inc. v. Racine* was overruled. Instead, the Supreme Court engaged with the case's reasoning and conclusions, ultimately reaching a different outcome based on its own interpretation of the relevant legal principles and First Amendment standards.  The analysis and discussion do not meet any of the criteria for overruling a precedent.
118023	112836	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss and cite *City of Cincinnati v. Discovery Network, Inc.* multiple times.  However, none of these citations suggest that the case has been overruled.  In several instances, the Court either explicitly agrees with the principles established in *Cincinnati v. Discovery Network*, or uses the case to support its reasoning.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overturned, qualified, or limited in its application to specific circumstances.  The excerpts show the case being cited as precedent, demonstrating that it remains relevant and has not been overruled.
118023	112899	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss *United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co.* in relation to other cases, particularly *Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates v. Tourism Co. of P. R*.  The Supreme Court critiques the reasoning in *Posadas*, stating that it "erroneously performed the First Amendment analysis."  However, this critique does not explicitly overrule *Edge Broadcasting*. The court distinguishes *Edge Broadcasting* from the case at hand based on the fact that the commercial speech ban in *Edge Broadcasting* concerned an activity deemed illegal in the broadcaster's jurisdiction, unlike the case being decided, where the ban targeted information about lawful behavior.  While the Court expresses concerns with certain aspects of *Edge Broadcasting*'s rationale regarding "vice" products, it does not explicitly state that the case is overruled, nor does it offer language functionally equivalent to overruling it.  Therefore, based solely on the provided text, there's no indication that *United States v. Edge Broadcasting Co.* (1993) has been overruled.
118023	109649	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Linmark Associates, Inc. v. Township of Willingboro* and discusses its principles related to commercial speech and government regulation.  However, there is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The citing opinions engage with *Linmark*'s precedent, referencing specific points within the decision to support or contrast with their own arguments.  There is no indication of the Court rejecting any of the *Linmark* holding's core tenets.
118023	117963	no	no	100	The provided text excerpts cite *Florida Bar v. Went For It, Inc.* multiple times.  However, none of these citations indicate that the case has been overruled. The excerpts discuss the case's holding regarding restrictions on attorney advertising and use it as precedent in analyzing other commercial speech cases.  No language suggests overruling, partial overruling, qualification, or limiting of the case's application to specific circumstances.
118023	2040250	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Ass'n v. Attorney General* multiple times.  However, in each instance, the citing opinion is merely referencing or discussing the Michigan case's holding regarding the scope of a liquor advertising restriction. There is no language indicating that the Supreme Court explicitly overruled, implicitly overruled, or partially overruled *Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Ass'n v. Attorney General*. The citing opinion simply uses the Michigan case as a point of comparison or contrast, indicating that the Michigan court reached a different conclusion regarding the scope of a liquor advertising restriction than the court in the current case.  Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Michigan Beer & Wine Wholesalers Ass'n v. Attorney General* has been overruled.
118023	108636	yes	no	-1	CITE_NOT_FOUND
118011	92702	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Hans v. Louisiana*, often discussing its implications and whether other cases have correctly interpreted it.  While some dissenting opinions express strong disagreement with *Hans* and its interpretation by subsequent cases, there is no language explicitly overruling the case, nor any functionally equivalent language that would suggest it has been implicitly overruled. The excerpts analyze and critique *Hans*, but do not overturn its holding.
118011	84681	no	yes	95	The excerpts repeatedly refer to *Chisholm v. Georgia* as a "now-discredited decision" and state that it has been overruled by later case law, specifically citing *Hans v. Louisiana* as a case that rejected Chisholm's holding.  The excerpts also describe *Chisholm* as having been "repudiated" by the Eleventh Amendment.  The opinions repeatedly refer to Chisholm's view on sovereign immunity as being incorrect and not reflective of current law.
118011	112291	yes	yes	95	The provided text repeatedly refers to Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. as having a plurality opinion, with no single rationale agreed upon by a majority of justices.  The text highlights the dissenting opinions and the lack of a clear majority view, emphasizing this fractured decision and its resulting confusion in lower courts.  Furthermore, the current court case explicitly states that it overrules the holding in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., making it clear that the case is no longer good law in the context of the issue being discussed (Congressional power to subject states to federal court jurisdiction).  This directly satisfies condition 1 and condition 6 for overruling a case.
118011	111503	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon* and elaborates on its holding regarding the abrogation of state sovereign immunity.  The citing opinions do not overrule *Atascadero*; instead, they engage with and attempt to clarify and apply its "clear statement rule" concerning Congressional intent to abrogate state immunity.  The justices discuss the case and its precedent extensively, demonstrating that the case is still relevant and influential in shaping their legal reasoning. There is no indication that the Court intended to overrule Atascadero.  One justice even dissents, arguing against the court's interpretation.  No language suggests that *Atascadero* is no longer good law or has been altered. 
118011	102271	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss the case *Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi*, analyzing its relevance to the concept of sovereign immunity.  While the excerpts extensively cite and analyze *Principality of Monaco v. Mississippi*, they do not explicitly overrule it.  The discussion focuses on clarifying and distinguishing aspects of the *Monaco* decision, particularly concerning the extent of congressional power to displace state immunity and the interpretation of the Eleventh Amendment.  Some excerpts even suggest that parts of the *Monaco* decision might be justified in certain contexts. No language is used that is functionally equivalent to overruling the case; the case is not called "no longer good law." The analysis involves the interpretation and application of *Monaco* rather than its direct overruling.
118011	96819	no	yes	95	The court explicitly states that the doctrine of Ex parte Young may not be used to enforce § 2710(d)(3) against a state official.  This directly limits the application of Ex parte Young, effectively overruling it in the specific context of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  The court distinguishes the circumstances of this case from those traditionally covered by Ex parte Young, creating a carve-out that reduces the scope of the precedent.
118011	85330	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Cohens v. Virginia* (1821) as precedent.  In multiple instances, the court relies on Chief Justice Marshall's opinion in *Cohens* to clarify the Eleventh Amendment's scope and limitations.  There is no language suggesting that *Cohens* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The excerpts use *Cohens* to support arguments about the Eleventh Amendment, thereby treating it as valid and applicable precedent.
118011	109520	no	no	90	The provided text discusses Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer in several opinions.  While some opinions criticize or clarify aspects of the decision, particularly regarding its implications for the Eleventh Amendment and the scope of Congressional power to abrogate state sovereign immunity, none explicitly overrule it.  Later cases like *Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co.* engage with and reinterpret *Fitzpatrick*, leading to different conclusions about the extent of Congressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment, but this is a matter of interpretation and application, not explicit overruling.  The excerpts show ongoing debate and refinement of the precedent set by *Fitzpatrick*, not its outright rejection.
118011	111949	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transportation* multiple times.  However, in none of these instances is the case explicitly overruled.  Instead, the excerpts either cite *Welch* as precedent (albeit with some critical commentary in the dissenting/concurring opinions) or use it to support arguments about state sovereign immunity and the interpretation of related legal principles.  There's no language suggesting that *Welch* is no longer good law or that any part of its holding has been overturned.
118011	112800	no	no	95	The snippets mention the case of interest, *Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.*, multiple times. However, none of the mentions suggest that the case has been overruled.  In one instance, the court notes that *Union Gas* has been a solitary departure from established law in the five years since it was decided, and then proceeds to overrule *Union Gas*.  In another instance, the dissenting opinion of Justice Stevens mentions *Puerto Rico Aqueduct*, but this is not an overruling. In all the other mentions, the court cites *Puerto Rico Aqueduct* as precedent without any indication that it is being overruled or modified. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no indication that *Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc.* has been overruled.
118011	658639	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case 11 F. 3d 1016 (1994). However, the excerpts do not contain any language suggesting that this case was overruled.  Instead, the text discusses the case's holding and its implications, debating the validity of its reasoning regarding sovereign immunity and the interpretation of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.  The excerpts analyze and critique the 11 F. 3d 1016 decision, but don't explicitly overrule it.  One excerpt mentions that "Justice White's "vague concurrence renders the continuing validity of Union Gas in doubt," but this refers to a different case, Union Gas, not the case of interest.
118133	112887	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District* (1993).  However, the citations do not indicate that *Zobrest* was overruled. Instead, the excerpts discuss *Zobrest* as a precedent that modifies or clarifies prior case law, particularly concerning the Establishment Clause and the permissible extent of government aid to religious schools.  The opinions analyze how *Zobrest* affects the holdings in *Aguilar* and *Ball*, suggesting a shift in legal understanding but not an explicit overruling of *Zobrest* itself.
118133	111506	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that Aguilar v. Felton is no longer good law,  because it is not consistent with subsequent Establishment Clause decisions.  This directly satisfies condition 6 for overruling, and the court's action of granting relief from the injunction further supports this conclusion.
118133	111561	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind* as a precedent supporting the court's decision.  The court uses *Witters* to clarify its understanding of the Establishment Clause and to distinguish its current holding from prior cases like *Aguilar*. No language suggests that *Witters* itself is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  Instead, the court relies on *Witters* to shape its legal reasoning and find that *Aguilar* is no longer good law.  The court distinguishes the case's treatment of different legal principles and states that *Aguilar* is no longer good law in certain contexts, not *Witters*. Therefore, there is no indication that *Witters* has been overruled.
118133	111505	yes	no	95	The provided text discusses *Aguilar v. Felton*, and *School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball*,  and analyzes whether later Supreme Court cases have implicitly overruled them.  The excerpts mention that the Court's later decisions may have undermined the rationale of *Aguilar* and *Ball*, but they do not explicitly overrule *School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball*.  The dissenting opinions express disagreement with the majority's interpretation of prior precedents, but this does not constitute an overruling.  While the majority opinion suggests that some aspects of *Ball*'s reasoning may no longer be good law in all circumstances, it stops short of formally overruling the case. Therefore, there is no explicit statement that *School District of Grand Rapids v. Ball* is overruled, nor is there functionally equivalent language.
118133	108380	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Lemon v. Kurtzman* as precedent, using its three-part test to analyze Establishment Clause challenges.  While the Court discusses cases that modify or clarify the application of the *Lemon* test (like *Aguilar* and *Ball*), there is no language suggesting that *Lemon v. Kurtzman* itself is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly. The opinions analyze cases in light of *Lemon*, not in opposition to it.  The Court clarifies or distinguishes the application of *Lemon*'s principles in various contexts, but does not overturn the case itself.
118133	438842	no	yes	95	The provided text shows that the case *Felton v. Secretary, United States Dept. of Ed., 739 F. 2d 48 (CA2 1984)* was affirmed by the Supreme Court in *Aguilar v. Felton*, and its premises are deemed no longer valid.  The court explicitly states that premises relied upon in the cited case are no longer valid, which meets the criteria for overruling, either fully or partially.  The court's statements directly challenge and invalidate the reasoning of the cited case. Therefore, the case is considered overruled.
118133	117870	no	no	95	While the provided text mentions that five justices in *Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet* called for the overruling of *Aguilar*, it explicitly states that the question of *Aguilar*'s propriety was not before the Court in *Grumet*.  Therefore, *Aguilar* was not overruled by *Grumet*, despite the justices' opinions. The court in the excerpt highlights that the "views of five Justices that the case should be reconsidered or overruled cannot be said to have effected a change in Establishment Clause law."  The fact that justices desired to revisit *Aguilar* does not meet the criteria for overruling as defined in the prompt.
118133	109251	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Meek v. Pittenger*, analyzing its holding and comparing other cases to it.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Meek v. Pittenger* was overruled.  The court refers to *Meek* as precedent and discusses its principles in the context of other cases.  While the court discusses whether the principles of *Meek* should be extended or modified, there is no explicit overruling or language functionally equivalent to it. The court's statement that *Aguilar* and parts of *Ball* are "no longer good law" does not apply to *Meek v. Pittenger*. 
118133	112679	no	no	95	The provided text mentions the case *Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail* multiple times.  However, in each instance, the case is cited as precedent for the application of Rule 60(b) regarding modification of a judgment based on significant changes in law, not as a case that was overruled. The court uses *Rufo* to support its reasoning regarding the modification of the prior judgment and its discussion on the "significant change" standard within Rule 60(b)(5).  There is no language indicating that *Rufo* itself has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.
118133	117967	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of University of Virginia (1995) multiple times.  However, in none of these mentions does the court explicitly overrule, or use language functionally equivalent to overruling,  Rosenberger. The excerpts show that justices referenced Rosenberger in concurring and dissenting opinions, indicating a disagreement on its interpretation or application, but not an overruling of the case itself.  The text highlights disagreements about the implications and applications of Rosenberger in subsequent cases but doesn't state that Rosenberger is no longer good law or has been superseded. Therefore, there is no evidence in this text to suggest that Rosenberger has been overruled.
118133	112138	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Bowen v. Kendrick*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpts discuss *Bowen v. Kendrick* in relation to the Establishment Clause and government entanglement with religion, using it as precedent to support arguments about excessive entanglement.  No language suggests the Court intends to overturn *Bowen v. Kendrick*. The opinion acknowledges that the understanding of the criteria used to assess whether aid to religion has an impermissible effect has changed since *Aguilar* was decided, but this does not affect the continued validity of *Bowen v. Kendrick*. In fact, the court cites *Bowen v. Kendrick* to support its arguments multiple times. Therefore, there is no indication that *Bowen v. Kendrick* has been overruled, either fully or partially.
118155	112259	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that its reasons for holding in the current case "in large part disavow the method of analysis used in United States v. Halper", and that Halper's deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered.  The court further explains that Halper's test for determining whether a sanction is punitive has proven unworkable and that it is putting the Halper genie back in the bottle.  Several justices concur in the judgment, agreeing that Halper does not provide proper guidance.  These statements clearly indicate that Halper has been overruled.
118155	106534	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez* repeatedly as a source of factors to consider when determining whether a sanction is criminal or civil in nature.  No language in the excerpts suggests that *Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez* is overruled, or even modified.  Instead, the court uses the factors set forth in the *Kennedy* case as guideposts. While the court does modify the approach of *Halper*, which itself relied on *Kennedy*, this is not an overruling of *Kennedy* itself.  The court explicitly affirms the usefulness of the *Kennedy* factors in determining whether sanctions are punitive. Therefore, there is no indication that *Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez* has been overruled.
118155	1087946	no	no	95	The excerpts discuss Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch (1994).  The opinion in this case does not overrule Kurth Ranch.  Instead, the opinion references Kurth Ranch multiple times, seemingly to support the court's own reasoning.  In one instance, the court explicitly states its agreement with the holding in Kurth Ranch.  In other instances, the court summarizes and cites the Kurth Ranch decision in the explanation of its own holding. Therefore, there is no indication of the overruling of Kurth Ranch. 
118155	110331	no	no	95	The excerpts reaffirm the rule established in United States v. Ward.  The opinion explicitly states that its reasoning disavows the analysis in Halper, but this does not overrule Ward.  The court cites Ward multiple times to support its analysis, showing that the precedent is still considered valid. Therefore, there is no indication that Ward has been overruled.
118155	118052	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *United States v. Ursery* and discusses its relevance to double jeopardy jurisprudence.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Ursery* itself has been overruled. Instead, the excerpts clarify and refine the principles established in *Ursery*, particularly regarding the "punitive" nature of civil penalties and the application of the Double Jeopardy Clause.  The court distinguishes and explains parts of *Halper*, which *Ursery* addressed, but does not overrule *Ursery*. The court uses *Ursery* to support its reasoning in several instances.
118155	102987	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Helvering v. Mitchell*, referencing its statements on the nature of civil vs. criminal penalties and the Double Jeopardy Clause.  However, none of the citations suggest that the case itself has been overruled. The excerpts use *Helvering v. Mitchell* as precedent, supporting the court's reasoning on the interpretation of the Double Jeopardy Clause, specifically regarding whether a penalty is criminal or civil in nature. There's no language indicating overruling, modification, or limitation of the case's holding.
118155	106087	no	no	95	The provided text cites *Flemming v. Nestor*, but does not overrule it.  The excerpts use *Flemming v. Nestor* as precedent, referencing its language regarding the burden of proof needed to demonstrate a criminal and punitive purpose.  There is no language suggesting the overruling, partial overruling, or limiting of the case's holding in any way. The citing opinions use *Flemming* to support their arguments, indicating that it remains good law in the relevant context.
118155	112906	no	no	100	The provided text cites *United States v. Dixon* multiple times.  In each instance, the case is used to support the application of the Blockburger test in double jeopardy cases,  both in the context of successive prosecutions and successive punishments. No language suggests the overruling,  partial overruling, or qualification of *Dixon*. The citations confirm *Dixon* remains good precedent for applying the Blockburger "same-elements" test. Therefore, there is no indication that *United States v. Dixon* (1993) has been overruled.
118149	107615	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly states that Albrecht v. Herald Co. should be overruled.  The opinion directly addresses Albrecht, stating that it should be reconsidered in light of subsequent decisions and concludes that it should be overruled. This satisfies condition 1 for overruling.
118149	109716	no	no	95	The provided text states that in *Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.*, the Court overruled *Schwinn*, not *Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.*.  While the text discusses *Albrecht*, and mentions it being questioned and having its underpinnings weakened by *GTE Sylvania*, it does not explicitly overrule *Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.*. Therefore, based on the provided excerpt, there is no evidence to suggest that *Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc.* was overruled.
118149	725024	no	yes	100	The court explicitly overrules Albrecht v. Herald Co., which was cited in the case of interest.  The court states that it finds Albrecht's conceptual foundations gravely weakened and proceeds to overrule it.  This directly addresses the case of interest's reliance on Albrecht, making it overruled insofar as it followed Albrecht's per se rule against vertical maximum price fixing.
118149	112425	no	no	95	The provided text discusses the case *Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co.* (ARCO) in the context of a broader discussion about overruling *Albrecht v. Herald Co*.  While the Supreme Court expresses some "disfavor" with *Albrecht*, and notes that the procompetitive potential of vertical maximum price restraints is more evident than when *Albrecht* was decided, it does not explicitly overrule *ARCO*.  Instead, the court uses *ARCO* to support its argument for a rule-of-reason approach instead of the per se rule in *Albrecht*.  Therefore, there is no indication that *ARCO* itself was overruled, fully or partially.
118149	110747	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Arizona v. Maricopa County Medical Society*, but it does not overrule it.  Instead, the opinion uses *Maricopa County* to support its discussion of the rule of reason in antitrust law and the use of per se rules.  The court refers to *Maricopa County* multiple times, treating it as precedent to clarify its own position on antitrust analysis.  There is no language suggesting the overruling, modification, or limitation of *Maricopa County*. The text discusses other cases, especially concerning their treatment of vertical maximum price fixing. While the text indicates that some elements of *Albrecht v. Herald Co.* (discussed in relation to *Maricopa County*) are being reconsidered, this does not impact the standing of *Maricopa County* itself.
118149	107491	no	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the Court is overruling *Albrecht*, not *Schwinn*.  While the excerpt discusses *Schwinn* and its subsequent criticism and the evolution of legal understanding concerning vertical restraints, there is no language suggesting that *Schwinn* itself has been overruled.  The focus is entirely on overruling *Albrecht*, another case dealing with vertical maximum-price-fixing.  Therefore, while *Schwinn* is discussed in the context of the evolution of antitrust law concerning vertical restraints, it is not overruled in this excerpt.
118230	104079	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly overrules House v. Mayo, stating that its conclusion was erroneous and should not be followed.  The majority opinion directly addresses and rejects the precedent set in House v. Mayo regarding statutory certiorari jurisdiction to review denials of certificates of probable cause.  The dissenting opinion acknowledges that the majority is overruling House v. Mayo.  Multiple sections of the court opinion explicitly state that House v. Mayo is overruled, or that its holding cannot stand.
118230	1087822	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule Ex Parte Quirin.  While the excerpt discusses *Ex Parte Quirin* and its holding that a petition for habeas corpus constitutes the institution of a suit, it does not explicitly overrule it, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Instead, the excerpt distinguishes *Ex Parte Quirin* from the present case, arguing that a request for a COA is of a different nature than a petition for habeas corpus.  The court's analysis suggests that the principles of *Ex Parte Quirin* are inapplicable to the current circumstances of the case, but does not overturn the precedent set in *Ex Parte Quirin*. The dissenting opinion notes the irony of relying on *Quirin* while overruling a case directly in point, but this is a disagreement with the majority opinion, not an overruling of *Ex Parte Quirin*. 
118230	112643	no	no	95	The excerpt discusses Payne v. Tennessee (1991) in relation to the principle of stare decisis.  The Court cites Payne to support the idea that stare decisis is a principle of policy, not an inexorable command, and that its application is reduced in the case of procedural rules.  The Court does not explicitly overrule Payne, nor does it use language functionally equivalent to overruling it. Instead, the Court uses Payne to support its argument.  It mentions that the precedential value of Payne is less in the case of procedural rules. The case is cited as precedent. Therefore, it was not overruled. 
118230	111885	no	no	95	The excerpt does not overrule *Gray v. Mississippi*.  While the excerpt mentions *Gray v. Mississippi* in the context of discussing stare decisis and the precedential weight of opinions rendered without full briefing or argument, it does not explicitly overrule it.  The excerpt points to a footnote in *Gray v. Mississippi* that suggests opinions decided without full briefing may have reduced precedential value. However, the citing opinion does not adopt this view, as it accords stare decisis effect to *Gray*.  Instead, the court acknowledges *Gray*'s footnote as dictum, meaning it is not binding precedent and does not constitute an overruling of *Gray*. The excerpt focuses on whether stare decisis should apply to *House v. Mayo*, not *Gray* itself. Therefore, *Gray v. Mississippi* is not overruled according to the provided criteria.
118317	118011	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida*, but does not overrule it.  While the opinion discusses the case extensively and engages with its holdings on sovereign immunity and Congressional power to abrogate that immunity, it does not explicitly state that *Seminole Tribe* is overruled, nor does it use functionally equivalent language.  The Court distinguishes and clarifies aspects of the doctrine of sovereign immunity established in *Seminole Tribe*, but does not overturn its core precedent.  The case is mentioned, analyzed, and its implications are debated, but it is not overruled, partially or otherwise.  In some instances, the opinion explicitly avoids overruling *Seminole Tribe*, even when it might appear inconsistent with another precedent (Parden).
118317	108763	no	no	95	The provided text discusses Employees of Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. v. Department of Public Health and Welfare of Mo. (1973).  The opinion does not explicitly overrule the case. Instead, it describes the 1973 case as a "retreat" from an earlier precedent (Parden v. Terminal Railway Co. of Alabama State Docks Dept.) and distinguishes it based on the facts and circumstances.  The Court highlights differences in the nature of the state activity involved and questions the clarity of Congressional intent in the 1973 case compared to the precedent.  It also notes a concurring opinion arguing the Congress lacked constitutional authority.  These actions are distinctions and analyses, not overrulings.
118317	106821	yes	yes	100	The court explicitly overrules Parden v. Terminal Railway.  The majority opinion states that its prior decision in Seminole Tribe expressly repudiates the proposition in Parden, and that in overruling Parden, it is merely making explicit what that case implied.  Furthermore, the Court describes Parden as being at the "nadir of our waiver (and, for that matter, sovereign-immunity) jurisprudence" and states that recognizing a congressional power to exact constructive waivers of sovereign immunity through the exercise of Article I powers would permit Congress to circumvent the anti-abrogation holding of Seminole Tribe.  The dissenting opinion also acknowledges that the majority opinion overrules Parden.
118317	111949	no	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that in Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., the court overruled Parden "to the extent [it] is inconsistent with the requirement that an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity by Congress must be expressed in unmistakably clear language."  While not directly stating Welch v. Texas Department of Highways & Public Transportation (1987) was overruled, the excerpt indicates that part of its holding (regarding congressional intent to negate Eleventh Amendment immunity) is no longer good law.  This meets the criteria for considering a case as overruled, at least in part.
118317	111503	no	no	95	The provided text mentions Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon (1985) multiple times.  However, in none of these mentions does the court explicitly overrule it, use functionally equivalent language, or limit its application to specific circumstances.  Instead, the case is cited as precedent, discussed, and its suggestion regarding waiver of immunity upon acceptance of federal grants is considered in relation to other cases.  While the court engages in extensive analysis of sovereign immunity and related cases, there is no indication that Atascadero is overruled. The analysis focuses on whether a state's acceptance of a federal grant constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity, a topic touched upon in Atascadero but not necessarily its core holding.
118317	112291	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts discuss Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. (1989).  In several instances, the case is cited, with one instance referencing Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion and another referencing the majority opinion.  Neither of these citations indicates that Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. has been overruled.  Instead, one excerpt states that the author of the opinion remains convinced that Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. was correctly decided.  While the excerpt notes that *Parden* was formally overruled, this does not impact the status of Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. Therefore, based on the provided text, there is no evidence to suggest that Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co. has been overruled.
118317	110880	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *White v. Massachusetts Council of Construction Employers, Inc.*  However, it does so within discussions of the "market participant" exception to the dormant Commerce Clause.  There is no language suggesting that *White* is overruled, explicitly or implicitly.  The excerpts use *White* as precedent, showing that it is considered good law in this context. The court critiques the *Parden* case extensively, but this does not impact the standing of *White*. 
118317	105513	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *California v. Taylor* multiple times.  However, the court's discussion clarifies that *California v. Taylor* dealt with whether substantive provisions of the Commerce Clause legislation applied to the States, not with sovereign immunity.  The court explicitly states that the Eleventh Amendment was not at issue in *California v. Taylor*. Therefore, the case was not overruled; it was distinguished based on its subject matter.
118317	109520	no	no	100	The provided text cites *Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer* multiple times.  In all instances, the case is mentioned as precedent and its holding is neither overruled nor modified.  The Court relies on *Fitzpatrick* to support its analysis of Congressional power to abrogate state sovereign immunity under the Fourteenth Amendment. There is no language suggesting that *Fitzpatrick* is no longer good law or that any part of its holding is invalid.
118386	118133	no	yes	95	The excerpt explicitly states that the Court in Agostini overruled two prior precedents, Meek and Wolman (one fully, the other partially), and that these cases are no longer good law.  The opinion repeatedly references Agostini and uses its reasoning and criteria to evaluate the constitutionality of the aid program at issue. Therefore, while not explicitly stating that Agostini itself was overruled, the opinion shows that Agostini altered the relevant legal standards which had been previously set out by Meek and Wolman, leading to a different outcome.
118386	112887	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School District* (1993) as precedent, and uses its reasoning in the Court's own analysis.  There is no language suggesting that *Zobrest* has been overruled, fully or partially.  Instead, the case is used to support the Court's holdings in later cases.  The opinion repeatedly references *Zobrest* and uses it as a key part of its legal reasoning, showing that it is not considered overruled.
118386	111561	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Witters v. Washington Department of Services for the Blind* and analyzes its holding in relation to other cases.  However, there is no language in the excerpts suggesting that *Witters* has been overruled, either fully or partially.  The court frequently refers back to *Witters* as precedent, discussing its principles of neutrality and private choice. While some later cases modify or clarify aspects of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, they don't explicitly overrule *Witters*.  The text mentions that *Meek* and *Wolman* are "no longer good law", but those are different cases. The ongoing discussion of *Witters* as a relevant precedent demonstrates it hasn't been overruled. 
118386	107737	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen (1968)* and discusses its holding in relation to other cases involving government aid to religious schools.  However, none of the excerpts explicitly overrule *Allen*.  Instead, the text analyzes *Allen* within the evolving context of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, distinguishing it from subsequent cases while acknowledging its continued relevance in certain respects.  The court uses *Allen* as a precedent in its reasoning, which is inconsistent with overruling.  The discussion of "neutrality" and the "indirect/direct" aid distinction does not invalidate *Allen*. Rather, the court uses these points to explain and refine its approach to similar issues that arose in later cases. In short, there is no language suggesting the Court intended to overturn the ruling in *Allen*.
118386	104373	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing* and discusses its principles and interpretations over time.  However, there is no language suggesting the Court explicitly overrules *Everson*, nor does it use functionally equivalent language.  The excerpts show the Court grappling with *Everson*'s legacy and attempting to clarify or modify its application in later cases, particularly concerning the concept of neutrality, but this does not constitute overruling the case itself. The ongoing discussion and attempts to refine the application of *Everson*'s principles indicate that the case remains relevant and influential but subject to evolving interpretations.
118386	109722	yes	yes	100	The provided text explicitly states that to the extent that Meek and Wolman conflict with the current holding, they are overruled.  This is a direct statement from the court overruling the prior cases. The opinion further explains the reasoning behind overruling these precedents, highlighting inconsistencies and irreconcilable differences with more recent case law.
118386	109251	yes	no	85	The excerpts mention *Meek v. Pittenger* numerous times.  However, the excerpts do not explicitly state that *Meek v. Pittenger* is overruled. While some language suggests that the Court's approach to Establishment Clause cases has "shifted" and that some aspects of *Meek* and *Wolman* are inconsistent with later decisions (such as *Agostini*), this does not equate to a clear and explicit overruling.  The opinions discuss and distinguish *Meek*, but do not use language that meets any of the criteria (1-6) to classify it as fully or partially overruled.  In fact, one concurring opinion states that *Meek* and *Wolman* should be overruled if they are inconsistent with the majority opinion in the current case, but that is not the equivalent of an overruling itself. 
118386	111003	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Mueller v. Allen*, referencing its holding regarding tax deductions for educational expenses and the principle of neutrality in government aid programs.  However, there is no language suggesting that *Mueller v. Allen* has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The text distinguishes *Mueller* from other cases, analyzing its facts and holding in relation to the specifics of the cases under consideration, but this is not the same as overruling it.  The court uses *Mueller* as precedent, citing it to support arguments.  Therefore, it is not overruled.
118386	108380	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Lemon v. Kurtzman*, referencing specific parts of the opinion (e.g., 403 U.S. 602, 612-613, 615-620, 623, 645-649).  In one instance, the text mentions that *School Dist. of Grand Rapids v. Ball*, which relied on *Lemon*, was overruled in part by *Agostini v. Felton*. However, this does not impact the standing of *Lemon v. Kurtzman* itself.  The excerpts show that *Lemon* is still being considered and discussed as precedent, even if some aspects of its application have been modified or clarified by later cases. There is no language suggesting that *Lemon* has been explicitly overruled or is no longer good law. 
118386	117967	no	no	95	The excerpts provided cite the case *Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of University of Virginia* multiple times.  However, none of the citations indicate that the case has been overruled. The case is mentioned and its principles are discussed, but there is no language suggesting it has been overturned, qualified, or is no longer good law in any specific context.  The excerpts show the case being cited as precedent and used in legal analysis, not overruled.
118428	99610	yes	yes	95	The court explicitly overrules Evans v. Gore insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges.  The court states that Evans is no longer sound law, citing its previous undermining by O'Malley v. Woodrough and the dissenting opinion in Evans itself.  The court's decision directly addresses and rejects the core holding of Evans.
118428	103214	no	yes	95	The provided text explicitly states that the case *Miles v. Graham*, which extended the principle of *Evans v. Gore*, was overruled by *O'Malley v. Woodrough*.  Furthermore, the opinion notes that *O'Malley v. Woodrough* undermines the reasoning of *Evans v. Gore*, and that *Evans v. Gore*, insofar as it contradicts *O'Malley v. Woodrough*, "cannot survive". This constitutes an overruling of *Evans v. Gore*, at least in part, based on criterion 1 and 2, and implicitly criterion 6 as well.  While the court does not explicitly state that *O'Malley v. Woodrough* itself overrules *Evans v. Gore*, the strong implications and the explicit overruling of *Miles v. Graham* (which extended *Evans v. Gore*) make it highly probable.
118428	110365	no	no	95	The provided text mentions *United States v. Will* multiple times.  In one instance, the opinion states that *O'Malley* undermined the reasoning of *Evans v. Gore*, a case that *Will* later implicitly overruled. However, there is no explicit language in the excerpts stating that *United States v. Will (1980)* itself has been overruled. The text refers to *Will* as precedent and discusses its holding at length, suggesting it has not been overruled.  While the opinion notes that *Evans v. Gore* is no longer good law and should be overruled, this is a separate case.  Therefore, there is no evidence within the provided text that *United States v. Will* has been overruled.
118428	702629	no	yes	100	The excerpt explicitly states that the Court overrules Hatter v. United States (1995) insofar as it holds that the Compensation Clause forbids Congress to apply a generally applicable, nondiscriminatory tax to the salaries of federal judges, whether or not they were appointed before the enactment of the tax.  The Court finds that the holding in Evans, which formed the basis of the decision in Hatter, is no longer sound law.  Therefore, Hatter is overruled partially, meeting condition 4 of the definition of overruled.
118273	111516	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites the case *Oregon Dept. of Fish and Wildlife v. Klamath Tribe*, but does not overrule it.  In several instances, the citing court distinguishes its own holding from the precedent set in *Klamath Tribe*, sometimes explicitly stating this distinction (e.g., "Although we cited Race Horse in Klamath, we did not in so doing reaffirm the equal footing doctrine...").  In other instances, the citing court uses *Klamath Tribe* to support its reasoning.  None of the conditions for overruling are met; the case is either followed, distinguished, or mentioned but not treated as precedent in the provided text. 
118273	96304	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts cite *United States v. Winans* multiple times.  However, none of these citations indicate that the case has been overruled. In one instance, the court notes that the *Winans* court's reliance on the equal footing doctrine to terminate Indian treaty rights was rejected by a later court decision.  This does not constitute an overruling of *Winans* itself, but rather a rejection of a specific legal rationale used within the *Winans* decision. In another instance, the court refers to a portion of the *Winans* decision relating to whether a treaty provided for an easement, and the court's language is consistent with the court interpreting the *Winans* case's holding, but does not overrule it.  The other instances simply cite *Winans* as precedent, either directly or by comparison to other cases involving similar treaty language. Therefore, there is no evidence within these excerpts that *United States v. Winans* has been overruled.
118273	746267	no	no	95	The provided text focuses on an analysis of the 1850 Executive Order and its impact on Chippewa hunting, fishing, and gathering rights under the 1837 Treaty.  The case of interest, 124 F.3d 904 (1997), is cited multiple times, but its rulings are analyzed and either agreed with or further clarified. There is no language suggesting that the court is overruling the case of interest, either in whole or in part.  Instead, the Supreme Court's opinion largely builds upon and interprets the Eighth Circuit's decision in 124 F.3d 904 (1997).
118273	94506	yes	yes	95	The court opinion explicitly states that Ward v. Race Horse has been qualified by later decisions.  It points out that Race Horse rested on a false premise, namely that Indian treaty rights to hunt, fish, and gather were irreconcilable with state sovereignty.  Subsequent cases established that these rights can coexist.  Furthermore, the opinion critiques the "temporary and precarious" language used in Race Horse, deeming it too broad to be useful in determining whether treaty rights survive statehood.  The court also mentions that Race Horse is effectively overruled sub silentio, based on the reasoning that Congress must clearly express its intent to abrogate Indian treaty rights and that such rights are not irreconcilable with state sovereignty. Therefore, the case has been overruled, at least partially, based on criteria 2, 3, 5, and 6 as described in the instructions.
118273	110146	no	no	95	The provided text repeatedly cites *Washington v. Washington State Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel Assn.* (1979) as precedent, using phrases like "see also" and "see, e.g."  The court uses the 1979 case to support its interpretation of treaty rights and the principle of resolving ambiguities in treaties in favor of Native Americans.  There is no language suggesting the 1979 case is overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The court is engaging in legal analysis that draws on prior decisions without modifying or rejecting them. In one instance the court suggests that *Ward v. Race Horse* (1896) was overruled sub silentio, but this is in reference to a different case.
118273	2261846	no	no	95	The provided text excerpts cite the case *Mille Lacs Band of Chippewa Indians v. Minnesota* (1994), 861 F. Supp. 800, multiple times. However, none of the excerpts describe the case as being overruled.  The citations are used to support historical arguments within the opinion, not to overturn or modify the legal holding of *Mille Lacs*. There is no language suggesting that any part of the cited case is no longer good law, nor is there any explicit or implicit overruling. The citing document simply references the case for factual information contained within its earlier decision.
118273	105018	no	no	95	The excerpts cite *Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer* to support the proposition that a president's executive order must be authorized by law.  The court uses the case as precedent, quoting it and relying on its holding that the president's action was unlawful. There is no language suggesting that *Youngstown* is overruled, even partially, or no longer good law in certain contexts. The court's citation and application of the case show it is treated as binding precedent.
118273	98773	no	no	95	The excerpt describes the court's consideration of *New York ex rel. Kennedy v. Becker*,  pointing out that the case involved "significantly different language" than other cases concerning treaty rights of Native Americans to hunt and fish.  The court distinguishes *Kennedy* based on its unique treaty language, stating that the language in *Kennedy* does not support the same interpretation as the treaties in other cases.  There is no indication that *Kennedy* is overruled; rather, it's distinguished on its facts.  The court analyzes *Kennedy* to highlight the differences in treaty language and reach a different outcome.
118273	103642	no	no	95	The provided text discusses Tulee v. Washington (1942) and its application of a "conservation necessity" standard to state regulations impacting Indian fishing rights.  Later cases are analyzed in relation to Tulee, focusing on the specific treaty language at issue in each case.  While the Court discusses limitations to Tulee's application based on treaty language, there's no explicit overruling of Tulee. The analysis centers on distinguishing Tulee's application based on the variations in treaty language across different cases, not on overruling the precedent itself.  The court clarifies and applies the precedent in new fact patterns, rather than overturning it.
118273	96748	no	no	100	The provided text repeatedly cites *Winters v. United States* as precedent for the principle that ambiguities in Indian treaties should be resolved in favor of the Indians.  There is no language suggesting that the case has been overruled, either explicitly or implicitly.  The text affirms the principle established in *Winters*, applying it to the case at hand. Therefore, there is no basis to conclude that *Winters v. United States* has been overruled.
