 The whites testified that just before getting in the car appellant slapped Herman Landry, one of the white boys, on the elbow.  The Negroes testified that appellant had not slapped Landry, but liad merely touched him.  The trial judge concluded that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Duncan had committed simple battery, and found him guilty.  I.  The Fourteenth Amendment denies the States the power to “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” In resolving conflicting *148 claims concerning the meaning of this spacious language, the Co'urt has looked increasingly to the Bill of Rights for guidance; many of the rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution have been held to be protected against state action by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  That clause now protects the right to compensation for property taken by the State; 4 the rights of speech, press, and religion covered by the First Amendment; 5 the Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and to have excluded from criminal trials any evidence illegally seized; 6 the right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to be free of compelled self-incrimination; 7 and the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, 8 to a speedy 9 and public 10 trial, to confrontation of opposing witnesses, 11 and to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses.  12 The test for determining whether a right extended by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments with respect to federal criminal proceedings is also protected against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment has been phrased in a variety of ways in the opinions of this Court. The question has been asked whether a right is among those “ 'fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,' ” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 67 (1932); 13 whether *149 it is “basic in our system of jurisprudence,” In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273 (1948); and whether it is “a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,” Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 343-344 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964); Pointer v. Texas, <citedDecision>380 U. S. 400, 403</citedDecision> (1965).  The claim before us is that the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment meets these tests.  The position of Louisiana, on the other hand, is that the Constitution imposes upon the States no duty to give a jury trial in any criminal case, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or the size of the punishment which may be imposed.  Because we believe that trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American scheme of justice, we hold that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in all criminal cases which — were they to be tried in a federal court — would come within the Sixth Amendment’s guarantee.  14 Since we consider the appeal be *150 fore us to be such a case, we hold that the Constitution was violated when appellant’s demand for jury trial was refused.  *151 The history of trial by jury in criminal cases has been frequently told.  15 It is sufficient for present purposes to say that by the time our Constitution was written, jury trial in criminal cases had been in existence in England for several centuries and carried impressive credentials traced by many to Magna Carta.

Quoting from Hebert v. Louisiana, 272 U. S. 312, 316 (1926).  In one sense recent cases applying provisions of the first eight Amendments to the States represent a new approach to the "incorporation” debate.  Earlier the Court can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into whether some particular procedural safeguard was required of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection.  For example, Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937), stated: “The right to trial by jury and the immunity from prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have value and importance.  Even so, they are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty.
**Concurrence Opinion**
As early as 1354 the words “due process of law” were used in an English statute interpreting Magna Carta, 4 and by the end of the 14th century “due process of law” and “law of the land” were interchangeable.  Thus the origin of this clause was an attempt by those who wrote Magna Carta to do away with the so-called trials of that period where people were liable to sudden arrest and summary conviction in courts and by judicial commissions with no sure and definite procedural protections and under laws that might have been improvised to try their particular cases. Chapter 39 of Magna Carta was a guarantee that the government would take neither life, liberty, nor property without a trial in accord with the law of the land that already existed at the time the alleged offense was committed.  This means that the Due Process Clause gives all Americans, whoever they are and wherever they happen to be, the right to be tried by independent and unprejudiced courts using established procedures and applying valid pre-existing laws.  There is not one word of legal history that justifies making the *170 term “due process of law” mean a guarantee of a trial free from laws and conduct which the courts deem at the time to be “arbitrary,” “unreasonable,” “unfair,” or “contrary to civilized standards.” The due process of law standard for a trial is one in accordance with the Bill of Rights and laws passed pursuant to constitutional power, guaranteeing to all alike a trial under the general law of the land.  Finally I want to add that I am not bothered by the argument that applying the Bill of Rights to the States, “according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment,” 5 interferes with our concept of federalism in that it may prevent States from trying novel social and economic experiments.  I have never believed that under the guise of federalism the States should be able to experiment with the protections afforded our citizens through the Bill of Rights.  As Justice Goldberg said so wisely in his concurring opinion in Pointer v. Texas, <citedDecision>380 U. S. 400</citedDecision> : “to deny to the States the power to impair a fundamental constitutional right is not to increase federal power, but, rather, to limit the power of both federal and state governments in favor of safeguarding the fundamental rights and liberties of the individual.  In my view this promotes rather than undermines the basic policy of avoiding excess concentration of power in government, federal or state, which underlies our concepts of federalism.” <citedDecision>380 U.S., at 414</citedDecision> .  It seems to me totally inconsistent to advocate, on the one hand, the power of this Court to strike down any state law or practice which it finds “unreasonable” or “unfair” and, on the other hand, urge that the States be *171 given maximum power to develop their own laws and procedures.  Yet the due process approach of my Brothers Harlan and Fortas (see other concurring opinion, post, p. 211) does just that since in effect it restricts the States to practices which a majority of this Court is willing to approve on a case-by-case basis.  No one is more concerned than I that the States be allowed to use the full scope of their powers as their citizens see fit.  And that is why I have continually fought against the expansion of this Court’s authority over the States through the use of a broad, general interpretation of due process that permits judges to strike down state laws they do not like.  In closing I want to emphasize that I believe as strongly as ever that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to make the Bill of Rights applicable to the States.  I have been willing to support the selective incorporation doctrine, however, as an alternative, although perhaps less historically supportable than complete incorporation.

 And, most importantly for me, the selective incorporation process has the virtue of having already worked to make most of the Bill of Rights’ protections applicable to the States.  My view has been and is that the Fourteenth Amendment, as a whole, malees the Bill of Rights applicable to the States.  This would certainly include the language of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, as well as the Due Process Clause.  For a more thorough exposition of my views against this approach to the Due Process Clause, see my concurring opinion in Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 174 .  See Murray’s Lessee v. Hoboken Land and Improvement Co., 18 How. 272, 276 .  28 Edw. 3 , c. 3 (1354).  See Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 10 ; Pointer v. Texas, <citedDecision>380 U. S. 400, 406</citedDecision> ; Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 464 .

 .  .  .” New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 280, 311 (dissenting opinion).  This Court, other courts, and the political process are available to correct any experiments in criminal procedure that prove fundamentally unfair to defendants.  That is not what is being done today: instead, and quite without reason, the Court has chosen to impose upon every State one means of trying criminal cases; it is a good means, but it is not the only fair means, and it is not demonstrably better than the alternatives States might devise.  I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.  See, e. g., my opinions in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643, 672 (dissenting); Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 44 (concurring); Malloy v.

North Carolina, 386 U. S. 213, 226 (concurring).  Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), held that the first eight Amendments restricted only federal action.  The locus classicus for this viewpoint is The Federalist No. 51 (Madison).  The Bill of Rights was opposed by Hamilton and other proponents of a strong central government.  See The Federalist No. 84; see generally C. Rossiter, 1787: The Grand Convention 284, 302-303.  In Barron v. Baltimore, supra, at 250 , Chief Justice Marshall said, “These amendments demanded security against the apprehended encroachments of the general government — not against those of the local governments.” Jaffe, Was Brandéis an Activist?
