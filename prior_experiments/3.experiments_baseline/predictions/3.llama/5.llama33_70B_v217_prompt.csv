Although the Target Case, Welch v. Texas Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 483 U.S. 468, is the one making this statement about Parden, the fact that it directly addresses and limits a previous case's holding and is itself mentioned as part of the discussion, indicates the court's willingness to reassess and correct previous decisions, implying that the Target Case itself is part of the evolving jurisprudence that may lead to the overruling of other cases. However, since the statement about overruling is directly related to Parden and not the Target Case, the key point here is the clear action of overruling taken by the Target Case towards another case, showing the court's trend. But most importantly, the passage does not overrule the Target Case itself but discusses its opinion as part of the reasoning.""
