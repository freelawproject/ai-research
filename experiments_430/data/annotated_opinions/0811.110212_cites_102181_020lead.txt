 Also rejected was the Government’s suggestion that the Court modify the privilege by vesting it in the witness-spouse, with freedom to testify or not independent of the defendant’s control.  The Court viewed this proposed modification as antithetical to the widespread belief, evidenced in the rules then in effect in a majority of the States and in England, “that the law should not force or encourage testimony which might alienate husband and wife, or further inflame existing domestic differences.” Id., at 79 .  Hawkins , then, left the federal privilege for adverse spousal testimony where it found it, continuing “a rule which bars the testimony of one spouse against the other unless both consent.” Id., at 78 .  Accord, Wyatt v. United States, 362 U. S. 525, 528 (1960).  7 However, in so doing, the Court made clear that its decision was not meant to “foreclose whatever changes in the rule may eventually be dictated by ‘reason and experience.’ ” 358 U. S., at 79 .  *47 III A The Federal Rules of Evidence acknowledge the authority of the federal courts to continue the evolutionary development of testimonial privileges in federal criminal trials “governed by the principles of the common law as they may be interpreted ... in the light of reason and experience.” Fed. Rule Evid. 501.  Cf. Wolfle v. United States, <citedDecision>291 U. S. 7, 12</citedDecision> (1934).  The general mandate of Rule 501 was substituted by the Congress for a set of privilege rules drafted by the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Rules of Evidence and approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States and by this Court. That proposal defined nine specific privileges, including a husband-wife privilege which would have codified the Hawkins rule and eliminated the privilege for confidential marital communications.  See proposed Fed. Rule Evid. 505.  In rejecting the proposed Rules and enacting Rule 501, Congress manifested an affirmative intention not to freeze the law of privilege.  Its purpose rather was to “provide the courts with the flexibility to develop rules of privilege on a case-by-case basis,” 120 Cong. Rec. 40891 (1974) (statement of Rep. Hungate), and to leave the door open to change.  See also S. Rep. No. 93-1277, p. 11 (1974); H. R. Rep. No. 93-650, p. 8 (1973).  8 Although Rule 501 confirms the authority of the federal courts to reconsider the continued validity of the Hawkins *48 rule, the long history of the privilege suggests that it ought not to be casually cast aside.

 In response to the question whether divorce was contemplated, Mrs. Trammel testified that her husband had said that “I would go my way and he would go his.” App. 27.  The Government represents to the Court that Elizabeth Trammel has not been prosecuted for her role in the conspiracy.  Roberts and Freeman were also convicted.  Roberts was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment.  Freeman received an indeterminate sentence under the Youth Corrections Act.  See Brosman, Edward Livingston and Spousal Testimony in Louisiana, 11 Tulane L. Rev. 243 (1937); Hutchins & Slesinger, Some Observations *45 on the Law of Evidence: Family Relations, 13 Minn. L. Rev. 675 (1929); Note, 24 Calif. L. Rev. 472 (1936); Note, 35 Mich. L. Rev. 329 (1936); Note, 10 So. Cal. L. Rev. 94 (1936); Note, 20 Minn. L. Rev. 693 (1936).  This Court recognized just such a confidential marital communications privilege in Wolfle v. United States, <citedDecision>291 U. S. 7</citedDecision> (1934), and in Blau v. United States, 340 U. S. 332 (1951).  In neither case, however, did the Court adopt the Wigmore view that the communications privilege be substituted in place of the privilege against adverse spousal testimony.  The privilege as to confidential marital communications is not at issue in the instant case; accordingly, our holding today does not disturb Wolfie and Blau .  See Note, Competency of One Spouse to Testify Against the Other in *46 Criminal Cases Where the Testimony Does Not Relate to Confidential Communications: Modern Trend, 38 Va. L. Rev. 359 (1952).  The decision in Wyatt recognized an exception to Hawkins for cases in which one spouse commits a crime against the other.  362 U. S., at 526 .  This exception, placed on the ground of necessity, was a longstanding one at common law. See Lord Audley’s Case, 123 Eng. Rep. 1140 (1631); 8 Wigmore §2239.
