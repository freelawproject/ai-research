 Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, 341 U. S. 593 (1951), involved restrictive horizontal agree *765 ments between an American corporation and two foreign corporations in which it owned 30 and 50 percent interests respectively.  The Timken Court cited Kiefer Stewart to show that “[t]he fact that there is common ownership or control of the contracting corporations does not liberate them from the impact of the antitrust laws.” 341 U. S., at 598 .  But the relevance of this statement is unclear.  The American defendant in Timken did not own a majority interest in either of the foreign corporate conspirators and, as the District Court found, it did not control them.  10 Moreover, as in Yellow Cab, there was evidence that the stock acquisitions were themselves designed to effectuate restrictive practices.  11 The Court’s reliance on the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine was in no way necessary to the result.  The same is true of Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., <citedDecision>392 U. S. 134</citedDecision> (1968), which involved a conspiracy among a parent corporation and three subsidiaries to impose various illegal restrictions on plaintiff franchisees.  The Court did suggest that, because the defendants “availed themselves of the privilege of doing business through separate corporations, the fact of common own *766 ership could not save them from any of the obligations that the law imposes on separate entities [citing Yellow Cab and <citedDecision>Timken].” Id., at 141-142</citedDecision> .  But the Court noted immediately thereafter that “[i]n any event” each plaintiff could “clearly” charge a combination between itself and the defendants or between the defendants and other franchise dealers.  <citedDecision>Ibid.</citedDecision> Thus, for the same reason that a finding of liability in Kiefer-Stewart could today be justified without reference to the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, see n. 9, supra, the doctrine was at most only an alternative holding in Perma Life Mufflers.  In short, while this Court has previously seemed to acquiesce in the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine, it has never explored or analyzed in detail the justifications for such a rule; the doctrine has played only a relatively minor role in the Court’s Sherman Act holdings.  III Petitioners, joined by the United States as amicus curiae, urge us to repudiate the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine.  12 The central criticism is that the doctrine gives undue significance to the fact that a subsidiary is separately incorporated and thereby treats as the concerted activity of two *767 entities what is really unilateral behavior flowing from decisions of a single enterprise.  We limit our inquiry to the narrow issue squarely presented: whether a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary are capable of conspiring in violation of § 1 of the Sherman Act.  We do not consider under what circumstances, if any, a parent may be liable for conspiring with an affiliated corporation it does not completely own.  A The Sherman Act contains a “basic distinction between concerted and independent action.” Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp., 465 U. S. 752, 761 (1984).

 Followed by the Seventh Circuit below as well as by other Courts of Appeals,- this test sets forth various criteria for evaluating whether a given parent and subsidiary are capable of conspiring with each other.  See n. 2, supra; see generally Ogilvie v. Fotomat Corp., 641 F. 2d 581 (CA8 1981); Las Vegas Sun, Inc. v. Summa Corp., 610 F. 2d 614 (CA9 1979), cert. denied, 447 U. S. 906 (1980); Photovest Corp. v. Fotomat Corp., 606 F. 2d 704 (CA7 1979), cert. denied, 445 U. S. 917 (1980).  These criteria measure the “separateness” of the subsidiary: whether it has separate control of its day-to-day operations, separate officers, separate corporate headquarters, and so forth.  At least when a subsidiary is wholly owned, however, these factors are not sufficient to describe a separate economic entity for purposes of the Sherman Act.  The factors simply describe the manner in which the parent chooses to structure a subunit of itself.  They cannot overcome the basic fact that the ultimate interests of the subsidiary and the parent are identical, so the parent and the subsidiary must be viewed as a single economic unit.  Because an “agreement” between a parent and its wholly owned subsidiary is no more likely to be anticompetitive than an agreement between two divisions of a single corporation, it does not matter that the parent “availed [itself] of the privilege of doing business through separate corporations,” Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., <citedDecision>392 U. S. 134,141</citedDecision> (1968).  The purposeful choice of a parent corporation to organize a subunit as a subsidiary is not itself a reason to heighten antitrust scrutiny, because it is not laden with anticompetitive risk.  For example, “[separate incorporation may reduce federal or state taxes or facilitate compliance with regulatory or reporting laws.  Local incorporation may also improve local identification.  Investors or lenders may prefer to specialize in a particular aspect of a conglomerate’s business.  Different parts of the business may require different pension or profit-sharing plans or different accounting practices.” Areeda, 97 Harv. L. Rev., at 453.  Sunkist Growers provides strong support for the notion that separate incorporation does not necessarily imply a capacity to conspire.
