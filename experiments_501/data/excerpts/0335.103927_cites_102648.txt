**Combined Opinion**
 Ordinarily we do not, in admiralty, more than in other *99 cases, review the concurrent findings of fact of two courts below.  The Carib Prince, 170 U. S. 655, 658 ; The Wildcroft, 201 U. S. 378, 387 ; Luckenbach v. McCahan Sugar Co., supra; Piedmont Coal Co. v. Seaboard Fisheries Co., 254 U. S. 1, 13 ; Just v. Chambers, 312 U. S. 383, 385 .  Here, however, both courts below, holding themselves bound by The Pinar Del Rio, supra, have, on the facts found, held as a matter of law that the staging was seaworthy despite its defect.  That conclusion of law is reviewable here.  Until the enactment of the Jones Act, 41 Stat. 1007 , 46 U. S. C. § 688 , the maritime law afforded no remedy by way of indemnity beyond maintenance and cure, for the injury to a seaman caused by the mere negligence of a ship’s officer or member of the crew.  But the admiralty rule that the vessel and owner are liable to indemnify a seaman for injury caused by unseaworthiness of the vessel or its appurtenant appliances and equipment, has been the settled law since this Court’s ruling to that effect in The Osceola, supra, 175 .  Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co., 247 U. S. 372, 380-381 ; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, 259 U. S. 255, 258-260 ; Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, 278 U. S. 130, 134 ; Cortes v. Baltimore Insular Line, 287 U. S. 367, 370-371 ; Warner v. Goltra, 293 U. S. 155, 158 ; The Arizona v. Anelich, <citedDecision>298 U. S. 110</citedDecision> , 120 et seq.; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, supra, 428-429 ; O’Donnell v. Great Lakes Co., 318 U. S. 36, 40 .  The latter rule seems to have been derived from the seaman’s privilege to abandon a ship improperly fitted out, and was generally applied, before its statement in The Osceola, supra, by numerous decisions of the lower federal courts during the last century.  See <citedDecision>The Arizona</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>
   Anelich, supra,
  
  121</citedDecision> , footnote 2.  This was a recognized departure from the rule of the English law, which allowed no recovery other than maintenance and cure for injuries caused by unseaworthiness, Couch v. Steel, 3 El.  & Bl. 402, until the enactment of the *100 Merchant Shipping Act of 1876, 39 & 40 Vict., Chap. 80, § 5, reenacted by the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, 57 & 58 Vict., Chap. 60, § 458.  By that statute there is annexed to every contract of service between the owner of a ship or the master and any seaman thereof, an obligation that all reasonable means be used to insure the seaworthiness of the ship before and during the voyage.  See Hedley v. Pinkney & Sons S. S. Co., [1894] A. C. 222.  In a number of cases in the federal courts, decided before The Osceola, supra, the right of the seaman to recover for injuries caused by unseaworthiness seems to have been rested on the negligent failure, usually by the seaman’s officers or fellow seamen, to supply seaworthy appliances.  The Noddleburn, 28 F. 855 , aff’d, 30 F. 142 ; The Neptuno, 30 F. 925 ; The Frank and Willie, 45 F. 494 ; The Julia Fowler, 49 F. 277 ; William Johnson & Co. v. Johansen, 86 F. 886 ; and see The Columbia, 124 F. 745 ; The Lyndhurst, 149 F. 900 .  But later cases in this and other federal courts have followed the ruling of The Osceola, supra, that the exercise of due diligence does not relieve the owner of his obligation to the seaman to furnish adequate appliances.  2 Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, 259-260 ; <citedDecision>The Arizona</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Anelich, supra,</citedDecision> 120 et seq.; Beadle v. Spencer, 298 U. S. 124, 128-129 ; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, supra, 428-429, 432 ; The H. A. Scandrett, 87 F. 2d 708 , 710-711; cf. The Edwin I.  Morrison, 153 U. S. 199, 210 .  If the owner is liable for furnishing an unseaworthy appliance, even when he is not negligent, a fortiori his obligation is unaffected by the fact that the negligence of the officers of the vessel contributed to its unseaworthiness.  *101 It is true that before the Jones Act the owner was, in other respects, not responsible for injuries to a seaman caused by the negligence of officers or members of the crew.  But this is not sufficient to insulate the owner from liability for their negligent failure to furnish seaworthy appliances, see Judge Addison Brown, in The Frank and Willie, supra, 495-497; Carlisle Packing Co. v. Sandanger, supra, 259-260 , more than their negligence relieves him from his liability for maintenance and cure.  The Osceola, supra, 175 ; Pacific S. S. Co. v. Peterson, supra, 134 ; Calmar S. S. Corp. v. Taylor, 303 U. S. 525, 527 .  It required the Harter Act to relax the exacting obligation to cargo of the owner’s warranty of seaworthiness of ship and tackle.
**Combined Opinion**
 It was unseaworthy in the sense that it was inadequate for the purpose for which it was ordinarily used, because of the defective rope with which it was rigged.  Its inadequacy rendered it unseaworthy, whether the mate’s failure to observe the defect was negligent or unavoidable.  Had it been adequate, petitioner would not have been injured and his injury was the proximate and immediate consequence of the unseaworthiness.  See The Osceola, supra, 174-175 , and cases cited.  Any negligence of the mate in selecting the rope and ordering its use as a part of the staging, or of the boatswain in using it for that purpose, could not relieve respondent of the duty to furnish a seaworthy staging.  Whether petitioner knew of the defective condition of the rope does not appear, but in any case the seaman, in the performance of his duties, is not deemed to assume the risk of unseaworthy appliances.  <citedDecision>The Arizona</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>
   Anelich, supra,
  
  123-124</citedDecision> ; Beadle v. Spencer, supra, 129-130 ; Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, supra. Nor does the fact that there was sound rope on board, which might have been used to rig a safe staging, afford an excuse to the owner for the failure to provide a safe one.  We have often had occasion to emphasize the conditions of the seaman’s employment, see Socony-Vacuum Co. v. Smith, supra, 430-431 and cases cited, which have been deemed to make him a ward of the admiralty and to place large responsibility for his safety on the owner.  He is subject to the rigorous discipline of the sea, and all the conditions of his service constrain him to accept, without critical examination and without protest, working conditions and appliances as commanded by his superior officers.  These conditions, which have generated the exacting re *104 quirement that the vessel or the owner must provide the seaman with seaworthy appliances with which to do his work, likewise require that safe appliances be furnished when and where the work is to be done.  For, as was said in The Osceola, supra, 175 , the owner’s obligation is “to supply and keep in order the proper appliances appurtenant to the ship.” (Italics supplied.) It is not enough that the “Wichita Falls” had on board sound rope which could have been used to make the staging seaworthy, if in fact the staging was unsafe because sound rope was not used.
