<p id="b293-5">In this case we re-examine the holding of <em>Sinclair Refining Co. </em>v. <em>Atkinson, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106432"><a href="/opinion/106432/sinclair-refining-co-v-atkinson/" aria-description="Citation for case: Sinclair Refining Co. v.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, considering itself bound by <em>Sinclair, </em>reversed the grant by the District Court for the Central District of California of petitioner’s prayer for injunctive relief. <span class="citation" data-id="286617"><a href="/opinion/286617/the-boys-markets-inc-v-retail-clerks-union-local-770/" aria-description="Citation for case: The Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerk&#x27;s Union, Local 770">416 F. 2d 368</a></span> (1969). We granted certiorari. <span class="citation multiple-matches"><a href="/c/U.%20S./396/1000/">396 U. S. 1000</a></span> (1970). Having concluded that <em>Sinclair </em>was erroneously decided and that subsequent events have undermined its continuing validity, we overrule that decision and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<p id="b294-4">I</p>
<p id="b294-5">In February 1969, at the time of the incidents that produced this litigation, petitioner and respondent were parties to a collective-bargaining agreement which provided, <em>inter alia, </em>that all controversies concerning its interpretation or application should be resolved by adjustment and arbitration procedures set forth therein<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that, during the life of the contract, there should <page-number citation-index="1" label="239">*239</page-number>be “no cessation or stoppage of work, lock-out, picketing or boycotts . <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The dispute arose when petitioner’s frozen foods supervisor and certain members of his crew who were not members of the bargaining unit began to rearrange merchandise in the frozen food cases of one of petitioner’s supermarkets. A union representative insisted that the food cases be stripped of all merchandise and be restocked by union personnel. When petitioner did not accede to the union’s demand, a strike was called and the union began to picket petitioner’s establishment. Thereupon petitioner demanded that the union cease the work stoppage and picketing and sought to invoke the grievance and arbitration procedures specified in the contract.</p>
<p id="b295-5">The following day, since the strike had not been terminated, petitioner filed a complaint in California <page-number citation-index="1" label="240">*240</page-number>Superior Court seeking a temporary restraining order, a preliminary and permanent injunction, and specific performance of the contractual arbitration provision. The state court issued a temporary restraining order forbidding continuation of the strike and also an order to show cause why a preliminary injunction should not be granted. Shortly thereafter, the union removed the case to the Federal District Court and there made a motion to quash the state court’s temporary restraining order. In opposition, petitioner moved for an order compelling arbitration and enjoining continuation of the strike. Concluding that the dispute was subject to arbitration under the collective-bargaining agreement and that the strike was in violation of the contract, the District Court ordered the parties to arbitrate the underlying dispute and simultaneously enjoined the strike, all picketing in the vicinity of petitioner’s supermarket, and any attempts by the union to induce the employees to strike or to refuse to perform their services.</p>
<p id="b296-4">II</p>
<p id="b296-5">At the outset, we are met with respondent’s contention that <em>Sinclair </em>ought not to be disturbed because the decision turned on a question of statutory construction which Congress can alter at any time. Since Congress has not modified our conclusions in <em>Sinclair, </em>even though it has been urged to do so,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> respondent argues that principles of <em>stare decisis </em>should govern the present case.</p>
<p id="b296-6">We do not agree that the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>bars a re-examination of <em>Sinclair </em>in the circumstances of this case. We fully recognize that important policy considerations militate in favor of continuity and predictability in the law. Nevertheless, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter <page-number citation-index="1" label="241">*241</page-number>wrote for the Court, <em>“[Sitare decisis </em>is a principle of policy and not a mechanical formula of adherence to the latest decision, however recent and questionable, when such adherence involves collision with a prior doctrine more embracing in its scope, intrinsically sounder, and verified by experience.” <em>Helvering </em>v. <em>Hallock, </em><span class="citation" data-id="103292"><a href="/opinion/103292/helvering-v-hallock/#119" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v. Hallock">309 U. S. 106, 119</a></span> (1940). See <em>Swift </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Wickham, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107115"><a href="/opinion/107115/swift-co-v-wickham/#116" aria-description="Citation for case: Swift &amp; Co. v. Wickham">382 U. S. 111, 116</a></span> (1965). It is precisely because <em>Sinclair </em>stands as a significant departure from our otherwise consistent emphasis upon the congressional policy to promote the peaceful settlement of labor disputes through arbitration <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and our efforts to accommodate and harmonize this policy with those underlying the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that we believe <em>Sinclair </em>should be reconsidered. Furthermore, in light of developments subsequent to <em>Sinclair, </em>in particular our decision in <em>Avco Corp. </em>v. <em>Aero Lodge 735, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107655"><a href="/opinion/107655/avco-corp-v-aero-lodge-no-735-international-assn-of-machinists/" aria-description="Citation for case: Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, International Ass&#x27;n of...">390 U. S. 557</a></span> (1968), it has become clear that the <em>Sinclair </em>decision does not further but rather frustrates realization of an important goal of our national labor policy.</p>
<p id="b297-4">Nor can we agree that conclusive weight should be accorded to the failure of Congress to respond to <em>Sinclair </em>on the theory that congressional silence should be interpreted as acceptance of the decision. The Court has cautioned that “[i]t is at best treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law.” <em>Girouard </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="104285"><a href="/opinion/104285/girouard-v-united-states/#69" aria-description="Citation for case: Girouard v. United States">328 U. S. 61, 69</a></span> <page-number citation-index="1" label="242">*242</page-number>(1946). Therefore, in the absence of any persuasive circumstances evidencing a clear design that congressional inaction be taken as acceptance of <em>Sinclair, </em>the mere silence of Congress is not a sufficient reason for refusing to reconsider the decision. <em><span class="citation" data-id="103292"><a href="/opinion/103292/helvering-v-hallock/" aria-description="Citation for case: Helvering v.

<p id="b298-7">From the time <em>Textile Workers Union </em>v. <em>Lincoln Mills, </em><span class="citation" data-id="105511"><a href="/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/" aria-description="Citation for case: Textile Workers v.

Lincoln Mills of Ala.">Lincoln Mills</a></span> </em>held generally that “the substantive law to apply in suits under § 301 (a) is federal law, which the courts must fashion from the policy of our national labor laws,” <span class="citation" data-id="105511"><a href="/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/#456" aria-description="Citation for case: Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.">353 U. S., at 456</a></span>, and more specifically that a union can obtain specific performance of an employer’s promise to arbitrate grievances. We rejected the contention that the anti-injunction proscriptions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act prohibited this type of relief, noting that a refusal to arbitrate was not “part and parcel of the abuses against which the Act was aimed,” <span class="citation" data-id="105511"><a href="/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/#458" aria-description="Citation for case: Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala."><em>id., </em>at 458</a></span>, and that the Act itself manifests a policy determination that arbitration should be encouraged. See <span class="citation no-link">29 U. S. C. § 108</span>.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Subsequently in the <em>Steelworkers </em><page-number citation-index="1" label="243">*243</page-number>Trilogy<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we emphasized the importance of arbitration as an instrument of federal policy for resolving disputes between labor and management and cautioned the lower courts against usurping the functions of the arbitrator.</p>
<p id="b299-4">Serious questions remained, however, concerning the role that state courts were to play in suits involving collective-bargaining agreements. Confronted with some of these problems in <em>Charles Dowd Box Co. </em>v. <em>Courtney, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106336"><a href="/opinion/106336/charles-dowd-box-co-v-courtney/" aria-description="Citation for case: Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney">368 U. S. 502</a></span> (1962), we held that Congress clearly intended <em>not </em>to disturb the pre-existing jurisdiction of the state courts over suits for violations of collective-bargaining agreements. We noted that the</p>
<blockquote id="b299-5">“clear implication of the entire record of the congressional debates in both 1946 and 1947 is that the purpose of conferring jurisdiction upon the federal district courts was not to displace, but to supplement, the thoroughly considered jurisdiction of the courts of the various States over contracts made by labor organizations.” <span class="citation" data-id="106336"><a href="/opinion/106336/charles-dowd-box-co-v-courtney/#511" aria-description="Citation for case: Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney"><em>Id., </em>at 511</a></span>.</blockquote>
<p id="b299-6">Shortly after the decision in <em>Dowd Box, </em>we sustained, in <em>Teamsters Local 174 </em>v. <em>Lucas Flour Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="106354"><a href="/opinion/106354/local-174-teamsters-chauffeurs-warehousemen-helpers-v-lucas-flour-co/" aria-description="Citation for case: Local 174, Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen &amp; Helpers...">369 U. S. 95</a></span> (1962), an award of damages by a state court to an employer for a breach by the union of a no-strike provision in its contract.. While emphasizing that “in enacting § 301 Congress intended doctrines of federal labor law uniformly to prevail over inconsistent local rules,” <em>id., </em>at 104, we did not consider the applicability of the Norris-LaGuardia Act to state court proceedings because the employer’s prayer for relief sought only <page-number citation-index="1" label="244">*244</page-number>damages and not specific performance of a no-strike obligation.</p>
<p id="b300-4">Subsequent to the decision in <em>Sinclair, </em>we held in <em>Avco Corp. </em>v. <em>Aero Lodge <span class="citation" data-id="107655"><a href="/opinion/107655/avco-corp-v-aero-lodge-no-735-international-assn-of-machinists/" aria-description="Citation for case: Avco Corp. v.

S. C. § 1441</span>. In so holding, however, the Court expressly left open the questions whether state courts are bound by the anti-injunction proscriptions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and whether federal courts, after removal of a § 301 (a) action, are required to dissolve any injunctive relief previously granted by the state courts. See generally <em>General Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union 191, </em><span class="citation" data-id="285790"><a href="/opinion/285790/general-electric-company-v-local-union-191-affiliated-with-international/" aria-description="Citation for case: General Electric Company v.

Three Justices who concurred expressed the view that <em>Sinclair </em>should be reconsidered “upon an appropriate future occasion.” <span class="citation" data-id="107655"><a href="/opinion/107655/avco-corp-v-aero-lodge-no-735-international-assn-of-machinists/#562" aria-description="Citation for case: Avco Corp. v.

<p id="b300-5">The decision in <em>Avco, </em>viewed in the context of <em><span class="citation" data-id="105511"><a href="/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/" aria-description="Citation for case: Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.">Lincoln Mills</a></span> </em>and its progeny, has produced an anomalous situation which, in our view, makes urgent the reconsideration of <em>Sinclair. </em>The principal practical effect of <em>Avco </em>and <em>Sinclair </em>taken together is nothing less than to oust state courts of jurisdiction in § 301 (a) suits where injunc-<page-number citation-index="1" label="245">*245</page-number>tive relief is sought for breach of a no-strike obligation. Union defendants can, as a matter of course, obtain removal to a federal court,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and there is obviously a compelling incentive for them to do so in order to gain the advantage of the strictures upon injunctive relief which <em>Sinclair </em>imposes on federal courts. The sanctioning of this practice, however, is wholly inconsistent with our conclusion in <em>Dowd Box </em>that the congressional purpose embodied in § 301 (a) was to <em>supplement, </em>and not to encroach upon, the pre-existing jurisdiction of the state courts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is ironic indeed that the very provision that Congress clearly intended to provide additional remedies for breach of collective-bargaining agreements has been employed to displace previously existing state remedies. We are not at liberty thus to depart from the clearly expressed congressional policy to the contrary.</p>
<p id="b301-4">On the other hand, to the extent that widely disparate remedies theoretically remain available in state, as opposed to federal, courts, the federal policy of labor law <page-number citation-index="1" label="246">*246</page-number>uniformity elaborated in <em>Lucas Flour Co., </em>is seriously offended. This policy, of course, could hardly require, as a practical matter, that labor law be administered identically in all courts, for undoubtedly a certain diversity exists among the state and federal systems in matters of procedural and remedial detail, a fact that Congress evidently took into account in deciding not to disturb the traditional jurisdiction of the States. The injunction, however, is so important a remedial device, particularly in the arbitration context, that its availability or nonavailability in various courts will not only produce rampant forum shopping and maneuvering from one court to another but will also greatly frustrate any relative uniformity in the enforcement of arbitration agreements.</p>
<p id="b302-4">Furthermore, the existing scheme, with the injunction remedy technically available in the state courts but rendered inefficacious by the removal device, assigns to removal proceedings a totally unintended function. While the underlying purposes of Congress in providing for federal question removal jurisdiction remain somewhat obscure,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> there has never been a serious contention that Congress intended that the removal mechanism be utilized to foreclose completely remedies otherwise available in the state courts. Although federal question removal jurisdiction may well have been intended to provide a forum for the protection of federal rights where such protection was deemed necessary or to encourage the development of expertise by the federal courts in the <page-number citation-index="1" label="247">*247</page-number>interpretation of federal law, there is no indication that Congress intended by the removal mechanism to effect a wholesale dislocation in the allocation of judicial business between the state and federal courts. Cf. <em>City of Greenwood </em>v. <em>Peacock, </em><span class="citation" data-id="107264"><a href="/opinion/107264/city-of-greenwood-v-peacock/" aria-description="Citation for case: City of Greenwood v. Peacock">384 U. S. 808</a></span> (1966).</p>
<p id="b303-4">It is undoubtedly true that each of the foregoing objections to <em>Sinclair-Avco </em>could be remedied either by overruling <em>Sinclair </em>or by extending that decision to the States. While some commentators have suggested that the solution to the present unsatisfactory situation does lie in the extension of the <em>Sinclair </em>prohibition to state court proceedings,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> we agree with Chief Justice Traynor of the California Supreme Court that “whether or not Congress could deprive state courts of the power to give such [injunctive] remedies when enforcing collective bargaining agreements, it has not attempted to do so either in the Norris-LaGuardia Act or section 301.” <em>McCarroll </em>v. <em>Los Angeles County Dist.

<p id="b303-5">An additional reason for not resolving the existing dilemma by extending <em>Sinclair </em>to the States is the devastating implications for the enforceability of arbitration agreements and their accompanying no-strike obligations if equitable remedies were not available.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As we have <page-number citation-index="1" label="248">*248</page-number>previously indicated, a no-strike obligation, express or implied, is the <em>quid pro quo </em>for an undertaking by the employer to submit grievance disputes to the process of arbitration. See <em><span class="citation" data-id="105511"><a href="/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/" aria-description="Citation for case: Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.">Textile Workers Union</a></span> </em>v. <span class="citation" data-id="105511"><a href="/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/#455" aria-description="Citation for case: Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala."><em>Lincoln Mills, supra, </em>at 455</a></span>.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Any incentive for employers to enter into such an arrangement is necessarily dissipated if the principal and most expeditious method by which the no-strike obligation can be enforced is eliminated. While it is of course true, as respondent contends, that other avenues of redress, such as an action for damages, would remain open to an aggrieved employer, an award of damages after a dispute has been settled is no substitute for an immediate halt to an illegal strike. Furthermore, an action for damages prosecuted during or after a labor dispute would only tend to aggravate industrial strife and delay an early resolution of the difficulties between employer and union.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b305-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="249">*249</page-number>Even if management is not encouraged by the unavailability of the injunction remedy to resist arbitration agreements, the fact remains that the effectiveness of such agreements would be greatly reduced if injunctive relief were withheld. Indeed, the very purpose of arbitration procedures is to provide a mechanism for the expeditious settlement of industrial disputes without resort to strikes, lockouts, or other self-help measures. This basic purpose is obviously largely undercut if there is no immediate, effective remedy for those very tactics that arbitration is designed to obviate. Thus, because <em>Sinclair, </em>in the aftermath of <em>Avco, </em>casts serious doubt upon the effective enforcement of a vital element of stable labor-management relations — arbitration agreements with their attendant no-strike obligations — we conclude that <em>Sinclair </em>does not make a viable contribution to federal labor policy.</p>
<p id="b305-4">IV</p>
<p id="b305-5">We have also determined that the dissenting opinion in <em>Sinclair </em>states the correct principles concerning the accommodation necessary between the seemingly absolute terms of the Norris-LaGuardia Act and the policy considerations underlying § 301 (a).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <span class="citation" data-id="106432"><a href="/opinion/106432/sinclair-refining-co-v-atkinson/#215" aria-description="Citation for case: Sinclair Refining Co. v.

S., at 215</a></span>. <page-number citation-index="1" label="250">*250</page-number>Although we need not repeat all that was there said, a few points should be emphasized at this time.</p>
<p id="b306-6">The literal terms of § 4 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act must be accommodated to the subsequently enacted provisions of § 301 (a) of the Labor Management Relations Act and the purposes of arbitration. Statutory interpretation requires more than concentration upon isolated words; rather, consideration must be given to the total corpus of pertinent law and the policies that inspired ostensibly inconsistent provisions. See <em>Richards </em>v. <em>United States, </em><span class="citation" data-id="106345"><a href="/opinion/106345/richards-v-united-states/#11" aria-description="Citation for case: Richards v.

Hutcheson">312 U. S. 219, 235</a></span> (1941).</p>
<p id="b306-7">The Norris-LaGuardia Act was responsive to a situation totally different from that which exists today. In the early part of this century, the federal courts generally were regarded as allies of management in its attempt to prevent the organization and strengthening of labor unions; and in this industrial struggle the injunction became a potent weapon that was wielded against the activities of labor groups.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The result was a large number of sweeping decrees, often issued <em>ex parte, </em>drawn on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis without regard to any systematic elaboration of national labor policy. See <em>Drivers’ Union </em>v. <em>Lake Valley Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="103386"><a href="/opinion/103386/milk-wagon-drivers-union-local-no-753-v-lake-valley-farm-products-inc/#102" aria-description="Citation for case: Milk Wagon Drivers&#x27; Union, Local No. 753 v. Lake Valley...">311 U. S. 91, 102</a></span> (1940).</p>
<p id="b307-3"><page-number citation-index="1" label="251">*251</page-number>In 1932 Congress attempted to bring some order out of the industrial chaos that had developed and to correct the abuses that had resulted from the interjection 6f the federal judiciary into union-management disputes on the behalf of management. See declaration of public policy, Norris-LaGuardia Act, § 2, <span class="citation no-link">47 Stat. 70</span>. Congress, therefore, determined initially to limit severely the power of the federal courts to issue injunctions “in any case involving or growing out of any labor dispute . . . § 4, <span class="citation no-link">47 Stat. 70</span>. Even as initially enacted, however, the prohibition against federal injunctions was by no means absolute. See Norris-LaGuardia Act, §§ 7, 8, 9, <span class="citation no-link">47 Stat. 71</span>, 72. Shortly thereafter Congress passed the Wagner Act,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> designed to curb various management activities that tended to discourage employee participation in collective action.</p>
<p id="b307-5">As labor organizations grew in strength and developed toward maturity, congressional emphasis shifted from protection of the nascent labor movement to the encouragement of collective bargaining and to administrative techniques for the peaceful resolution of industrial disputes. This shift in emphasis was accomplished, however, without extensive revision of many of the older enactments, including the anti-injunction section of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Thus it became the task of the courts to accommodate, to reconcile the older statutes with the more recent ones.</p>
<p id="b307-6">A leading example of this accommodation process is <em>Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen </em>v. <em>Chicago River </em>&amp; <em>Ind. R. Co., </em><span class="citation" data-id="105482"><a href="/opinion/105482/brotherhood-of-railroad-trainmen-v-chicago-river-indiana-railroad/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp;...">353 U. S. 30</a></span> (1957). There we were confronted with a peaceful strike which violated the statutory duty to arbitrate imposed by the Railway Labor Act. The Court concluded that a strike in violation of a statutory arbitration duty was not the type of situa<page-number citation-index="1" label="252">*252</page-number>tion to which the Norris-LaGuardia Act was responsive, that an important federal policy was involved in the peaceful settlement of disputes through the statutorily mandated arbitration procedure, that this important policy was imperiled if equitable remedies were not available to implement it, and hence that Norris-LaGuardia’s policy of nonintervention by the federal courts should yield to the overriding interest in the successful implementation of the arbitration process.</p>
<p id="b308-4">The principles elaborated in <em><span class="citation" data-id="105482"><a href="/opinion/105482/brotherhood-of-railroad-trainmen-v-chicago-river-indiana-railroad/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v.

To be sure, <em><span class="citation" data-id="105482"><a href="/opinion/105482/brotherhood-of-railroad-trainmen-v-chicago-river-indiana-railroad/" aria-description="Citation for case: Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v. Chicago River &amp;...">Chicago River</a></span> </em>involved arbitration procedures established by statute. However, we have frequently noted, in such cases as <em><span class="citation" data-id="105511"><a href="/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/" aria-description="Citation for case: Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.">Lincoln Mills</a></span>, </em>the <em>Steelworkers Trilogy, </em>and <em>Lucas Flour, </em>the importance that Congress has attached generally to the voluntary settlement of labor disputes without resort to self-help and more particularly to arbitration as a means to this end. Indeed, it has been stated that <em><span class="citation" data-id="105511"><a href="/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/" aria-description="Citation for case: Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills of Ala.">Lincoln Mills</a></span>, </em>in its exposition of § 301 (a), “went a long way towards making arbitration the central institution in the administration of collective bargaining contracts.” <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b308-5">The <em>Sinclair </em>decision, however, seriously undermined the effectiveness of the arbitration technique as a method peacefully to resolve industrial disputes without resort to strikes, lockouts, and similar devices. Clearly employers will be wary of assuming obligations to arbitrate specifically enforceable against them when no similarly efficacious remedy is available to enforce the concomitant undertaking of the union to refrain from striking. On the other hand, the central purpose of the Norris-LaGuar-dia Act to foster the growth and viability of labor organizations is hardly retarded — if anything, this goal is advanced — by a remedial device that merely enforces the obligation that the union freely undertook under <page-number citation-index="1" label="253">*253</page-number>a specifically enforceable agreement to submit disputes to arbitration.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that the unavailability of equitable relief in the arbitration context presents a serious impediment to the congressional policy favoring the voluntary establishment of a mechanism for the peaceful resolution of labor disputes, that the core purpose of the Norris-LaGuardia Act is not sacrificed by the limited use of equitable remedies to further this important policy, and consequently that the Norris-LaGuardia Act does not bar the granting of injunctive relief in the circumstances of the instant case.</p>
<p id="b309-4">V</p>
<p id="b309-5">Our holding in the present case is a narrow one. We do not undermine the vitality of the Norris-LaGuardia Act. We deal only with the situation in which a collective-bargaining contract contains a mandatory grievance adjustment or arbitration procedure. Nor does it follow from what we have said that injunctive relief is appro<page-number citation-index="1" label="254">*254</page-number>priate as a matter of course in every case of a strike over an arbitrable grievance. The dissenting opinion in <em>Sinclair </em>suggested the following principles for the guidance of the district courts in determining whether to grant injunctive relief — principles that we now adopt:</p>
<blockquote id="b310-6">“A District Court entertaining an action under § 301 may not grant injunctive relief against concerted activity unless and until it decides that the case is one in which an injunction would be appropriate despite the Norris-LaGuardia Act. When a strike is sought to be enjoined because it is over a grievance which both parties are contractually bound to arbitrate, the District Court may issue no injunc-tive order until it first holds that the contract <em>does </em>have that effect; and the employer should be ordered to arbitrate, as a condition of his obtaining an injunction against the strike. Beyond this, the District Court must, of course, consider whether issuance of an injunction would be warranted under ordinary principles of equity — whether breaches are occurring and will continue, or have been threatened and will be committed; whether they have caused or will cause irreparable injury to the employer; and whether the employer will suffer more from the denial of an injunction than will the union from its issuance.” <span class="citation" data-id="106432"><a href="/opinion/106432/sinclair-refining-co-v-atkinson/#228" aria-description="Citation for case: Sinclair Refining Co. v. Atkinson">370 U. S., at 228</a></span>. (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>
<p id="b310-7">In the present case there is no dispute that the grievance in question was subject to adjustment and arbitration under the collective-bargaining agreement and that the petitioner was ready to proceed with arbitration at the time an injunction against the strike was sought and obtained. The District Court also concluded that, by reason of respondent’s violations of its no-strike obligation, petitioner “has suffered irreparable injury and will continue to suffer irreparable injury.” Since we now <page-number citation-index="1" label="255">*255</page-number>overrule <em>Sinclair, </em>the holding of the Court of Appeals in reliance on <em>Sinclair </em>must be reversed. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case with directions to enter a judgment affirming the order of the District Court.</p>
