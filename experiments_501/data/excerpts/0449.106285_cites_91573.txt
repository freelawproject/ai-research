 .  .  were such as to 'offend “a sense of justice,” ’ ” but the court found determinative the fact that the evidence had not been taken “from defendant’s person by the use of brutal or offensive physical force against defendant.” 170 Ohio St., at 431, 166 N. E. 2d, at 389-390.  The State says that even if the’ search were made without authority, or otherwise unreasonably, it is not prevented from using the unconstitutionally seized evidence at trial, citing Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 (1949), in which this Court did indeed hold “that in a prosecution in a State court for a State crime the Fourteenth Amend *646 ment does not forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure.” At p. 33.  On this appeal, of which we have noted probable jurisdiction, 364 U. S. 868 , it is urged once again that we review that holding.  3 I.  Seventy-five years ago, in Boyd v. United States, <citedDecision>116 U. S. 616, 630</citedDecision> (1886), considering the Fourth 4 and Fifth Amendments as running “almost into each other” 5 on the facts before it, this Court held that the doctrines of those Amendments “apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employés of the sanctity of a man’s home and the privacies of life. It is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, *647 that constitutes the essence of the offence; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private property .... Breaking into a house and opening boxes and drawers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man’s own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime or to forfeit his goods, is within the condemnation ... [of those Amendments].” The Court noted that “constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed.  .  .  .  It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon.” At p. 635.  In this jealous regard for maintaining the integrity of individual rights, the Court gave life to Madison’s prediction that “independent tribunals of justice .  .  .  will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights.” I Annals of Cong. 439 (1789).  Concluding, the Court specifically referred to the use of the evidence there seized as “unconstitutional.” At p. 638.  Less than 30 years after <citedDecision>Boyd</citedDecision> , this Court, in Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 (1914), stated that “the Fourth Amendment .  .  .  put the courts of the United States and Federal officials, in the exercise of their power and authority, under limitations and restraints [and] .  .  .  forever secure [d] the people, their persons, houses, papers and effects against all unreasonable searches and seizures under the guise of law .

 ,” Weeks v. United States, supra, at 392, and that such evidence “shall not be used at all.” Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, at 392.  *649 There are in the cases of this Court some passing references to the Weeks rule as being one of evidence.  But the plain and unequivocal language of Weeks — and its later paraphrase in Wolf — to the effect that the Weeks rule is of constitutional origin, remains entirely undisturbed.  In Byars v. United States, 273 U. S. 28 (1927), a unanimous Court declared that “the doctrine [cannot] ... be tolerated under our constitutional system, that evidences of crime discovered by a federal officer in making a search without lawful warrant may be used against the victim of the unlawful search where a timely challenge has been interposed.” At pp. 29-30 (emphasis added).  The Court, in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438 (1928), in unmistakable language restated the Weeks rule: “The striking outcome of the Weeks case and those which followed it was the sweeping declaration that the Fourth Amendment, although not referring to or limiting the use of evidence in courts, really forbade its introduction if obtained by government officers through a violation of the Amendment.” At p. 462.  In McNabb v. United States, 318 U. S. 332 (1943), we note this statement: “[A] conviction in the federal courts, the foundation of which is evidence obtained in disregard of liberties deemed fundamental by the Constitution, cannot stand.  <citedDecision>Boyd</citedDecision> v. United States .  .  .  Weeks v. United States .... And this Court has, on Constitutional grounds, set aside convictions, both in the federal and state courts, which were based upon confessions ‘secured by protracted and repeated questioning of ignorant and untutored persons, in whose minds the power of officers was greatly mag *650 nified' ... or ‘who have been unlawfully held incommunicado without advice of friends or counsel’ .  .  .  .” At pp. 339-340.

Although appellant chose to urge what may have appeared to be the surer ground for favorable disposition and did not insist that Wolf be overruled, the amicus curiae, who was also permitted to participate in the oral argument, did urge the Court to overrule Wolf .  “The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” The close connection between the concepts later embodied in these two Amendments had been noted at least as early as 1765 by Lord Camden, on whose opinion in Entick v. Carrington, 19 Howell’s State Trials 1029, the <citedDecision>Boyd</citedDecision> court drew heavily.  Lord Camden had noted, at 1073: “It is very certain, that the law obligeth no man to accuse himself; because the necessary means of compelling self-accusation, falling upon the innocent as well as the guilty, would be both cruel and unjust; and it should seem, that search for evidence is disallowed upon the same principle.  There too the innocent would be confounded with the guilty.” See, however, National Safe Deposit Co. v. Stead, 232 U. S. 58 (1914), and Adams v. New York, 192 U. S. 585 (1904).  Less than half of the States have any criminal provisions relating directly to unreasonable searches and seizures.  The punitive sanctions of the 23 States attempting to control such invasions of the right of privacy may be classified as follows: Criminal Liability of Affiant for Malicious Procurement of Search Warrant.  — Ala. Code, 1968, Tit. 15, § 99; Alaska Comp. Laws Ann., 1949, §66-7-15; Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann., 1956, § 13-1454; Cal. Pen. Code §170 ; Fla. Stat., 1959, § 933.16; Ga.

 That this is a procedural right, and that its violation occurs at the time his improperly obtained statement is admitted at trial, is manifest.  For without this right all the careful safeguards erected around the giving of testimony, whether by an accused or any other witness, would become empty formalities in a procedure where the most compelling possible evidence of guilt, a confession, would have already been obtained at the unsupervised pleasure of the police.  This, and not the disciplining of the police, as with illegally seized evidence, is surely the true basis for excluding a statement of the accused which was unconstitutionally obtained.  In sum, I think the coerced confession analogy works strongly against what the Court does today.  In conclusion, it should be noted that the majority opinion in this case is in fact an opinion only for the judgment overruling Wolf, and not for the basic rationale by which four members of the majority have reached that result.  For my Brother Black is unwilling to subscribe to their view that the Weeks exclusionary rule derives from the Fourth Amendment itself (see ante, p. 661), but joins the majority opinion on the premise that its end result can be achieved by bringing the Fifth Amendment to the aid of the Fourth (see ante, pp. 662-665).  12 On that score I need only say that whatever the validity of *686 the “Fourth-Fifth Amendment” correlation which the Boyd case ( <citedDecision>116 U. S. 616</citedDecision> ) found, see 8 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed. 1940), § 2184, we have only very recently again reiterated the long-established doctrine of this Court that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is not applicable to the States.  See Cohen v. Hurley, 366 U. S. 117 .  I regret that I find so unwise in principle and so inexpedient in policy a decision motivated by the high purpose of increasing respect for Constitutional rights.  But in the last analysis I think this Court can increase respect for the Constitution only if it rigidly respects the limitations which the Constitution places upon it, and respects as well the principles inherent in its own processes.  In the present case I think we exceed both, and that our voice becomes only a voice of power, not of reason.  The material parts of that law are quoted in note 1 of the Court’s opinion.  Ante,-p.
