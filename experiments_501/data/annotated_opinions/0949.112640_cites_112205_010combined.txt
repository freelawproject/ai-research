 The District Court nonetheless went on to address the merits of all 11 of Coleman's claims.  The court ruled against Coleman on all of the claims and denied the petition.  Id., at 40-52.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  895 F. 2d 139 (1990).  The court held that Coleman had defaulted all of the claims that he had presented for the first time in state habeas.  Coleman argued that the Virginia Supreme Court had not "clearly and expressly" stated that its decision in state habeas was based on a procedural default, and therefore the federal courts could not treat it as such under the rule of Harris v. Reed, <citedDecision>489 U. S. 255</citedDecision> (1989).  The Fourth Circuit disagreed.  It concluded that the Virginia Supreme Court had met the "plain statement" requirement of <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> by granting a motion to dismiss that was based solely on procedural grounds.  895 F. 2d, at 143 .  The Fourth Circuit held that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision *729 rested on independent and adequate state grounds and that Coleman had not shown cause to excuse the default.  Id., at 143-144 .  As a consequence, federal review of the claims Coleman presented only in the state habeas proceeding was barred.  Id., at 144 .  We granted certiorari, 498 U. S. 937 (1990), to resolve several issues concerning the relationship between state procedural defaults and federal habeas review, and now affirm.
**Combined Opinion**
 Because this Court has no power to review a state law determination that is sufficient to support the judgment, resolution of any independent federal ground for the decision could not affect the judgment and would therefore be advisory.  See Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U. S. 117, 125-126 (1945) ("We are not permitted to render an advisory opinion, and if the same judgment would be rendered by the state court after we corrected its views of federal laws, our review could amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion").  We have applied the independent and adequate state ground doctrine not only in our own review of state court judgments, but in deciding whether federal district courts should address the claims of state prisoners in habeas corpus actions.  The doctrine applies to bar federal habeas when *730 a state court declined to address a prisoner's federal claims because the prisoner had failed to meet a state procedural requirement.  In these cases, the state judgment rests on independent and adequate state procedural grounds.  See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U. S. 72, 81, 87 (1977); Ulster County Court v. Allen, 442 U. S. 140, 148 (1979).  See generally <citedDecision>Harris, supra, at 262</citedDecision> .  The basis for application of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in federal habeas is somewhat different than on direct review by this Court. When this Court reviews a state court decision on direct review pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1257 , it is reviewing the judgment; if resolution of a federal question cannot affect the judgment, there is nothing for the Court to do.  This is not the case in habeas.  When a federal district court reviews a state prisoner's habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 2254 , it must decide whether the petitioner is "in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." Ibid. The court does not review a judgment, but the lawfulness of the petitioner's custody simpliciter.  See Fay v. Noia, 372 U. S. 391, 430 (1963).  Nonetheless, a state prisoner is in custody pursuant to a judgment.

 In Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320 (1985), we applied the Long presumption in the context of an alleged independent and adequate state procedural ground.  Caldwell, a criminal defendant, challenged at trial part of the prosecutor's closing argument to the jury, but he did not raise the issue on appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court. That court raised the issue sua sponte, discussing this federal question at length in its opinion and deciding it against Caldwell.  The court also made reference to its general rule that issues not raised on appeal are deemed waived.  The State argued to this Court that the procedural default constituted an independent and adequate state ground for the Mississippi *734 court's decision.  We rejected this argument, noting that the state decision "`fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law,'" and there was no clear and express statement that the Mississippi Supreme Court was relying on procedural default as an independent ground.  Id., at 327, quoting Long, supra, at 1040 .  Long and Caldwell were direct review cases. We first considered the problem of ambiguous state court decisions in the application of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in a federal habeas case in Harris v. Reed, <citedDecision>489 U. S. 255</citedDecision> (1989).  Harris, a state prisoner, filed a petition for state postconviction relief, alleging that his trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance.  The state trial court dismissed the petition, and the Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed.  In its order, the Appellate Court referred to the Illinois rule that "`those [issues] which could have been presented [on direct appeal], but were not, are considered waived.'" <citedDecision>Id., at 258</citedDecision> .  The court concluded that Harris could have raised his ineffective assistance claims on direct review.  Nonetheless, the court considered and rejected Harris' claims on the merits.  Harris then petitioned for federal habeas.  The situation presented to this Court was nearly identical to that in Long and Caldwell : a state court decision that fairly appeared to rest primarily on federal law in a context in which a federal court has an obligation to determine if the state court decision rested on an independent and adequate state ground.  "Faced with a common problem, we adopt[ed] a common solution." <citedDecision>Harris, supra, at 263</citedDecision> .  <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> applied in federal habeas the presumption this Court adopted in Long for direct review cases. Because the Illinois Appellate Court did not "clearly and expressly" rely on waiver as a ground for rejecting Harris' ineffective assistance of counsel claims, the Long presumption applied and Harris was not barred from federal habeas.  <citedDecision>Harris, supra, at 266</citedDecision> .  After <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> , federal courts on habeas corpus review of state prisoner claims, like this Court on direct review of state *735 court judgments, will presume that there is no independent and adequate state ground for a state court decision when the decision "fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with the federal law, and when the adequacy and independence of any possible state law ground is not clear from the face of the opinion." Long, supra, at 1040-1041 .  In habeas, if the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner presented his federal claims fairly appeared to rest primarily on resolution of those claims, or to be interwoven with those claims, and did not clearly and expressly rely on an independent and adequate state ground, a federal court may address the petition.  [*] III A Coleman contends that the presumption of Long and <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> applies in this case and precludes a bar to habeas because the Virginia Supreme Court's order dismissing Coleman's appeal did not "clearly and expressly" state that it was based on state procedural grounds.  Coleman reads <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> too broadly.  A predicate to the application of the <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> presumption is that the decision of the last state court to which the petitioner presented his federal claims must fairly appear to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with federal law. Coleman relies on other language in <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> .  That opinion announces that "a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case *736 clearly and expressly states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar." <citedDecision>Harris, supra, at 263</citedDecision> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Coleman contends that this rule, by its terms, applies to all state court judgments, not just those that fairly appear to rest primarily on federal law. Coleman has read the rule out of context.  It is unmistakably clear that <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> applies the same presumption in habeas that Long and Caldwell adopted in direct review cases in this Court. See Harris, <citedDecision>489 U. S., at 263</citedDecision> ("Faced with a common problem we adopt a common solution"); see also <citedDecision>id., at 264</citedDecision> ("Under our decision today, a state court need do nothing more to preclude habeas review than it must do to preclude direct review").  Indeed, the quoted passage purports to state the rule "on either direct or habeas review." <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> , being a federal habeas case, could not change the rule for direct review; the reference to both direct and habeas review makes plain that <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> applies precisely the same rule as Long.  Harris describes the Long presumption, and hence its own, as applying only in those cases in which "`it fairly appears that the state court rested its decision primarily on federal law.'" <citedDecision>Harris, supra, at 261</citedDecision> , quoting Long, 463 U. S., at 1040 .  That in one particular exposition of its rule <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> does not mention the predicate to application of the presumption does not change the holding of the opinion.  Coleman urges a broader rule: that the presumption applies in all cases in which a habeas petitioner presented his federal claims to the state court. This rule makes little sense.  In direct review cases, "[i]t is .  .  .  `incumbent upon this Court .  .
**Combined Opinion**
 to ascertain for itself .  .  .  whether the asserted non-federal ground independently and adequately supports the [state court] judgment.'" Long, supra, at 1038 , quoting Abie State Bank v. Bryan, 282 U. S. 765, 773 (1931).  Similarly, federal habeas courts must ascertain for themselves if the petitioner is in custody pursuant to a state court judgment that rests on independent and adequate state grounds.  In cases in which the Long and <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> presumption *737 applies, federal courts will conclude that the relevant state court judgment does not rest on an independent and adequate state ground.  The presumption, like all conclusive presumptions, is designed to avoid the costs of excessive inquiry where a per se rule will achieve the correct result in almost all cases. As we explained in a different context: " Per se rules .  .  .  require the Court to make broad generalizations .  .  .  .  Cases that do not fit the generalization may arise, but a per se rule reflects the judgment that such cases are not sufficiently common or important to justify the time and expense necessary to identify them." Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 50, n. 16 (1977).  Per se rules should not be applied, however, in situations where the generalization is incorrect as an empirical matter; the justification for a conclusive presumption disappears when application of the presumption will not reach the correct result most of the time.  The Long and <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> presumption works because in the majority of cases in which a state court decision fairly appears to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with such law, and the state court does not plainly state that it is relying on an independent and adequate state ground, the state court decision did not in fact rest on an independent and adequate state ground.  We accept errors in those small number of cases where there was nonetheless an independent and adequate state ground in exchange for a significant reduction in the costs of inquiry.  The tradeoff is very different when the factual predicate does not exist.  In those cases in which it does not fairly appear that the state court rested its decision primarily on federal grounds, it is simply not true that the "most reasonable explanation" is that the state judgment rested on federal grounds.  Cf. Long, supra, at 1041 .  Yet Coleman would have the federal courts apply a conclusive presumption of no independent and adequate state grounds in every case in which a state prisoner presented his federal claims to a state *738 court, regardless of whether it fairly appears that the state court addressed those claims.  We cannot accept such a rule, for it would greatly and unacceptably expand the risk that federal courts will review the federal claims of prisoners in custody pursuant to judgments resting on independent and adequate state grounds.  Any efficiency gained by applying a conclusive presumption, and thereby avoiding inquiry into state law, is simply not worth the cost in the loss of respect for the State that such a rule would entail.  It may be argued that a broadly applicable presumption is not counterfactual after it is announced: Once state courts know that their decisions resting on independent and adequate state procedural grounds will be honored in federal habeas only if there is a clear and express statement of the default, these courts will provide such a statement in all relevant cases. This argument does not help Coleman.  Even assuming that <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> can be read as establishing a presumption in all cases, the Virginia Supreme Court issued its order dismissing Coleman's appeal before this Court decided <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> .  As to this state court order, the absence of an express statement of procedural default is not very informative.  In any event, we decline to establish such a rule here, for it would place burdens on the States and state courts in exchange for very little benefit to the federal courts.  We are, as an initial matter, far from confident that the empirical assumption of the argument for such a rule is correct.  It is not necessarily the case that state courts will take pains to provide a clear and express statement of procedural default in all cases, even after announcement of the rule.  State courts presumably have a dignitary interest in seeing that their state law decisions are not ignored by a federal habeas court, but most of the price paid for federal review of state prisoner claims is paid by the State.  When a federal habeas court considers the federal claims of a prisoner in state custody for independent and adequate state law reasons, it is the State that must respond.
**Combined Opinion**
 It is the State that must retry the petitioner if the federal courts reverse his conviction.  If a state court, in the course of disposing of cases on its overcrowded docket, neglects to provide a clear and express statement of procedural default, or is insufficiently motivated to do so, there is little the State can do about it.  Yet it is primarily respect for the State's interests that underlies the application of the independent and adequate state ground doctrine in federal habeas.  A broad presumption would also put too great a burden on the state courts.  It remains the duty of the federal courts, whether this Court on direct review, or lower federal courts in habeas, to determine the scope of the relevant state court judgment.  We can establish a per se rule that eases the burden of inquiry on the federal courts in those cases where there are few costs to doing so, but we have no power to tell state courts how they must write their opinions.  We encourage state courts to express plainly, in every decision potentially subject to federal review, the grounds upon which their judgments rest, but we will not impose on state courts the responsibility for using particular language in every case in which a state prisoner presents a federal claim  every state appeal, every denial of state collateral review  in order that federal courts might not be bothered with reviewing state law and the record in the case. Nor do we believe that the federal courts will save much work by applying the <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> presumption in all cases. The presumption at present applies only, when it fairly appears that a state court judgment rested primarily on federal law or was interwoven with federal law, that is, in those cases where a federal court has good reason to question whether there is an independent and adequate state ground for the decision.  In the rest of the cases, there is little need for a conclusive presumption.  In the absence of a clear indication *740 that a state court rested its decision on federal law, a federal court's task will not be difficult.  There is, in sum, little that the federal courts will gain by applying a presumption of federal review in those cases where the relevant state court decision does not fairly appear to rest primarily on federal law or to be interwoven with such law, and much that the States and state courts will lose.  We decline to so expand the <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> presumption.  B The <citedDecision>Harris</citedDecision> presumption does not apply here.  Coleman does not argue, nor could he, that it "fairly appears" that the Virginia Supreme Court's decision rested primarily on federal law or was interwoven with such law. The Virginia Supreme Court stated plainly that it was granting the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss the petition for appeal.  That motion was based solely on Coleman's failure to meet the Supreme Court's time requirements.  There is no mention of federal law in the Virginia Supreme Court's three-sentence dismissal order.  It "fairly appears" to rest primarily on state law. Coleman concedes that the Virginia Supreme Court dismissed his state habeas appeal as untimely, applying a state procedural rule.  Brief for Petitioner 9.  He argues instead that the court's application of this procedural rule was not independent of federal law. Virginia Supreme Court Rule 5:5(a) declares that the 30-day requirement for filing a notice of appeal is "mandatory."
**Combined Opinion**
 This was no doubt an inadvertent error, and respondent concedes that Coleman did not "understandingly and knowingly" forgo the privilege of state collateral appeal.  See Fay, 372 U. S., at 439 .  Therefore, if the Fay deliberate bypass standard still applies, Coleman's state procedural default will not bar federal habeas.  In Harris, we described in broad terms the application of the cause and prejudice standard, hinting strongly that Fay had been superseded: "Under Sykes and its progeny, an adequate and independent finding of procedural default will bar federal habeas review of the federal claim, unless the habeas petitioner can show `cause' for the default and `prejudice *750 attributable thereto,' Murray v. Carrier, 477 U. S. 478, 485 (1986), or demonstrate that failure to consider the federal claim will result in a `"`fundamental miscarriage of justice.'"' Id., at 495 , quoting Engle v. Isaac, 456 U. S. 107, 135 (1982).  See also Smith v. Murray, 477 U. S. 527, 537 (1986)." Harris, <citedDecision>489 U. S., at 262</citedDecision> .  We now make it explicit: In all cases in which a state prisoner has defaulted his federal claims in state court pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review of the claims is barred unless the prisoner can demonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result of the alleged violation of federal law, or demonstrate that failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice.  Fay was based on a conception of federal/state relations that undervalued the importance of state procedural rules.  The several cases after Fay that applied the cause and prejudice standard to a variety of state procedural defaults represent a different view.  We now recognize the important interest in finality served by state procedural rules, and the significant harm to the States that results from the failure of federal courts to respect them.  Cf. McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 491 (1991) ("Though Fay v. Noia, supra , may have cast doubt upon these propositions, since Fay we have taken care in our habeas corpus decisions to reconfirm the importance of finality").  Carrier applied the cause and prejudice standard to the failure to raise a particular claim on appeal.
**Combined Opinion**
 Given that a criminal defendant has no right to counsel beyond his first appeal in pursuing state discretionary or collateral review, it would defy logic for us to hold that Coleman had a right to counsel *757 to appeal a state collateral determination of his claims of trial error.  Because Coleman had no right to counsel to pursue his appeal in state habeas, any attorney error that led to the default of Coleman's claims in state court cannot constitute cause to excuse the default in federal habeas.  As Coleman does not argue in this Court that federal review of his claims is necessary to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice, he is barred from bringing these claims in federal habeas.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed.  JUSTICE WHITE, concurring.  I concur in the judgment of the Court and I join in its opinion, but add a few words concerning what occurred below.  Harris v. Reed, <citedDecision>489 U. S. 255</citedDecision> (1989), stated that "a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case `"clearly and expressly"' states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar." <citedDecision>Id., at 263</citedDecision> , quoting Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 327 (1985), in turn quoting Michigan v. Long, 463 U. S. 1032, 1041 (1983).  If there were nothing before us but the order granting the State's motion to dismiss for untimeliness, it would be clear enough that the dismissal was based on a procedural default.  But the state court did not grant the State's explicit request for an early ruling on the motion.  Instead, the court delayed ruling on the motion to dismiss, and hence briefs on both the motion and the merits were filed.  Six months later, the court "upon consideration whereof" granted the State's motion to dismiss the appeal.  Hence petitioner's argument that the court studied the merits of the federal claims to determine whether to waive the procedural default, found those claims lacking, and only then granted the motion to dismiss; it is as though the court had said that it was granting the motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely because the federal *758 claims were untenable and provided the court no reason to waive the default.  The predicate for this argument is that on occasion the Virginia Supreme Court waives the untimeliness rule.
**Combined Opinion**
 Indeed, the duty arose out of a distinct distrust of state courts, which this Court perceived as attempting to evade federal review.  See Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina ex rel. Daniel, 281 U. S. 537, 540 (1930) ("Even though the constitutional protection invoked be denied on non-federal grounds, it is the province of this Court to inquire whether the decision of the state court rests upon a fair and substantial basis.  If unsubstantial, constitutional obligations may not thus be evaded").  From these noble beginnings, the Court has managed to transform the duty to protect federal rights into a self-fashioned abdication.  Defying the constitutional allocation *762 of sovereign authority, the Court now requires a federal court to scrutinize the state-court judgment with an eye to denying a litigant review of his federal claims rather than enforcing those provisions of the Federal Bill of Rights that secure individual autonomy.  II Even if one acquiesced in the majority's unjustifiable elevation of abstract federalism over fundamental precepts of liberty and fairness, the Court's conclusion that the plain-statement rule of Michigan v. Long does not apply to a summary order defies both settled understandings and compassionate reason.  A As an initial matter, it cannot seriously be disputed that the Court's opinion in Harris v. Reed, <citedDecision>489 U. S. 255</citedDecision> (1989), expressly considered this issue and resolved the question quite contrary to the Court's holding today.  Both Long and Harris involved a federal review of a state-court opinion that, on its face, addressed the merits of the underlying claims and resolved those claims with express reference to both state and federal law. See Long, 463 U. S., at 1037 , and n. 3; Harris, <citedDecision>489 U. S., at 257-258</citedDecision> .  In each case, it was not disputed that the alleged state ground had been invoked: The Court was faced with the question whether that state ground was adequate to support the judgment and independent of federal law. Accordingly, the Long and Harris Courts spoke of state-court judgments that "fairly appea[r] to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law," Long, 463 U. S., at 1040 , or that contained "ambiguous... references to state law." Harris, <citedDecision>489 U. S., at 263</citedDecision> .  The majority asserts that these statements establish a factual predicate for the application of the plain-statement rule.  Ante, at 735-736.  Neither opinion, however, purported to limit the application of the plain-statement rule to the narrow *763 circumstances presented in the case under review.  In fact, the several opinions in Harris make plain that for purposes of federal habeas, the Court was adopting the Long presumption for all cases where federal claims are presented to state courts.  The Harris Court expressed its understanding of Long unequivocally: "We held in Long that unless the state court clearly expressed its reliance on an adequate and independent state-law ground, this Court may address a federal issue considered by the state court." 489 U. S., at 262-263.  Armed with that understanding, the Court concluded that "a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case `"clearly and expressly"' states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar."
