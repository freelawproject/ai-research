**Dissenting Opinion**
 Because I disagree with the Court’s overruling of Geer and holding that Oklahoma’s law relating to the sale of minnows violates the Commerce Clause, I dissent.  In its headlong rush to overrule Geer , the Court characterizes that decision as “rest[ing] on the holding that no interstate commerce was involved.” Ante, at 327.  It is true that one of the rationales relied on by the Geer Court was that the State could exercise its power to control the killing and ownership of animals ferae naturae to prohibit such game *340 from leaving the borders of the State and thus prevent the game from ever becoming the objects of interstate commerce.  161 U. S., at 530-532 .  Since the Court in Geer was of the view that the challenged statute effectively prevented certain game from entering the stream of interstate commerce, there could be no basis for a Commerce Clause challenge to the State’s law. Id., at 530, 532 .  2 I do not dispute the Court’s rejection of this theory; as the Court points out, this rationale was rejected long before today.  Ante, at 329; see West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., <citedDecision>221 U. S. 229</citedDecision> (1911).  My objection is that this line of reasoning, while undoubtedly considered important by the majority in Geer , is unnecessary to sustain that decision 3 and is unneeded in the disposition of the pres *341 ent case. And no one — not the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals or the State in this Court — contends that the minnows at issue are not the subjects of interstate commerce.  It is obvious that the Court has simply set this theory up as a sort of strawman to facilitate the toppling of a decision which, in other respects, enunciates principles that have remained valid and vital, albeit somewhat refined, at least until today.  4 The Court in Geer expressed the view derived from Roman law that the wild fish and game located within the territorial limits of a State are the common property of its citizens and that the State, as a kind of trustee, may exercise this common “ownership" for the benefit of its citizens.  161 U. S., at 529 .  Admittedly, a State does not “own” the wild creatures within its borders in any conventional sense of the word.  5 Baldwin v. Montana Fish & Game Comm’n, supra, at 386; Douglas v.
