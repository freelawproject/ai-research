 The Clause protects only against the imposition of multiple criminal punishments for the same offense, Helvering v. Mitchell, 303 U. S. 391, 399 (1938); see also Hess, supra, at 548-549 (“Only” “criminal punishment” “subjeet[s] the defendant to ‘jeopardy 3 within the constitutional meaning”); Breed v. Jones, 421 U. S. 519, 528 (1975) (“In the constitutional sense, jeopardy describes the risk that is traditionally associated with a criminal prosecution”), and then only when such occurs in successive proceedings, see Missouri v. Hunter, 459 Ú.  S. 359, 366 (1983).  Whether a particular punishment is criminal or civil is, at least initially, a matter of statutory construction.  Helvering, supra, at 399 .  A court must first ask whether the legislature, “in establishing the penalizing mechanism, indicated either expressly or impliedly a preference for one label or the other.” Ward, 448 U. S., at 248 .  Even in those eases where the legislature “has indicated an intention to establish a civil penalty, we have inquired further whether the statutory scheme was so punitive either in purpose or effect,” id., at 248-249 , as to “transfor[m] what was clearly intended as a civil remedy into a criminal penalty,” Rex Trailer Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 148, 154 (1956).  In making this latter determination, the factors listed in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 144, 168-169</citedDecision> (1963), provide useful guideposts, including: (1) “[wjhether the sanction involves an affirmative disability or restraint”; (2) “whether it has historically been regarded as a punishment”; (3) “whether it comes into play only on a finding of scienter (4) “whether its operation will promote the traditional aims of punishment — retribution and deterrence”; (5) “whether the behavior to which it applies is already a crime”; (6) “whether an alternative purpose to which it may rationally be connected is assignable for it”; and (7) “whether it appears *100 excessive in relation to the alternative purpose assigned.” It is important to note, however, that “these factors must be considered in relation to the statute on its face,” <citedDecision>id., at 169</citedDecision> , and “only the clearest proof” will suffice to override legislative intent and transform what has been denominated a civil remedy into a criminal penalty, Ward, supra, at 249 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Our opinion in United States v. Halper marked the first time we applied the Double Jeopardy Clause to a sanction without first determining that it was criminal in nature.  In that case, Irwin Halper was convicted of, inter alia, violating the criminal false claims statute, 18 U. S. C. § 287 , based on his submission of 65 inflated Medicare claims each of which overcharged the Government by $9.  He was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and fined $5,000.  The Government then brought an action against Halper under the civil False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3731 (1982 ed., Supp. II).  The remedial provisions of the False Claims Act provided that a violation of the Act rendered one “liable to the United States Government for a civil penalty of $2,000, an amount equal to 2 times the amount of damages the Government sustains because of the act of that person, and costs of the civil action.” Id., § 3729.  Given Halper’s 65 separate violations of the Act, he appeared to be liable for a penalty of $130,000, despite the fact he actually defrauded the Government of less than $600.

 490 U. S., at 438-439 .  On direct appeal, this Court affirmed.  As the Halper Court saw it, the imposition of “punishment” of any kind was *101 subject to double jeopardy constraints, and whether a sanction constituted “punishment” depended primarily on whether it served the traditional “goals of punishment,” namely, “retribution and deterrence.” Id., at 448 .  Any sanction that was so “overwhelmingly disproportionate” to the injury caused that it could not “fairly be said solely to serve [the] remedial purpose” of compensating the Government for its loss, was thought to be explainable only as “serving either retributive or deterrent purposes.” See id., at 448-449 (emphasis added).  The analysis applied by the Halper Court deviated from our traditional double jeopardy doctrine in two key respects.  First, the Halper Court bypassed the threshold question: whether the successive punishment at issue is a “criminal” punishment.  Instead, it focused on whether the sanction, regardless of whether it was civil or criminal, was so grossly disproportionate to the harm caused as to constitute “punishment.” In so doing, the Court elevated a single <citedDecision>Kennedy</citedDecision> factor — whether the sanction appeared excessive in relation to its nonpunitive purposes — to dispositive status.  But as we emphasized in <citedDecision>Kennedy</citedDecision> itself, no one factor should be considered controlling as they “may often point in differing directions.” <citedDecision>372 U. S., at 169</citedDecision> .  The second significant departure in Halper .  was the Court’s decision to “asses[s] the character of the actual sanctions imposed,” 490 U. S., at 447 , rather than, as <citedDecision>Kennedy</citedDecision> demanded, evaluating the “statute on its face” to determine whether it provided for what amounted to a criminal sanction, <citedDecision>372 U. S., at 169</citedDecision> .  We believe that Halper’s deviation from longstanding double jeopardy principles was ill considered.  5 AlS subsequent *102 eases have demonstrated, Hamper’s test for determining whether a particular sanction is “punitive,” and thus subject to the strictures of the Double Jeopardy Clause, has proved unworkable.  We have since recognized that all civil penalties have some deterrent effect.  See Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767, 777, n. 14 (1994); United States v. Ursery, 518 U. S. 267, 284-285, n. 2 (1996).  6 If a sanction must be “solely” remedial (i.  e., entirely nonde-terrent) to avoid implicating the Double Jeopardy Clause, then no civil penalties are beyond the scope of the Clause.

 Second, the sanctions imposed not an tive disability or restraint,” as that term is normally understood.  While petitioners have been prohibited from further participating in the banking industry, this is “certainly nothing approaching the 'infamous punishment’ of imprisonment.” Flemming v. Nestor, 363 U. S. 603, 617 (1960).  Third, neither sanction comes into play “only” on a finding of scienter.  The provisions under which the money penalties were imposed, 12 U. S. C. §§ 93 (b) and 504, allow for the assessment of a penalty against any person “who violates” any of the underlying banking statutes, without regard to the violator’s state of mind.  “Good faith” is considered by OCC in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed, § 93(b)(2), but a penalty ean be imposed even in the absence of bad faith.  The fact that petitioners’ “good faith” was considered in determining the amount of the penalty to be imposed in this case is irrelevant, as we look only'to “the statute on its face” to determine whether a penalty is criminal in nature.  Kennedy, <citedDecision>372 U. S., at 169</citedDecision> .  Similarly, while debarment may be imposed for a “willful” disregard “for the safety or soundness of [an] insured depository institution,” *105 willfulness is not a prerequisite to debarment; it is sufficient that the disregard for the safety and soundness of the institution was “continuing." § 1818(e)(1)(C)(ii).  Fourth, the conduct for which OCC sanctions are imposed may also be criminal (and in this ease formed the basis for petitioners’ indictments).  This fact is insufficient to render the money penalties and debarment sanctions criminally punitive, Ursery, 518 U. S., at 292 , particularly in the double jeopardy context, see United States v. Dixon, 509 U. S. 688, 704 (1993) (rejecting “same-conduct” test for double jeopardy purposes).  Finally, we recognize that the imposition of both money penalties and debarment sanctions will deter others from emulating petitioners’ conduct, a traditional goal of criminal punishment.  But the mere presence of this purpose is insufficient to render a sanction criminal, as deterrence “may serve civil as well as criminal goals.” Ursery, supra, at 292 ; see also Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U. S. 442, 452 (1996) (“[Forfeiture .

*115 Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, concurring in the judgment.  I agree with the majority and with Justice Souter that United States v. Halper, 490 U. S. 435 (1989), does not provide proper guidance for distinguishing between criminal and noncriminal sanctions and proceedings.  I also agree that United States v. Ward, 448 U. S. 242, 248 (1980), and Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, <citedDecision>372 U. S. 144, 168-169</citedDecision> (1963), set forth the proper approach.  I do not join the Court’s opinion, however, because I disagree with its reasoning in two respects.  First, unlike the Court I would not say that “‘only the clearest proof will “transform” into a criminal punishment what a legislature calls a “civil remedy.” Ante, at 100.  I understand that the Court has taken this language from earlier cases. See Ward, supra, at 249 .  But the limitation that the language suggests is not consistent with what the Court has actually done.  Rather, in fact if not in theory, the Court has simply applied factors of the <citedDecision>Kennedy</citedDecision> variety to the matter at hand. In Department of Revenue of Mont. v. Kurth Ranch, 511 U. S. 767 (1994), for example, the Court held that the collection of a state tax imposed on the possession and storage of drugs was “the functional equivalent of a successive criminal prosecution” because, among other things, the tax was “remarkably high”; it had “an obvious deterrent purpose”; it was “conditioned on the commission of a crime”; it was “exacted only after the taxpayer ha[d] been arrested for the precise conduct that gives rise to the tax obligation”; its alternative function of raising revenue could be equally well served by increasing the fine imposed on the activity; and it departed radically from “normal revenue laws” by taxing contraband goods perhaps destroyed before the tax was imposed.  Id., at 781-784 .  This reasoning tracks the nonexclusive list of factors set forth in <citedDecision>Kennedy</citedDecision> , and it is, I believe, the proper approach.  The “clearest proof” language *116 is consequently misleading, and I would consign it to the same legal limbo where Halper now rests.  Second, I would not decide now that a ate a statute only “ ‘on its face,’ ” ante, at 100 (quoting <citedDecision>Kennedy, supra, at 169</citedDecision> ), rather than “assessing the character of the actual sanctions imposed,” Halper, supra, at 447 ; ante, at 101.  Halper involvéd an ordinary civil-fine statute that as normally applied would not have created any “double jeopardy” problem.  It was not the statute itself, but rather the disproportionate relation between fine and conduct as the statute was applied in the individual case that led this Court, unanimously, to find that the “civil penalty” was, in those circumstances, a second “punishment” that constituted double jeopardy.  See 490 U. S., at 439, 452 (finding that $130,000 penalty was “sufficiently disproportionate” to $585 loss plus approximately $16,000 in Government expenses caused by Halper’s fraud to constitute a second punishment in violation of double jeopardy).  Of course, the Court in Halper might have reached the same result through application of the constitutional prohibition of “excessive fines.” See ante, at 103; Alexander v. United States, 509 U. S. 544, 558-559 (1993); Halper, supra, at 449 (emphasizing that Halper was “the rare case” in which there was an “overwhelmingly disproportionate” fine).  But that is not what the Court there said.  And nothing in the majority’s opinion today explains why we should abandon this aspect of Hamper's holding.  Indeed, in context, the language of <citedDecision>Kennedy</citedDecision> that suggests that the Court should consider the statute on its face does not suggest that there may not be further analysis of a penalty as it is applied in a particular case. See <citedDecision>372 U. S., at 169</citedDecision> .  Most of the lower court confusion and criticism of Halper appears to have focused on the problem of characterizing — by examining the face of the statute — the purposes of a civil penalty as punishment, not on the application of double jeopardy analysis to the penalties that are imposed in particular cases. It seems to me quite possible that *117 a statute that provides for a punishment that normally is civil in nature could nonetheless amount to a criminal punishment as applied in special circumstances.  And I would not now hold to the contrary.  That said, an analysis of the <citedDecision>Kennedy</citedDecision> factors still leads me to the conclusion that the statutory penalty in this case is not on its face a criminal penalty.  Nor, in my view, does the application of the statute to the petitioners in this ease amount to criminal punishment.  I therefore concur in the judgment.
