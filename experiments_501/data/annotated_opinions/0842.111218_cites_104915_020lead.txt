 With only a citation to Yellow Cab and no further analysis, the Court stated that the “suggestion runs counter to our past decisions that common ownership and control does not liberate corporations from the impact of the antitrust laws” and stated that this rule was “especially applicable” when defendants “hold themselves out as competitors.” 340 U. S., at 215 .  Unlike the Yellow Cab passage, this language does not pertain to corporations whose initial affiliation was itself unlawful.  In straying beyond Yellow Cab, the Kiefer-Stewart Court failed to confront the anomalies an intra-enterprise doctrine entails.  It is relevant nonetheless that, were the ease decided today, the same result probably could be justified on the ground that the subsidiaries conspired with wholesalers other than the plaintiff.  9 An intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine thus would no longer be necessary to a finding of liability on the facts of Kiefer-Stewart.  Later cases invoking the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine do little more than cite Yellow Cab or Kiefer-Stewart, and in none of the cases was the doctrine necessary to the result reached.  Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. United States, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 593</citedDecision> (1951), involved restrictive horizontal agree *765 ments between an American corporation and two foreign corporations in which it owned 30 and 50 percent interests respectively.  The Timken Court cited Kiefer Stewart to show that “[t]he fact that there is common ownership or control of the contracting corporations does not liberate them from the impact of the antitrust laws.” <citedDecision>341 U. S., at 598</citedDecision> .  But the relevance of this statement is unclear.  The American defendant in Timken did not own a majority interest in either of the foreign corporate conspirators and, as the District Court found, it did not control them.  10 Moreover, as in Yellow Cab, there was evidence that the stock acquisitions were themselves designed to effectuate restrictive practices.  11 The Court’s reliance on the intra-enterprise conspiracy doctrine was in no way necessary to the result.  The same is true of Perma Life Mufflers, Inc. v. International Parts Corp., 392 U. S. 134 (1968), which involved a conspiracy among a parent corporation and three subsidiaries to impose various illegal restrictions on plaintiff franchisees.  The Court did suggest that, because the defendants “availed themselves of the privilege of doing business through separate corporations, the fact of common own *766 ership could not save them from any of the obligations that the law imposes on separate entities [citing Yellow Cab and Timken].” Id., at 141-142 .

 n. 6.  109.  Although the plaintiff apparently never acquiesced in the resale price maintenance scheme, Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 182 F. 2d 228, 231 (CA7 1950), rev’d, 340 U. S. 211 (1951), one of the subsidiaries did gain the compliance of other wholesalers after once terminating them for refusing to abide by the pricing scheme.  See 182 F. 2d, at 231 ; 340 U. S., at 213 .  A theory of combination between the subsidiaries and the wholesalers could now support § 1 relief, whether or not it could have when Kiefer-Stewart was decided.  See Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U. S. 145, 149-150 , and n. 6 (1968); United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., 362 U. S. 29 (1960).  See United States v. Timken Roller Bearing Co., 83 F. Supp. 284, 311-312 (ND Ohio 1949), aff’d as modified, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 593</citedDecision> (1951).  The agreement of an individual named Dewar, who owned 24 and 50 percent of the foreign corporations respectively, was apparently required for the American defendant to have its way.  For almost 20 years before they became affiliated by stock ownership, two of the corporations had been party to the sort of restrictive agreements the Timken Court condemned.  Three Justices upholding antitrust liability were of the view that Timken’s “interests in the [foreign] companies were obtained as part of a plan to promote the illegal trade restraints” and that the “intercorporate relationship” was “the core of the conspiracy.” <citedDecision>Id., at 600-601</citedDecision> .  Because two Justices found no antitrust violation at all, see <citedDecision>id., at 605</citedDecision> (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); <citedDecision>id., at 606</citedDecision> (Jackson, J., dissenting), and two Justices did not take part, apparently only Chief Justice Vinson and Justice Reed were prepared to hold that there was a violation even if the initial acquisition itself was not illegal.  See <citedDecision>id., at 601-602</citedDecision> (Reed, J., joined by Vinson, C. J., concurring).  The doctrine has long been criticized.  See, e. g., Areeda, Intra-enterprise Conspiracy in Decline, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 451 (1983); Handler & Smart, The Present Status of the Intracorporate Conspiracy Doctrine, 3 Cardozo L. Rev. 23 (1981); Kempf, Bathtub Conspiracies: Has Seagram Distilled a More Potent Brew?, 24 Bus. Law. 173 (1968); McQuade, Conspiracy, Multicorporate Enterprises, and Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 41 Va. L. Rev. 183 (1955); Rahl, Conspiracy and the Anti-Trust Laws, 44 Ill. L. Rev. 743 (1950); Sprunk, Intra-Enterprise Conspiracy, 9 ABA Antitrust Section Rep. 20 (1956); Stengel, Intra-Enterprise Conspiracy Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 35 Miss. L. J. 5 (1963); Willis & Pitofsky, Antitrust Consequences of Using Corporate Subsidiaries, 43 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 20 (1968); Note, “Conspiring Entities” Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 95 Harv. L. Rev. 661 (1982); Note, Intra-Enterprise Conspiracy Under Section 1 of the Sherman Act: A Suggested Standard, 75 Mich. L. Rev. 717 (1977).  Section 2 of the Sherman Act provides in pertinent part: “Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony.” 26 Stat. 209 , as amended, 15 U. S. C. §2 .  By making a conspiracy to monopolize unlawful, § 2 does reach both concerted and unilateral behavior.  The point remains, however, that purely unilateral conduct is illegal only under § 2 and not under § 1.  Monopolization without conspiracy is unlawful under § 2, but restraint of trade without a conspiracy or combination is not unlawful under § 1.
