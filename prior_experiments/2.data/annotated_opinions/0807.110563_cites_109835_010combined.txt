*615 See, e. g., Helson & Randolph v. Kentucky, 279 U.S. 245 , 250-252 (1929); Ozark Pipe Line Corp. v. Monier, 266 U.S. 555 , 562 (1925). Consequently, the distinction between intrastate activities and interstate commerce was crucial to protecting the States' taxing power. [4] The Court has, however, long since rejected any suggestion that a state tax or regulation affecting interstate commerce is immune from Commerce Clause scrutiny because it attaches only to a "local" or intrastate activity. See Hunt v. Washington Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333 , 350 (1977); Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 , 141-142 (1970); Nippert v. Richmond, 327 U.S. 416 , 423-424 (1946). Correspondingly, the Court has rejected the notion that state taxes levied on interstate commerce are per se invalid. See, e. g., Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., <targetCase>435 U.S. 734</targetCase> (1978); Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra . In reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state taxes, our goal has instead been to "establish a consistent and rational method of inquiry" focusing on "the practical effect of a challenged tax." Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U.S. 425 , 443 (1980). See Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 437 U.S. 267 , 276-281 (1978); Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring *616 Cos., supra , at 743-751; Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, supra , at 277-279. We conclude that the same "practical" analysis should apply in reviewing Commerce Clause challenges to state severance taxes.

See 430 U.S. , at 279 , n. 8; see also National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization, 430 U.S. 551 , 558 (1977). [15] Indeed, the words "amount" and "value" were not even used in Complete Auto Transit. See 430 U.S. , at 279 . Similarly, our cases applying the Complete Auto Transit test have not mentioned either of these words. See Exxon Corp. v. Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue, 447 U.S. 207 , 228 (1980); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U.S. 425 , 443 (1980); Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U.S. 434 , 444-445 (1979); Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., <targetCase>435 U.S. 734</targetCase> , 750 (1978); National Geographic Society v. California Board of Equalization, supra, at 558. [16] In any event, the linchpin of appellants' contention is the incorrect assumption that the amount of state taxes that may be levied on an activity connected to interstate commerce is limited by the costs incurred by the State on account of that activity. Only then does it make sense to advocate judicial examination of the relationship between taxes paid and benefits provided. But as we have previously noted, see supra, at 623-624, interstate commerce may be required to contribute to the cost of providing all governmental services, including those services from which it arguably receives no direct "benefit." In such circumstances, absent an equal protection challenge (which appellants do not raise), and unless a court is to second-guess legislative decisions about the amount or disposition of tax revenues, it is difficult to see how the court is to go about comparing costs and benefits in order to decide whether the tax burden on an activity connected to interstate commerce is excessive. [17] Of course, a taxing statute may be judicially disapproved if it is "so arbitrary as to compel the conclusion that it does not involve an exertion of the taxing power, but constitutes, in substance and effect, the direct exertion of a different and forbidden power, as, for example, the confiscation of property." Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, 292 U.S. 40 , 44 (1934).

3323, 42 U.S. C . ยง 8401 (1976 ed., Supp. III), authorizes federal grants to areas affected by increased coal production. [10] This is a marked departure from the Court's prior cases. Rather than suggesting such a mechanical test, those cases imply that a tax will be struck down under the fourth prong of the Complete Auto Transit test if the plaintiff establishes a factual record that the tax is not fairly related to the services and protection provided by the State. See, e. g., Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., <targetCase>435 U.S. 734</targetCase> , 750-751 (1978); id., at 764 (POWELL, J., concurring in part and concurring in result). See Merrion v. Jicarilla Apache Tribe, 617 F.2d 537 , 545, n. 4 (CA10) (en banc), cert. granted, 449 U.S. 820 (1980). Even the trial court in the present case recognized that if it reached this question it "would necessarily have to deny the motion to dismiss and proceed to a factual determination." App. 37a. [11] As the example of Alaska illustrates, this prospect is not a fanciful one.

Statement to Accompany the Report of the Free Joint Conference Committees on Coal Taxation 1 (1975). Since the tax was designed only to "preserve or modestly increase" general revenues, it is appropriate for a court to inquire here whether the "surplus" revenue Montana has received from this severance tax is "manifestly disproportionate" to the present or future costs attributable to coal development. [14] Complete Auto Transit gave several examples of "tailored" taxes: property taxes designed to differentiate between property used in transportation and other types of property; an income tax using different rates for different types of business; and a tax on the "privilege of doing business in corporate form" that changed with the nature of the corporate activity involved. 430 U.S. , at 288 , n. 15. A severance tax using different rates for different minerals is, of course, directly analogous to these examples. [15] See also Washington Revenue Dept. v. Association of Wash. Stevedoring Cos., <targetCase>435 U.S. 734</targetCase> , 754-755 (1978); id., at 764 (POWELL, J., concurring in part and concurring in result). [16] The degree to which a tax may be "exported" turns on such factors as the taxing jurisdiction's relative dominance of the market, the elasticity of demand for the product, and the availability of adequate substitutes. See, e. g., McLure, Economic Constraints on State and Local Taxation of Energy Resources, 31 Nat. Tax J. 257, 257-259 (1978); Posner, at 510-512. Commentators are in disagreement over the likelihood that coal severance taxes are in fact exported. Compare, e. g., McLure, at 259, and Gillis & Peprah, Severance Taxes on Coal and Uranium in the Sunbelt, Tex.
