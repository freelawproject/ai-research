**Concurrence Opinion**
 The Court’s opinion, in my judgment, dissipates the doubt and uncertainty in this field of constitutional law and I am persuaded, for this and other reasons stated, to depart from my prior views, to accept the Boyd doctrine as controlling in this state case and to join the Court’s judgment and opinion which are in accordance with that constitutional doctrine.  232 U. S. 383 , decided in 1914.  338 U. S. 25, 33 .  Id., at 39-40 .  The interrelationship between the Fourth and the Fifth Amendments in this area does not, of course, justify a narrowing in the interpretation of either of these Amendments with respect to areas in which they operate separately.  See Feldman v. United States, 322 U. S. 487, 602-503 (dissenting opinion); Frank v. Maryland, 359 U. S. 360, 374-384 (dissenting opinion).  <citedDecision>116 U.

As the Court points out, Mr. Justice Bradley’s approach to interpretation of- the Bill of Rights stemmed directly from the spirit in which that great charter of liberty was offered for adoption on the floor of the House of Representatives by its framer, James Madison: “If they [the first ten Amendments] are incorporated into the Constitution, independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; they will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the Legislative or Executive; they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights.” I Annals of Congress 439 (1789).  342 U. S. 165 .  Id., at 173 .  Id., at 172 .  Id., at 172,173 .  Id., at 174-177 .
