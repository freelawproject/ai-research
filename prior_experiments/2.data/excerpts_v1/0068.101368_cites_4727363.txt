**Combined Opinion**
The bill had been fraudulently issued by the agent for his own enrichment and the described merchandise had not, in fact, been received by the defendant or its agent. The court held that there was no implied authority in the agent to issue bills of lading for merchandise not actually received, and that there was consequently no contractual obligation on the part of the carrier. As the only act of the agent complained of, the issuance of the bill of lading, was thus held not to be within the scope of his authority, that holding was sufficient to dispose of the entire case. To this extent the case has been often cited and followed. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Nat. Park Bk., 188 Ala. 109 , 119; Roy & Roy v. Northern Pacific Ry Co., 42 Wash. 572 , 576; contra, Bank of Batavia v. New York, etc. R.R. Co., 106 N.Y. 195 . But the court in the Friedlander case went on to say (p. 425): ". . . nor is the action maintainable on the ground of tort.
