**Dissenting Opinion**
Justice Blackmun, with whom Justice Marshall and Justice Stevens join, dissenting.  Federalism; comity; state sovereignty; preservation of state resources; certainty: The majority methodically inventories these multifarious state interests before concluding that the plain-statement rule of Michigan v. Long, <citedDecision>463 U. S. 1032</citedDecision> (1983), does not apply to a summary order.  One searches the majority’s opinion in vain, however, for any mention of petitioner Coleman’s right to a criminal proceeding free from constitutional defect or his interest in finding a forum for his constitutional challenge to his conviction and sentence of death.  Nor does the majority even allude to the “important need for uniformity in federal law,” <citedDecision>id., at 1040</citedDecision> , which justified this Court’s adoption of the plain-statement rule in the first place.  Rather, displaying obvious exasperation with the breadth of substantive federal habeas doctrine and the expansive protection afforded by the Fourteenth Amendment’s guarantee of fundamental fairness in state criminal proceedings, the Court today continues its crusade *759 to erect petty procedural barriers in the path of any state prisoner seeking review of his federal constitutional claims.  Because I believe that the Court is creating a Byzantine morass of arbitrary, unnecessary, and unjustifiable impediments to the vindication of federal rights, I dissent.  I The Court cavalierly claims that “[t]his is a case about federalism,” ante, at 726, and proceeds without explanation to assume that the purposes of federalism are advanced whenever a federal court refrains from reviewing an ambiguous state-court judgment.  Federalism, however, has no inherent normative value: It does not, as the majority appears to assume, blindly protect the interests of States from any incursion by the federal courts.  Rather, federalism secures to citizens the liberties that derive from the diffusion of sovereign power.  “Federalism is a device for realizing the concepts of decency and fairness which are among the fundamental principles of liberty and justice lying at the base of all our civil and political institutions.” Brennan, Federal Habeas Corpus and State Prisoners: An Exercise in Federalism, 7 Utah L. Rev. 423 , 442 (1961).

 Similarly, the Court has stated that the duty “cannot be disregarded without neglecting or renouncing a jurisdiction conferred by the law and designed to protect and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof.” Ward v. Board of Comm’rs of Love County, 253 U. S. 17, 23 (1920).  Indeed, the duty arose out of a distinct distrust of state courts, which this Court perceived as attempting to evade federal review.  See Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina ex rel. Daniel, 281 U. S. 537, 540 (1930) (“Even though the constitutional protection invoked be denied on non-federal grounds, it is the province of this Court to inquire whether the decision of the state court rests upon a fair and substantial basis.  If unsubstantial, constitutional obligations may not thus be evaded”).  From these noble beginnings, the Court has managed to transform the duty to protect federal rights into a self-fashioned abdication.  Defying the constitutional allocation *762 of sovereign authority, the Court now requires a federal court to scrutinize the state-court judgment with an eye to denying a litigant review of his federal claims rather than enforcing those provisions of the Federal Bill of Rights that secure individual autonomy.  II Even if one acquiesced in the majority s unjustifiable elevation of abstract federalism over fundamental precepts of liberty and fairness, the Court’s conclusion that the plain-statement rule of <citedDecision>Michigan</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> does not apply to a summary order defies both settled understandings and compassionate reason.  A As an initial matter, it cannot seriously be disputed that the Court’s opinion in Harris v. Reed, 489 U. S. 255 (1989), expressly considered this issue and resolved the question quite contrary to the Court’s holding today.  Both <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> and Harris involved a federal review of a state-court opinion that, on its face, addressed the merits of the underlying claims and resolved those claims with express reference to both state and federal law. See Long, <citedDecision>463 U. S., at 1037</citedDecision> , and n. 3; Harris, 489 U. S., at 257-258 .  In each case, it was not disputed that the alleged state ground had been invoked: The Court was faced with the question whether that state ground was adequate to support the judgment and independent of federal law. Accordingly, the <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> and Harris Courts spoke of state-court judgments that “fairly appea[r] to rest primarily on federal law, or to be interwoven with federal law,” Long, <citedDecision>463 U. S., at 1040</citedDecision> , or that contained “ambiguous .  .  .  references to state law.” Harris, 489 U. S., at 263 .  The majority asserts that these statements establish a factual predicate for the application of the plain-statement rule.  Ante, at 735-736.  Neither opinion, however, purported to limit the application of the plain-statement rule to the narrow *763 circumstances presented in the case under review.  In fact, the several opinions in Harris make plain that for purposes of federal habeas, the Court was adopting the <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> presumption for all cases where federal claims are presented to state courts.  The Harris Court expressed its understanding of <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> unequivocally: “We held in <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> that unless the state court clearly expressed its reliance on an adequate and independent state-law ground, this Court may address a federal issue considered by the state court.” 489 U. S., at 262-263 .  Armed with that understanding, the Court concluded that “a procedural default does not bar consideration of a federal claim on either direct or habeas review unless the last state court rendering a judgment in the case ‘“clearly and expressly” ’ states that its judgment rests on a state procedural bar.” Id., at 263 , quoting Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U. S. 320, 327 (1985), in turn quoting Long, <citedDecision>463 U. S., at 1041</citedDecision> .  Justice O’Connor, in a concurring opinion joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, echoed the majority’s indication that the <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> presumption applied to all cases where a federal claim is presented to the state courts.  She wrote separately to emphasize that the Court’s opinion did not alter the well-settled rule that federal courts may look to state procedural-default rules in determining whether a federal claim has been properly exhausted in the state courts.  See 489 U. S., at 268-270 .  “[I]t is simply impossible,” according to the concurrence, “to ‘[r]equir[e] a state court to be explicit in its reliance on a procedural default’ .  .  .  where a claim raised on federal habeas has never been presented to the state courts at all.” Id., at 270 .

 This accommodation furthers the values underlying federalism in two ways.  First, encouraging a defendant to assert his federal rights in the appropriate state forum makes it possible for transgressions to be arrested sooner and before they influence an erroneous deprivation of liberty.  Second, thorough examination of a prisoner’s federal claims in state court permits more effective review of those claims in federal court, honing the accuracy of the writ as an implement to eradicate unlawful detention.  See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S. 509, 519 (1982); Brown v. Allen, 344 U. S., at 500-501 (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).  The majority ignores these purposes in concluding that a State need not bear the burden of making clear its intent to rely on such a rule.  When it is uncertain whether a state-court judgment denying relief from federal claims rests on a procedural bar, it is inconsistent with federalism principles for a federal court to exercise discretion to decline to review those federal claims.  In justifying its new rule, the majority first announces that, as a practical matter, the application of the <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> presumption to a summary order entered in a case where a state *766 prisoner presented federal constitutional claims to a state court is unwarranted, because “it is simply not true that the ‘most reasonable explanation’ is that • the state judgment rested on federal grounds.” Ante, at 737, quoting Long, <citedDecision>463 U. S., at 1041</citedDecision> .  The majority provides no support for this flat assertion.  In fact, the assertion finds no support in reality.  “Under our federal system, the federal and state ‘courts [are] equally bound to guard and protect the rights secured by the Constitution.’” Rose v. Lundy, 455 U. S., at 518 , quoting Ex parte Royall, 117 U. S. 241, 251 (1886).  Accordingly, state prisoners are required to present their federal claims to state tribunals before proceeding to federal habeas, “to protect the state courts’ role in the enforcement of federal law and prevent disruption of state judicial proceedings.” 455 U. S., at 518 .  See 28 U. S. C. § 2254 .  Respect for the States’ responsible assumption of this solemn trust compels the conclusion that state courts presented with federal constitutional claims actually resolve those claims unless they indicate to the contrary.

 Thus, to the extent the State must “pay the price” of retrying a state prisoner, that price is incurred as a direct result of the State’s failure scrupulously to honor his federal rights, not as a consequence of unwelcome federal review.  See Teague v. Lane, 489 U. S. 288, 306 (1989) (opinion of O’Connor, J., joined by Rehnquist, C. J., and Scalia and Kennedy, JJ., quoting Desist v. United States, 394 U. S. 244, 262-263 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting)) (“ ‘[T]he threat of habeas serves as a necessary additional incentive for trial and appellate courts throughout the land to conduct their proceedings in a manner consistent with established constitutional standards’”).  *768 The majority also contends without elaboration that a “broad presumption [of federal jurisdiction] would .  .  .  put too great a burden on the state courts.” Ante, at 739.  This assertion not only finds no support in <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> , where the burden of the presumption on state courts is not even mentioned, but also is premised on the misconception that the plain-statement rule serves only to relieve the federal court of the “bother” of determining the basis of the relevant state-court judgment.  Viewed responsibly, the plain-statement rule provides a simple mechanism by which a state court may invoke the discretionary deference of the federal habeas court and virtually insulate its judgment from federal review.  While state courts may choose to draw their orders as they wish, the right of a state prisoner, particularly one sentenced to death, to have his federal claim heard by a federal habeas court is simply too fundamental to yield to the State’s incidental interest in issuing ambiguous summary orders.  C Not only is the majority’s abandonment of the plain-statement rule for purposes of summary orders unjustified, it is also misguided.  In <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> , the Court adopted the plain-statement rule because we had “announced a number of principles in order to help us determine” whether ambiguous state-court judgments rested on adequate and independent state grounds, but had “not developed a satisfying and consistent approach for resolving this vexing issue.” <citedDecision>463 U. S., at 1038</citedDecision> .  Recognizing that “[t]his ad hoc method of dealing with cases that involve possible adequate and independent state grounds is antithetical to the doctrinal consistency that is required when sensitive issues of federal-state relations are involved,” <citedDecision>id., at 1039</citedDecision> (emphasis added), the Court determined that a broad presumption of federal jurisdiction combined with a simple mechanism by which state courts could clarify their intent to rely on state grounds would best “provide state judges with a clearer opportunity to develop state *769 jurisprudence unimpeded by federal interference, and yet will preserve the integrity of federal law,” <citedDecision>id., at 1041</citedDecision> .  Today’s decision needlessly resurrects the piecemeal approach eschewed by <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> and, as a consequence, invites the intrusive and unsatisfactory federal inquiry into unfamiliar state law that <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> sought to avoid.  The Court’s decisions in this case and in Ylst v. Nunne-maker, post, p. 797, well reveal the illogic of the ad hoc approach.  In this case, to determine whether the admittedly ambiguous state-court judgment rests on an adequate and independent state ground, the Court looks to the “nature of the disposition” and the “surrounding circumstances” that “indicate]” that the basis [of the decision] was procedural default.  Ylst, post, at 802.  This method of searching for “clues” to the meaning of a facially ambiguous order is inherently indeterminate.  Tellingly, both the majority and concurring opinions in this case concede that it remains uncertain whether the state court relied on a procedural default.  See ante, at 744 (“There is no doubt that the Virginia Supreme Court’s ‘consideration’ of all filed papers adds some ambiguity”); ante, at 757-758 (White, J., concurring) (“[I]t is as though the court had said that it was granting the motion to dismiss the appeal as untimely because the federal claims were untenable and provided the court no reason to waive the default”).
**Dissenting Opinion**
 This presumption does not purport to distinguish between unexplained judgments that are entered on review of the reasoned opinion and those that are independent thereof.  The Ylst Court demonstrates the employment of the presumption by simply ignoring the judgment of the highest court of California, and by looking back to an intermediate court judgment rendered 12 years earlier to conclude that Nunnemaker’s federal claims have been procedurally defaulted.  In so concluding, the Court determines that an intervening order by the California Supreme Court, which, with citations to two state-court decisions, denied Nunne-maker’s earlier petition invoking the court’s original jurisdiction, is not “informative with respect to the question,” post, at 805, whéther a state court has considered the merits of Nunnemaker’s claims since the procedural default was recognized.  Thus, the Court dismisses two determinations of the California Supreme Court, rendered not in review of an earlier state-court judgment but as an exercise of its original jurisdiction, because it finds those determinations not “informative.  ” While the Court may comfort itself by labeling this exercise “look[ing] through,” see post, at 804, it cannot be disputed that the practice represents disrespect for the State’s determination of how best to structure its mechanisms for seeking postconviction relief.  *771 Moreover, the presumption adopted by the Ylst Court further complicates the efforts of state courts to understand and accommodate this Court’s federal habeas jurisprudence.  Under <citedDecision>Long</citedDecision> , a state court need only recognize that it must clearly express its intent to rely on a state procedural default in order to preclude federal habeas review in most cases. After today, however, a state court that does not intend to rely on a procedural default but wishes to deny a meritless petition in a summary order must now remember that its unexplained order will be ignored by the federal habeas court. Thus, the state court must review the procedural history of the petitioner’s claim and determine which state-court judgment a federal habeas court is likely to recognize.  It then must determine whether that judgment expresses the substance that the court wishes to convey in its summary order, and react accordingly.  If the previous reasoned judgment rests on a procedural default, and the subsequent court wishes to forgive that default, it now must clearly and expressly indicate that its judgment does not rest on a state procedural default.  I see no benefit in abandoning a clear rule to create chaos.  Ill Having abandoned the plain-statement rule with respect to a summary order, the majority must consider Coleman’s argument that the untimely filing of his notice of appeal was the result of attorney error of sufficient magnitude as to constitute cause for his procedural default.  In a sleight of logic that would be ironic if not for its tragic consequences, the majority concludes that a state prisoner pursuing state collateral relief must bear the risk of his attorney’s grave errors — even if the result of those errors is that the prisoner will be executed without having presented his federal claims to a federal court — because this attribution of risk represents the appropriate “allocation of costs.” Ante, at 754.  Whether unprofessional attorney conduct in a state postconviction proceeding should bar federal habeas review of a state prisoner’s *772 conviction and sentence of death is not a question of costs to be allocated most efficiently.
