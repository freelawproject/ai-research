 The State has no power to impart to him any immunity from responsibility to the supreme authority of the United States.” Id., at 159-160 .  As the complaint in the instant case alleges violations by officials of Illinois of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, it seems that the case is governed by Ex parte Young so far as injunctive relief is concerned.  The main thrust of the argument is that the.  instant case asks for relief which if granted would .affect the treasury of the State.  Most welfare decisions by federal courts have a fi *681 nancial impact on the States.  Under the existing federal-state cooperative system, a state desiring to participate, submits a “state plan” to HEW for approval; once HEW approves the plan the State is locked into the cooperative scheme until it withdraws, 3 all as described in King v. Smith, 392 U. S. 309 , 316 et seq. The welfare cases coming here have involved ultimately the financial responsibility of the State to beneficiaries claiming they were deprived of federal rights.  King v. Smith required payment to children even though their mother was co-habitating with a man who could not pass muster as a *682 “parent.” Rosado v. Wyman, <citedDecision>397 U. S. 397</citedDecision> , held that under this state-federal cooperative program a State could not reduce its standard of need in conflict with the federal standard.  It is true that <citedDecision>Rosado</citedDecision> did not involve retroactive payments as are involved here.  But the distinction is not relevant or material because the result in every welfare case coming here is to increase or reduce the financial responsibility of the participating State.  In no case when the responsibility of the State is increased to meet the lawful demand of the beneficiary, is there any levy on state funds.  Whether the decree is prospective only or requires payments for the weeks or months wrongfully skipped over by the state officials, the nature of the impact on the state treasury is precisely the same.  We have granted relief in other welfare cases which included retroactive assistance benefits or payments.  In State Dept. of Health and Rehabilitative Services v. Zarate, 407 U. S. 918 , the sole issue presented to us 4 was whether the Eleventh Amendment barred a judgment against state officers for retroactive welfare assistance benefits or payments.  That had been ordered by the lower court and we summarily affirmed, only Mr. Justice White voting to note probable jurisdiction.

 The lower court’s opinion is found in 347 F. Supp. 1004 .  The jurisdictional statement had as its second question the following: “Whether a federal court is precluded by the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution from ordering a state agency to pay money from the state treasury and from further ordering the state agency to perform certain specified acts which would otherwise be in the discretion of the agency.” The lower court’s opinion is found in 304 F. Supp. 717 .  Retroactive payments were challenged in question 2 of the jurisdictional statement.  Id., at 338 n. 5.  The award of money damages was alleged to be a violation of the Eleventh Amendment in Part V of the jurisdictional statement.  The jurisdictional statement in the Sterrett case explicitly urged that the decree below violated the Eleventh Amendment since it would expend itself on the public treasury — the second question in the jurisdictional statement.  We settled in Rosado v. Wyman, <citedDecision>397 U. S. 397</citedDecision> , the question whether the grant of authority under the Social Security Act to HEW to cut off federal funds for noncompliance with statutory requirements provides the exclusive procedure and remedy for violations of the Act.  We said: “We are most reluctant to assume Congress has closed the avenue of effective judicial review to those individuals most directly affected by the administration of its program,” <citedDecision>Id., at 420</citedDecision> .
