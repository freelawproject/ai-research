<author id="b515-4">Mr. Justice Rehnquist</author>
<p id="AAK">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b515-5">This lawsuit began when the State of Oregon sued Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel Co., an Oregon corporation, to settle the ownership of certain lands underlying the Willamette River. The Willamette is a navigable river, and this land is located near Corvallis, Oregon. The river is not an interstate boundary.</p>
<p id="b515-6">Corvallis Sand had been digging in the disputed part of the riverbed for 40 to 50 years without a lease from the State. The State brought an ejectment action against Corvallis Sand, seeking to recover 11 separate parcels of riverbed, as well as damages for the use of the parcels. The State’s complaint alleged that by virtue of its sovereignty it was the owner in fee simple of the disputed portions of the riverbed, and that it was entitled to immediate possession and damages. Corvallis Sand denied the State’s ownership of the bed.</p>
<p id="b516-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="366">*366</page-number>Each party was partially successful in the Oregon courts,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we granted cross petitions for certiorari. 423 U. S. 1048. Those courts understandably felt that our recent decision in <em>Bonelli Cattle Co. </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>414 U. S. 313 (1973), required that they ascertain and apply principles of federal common law to the controversy. Twenty-six States have joined in three <em>amicus </em>briefs urging that we reconsider <em>Bonelli, supra, </em>because of what they assert is its significant departure from long-established precedent in this Court.</p>
<p id="b516-5">I</p>
<p id="b516-6">The nature of the litigation and the contentions of the parties may be briefly stated. Title to two distinct portions of land has been at issue throughout. The first of these portions has apparently been within the bed of the Willamette River since Oregon’s admission into the Union.</p>
<p id="b516-7">The other portion of the land underlies the river in an area known as Fischer Cut, which was not a part of the riverbed at the time Oregon was admitted to the Union. The trial'court found that prior to a flood which occurred in November 1909, the Willamette flowed around a peninsula-like formation known as Fischer Island, but that by 1890 a clearly discernible overflow channel across the neck of the peninsula had developed. Before 1909 this channel carried <page-number citation-index="1" label="367">*367</page-number>the flow of the river only at its intermediate or high stages, and the main channel of the river continued to flow around Fischer Island. But in November 1909, a major flood, in the words of the Oregon trial court, “suddenly and with great force and violence converted Fischer Cut into the main channel of the river.”</p>
<p id="b517-4">The trial court, sitting without a jury, awarded all parcels in dispute, except for the Fischer Cut lands, to the State. That court found that the State had acquired sovereign title to those lands upon admission into the Union, and that it had not conveyed that title. The State was also awarded damages to recompense it for Corvallis Sand’s use of the lands.</p>
<p id="b517-5">With respect to the Fischer Cut lands, the trial court found that avulsion, rather than accretion, had caused the change in the channel of the river, and therefore the title to the lands remained in Corvallis Sand, the original owner of the land before it became riverbed.</p>
<p id="b517-6">The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed. That court felt bound, under <em>Bonelli, </em>to apply federal common law to the resolution of this property dispute. In so doing, the court found that the trial court’s award of Fischer Cut to Corvallis Sand was correct either under the theory of avulsion, or under the so-called exception to the accretion rule, announced in <em>Commissioners </em>v. <em>United States, </em>270 F. 110 (CA8 1920).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court, finding that preservation of the State’s <page-number citation-index="1" label="368">*368</page-number>interest in navigation, fishing, and other related goals did not require that it acquire ownership of the new bed, rejected the argument that the State’s sovereign title to a riverbed follows the course of the river as it moves.</p>
<p id="b518-5">II</p>
<p id="b518-6">In this Court, Oregon urges that we either modify <em>Bonelli or </em>expound “federal common law” in such a way that its title to all the land in question will be established. Corvallis Sand urges that we interpret “federal common law” in such a manner that it will prevail. <em>Amici, </em>as previously noted, urge that we re-examine <em>Bonelli </em>because in their view that case represented a sharp break with well-established previous decisions of the Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b518-7">The dispute in <em>Bonelli </em>was over the ownership of the former bed of the Colorado River, a bed which the river had abandoned because of a federal rechanneling project. The Bonelli land was not part of the actual riverbed, however, either at the time Arizona was admitted to the Union, or at the time of suit. Before Arizona had been admitted as a <page-number citation-index="1" label="369">*369</page-number>State, Bonelli’s predecessor in title had received a United States patent to the land. Over a period of years the Colorado River had migrated gradually eastward, eroding its east bank and depositing alluvion on its west bank in the process. In the course of this movement of the river the Bonelli land, which had at the time of patent been on the east bank, was submerged, and, until the rechanneling project, most of it was under water. After the completion of the rechanneling project the bed of the Colorado River was substantially narrowed, and the Bonelli land re-emerged.</p>
<p id="b519-4">The Supreme Court of Arizona held that Arizona owned the title to the beds of navigable rivers within its borders, and that Arizona therefore acquired title to the Bonelli land when it became part of the riverbed as a result of the eastward migration of the Colorado. That court went on to hold that under state law the re-emergence of the land was an avulsive change, which did not divest the State of its title to the exposed land. This Court granted certiorari and reversed the Supreme Court of Arizona.</p>
<p id="b519-5">We phrased the critical inquiry in <em>Bonelli </em>in these words:</p>
<blockquote id="AGmr">“The issue before us is not what rights the State has accorded private [land] owners in lands which the State holds as sovereign; but, rather, <em>how far </em>the State’s sovereign right extends under the equal-footing doctrine and the Submerged Lands Act — whether the State retains title to the lands <em>formerly </em>beneath the stream of the Colorado River <em>or whether that title is defeasible by the withdrawal of those waters.” </em>414 U. S., at 319-320. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
<p id="b519-6">We held that federal common law should govern in deciding whether a State retained title to lands which had reemerged from the bed of a navigable stream, relying in part on <em>Borax, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>296 U. S. 10 (1935)., That case held that the extent and validity of a federal grant was a question to be resolved by federal law, and in <em>Bonelli </em><page-number citation-index="1" label="370">*370</page-number>we decided that the nature of the title conferred by the equal-footing doctrine set forth hr <em>Pollard’s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hagan, </em>3 How. 212 (1845), should likewise be governed by federal common law. Under the equal-footing doctrine “the new States since admitted have the same rights, sovereignty and jurisdiction ... as the original States possess within their respective borders.” <em>Mumford </em>v. <em>Wardwell, </em>6 Wall. 423, 436 (1867). <em>Pollard’s Lessee </em>held that under the equal-footing doctrine new States, upon their admission to the Union, acquire title to the lands underlying navigable waters within their boundaries.</p>
<p id="b520-5">We went on to discuss the nature of the sovereign’s interest in the riverbed, which we found to lie in the protection of navigation, fisheries, and similar purposes. We held that under federal common law, as we construed it in that case, Arizona’s sovereign interest in the re-emerged land was not sufficient to enable it to retain title. We found the principle governing title to lands which have been formed by accretion, rather than that which governs title where there has been an avulsive change in the channel of the river, to be applicable. We chose the former because it would both ensure the riparian owner access to the water’s edge and prevent the State from receiving a windfall. We therefore decided that Bonelli, as riparian owner, was entitled to the land in question.</p>
<p id="b520-6">Our analysis today leads us to conclude that our decision to apply federal common law in <em>Bonelli </em>was incorrect. We first summarize the basis for this conclusion, and then elaborate in greater detail in Parts III and IV, <em>infra.</em></p>
<p id="b520-7">The title to the land underlying the Colorado River at the time Arizona was admitted to the Union vested in the State as of that date under the rule of <em>Pollard’s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hagan, supra. </em>Although federal law may fix the initial boundary line between fast lands and the riverbeds at the time of a State’s admission to the Union, the State’s title <page-number citation-index="1" label="371">*371</page-number>to the riverbed vests absolutely as of the time of its admission and is not subject to later defeasance by operation of any doctrine of federal common law. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>13 Pet. 498 (1839); <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Harbor Comm’rs, </em>18 Wall. 57 (1873).</p>
<p id="b521-4">Bonelli’s thesis that the equal-footing doctrine would require the effect of a movement of the river upon title to the riverbed to be resolved under federal common law was in error. Once the equal-footing doctrine had vested title to the riverbed in Arizona as of the time of its admission to the Union, the force of that doctrine was spent; it did not operate after that date to determine what effect on titles the movement of the river might have. Our error, as we now see it, was to view the equal-footing doctrine enunciated in <em>Pollard’s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hagan </em>as a basis upon which federal common law could supersede state law in the determination of land titles. Precisely the contrary is true; in <em>Pollard’s Lessee </em>itself the equal-footing doctrine resulted in the State’s acquisition of title notwithstanding the efforts of the Federal Government to dispose of the lands in question in another way.</p>
<p id="b521-5">The equal-footing doctrine did not, therefore, provide a basis for federal law to supersede the State’s application of its own law in deciding title to the Bonelli land, and state law should have been applied unless there were present some other principle of federal law requiring state law to be displaced. The only other basis<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for a colorable claim <page-number citation-index="1" label="372">*372</page-number>of federal right in <em>Bonelli </em>was that the Bonelli land had originally been patented to its predecessor by the United States, just as had most other land in the Western States. But that land had long been in private ownership and, hence, under the great weight of precedent from this Court, subject to the general body of state property law. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Jackson, supra, </em>at 517. Since the application of federal common law is required neither by the equal-footing doctrine nor by any other claim of federal right, we now believe that title to the Bonelli land should have been governed by Arizona law, and that the disputed ownership of the lands in the bed of the Willamette River in this case should be decided solely as a matter of Oregon law.</p>
<p id="b522-5">Ill</p>
<p id="b522-6"><em>Pollard’s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hagan, supra, </em>holds that the State receives absolute title to the beds of navigable waterways within its boundaries upon admission to the Union, and contains not the slightest suggestion that such title is “defeasible” in the technical sense of that term. The issue there was whether a federal patent, issued after the admission of Alabama to the Union, could validly convey lands that had underlain navigable waters upon Alabama’s admission. The Court had before it the following jury charge, given in the ejectment action below:</p>
<blockquote id="b522-7">“[T]hat if [the jury] believed the premises sued for were below usual high water-mark, at the time <page-number citation-index="1" label="373">*373</page-number>Alabama was admitted into the union, then the act of Congress, and the patent in pursuance thereof, could give the plaintiffs no title, whether the waters had receded by the labour of man only, or by alluvion <em>. . . </em>3 How., at 220.</blockquote>
<p id="b523-5">The Court regarded the case as one of signal importance, and it observed that the decision was approached “with' a just sense of its great importance to all the states of the union, and particularly to the new ones.” <em>Ibid. </em>Mr. Justice Catron, in his dissenting opinion, commented that he deemed the case “the most important controversy ever brought before this court, either as it respects the amount of property involved, or the principles on which the present judgment proceeds . . . .” <em>Id., </em>at 235. The Court gave careful consideration to the role of the United States in holding the lands in question in trust for the new States, and to the recognition that the new States would be admitted “upon an equal footing, in all respects whatever . . .” with the original States. <em>Id., </em>at 224. Citing <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Waddell, </em>16 Pet. 367, 410 (1842), the Court noted that the original States held the “ 'absolute right to all their navigable waters, and the soils under them for their own common use, subject only to the rights since surrendered by the Constitution/ ” 3 How., at 229. The Court then concluded:</p>
<blockquote id="b523-6">“First, The shores of navigable waters, and the soils under them, were not granted by the Constitution to the United States, but were reserved to the states respectively. Secondly, The new states have the parné rights, sovereignty, and jurisdiction over this subject as the original states. Thirdly, The right of the United States to the public lands, and the power of Congress to make all needful rules and regulations for the sale and disposition thereof, conferred no power to grant to the plaintiffs the land in controversy . . . .” <em>Id., </em>at 230.</blockquote>
<p id="b524-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="374">*374</page-number>In so holding, the Court established the absolute title of the States to the beds of navigable waters, a title which neither a provision in the Act admitting the State to the Union<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> nor a grant from Congress to a third party was capable of defeating.</p>
<p id="b524-5">Thus under <em>Pollard’s Lessee </em>the State’s title to lands underlying navigable waters within its boundaries is conferred not by Congress but by the Constitution itself. The rule laid down in <em>Pollard’s Lessee </em>has been followed in an unbroken line of cases which make it clear that the title thus acquired by the State is absolute so far as any federal principle of land titles is concerned. For example, in <em>Weber </em>v. <em>Harbor Comm’rs, </em>18 Wall., at 65-66, the Court reaffirmed the doctrine of <em>Pollard’s Lessee:</em></p>
<blockquote id="b524-6">“Upon the admission of California into the Union upon equal footing with the original States, <em>absolute property in, and dominion and sovereignty over, all soils under the tidewaters within her limits passed to the State, with the consequent right to dispose of the title to any part of said soils in such manner as she might deem proper, </em>subject only to the paramount right of navigation over the waters . . . .” (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
<p id="b524-7">In <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Keokuk, </em>94 U. S. 324, 338 (1877), the Court extended the doctrine to waters which were nontidal but nonetheless navigable, consistent with its earlier extension of admiralty jurisdiction to such waters in <em>The Propeller </em><page-number citation-index="1" label="375">*375</page-number><em>Genesee Chief </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh, </em>12 How. 443 (1852). And in <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>152 U. S. 1 (1894), the Court recounted <em>in extenso </em>the many cases which had followed the doctrine of <em>Pollard’s Lessee. </em>In summarizing its holding, 152 U. S., at 57-58, the Court stated:</p>
<blockquote id="b525-4">“The new States admitted into the Union since the adoption of the Constitution have the same rights as the original States in the tide waters, and in the lands under them, within their respective jurisdictions. The title and rights of riparian or littoral proprietors in the soil below [the] high water mark, therefore, are governed by the laws of the several States, subject to the rights granted to the United States by the Constitution.”</blockquote>
<p id="b525-5">At the time of our decision in <em>Bonelli, </em>this line of authority stood side by side with, and was wholly consistent with, other cases requiring the application of federal law to questions of land titles or boundaries. Where Mexico had patented tidal lands to a private owner before ceding to the United States the territory which ultimately became the State of California, California did not succeed to the ownership of such lands upon her admission to the Union. <em>Knight </em>v. <em>United States Land Assn., </em>142 U. S. 161 (1891). If a navigable stream is an interstate boundary, this Court, in the exercise of its original jurisdiction over suits between States, has necessarily developed a body of federal common law to determine the effect of a change in the bed of the stream on the boundary. See, <em>e. g., Nebraska </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>143 U. S. 359 (1892); <em>Arkansas </em>v. <em>Tennessee, </em>246 U. S. 158 (1918). Congress possesses by virtue of its commerce power a “navigational servitude” with respect to navigable waters.</p>
<blockquote id="b525-6">“All navigable waters are under the control of the United States for the purpose of regulating and improving navigation, and although the title to the shore and submerged soil is in the various States and individual <page-number citation-index="1" label="376">*376</page-number>owners under them, it is always subject to the servitude in respect of navigation created in favor of the Federal government by the Constitution.” <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>166 U. S. 269, 271-272 (1897).</blockquote>
<p id="b526-5">In <em>Borax, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>296 U. S. 10 (1935), this Court also found a basis to apply federal law, but its rationale does not dictate a different result in this case. In <em>Borax, </em>the city of Los Angeles brought suit to quiet title in certain land in Los Angeles Harbor. Los Angeles claimed the land under a grant from the State of California, whereas Borax, Ltd., claimed the land as a successor in interest to a federal patentee. The federal patent had purported to convey a specified quantity of land, 18.88 acres, according to a survey by the General Land Office. This Court recognized that if the patent purported to convey lands which were part of the tidelands, the patent would be invalid to that extent since the Federal Government has no power to convey lands which are rightfully the State’s under the equal-footing doctrine. <em>Id., </em>at 17-19. The Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals to remand for a new trial to allow the city to attempt to prove that some portion of the lands described in the federal patent was in fact tideland.</p>
<p id="b526-6">The Court went on to hold that the boundary between the upland and tideland was to be determined by federal law. <em>Id., </em>at 22. This same principle would require that determination of the initial boundary between a riverbed, which the State acquired under the equal-footing doctrine, and riparian fast lands likewise be decided as a matter of federal law rather than state law. But that determination is solely for the purpose of fixing the boundaries of the riverbed acquired by the State at the time of its admission to the Union; thereafter the role of the equal-footing doctrine is ended, and the land is subject to the laws of the State. The expressions in <em>Bonelli </em>suggesting a more ex<page-number citation-index="1" label="377">*377</page-number>pansive role for the equal-footing doctrine are contrary to the line of cases following <em>Pollard’s </em>Lessee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b527-4">For example, this Court has held that subsequent changes in the contour of the land, as well as subsequent transfers of the land, are governed by the state law. <em>Joy </em>v. <em>St. Louis, </em>201 U. S. 332, 343 (1906). Indeed, the rule that lands once having passed from the Federal Government are subject to the laws of the State in which they lie antedates <em>Pollard’s Lessee. </em>As long ago as 1839, the Court said:</p>
<blockquote id="b527-5">“We hold the true principle to be this, that whenever the question in any Court, state or federal, is, <em>whether </em>a title to land which had once been the property of the United States has passed, that question must be resolved by the laws of the United States; but that <em>whenever, </em>according to those laws, <em>the title shall have passed, </em>then that property, like all other property in the state, is <em>subject to state legislation; </em>so far as that legislation is consistent with the admission that the title passed and vested according to the laws of the United States.” <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>13 Pet., at 517. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>
<p id="b528-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="378">*378</page-number>The contrary approach would result in a perverse application of the equal-footing doctrine. An original State would be free to choose its own legal principles to resolve property disputes relating to land under its riverbeds; a subsequently admitted State would be <em>constrained </em>by the equal-footing doctrine to apply the federal common-law rule, which may result in property law determinations antithetical to the desires of that State. See <em>Bonelli, 414 </em>U. S., at 332-333 (Stewart, J., dissenting).</p>
<p id="b528-5">Thus, if the lands at issue did pass under the equal-footing doctrine, state title is not subject to defeasance and state law governs subsequent dispositions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b528-6">IV</p>
<p id="b528-7">A similar result obtains in the case of riparian lands which did not pass under the equal-footing doctrine. This Court has consistently held that state law governs issues relating to this property, like other real property, unless some other principle of federal law requires a different result.</p>
<p id="b528-8">Under our federal system, property ownership is not governed by a general federal law, but rather by the laws of the several States. “The great body of law in this country which controls acquisition, transmission, and transfer of property, and defines the rights of its owners in relation to the state or to private parties, is found in the statutes and decisions of the state.” <em>Davies Warehouse Co. </em>v. <em>Bowles, </em>321 U. S. 144, 155 (1944). This is particularly true with respect <page-number citation-index="1" label="379">*379</page-number>to real property, for even when federal common law was in its heyday under the teachings of <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>16 Pet. 1 (1842), an exception was carved out for the local law of real property. <em>Id., </em>at 18. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Little Lake Misere Land Co., </em>412 U. S. 580, 591 (1973).</p>
<p id="b529-4">This principle applies to the banks and shores of waterways, and we have consistently so held. <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Keokuk, </em>94 U. S. 324 (1877), involved an ejectment action by the plaintiff against the city involving certain land along the banks of the Mississippi River. After noting that the early state doctrines regarding the ownership of the soil of nontidal waters were based upon the then-discarded English view that nontidal waters were presumed nonnavigable, the Court clearly articulated the rule that the States could formulate, and modify, rules of riparian ownership as they saw fit:</p>
<blockquote id="b529-5">“Whether, as rules of property, it would now be safe to change these doctrines [arising out of the confusion of the original classification of nontidal waters as non-navigable] where they have been applied, as before remarked, is for the several States themselves to determine. If they choose to resign to the riparian proprietor rights which properly belong to them in their sovereign capacity, it is not for others to raise objections. In our view of the subject the correct principles were laid down in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Waddell, </em>16 Pet. 367, <em>Pollard’s Lessee </em>v. <em>Hagan, </em>3 How. 212, and <em>Goodtitle </em>v. <em>Kibbe, </em>9 <em>id. </em>471. These cases related to tide-water, it is true; but they enunciate principles which are equally applicable to all navigable waters.” <em>Id., </em>at 338.</blockquote>
<p id="b529-6">In <em>Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>the Court canvassed its previous decisions and emphasized that state law controls riparian ownership. The Court concluded that grants by Congress of land bordering navigable waters “leave the question of the use of the shores by the owners of uplands to the sovereign control of each State, subject only to the rights <page-number citation-index="1" label="380">*380</page-number>vested by the Constitution in the United States.” 152 U. S., at 58. As the Court again emphasized in <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>137 U. S. 661, 669 (1891):</p>
<blockquote id="b530-5">“ [W]hatever incidents or rights attach to the ownership of property conveyed by the government will be determined by the States, subject to the condition that their rules do not impair the efficacy of the grants or the use and enjoyment of the property by the grantee.”</blockquote>
<p id="b530-6">This doctrine was squarely applied to the case of a riparian proprietor in <em>Joy </em>v. <em>St. Louis, </em>201 U. S. 332 (1906). The land at issue had originally been granted to the patentee’s predecessor by Spain, and Congress had confirmed the grant and issued letters patent. This Court held that the fact that a plaintiff claimed accretions to land patented to his predecessor by the Federal Government did not confer federal-question jurisdiction, and implicitly rejected any notion that “federal common law” <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had any application to the resolution. Central to this result was the holding:</p>
<blockquote id="b530-7">“As this land in controversy is not the land described <page-number citation-index="1" label="381">*381</page-number>in the letters patent or the [A]cts of Congress, but, as is stated in the petition, is formed by accretions or gradual deposits from the river, whether such land belongs to the plaintiff is, under the cases just cited, a matter of local or state law, and not one arising under the laws of the United States.” <em>Id., </em>at 343.</blockquote>
<p id="b531-4">V</p>
<p id="b531-5">Upon full reconsideration of our decision in <em>Bonelli, </em>we conclude that it was wrong in treating the equal-footing doctrine as a source of federal common law after that doctrine had vested title to the riverbed in the State of Arizona as of the time of its admission to the Union. We also think there was no other basis in that case, nor is there any in this case, to support the application of federal common law to override state real property law. There are obviously institutional considerations which we must face in deciding whether for that reason to overrule <em>Bonelli </em>or to adhere to it, and those considerations cut both ways. Substantive rules governing the law of real property are peculiarly subject to the principle of <em>stare decisis. </em>See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Title Ins. Co., </em>265 U. S. 472 (1924).</p>
<p id="b531-6">Here, however, we are not dealing with substantive property law as such, but rather with an issue substantially related to the constitutional sovereignty of the States. In cases such as this, considerations of <em>stare decisis </em>play a less important role than they do in cases involving substantive property law. Cf. <em>The Passenger Cases, 7 </em>How. 283, <page-number citation-index="1" label="382">*382</page-number>470 (1849) (Taney, C. J., dissenting); <em>Burnet </em>v. <em>Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co., </em>285 U. S. 393, 405-411 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting); <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Allwright, </em>321 U. S. 649 (1944). Even if we were to focus on the effect of our decision upon rules of substantive property law, our concern for unsettling titles would lead us to overrule <em>Bonelli, </em>rather than to retain it. See <em>Minnesota Co. </em>v. <em>National Co., </em>3 Wall. 332, 334 (1866). Since one system of resolution of property disputes has been adhered to from 1845 until 1973, and the other only for the past three years, a return to the former would more closely conform to the expectations of property owners than would adherence to the latter. We are also persuaded that, in large part because of the positions taken in the briefs presented to the Court in <em>Bonelli, </em>the <em>Bonelli </em>decision was not a deliberate repudiation of all the cases which had gone before. We there proceeded on the view, which we now think to have been mistaken, that <em>Borax, supra, </em>should be read so expansively as to in effect overrule <em>sub silentio </em>the line of eases following <em>Pollard’s Lessee.</em></p>
<p id="b532-5">For all of these reasons, we have now decided that Bonelli’s application of federal common law to cases such as this must be overruled.</p>
<p id="b532-6">The judgment under review is vacated, and the case remanded to the Supreme Court of Oregon for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>
<p id="b532-7">
<em>It is so ordered.</em>
</p>

<p id="b516-8"> The case was brought and tried in the Circuit Court of Benton County, Ore. Both parties appealed from the judgment rendered by that court to the Oregon Court of Appeals. Subsequent to that judgment, our decision in <em>Bonelli Cattle Co. </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>414 U. S. 313 (1973), had come down and the Court of Appeals employed the reasoning of <em>Bonelli </em>in deciding the appeal. Both parties then sought review in the Supreme Court of Oregon, which granted discretionary review limited to the factual question of the length of a channel known as Fischer Cut, modified the Court of Appeals’ decision in this respect, and, without discussion, affirmed the decision “[i]n all other respects.” Because of this procedural history we shall, as a matter of convenience, refer in the course of this opinion to rulings and findings of the “Oregon courts."</p>

<p id="b517-7"> The court quoted the following language from <em>Commissioners </em>in support of that rule:</p>
<blockquote id="b517-8">“1 [The accretion rule] is applicable to and governs cases where the boundary line, the thread of the stream, by the slow and gradual processes of erosion and accretion creeps across the intervening space between its old and its new location. To this rule, however, there is a well-established and rational exception. It is that, where a river changes its main channel, not by excavating, passing over, and then filling the intervening place between its old and its new main channel, but by flowing around this intervening land, which never becomes in the meantime its main channel, <page-number citation-index="1" label="368">*368</page-number>and the change from the old to the new main channel is wrought during many years by the gradual or occasional increase from year to year of the proportion of the waters of the river passing over the course which eventually becomes the new main channel, and the decrease from year to year of the proportion of its waters passing through the old main channel until the greater part of its waters flow through the new main channel, the boundary line between the estates remains in the old channel subject to such changes in that channel as are wrought by erosion or accretion while the water in it remains a running stream. . . ” 18 Ore. App. 524, 539-540, 526 P. 2d 469, 477 (1974).</blockquote>

<p id="b518-10"> The dissenting opinion is correct in stating that neither party in its brief requested that <em>Bonelli </em>be overruled. That question was elaborately briefed by <em>amici, </em>however, and counsel were questioned about it during oral argument. Counsel for <em>amici </em>urged that <em>Bonelli </em>be overruled. Counsel for the State agreed that a re-examination of <em>Bonelli </em>would be appropriate, and that upon such re-examination issues such as those in this case should be left to state law. Tr. of Oral Arg. 34.</p>

<p id="b521-6"> Arizona, in its brief, also relied upon the Submerged Lands Act of 1963, 43 U. S. C. § 1301. However, as discussed in <em>Bonelli, </em>the Submerged Lands Act did not alter the scope or effect of the equal-footing doctrine, nor did it alter state property law regarding riparian ownership. The effect of the Act was merely to confirm the States’- title to the beds of navigable waters within their boundaries as against any claim of the United States Government. As merely a declaration of the States’ preexisting rights in the riverbeds, nothing in the Act in any way mandates, or even indicates, that federal common law should be used to resolve <page-number citation-index="1" label="372">*372</page-number>'ownership of lands which, by the very terms of the Act, reside in the States. We recognized as much in <em>Bonelli, </em>see 414 U. S., at 318, and our references to the Act in <em>Bonelli </em>in no way indicate that it was the Act, rather than the scope of the equal-footing doctrine, which resulted in our application of federal common law:</p>
<p id="b522-9">“Since the Act does not extend to the States any interest beyond those afforded by the equal-footing doctrine, the State can no more base its claim to lands unnecessary to a navigational purpose on the Submerged Lands Act than on that doctrine.” <em>Id., </em>at 324r-325.</p>

<p id="b524-8"> The compact entered into when Alabama was admitted to the Union contained the following language: “‘[A]ll navigable waters within the said state shall for ever remain public highways, free to the citizens of said state, and of the United States, without any tax, duty, impost, or toll therefor, imposed by the said state.’. . .” 3 How., at 229. The Court found that this language merely enunciated Congress’ right to regulate commerce upon the navigable waters, similarly reserved to it with respect to the original States, and thus the language did not detract from the State’s absolute title in the bed. <em>Id., </em>at 229-230.</p>

<p id="b527-6"> <em>Amici </em>Utah and New Mexico also urge us to reconsider our decision in <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>389 U. S. 290 (1967). They advance the same reasons for such reconsideration as they do with respect to <em>Bonelli. </em>But <em>Hughes </em>was not cited by the Oregon courts below, and in <em>Bonelli </em>we expressly declined to rely upon it as a basis for our decision there, see 414 U. S., at 321 n. 11. We therefore have no occasion to address the issue. We are aware of the fact that <em>Hughes </em>gave to <em>Borax </em>the same sort of expansive construction as did <em>Bonelli, </em>but we are likewise aware that <em>Hughes </em>dealt with oeeanfront property, a fact which the Court thought sufficiently different from the usual situation so as to justify a “federal common law” rule of riparian proprietorship:</p>
<p id="b527-7">“The rule deals with waters that lap both the lands of the State and the boundaries of the international sea. This relationship, at this particular point of the marginal sea, is too close to the vital interest of the Nation in its own boundaries to allow it to be governed by any law but the 'supreme Law of the Land.’ ” 389 U. S., at 293.</p>

<p id="b528-9"> We are fortified in our conclusion that Bonelli’s equal-footing analysis was unsound by the fact that its author has likewise rejected it. The dissenting opinion of our Brother Marshall, <em>post, </em>p. 382, would sustain the result reached in <em>Bonelli </em>but on a ground explicitly avoided in the <em>Bonelli </em>opinion. The "mystery” or "puzzle” to which our Brother refers, <em>post, </em>at 384, turns out to be nonexistent; in rejecting Bonelli’s equal-footing analysis, we are simply refusing to be more Roman than the Romans. The dissent’s own abandonment of Bonelli’s <em>ratio decidendi </em>is anything but a ringing endorsement of the rule of <em>stare decisis.</em></p>

<p id="b530-8"> We think that the insistence of our dissenting Brethren that “federal common law” should be applied to a determination of title in this case, albeit not for the same reason expounded in <em>Bonelli, </em>misapprehends the meaning and significance of the term “common law” as it is used in several of our old cases.</p>
<p id="b530-9">In the generic sense of the term, the “common law” has been defined as:</p>
<p id="b530-10">“ ‘the body of those principles and rules of action, relating to the government and security of persons and property, which derive their authority solely from usages and customs of immemorial antiquity, or from the judgments and decrees of the courts recognizing, affirming and enforcing such usages and customs; and, in this sense, particularly the ancient unwritten law of England.’ ” <em>Western Union Telegraph Co. </em>v. <em>Call Pub. Co., </em>181 U. S. 92, 102 (1901) (citing Black’s Law Dictionary).</p>
<p id="b530-11">It is in this descriptive sense that the term is used in the two principal quotations relied upon in the dissenting opinion, <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>United States, </em>10 Pet. 662, 717 (1836), and <em>County of St. Clair </em>v. <em>Lovingston, </em>23 Wall. 46, 68 (1874). In the passage from <em>New Orleans, </em>the Court <page-number citation-index="1" label="381">*381</page-number>simply summarized the accepted British common-law doctrine of accretion. In <em>Lovingston, </em>the Court affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois which had rested upon the proper rule of common law, without any indication that this rule was not the law of Illinois. In light of the treatment of the subject in such later cases as <em>Barney </em>v. <em>Keokuk, Packer </em>v. <em>Bird, Shively </em>v. <em>Bowlby, </em>and <em>Joy </em>v. <em>St. Louis, </em>all discussed in the text, no “rule” requiring the application of “federal common law” to questions of riparian ownership may be deduced from <em>New Orleans </em>and <em>Lovingston. </em>See <em>post, </em>at 387-388.</p>
