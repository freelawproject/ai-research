 Nonetheless plaintiffs’ prayers for backpay were denied because any such damages would come ultimately from the city of New York and, therefore, to hold otherwise would be to “circumvenft]” the immunity conferred on municipalities by Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961).  See 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  On appeal, petitioners renewed their arguments that the Board of Education 4 was not a “municipality” within the meaning of Monroe v. Pape, supra, and that, in any event, the District Court had erred in barring a damages award against the individual defendants.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions.  The court first held that the Board of Education was not a “person” under § 1983 because “it performs a vital governmental function .  .  ., and, significantly, while it has the right to determine how the funds appropriated to it shall be spent ... , it has no final say in deciding what its appropriations shall be.” <citedDecision>532 F. 2d 259, 263</citedDecision> (1976).  The individual defendants, however, were “persons” under § 1983, even when sued solely in their official capacities.  <citedDecision>532 F. 2d, at 264</citedDecision> .  Yet, because a damages award would “have to be paid by a city that was held not to be amenable to such an action in Monroe v. Pape," a damages action against officials sued in their official capacities could not proceed.  Id., at 265 .  We granted certiorari in this case, 429 U. S. 1071 , to consider “Whether local governmental officials and/or local independent school boards are 'persons’ within the meaning of 42 U. S. C. § 1983 when equitable relief in the nature of back pay is sought against them in their official capacities?” Pet. for Cert. 8.  *663 Although, after plenary consideration, we have decided the merits of over a score of cases brought under § 1983 in which the principal defendant was a school board 5 — and, indeed, in some of which § 1983 and its jurisdictional counterpart, 28 U. S. C. § 1343 , provided the only basis for jurisdiction 6 — we indicated in Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 279 (1977), last Term that the question presented here was open and would be decided “another day.” That other day has come and we now overrule Monroe v. Pape, supra, insofar as it holds that local governments are wholly immune from suit under § 1983.  7 *664 I In Monroe v. Pape , we held that “Congress did not undertake to bring municipal corporations within the ambit of [§ 1983].” 365 U. S., at 187 .  The sole basis for this conclusion was an inference drawn from Congress’ rejection of the “Sherman amendment” to the bill which became the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13 , the precursor of § 1983.

 See, e. g., Continental T. V., Inc. v. GTE Sylvania Inc., 433 U. S. 36, 47-49 (1977); Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393 , 406 n. 1 (1932) (Brandéis, J., dissenting) (collecting cases).  Nor is this a case where we should “place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of the Court’s own error.” Girouard v. United States, 328 U. S. 61, 70 (1946).  First, Monroe v. Pape , insofar as it completely immunizes municipalities from suit under § 1983, was a departure from prior practice.  See, e. g., Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, 18 F. Cas. 393 (No. 10,336) (CC ND Ill. 1873); City of Manchester v. Leiby, 117 F. 2d 661 (CA1 1941); Hannan v. City of Haverhill, 120 F. 2d 87 (CA1 1941); Douglas v. City of Jeannette, 319 U. S. 157 (1943); Holmes v. Atlanta, 350 U. S. 879 (1955), in each of which municipalities were defendants in § 1983 suits.  59 Moreover, the constitutional de- *696 feet that led to the rejection of the Sherman amendment would not have distinguished between municipalities and school boards, each of which is an instrumentality of state administration.  See supra, at 673-682.  For this reason, our cases — decided both before and after Monroe , see n. <citedDecision>5, supra—</citedDecision> holding school boards liable in § 1983 actions are inconsistent with Monroe , especially as Monroe’s, immunizing principle was extended to suits for injunctive relief in City of Kenosha v. Bruno, 412 U. S. 507 (1973).  60 And although in many of these cases jurisdiction was not questioned, we ought not “disregard the implications of an exercise of judicial authority assumed to be proper for [100] years.” Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U. S. 294, 307 (1962); see Bank of the United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch, at 88 (Marshall, C. J.) (“Those decisions are not cited as authority .  .  .  but they have much weight, as they show that this point neither occurred to the bar or the bench”).  Thus, while we have reaffirmed Monroe without further examination on three occasions, 61 it can scarcely be said that Monroe is so consistent with the warp and woof of civil rights law as to be beyond question.  Second, the principle of blanket immunity established in Monroe cannot be cabined short of school boards.

 And such county, city, or parish, so paying, shall also be subrogated to all the plaintiff's rights under such judgment.” Id., at 749, 755.  The relevant text of the second conference substitute for the Sherman amendment is as follows: “[A]ny person or persons having knowledge that any of the wrongs conspired to be done and mentioned in the second section of this act are about to be committed, and having power to prevent or aid in preventing the same, shall neglect or refuse so to do, and such wrongful act shall be committed, such person or persons shall be liable to the person injured, or his legal representatives.” Id., at 804 (emphasis added).  The complaint was amended on September 14, 1972, to allege a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 253 , as amended, 42 U. S. C. § 2000e et seq. (1970 ed. and Supp. V).  The District Court held that the 1972 amendments to Title VII did not apply retroactively to *661 discrimination suffered prior to those amendments even when an action challenging such prior discrimination was pending on the date of the amendments.  394 F. Supp. 853, 856 (SDNY 1975).  This holding was affirmed on appeal.  <citedDecision>532 F. 2d 259, 261-262</citedDecision> (CA2 1976).  Although petitioners sought certiorari on the Title VII issue as well as the § 1983 claim, we restricted our grant of certiorari to the latter issue.  429 U. S. 1071 .  The plaintiffs alleged that New York had a city wide policy of forcing women to take maternity leave after the fifth month of pregnancy unless a city physician and the head of an employee’s agency allowed up to an additional two months of work.  Amended Complaint ¶ 28, App. 13-14.  The defendants did not deny this, but stated that this policy had been changed after suit was instituted.  Answer ¶ 13, App. 32-33.  The plaintiffs further alleged that the Board had a policy of requiring women to take maternity leave after the seventh month of pregnancy unless that month fell in the last month of the school year, in which case the teacher could remain through the end of the school term. Amended Complaint ¶¶ 39, 42, 45, App. 18-19, 21.  This allegation was denied.  Answer ¶¶ 18, 22, App. 35, 37.  Amended Complaint ¶ 24, App. 11-12.  Petitioners conceded that the Department of Social Services enjoys the same status as New York City for Monroe purposes.  See <citedDecision>532 F. 2d, at 263</citedDecision> .  Milliken v.

However, we do uphold Monroe v. Pape insofar as it holds that the doctrine of respondeat superior is not a basis for rendering municipalities *664 liable under § 1983 for the constitutional torts of their employees.  See Part II, infra.  We expressly declined to consider “policy considerations” for or against municipal liability.  See 365 U. S., at 191.


**Dissenting Opinion**
 At the same time, the doctrine of municipal immunity enunciated in Monroe has protected municipalities and their limited treasuries from the consequences of their officials’ failure to predict the course of this Court’s constitutional jurisprudence.  None of the Members of this Court can foresee the practical consequences of today’s removal of that protection.  Only the Congress, which has the benefit of the advice of every segment of this diverse Nation, is equipped to consider the results of such a drastic change in the law. It seems all but inevitable that it will find it necessary to do so after today’s decision.  I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  As we pointed out in Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v. Doyle, 429 U. S. 274, 278-279 (1977), the existence of a claim for relief under § 1983 is “jurisdictional” for purposes of invoking 28 U. S. C. § 1343 , even though the existence of a meritorious constitutional claim is not similarly required in order to invoke jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. § 1331 .  See Bell v. Hood, 327 U.S. 678, 682 (1946).  The other statutes cited by the Court, ante, at 697-699, n. 63, make no mention of § 1983, but refer generally to suits against “a local educational agency.” As noted by the Court of Appeals, <citedDecision>532 F. 2d 259, 264-266</citedDecision> , such suits may be maintained against board members in their official capacities *717 for injunctive relief under either § 1983 or Ex parte Young, 209 U. S. 123 (1908).  Congress did not stop to consider the technically proper avenue of relief, but merely responded to the fact that relief was being granted.  The practical result of choosing the avenue suggested by petitioners would be the subjection of school corporations to liability in damages.  Nothing in recent congressional history even remotely supports such a result.  I find it somewhat ironic that, in abandoning the supposedly ill-considered holding of Monroe , my Brother Powell relies heavily upon cases involving school boards, although he admits that “the exercise of § 1983 jurisdiction .  .  .
