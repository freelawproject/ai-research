 the mortgagee or trustee or holder of the notes secured by such mortgage or deed of trust shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account of such mortgage, deed of trust or obligation secured by the same: .  .  .  .” The Superior Court overruled the demurrer, and an appeal to the Supreme Court of North Carolina followed.  Bullington supported his Superior Court judgment on the ground that the United States Constitution precluded North Carolina from shutting the doors of its courts to him.  The North Carolina Supreme Court, holding that the North Carolina Act of 1933 barred Bullington’s suit against Angel, reversed the Superior Court and dismissed the action.  <citedDecision>220 N. C. 18</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>16 S. E. 2d 411</citedDecision> .  Bullington did not seek to review this judgment here.  Instead, he sued Angel for the deficiency in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina.  Angel pleaded in bar the judgment in the North Carolina action.  The District Court gave judgment for Bullington, 56 F. Supp. 372 , and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed.  150 F. 2d 679 .  We granted certiorari, 326 U. S. 713 , because the failure *186 to dismiss this action, on the ground that the judgment in the North Carolina court precluded the right thereafter to recover on the same cause of action in the federal court, presented an important question in the administration of justice.

 Bullington sought a deficiency judgment.  Angel, by demurrer, resisted on the ground that a North Carolina statute precluded a deficiency judgment.  The North Carolina Supreme Court, reversing the trial court, found the North Carolina statute a bar to such a suit.  It said that “the limitation created by the statute is upon the jurisdiction of the court in that it is declared that the holder of notes given to secure the purchase price of real property 'shall not be entitled to a deficiency judgment on account’ thereof.  This closes the courts of this State to one who seeks a deficiency judgment on a note given for the purchase price of real property.  The statute operates upon the adjective law of the State, which pertains to the practice and procedure, *188 or legal machinery by which the substantive law is made effective, and not upon the substantive law itself.  It is a limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts of this State.” <citedDecision>220 N. C. 18, 20</citedDecision> , <citedDecision>16 S. E. 2d 411, 412</citedDecision> .  But the allowable “limitation of the jurisdiction of the courts” of North Carolina presents more than a question of local law for determination by the North Carolina Supreme Court. Speaking for a unanimous Court, Mr. Justice Brandeis thus expressed the subordination to the requirements of the Constitution of the power of a State to withdraw jurisdiction from its courts: “The power of a State to determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the controversies which shall be heard in them is, of course, subject to the restrictions imposed by the Federal Constitution.” McKnett v. St. Louis & S. F. Ry. Co., 292 U. S. 230, 233 .  The Contract Clause, the Full Faith and Credit Clause, the Privileges or Immunities Clause, all fetter the freedom of a State to deny access to its courts howsoever much it may regard such withdrawal of jurisdiction “the adjective law of the State,” or the exercise of its right to regulate “the practice and procedure” of its courts.  Broderick v. Rosner, 294 U. S. 629, 642 .  A State “cannot escape its constitutional obligations by the simple device of denying jurisdiction in such cases to courts otherwise competent.” Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, 252 U. S. 411, 415 ; and see White v. Hart, 13 Wall. 646 .  This pervasive principle of our federal law, constitutional and statutory, was thus put by Mr. Justice Holmes: “ Whatever springes the State may set for those who are endeavoring to assert rights that the State confers, the assertion of federal rights, when plainly and reasonably made, is not to be defeated under the name of local practice.” Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U. S. 22, 24 .  4.
