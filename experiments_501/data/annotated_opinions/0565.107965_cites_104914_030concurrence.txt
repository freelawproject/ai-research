**Concurrence Opinion**
 But whatever may be thought of the redundant discourse before us it had no chance of starting a present conflagration.  If in the long run the beliefs expressed in proletarian dictatorship are destined to be accepted by the dominant forces of the community, the only meaning of free speech is that they should be given their chance and have their way.” We have never been faithful to the philosophy of that dissent.  *453 The Court in Herndon v. Lowry, 301 U. S. 242 , overturned a conviction for exercising First Amendment rights to incite insurrection because of lack of evidence of incitement.  Id., at 259-261 .  And see Hartzel v. United States, 322 U. S. 680 .  In Bridges v. California, 314 U. S. 252, 261-263 , we approved the “clear and present danger” test in an elaborate dictum that tightened it and confined it to a narrow category.  But in Dennis v. United States, <citedDecision>341 U. S. 494</citedDecision> , we opened wide the door, distorting the “clear and present danger” test beyond recognition.  1 In that case the prosecution dubbed an agreement to teach the Marxist creed a “conspiracy.” The case was submitted to a jury on a charge that the jury could not convict unless it found that the defendants “intended to overthrow the Government ‘as speedily as circumstances would permit.' ” <citedDecision>Id., at 509-511</citedDecision> .  The Court sustained convictions under that charge, construing it to mean a determination of ‘“whether the gravity of the “evil,” discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger.’ ” 2 <citedDecision>Id., at 510</citedDecision> , quoting from United States v. Dennis, 183 F. 2d 201, 212 .  Out of the “clear and present danger” test came other offspring.  Advocacy and teaching of forcible overthrow of government as an abstract principle is immune from prosecution.  Yates v. United States, 354 U. S. 298, 318 .  But an “active” member, who has a guilty knowledge and intent of the aim to overthrow the Government *454 by violence, Noto v. United States, 367 U. S. 290 , may be prosecuted.  Scales v. United States, 367 U. S. 203, 228 .  And the power to investigate, backed by the powerful sanction of contempt, includes the power to determine which of the two categories fits the particular witness.
