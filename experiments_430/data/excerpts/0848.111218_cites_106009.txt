 See ibid.; Griffith, supra, at 103 .  n. 6.  109.  Although the plaintiff apparently never acquiesced in the resale price maintenance scheme, Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 182 F. 2d 228, 231 (CA7 1950), rev’d, 340 U. S. 211 (1951), one of the subsidiaries did gain the compliance of other wholesalers after once terminating them for refusing to abide by the pricing scheme.  See 182 F. 2d, at 231 ; 340 U. S., at 213 .  A theory of combination between the subsidiaries and the wholesalers could now support § 1 relief, whether or not it could have when Kiefer-Stewart was decided.  See Albrecht v. Herald Co., 390 U. S. 145, 149-150 , and n. 6 (1968); United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., <citedDecision>362 U. S. 29</citedDecision> (1960).  See United States v. Timken Roller Bearing Co., 83 F. Supp. 284, 311-312 (ND Ohio 1949), aff’d as modified, 341 U. S. 593 (1951).  The agreement of an individual named Dewar, who owned 24 and 50 percent of the foreign corporations respectively, was apparently required for the American defendant to have its way.  For almost 20 years before they became affiliated by stock ownership, two of the corporations had been party to the sort of restrictive agreements the Timken Court condemned.  Three Justices upholding antitrust liability were of the view that Timken’s “interests in the [foreign] companies were obtained as part of a plan to promote the illegal trade restraints” and that the “intercorporate relationship” was “the core of the conspiracy.” Id., at 600-601 .  Because two Justices found no antitrust violation at all, see id., at 605 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting); id., at 606 (Jackson, J., dissenting), and two Justices did not take part, apparently only Chief Justice Vinson and Justice Reed were prepared to hold that there was a violation even if the initial acquisition itself was not illegal.  See id., at 601-602 (Reed, J., joined by Vinson, C. J., concurring).

 This not only reduces the diverse directions in which economic power is aimed but suddenly increases the economic power moving in one particular direction.” Ante, at 769.  That is true, but it is also true of any ordinary commercial contract between separate entities, as can be seen if one substitutes the word “contract” for “conspiracy” in the passage I have quoted.  The language of the Sherman Act indicates that it treats “contracts” and “conspiracies” as equivalent concepts — both satisfy the multiplicity-of-aetors requirement — and yet one of the most fundamental points in antitrust jurisprudence, dating at least to Standard Oil, is that there is nothing inherently anticompetitive about a contract.  Similarly, an agreement to act “for common benefit” in itself is unremarkable — all agreements are in some sense a restraint of trade be they contracts or conspiracies.  It is only when trade is unreasonably restrained that § 1 is implicated.  The Court’s evidentiary concern lacks merit.  We made this point in the context of resale price maintenance in United States v. Parke, Davis & Co., <citedDecision>362 U. S. 29</citedDecision> (1960): “The Sherman Act forbids combinations of traders to suppress competition.  True, there results the same economic effect as is accomplished by a prohibited combination to suppress price competition if each customer, although induced to do so solely by a manufacturer’s announced policy, independently decides to observe specified resale prices.  So long as Colgate is not overruled, this result is tolerated but only when it is the consequence of a mere refusal to sell in the exercise of a manufacturer’s right ‘freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal.’” <citedDecision>Id.,</citedDecision> at 44 (quoting Colgate, 250 U. S., at 307 ).  “[lit is the potential which this conspiracy concept holds for the development of a rational enforcement policy which, if anything, will ultimately attract the courts.  If conduct of a single corporation which restrains trade were to violate Section 1, a forceful weapon would be available to the government with which to challenge conduct which in oligopolistic industries creates or reinforces entry barriers.  Excessive advertising in the cereal, drug, or detergent industries, annual style changes in the auto industry, and other such practices could be reached as soon as they threatened to inhibit competition; there would be no need to wait until a ‘dangerous probability’ of monopoly had been reached, the requirement under Section 2 ‘attempt’ doctrine.  Nor would a single firm restraint of trade rule be overbroad.  It would in no way threaten single firm activity — setting a price, deciding what market it would deal in, or the like — which did not threaten competitive conditions.” L. Sullivan, swpra n. 9, § 114, at 324 (footnotes omitted).  This was the case in Kiefer-Stewart, for example.

 Griffith simply assumed that the companies were capable of conspiring with each other; Schine cited Yellow Cab and Crescent Amusement for the proposition, 334 U. S., at 116.  In both cases, however, an intra-enterprise conspiracy holding was unnecessary not only because the Court found a § 2 violation, but also because the affiliated exhibitors had conspired with independent film distributors.  See ibid.; Griffith, supra, at 103, n. 6, 109 .  [9]  Although the plaintiff apparently never acquiesced in the resale price maintenance scheme, Kiefer-Stewart Co. v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc., 182 F. 2d 228, 231 (CA7 1950), rev'd, 340 U.
