 One hundred forty years ago, this Court found it obvious that whoever had title to the land bordering water would have title to new land formed by alluvial deposits on the existing upland: “The question is well settled at common law, that the person whose land is bounded by a stream of water, which changes its course gradually by alluvial formations, shall still hold by the same boundary, including the accumulated soil.  No other rule can be applied on just principles.  Every proprietor whose land is thus bounded is subject to loss, by the same means which may add to his territory: and as he is without remedy for his loss, in this way, he cannot be held accountable for his gain.” Ibid, (emphasis added).  This statement of the law was quoted by the Court in County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46, 68 (1874).  *387 The Court in County of St. Clair went on to note: “The riparian right to future alluvion is a vested right.  It is an inherent and essential attribute of the original property.” Ibid, (emphasis added).  Similarly, in Shively v. Bowlby, <citedDecision>152 U. S. 1</citedDecision> (1894), 6 the Court said: “The rule, everywhere admitted, that where the land encroaches upon the water by gradual and imperceptible degrees, the accretion or alluvion belongs to the owner of the land, is equally applicable to lands bounding on tide waters or on fresh waters, and to the King or the State as to private persons; and is independent of the law governing the title in the soil covered by the water.” Id., at 35 (emphasis added).  Thus, the right to such additions 7 was part of the title which passed with the federal grant, cf. 3 American Law of Property § 15.27, p. 859 (A. J. Casner ed. 1952), and was protected by federal law. By holding that state law now governs the impact of changes in the course of the bordering water on a federal riparian grant, the Court denies that “a question which concerns the validity and effect of an act done by the United States” is “necessarily a federal question.” Borax, Ltd. v. Los Angeles, 296 U. S. 10, 22 (1935).  As far as federal law is concerned, a federal riparian grant *388 is now understood to have incorporated a fixed rather than ambulatory boundary.  Ante, at 376.  The rule of New Orleans v. United States, supra, and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, supra, is discarded along with Bonelli and Hughes .  The cases the Court concludes compel this dramatic shift do not even support it.  Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498 (1839), 8 was an action of ejectment brought against the commander of a United States military post to recover part of the post.

 The plaintiff claimed title to the new land by virtue of his asserted ownership of the adjacent upland.  The Court noted that “[i]t is generally conceded that the riparian title attaches to subsequent accretions to the land effected by the gradual and imperceptible operation of natural causes.” Id., at 337 .  Whether the same rule applied to land created out of the bed of the river, however, the Court considered a question of state law. The reason for this, as the Court explained, is that the riparian rights granted by the Federal Government extended only to the water’s edge; if the States wish to grant the riparian owner rights beyond that point, they may do so at their own discretion.  See id., at 338 .  The Court transforms this conclusion that the States may, if they wish, enlarge the title granted by the Federal Government into support for the proposition that the States *390 may also restrict that title.  The transformation is impressive, but it is not logical.  The issue before the Court in <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> v. <citedDecision>Bowlby, supra,</citedDecision> was the title to land below the high-water mark of the Columbia River in Oregon.  Shively claimed under a prestatehood grant from the United States, while Bowlby based his title on a subsequent grant from the State of Oregon.  The Court held for Bowlby, finding that although Congress could have granted Shively title to the land he claimed, 11 it had not done so, nor had the State.  <citedDecision>152 U. S., at 48-57</citedDecision> .  As the majority indicates, the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court engaged in a thorough review of earlier cases. It summarized its conclusions, in part, as follows: “The title and rights of riparian or littoral proprietors in the soil below [the] high water mark, therefore, are governed by the laws of the several States, subject to the rights granted to the United States by the Constitution.” <citedDecision>Id., at 57-58</citedDecision> .  But the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court, unlike today’s majority, realized that this proposition does not affect the rights of riparian holders to the benefits of the common-law doctrines governing boundary changes.  12 Those rights are “independent of *391 the law governing the title in the soil covered by the water.” <citedDecision>Id., at 35</citedDecision> .  See <citedDecision>id., at 36</citedDecision> .  13 Thus, the cases refute the majority’s contention that the results in Hughes and Bonelli sharply departed from prior law. Today’s holding cannot, therefore, be based on interpretation of the meaning of the pre-statehood riparian grants under which Corvallis Sand & Gravel holds title, since the right to an ambulatory boundary was assumed to be part of the rights of a riparian grantee at the time the grants were made.  Moreover, the cases also demonstrate that there is no constitutional basis for today’s holding.  The only constitutional question discussed in the majority opinion is the law governing the States’ title to land beneath navigable waters, and the rights of the riparian holder are independent of that law. II Since today’s ruling cannot be a matter either of constitutional law or of interpretation of the meaning of federal grants, it must be a choice-of-law decision.  In deciding whether to formulate and apply a federal common-law rule, “normally the guiding principle is that a sig *392 nificant conflict between some federal policy or interest and the use of state law in the premises must first be specifically shown.” Wallis v. Pan American Petroleum Corp., 384 U. S. 63, 68 (1966).  See generally P. Bator, P. Mishkin, D. Shapiro, & H. Wechsler, Hart & Wechsler’s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 756-832 (2d ed. 1973).  In order to assure an informed presentation of federal policies and interests when faced with a choice between federal and state law, this Court in the past has invited the Solicitor General to file a brief amicus curiae expressing the views of the United States.

 A sudden, or avulsive, change does not effect a shift in boundaries.  These doctrines form a coherent system.  It would make no sense to hold that the federal doctrine of accretion must be applied to the benefit of a federal riparian grantee but that the federal doctrine of avulsion need not be applied.  Cited ante, at 371, 372, 377.  Cited ante, at 380.  Cited ante, at 374, 379.  The language in Pollard’s Lessee v. Hagan, 3 How. 212 (1845), on which the majority heavily relies to prove that Congress had no such power, see ante, at 372-374, was dismissed as dictum by the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court. See <citedDecision>152 U. S., at 28</citedDecision> .  The majority also quotes the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court’s statement that federal grants “ ‘leave the question of the use of the shores by the owners of uplands to the sovereign control of each State.’ ” Ante, at 379, quoting <citedDecision>152 U. S., at 58</citedDecision> .  It is clear from the context that by “shores” the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court meant the land below the high-water mark.  The State, as owner of that land, controls, it.  The Court did not suggest that the State was free to diminish the title of the upland owner by denying his right to an ambulatory boundary if the “shores” recede or the uplands grow.  The majority’s assertion that the rule of New Orleans v. United States, 10 Pet. 662 (1836), and County of St. Clair v. Lovingston, 23 Wall. 46 (1874), is merely a description of the English common law, ante, at 380-381, n. 8, is belied by the <citedDecision>Shively</citedDecision> Court’s affirmation of the independence of the riparian holder’s rights from the law governing the lands beneath the water.  The majority chooses not to discuss this aspect of Shivély.  Joy v. St. Louis, 201 U. S. 332, 342, 343 (1906), cited ante, at 377, 380, does contain language which supports the conclusions reached by the majority.  That case, however, did not involve lands in which a grantee of the United States held or claimed title.  The land in that case was granted by Spain.  Congress confirmed the grant, but by so doing it added nothing to the title conferred by Spain.  See Joy v. St. Louis, 122 P. 524 (ED Mo. 1903), aff’d, 201 U. S. 332 (1906); United States v. Washington, 294 F. 2d 830, 833 (CA9 1961), cert. denied, 369 U. S. 817 (1962).
