**Combined Opinion**
 [6] II.  The remaining question is whether the recordings that the police obtained by intercepting the petitioners' telephone conversations were admissible in evidence in the Florida trial court, notwithstanding the express prohibition of federal law against divulgence of recordings so procured.  Section 605 was enacted as part of the Federal Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1103 , six years after the Court had said in Olmstead v. United States, 277 U. S. 438, 465 , that "Congress may of course [legislate to] protect the secrecy of telephone messages by making them, when intercepted, inadmissible in evidence.  .  .  ." In Nardone v. United States, <citedDecision>302 U. S. 379</citedDecision> , the Court was first called upon to decide whether § 605 had indeed served to render evidence of intercepted communications inadmissible in a federal trial. In that case the Government urged that "a construction be given the section which would exclude federal agents since it is improbable Congress intended to hamper and impede the activities of the government in the detection and punishment of crime." <citedDecision>302 U. S., at 383</citedDecision> .  In reversing the judgment of conviction, the Court's answer to that argument was unequivocal: "[T]he plain words of § 605 forbid anyone, unless authorized by the sender, to intercept a telephone message, and direct in equally clear language that `no person' shall divulge or publish the message or its *383 substance to `any person.' To recite the contents of the message in testimony before a court is to divulge the message.  The conclusion that the act forbids such testimony seems to us unshaken by the government's arguments.  ..... "Congress may have thought it less important that some offenders should go unwhipped of justice than that officers should resort to methods deemed inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty.  The same considerations may well have moved the Congress to adopt § 605 as evoked the guaranty against practices and procedures violative of privacy, embodied in the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution." <citedDecision>302 U. S., at 382, 383</citedDecision> .  Fifteen years later, in Schwartz v. Texas, 344 U. S. 199 , the Court considered the question whether, despite § 605, telephone communications intercepted by state officers could lawfully be received in evidence in state criminal trials.  That case was decided in the shadow of Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 , which shortly before had held that "in a prosecution in a State court for a State crime the Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid the admission of evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure." 338 U. S., at 33 .  The Court in Schwartz recognized that the problem before it was "somewhat different" from the one that had been presented in Wolf , "because the introduction of the intercepted communications would itself be a violation" of federal law. 344 U. S., at 201 .  But the Court nonetheless concluded that state trial courts were not required to reject evidence violative of § 605.  For if, as Wolf had held, state courts were free to accept evidence obtained in violation of the Federal Constitution, the *384 Court reasoned that they could not be required to reject evidence obtained and divulged in violation of a federal statute.  That was the thrust of the Schwartz opinion: "Although the intercepted calls would be inadmissible in a federal court, it does not follow that such evidence is inadmissible in a state court. Indeed, evidence obtained by a state officer by means which would constitute an unlawful search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution is nonetheless admissible in a state court, Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25 , while such evidence, if obtained by a federal officer, would be clearly inadmissible in a federal court. Weeks v. United States, 232 U. S. 383 ." Ibid. The fact that a state official would be violating the express terms of the federal statute by the very act of divulging the intercepted communications as evidence for the prosecution at the trial, the Court in Schwartz said, was "simply an additional factor for a state to consider in formulating a rule of evidence for use in its own courts." Ibid. But in Benanti v. United States, 355 U. S. 96 , five years later, the Court returned to the teaching of <citedDecision>Nardone</citedDecision> in giving emphatic recognition to the language of the statute that itself makes illegal the divulgence of intercepted communications.  In Benanti the Court held inadmissible in a federal trial communications that had been intercepted by state officers.  [7] "Section 605," the Court said, "contains an express, absolute prohibition against the divulgence of intercepted communications." 355 U. S., at 102.  *385 After the Benanti decision, therefore, the only remaining support for Schwartz v. Texas, supra , was the holding in Wolf v. Colorado, supra , that state courts, unlike federal courts, were free to decide for themselves whether to condone violations of federal law by accepting the products of such violations as evidence.  That doctrinal underpinning of the Schwartz decision was, of course, completely removed by Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 , which overruled Wolf and squarely held that evidence obtained by state officers in an unreasonable search is inadmissible in a state criminal trial. In view of the <citedDecision>Nardone</citedDecision> and Benanti decisions, [8] the doctrine of Schwartz v. Texas cannot survive the demise of Wolf v. Colorado, supra .  In the Mapp case, the Court in overruling Wolf imposed a judicially devised exclusionary rule in order to insure that a State could not adopt rules of evidence calculated to permit the invasion of rights protected by federal organic law. In the present case the federal law itself explicitly protects intercepted communications from divulgence, in a court or any other place.  But the decision we reach today is not based upon language and doctrinal symmetry alone.  It is buttressed as well by the "imperative of judicial integrity." Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 222 .  [9] Under our Constitution *386 no court, state or federal, may serve as an accomplice in the willful transgression of "the Laws of the United States," laws by which "the Judges in every State [are] bound .  .

 shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby, any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding." Art. VI, U. S. Const. [11]  Compare Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, at 30-31 .  [12]  In Pugach v. Klein, 193 F. Supp. 630 , a defendant in a state criminal case attempted unsuccessfully to initiate a criminal prosecution against state officers for violations of § 605.  See also Simons v. O'Connor, 187 F. Supp. 702 (denying damages in action against state officer for violation of § 605).  There seem to be only three reported prosecutions of private individuals for violations of § 605.  United States v. Gruber, 123 F. 2d 307 ; United States v. Gris, 247 F. 2d 860 ; Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206 .  [*] Nardone v. United States, <citedDecision>302 U. S. 379</citedDecision> , established that divulgence of intercepted communications in court was a violation of § 605.  The Court went on to hold that a federal conviction resulting from such a violation was itself improper.  The Court did not, however, make it clear whether the Act required that result by its own force or the Court was simply imposing that result by virtue of its supervisory power.
