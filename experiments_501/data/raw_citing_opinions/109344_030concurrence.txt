<p id="Arh">concurring in the judgment.</p>
<p id="AGe">Being of the view that the goods involved here had lost their character as imports and that subjecting them to ad valorem taxation was consistent with the Constitution as interpreted by prior cases, including <em>Low </em>v. <em>Austin, </em><span class="citation" data-id="88429"><a href="/opinion/88429/low-v-austin/" aria-description="Citation for case: Low v. Austin">13 Wall. 29</a></span> (1872), I would affirm the judgment. There is little reason and no necessity at this time to overrule <em><span class="citation" data-id="88429"><a href="/opinion/88429/low-v-austin/" aria-description="Citation for case: Low v. Austin">Low</a></span> </em>v. <em><span class="citation" data-id="88429"><a href="/opinion/88429/low-v-austin/" aria-description="Citation for case: Low v. Austin">Austin</a></span>. </em>None of the parties has challenged that case here, and the issue of its overruling has not been briefed or argued.</p>
