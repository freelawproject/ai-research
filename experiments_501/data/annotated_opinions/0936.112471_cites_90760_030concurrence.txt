 The former option would plainly have violated the Ex Post Facto Clause because it would have increased respondent’s punishment beyond the penalty authorized at the time of his offense.  The second option, which the Texas Legislature adopted, is not subject to that defect; nor does it criminalize previously innocent conduct or make any change in the procedures used to convict or to sentence respondent.  It created a new remedy designed to conform respondent’s sentence to that authorized by law at the time of his offense.  Such legislation does not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.  The argument to the contrary is based on our cases holding that the Clause applies to procedural, as well as substantive, changes that deprive a defendant of “substantial personal rights” and a claim that respondent’s right to a new trial after an erroneous sentence was such a right.  The argument misreads our precedents and overlooks the critical importance of evaluating the procedural right at issue by reference to the time of the offense.  II In Kring v. Missouri, <citedDecision>107 U. S. 221</citedDecision> (1883), the Court rejected the argument that the Ex Post Facto Clause has no application to procedural changes.  At the time of Kring’s offense, Missouri law provided that the acceptance of a plea of guilty to second-degree murder constituted an acquittal of first-degree murder.  A subsequent amendment to the Missouri Constitution abrogated that rule and Kring was thereafter convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death.  The Missouri Supreme Court held that there was no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause because the retroactive *55 amendment was merely a procedural change.  3 This Court’s reversal of that holding demonstrates that the Clause applies to some procedural changes, but our decision rested on the fact that the change had deprived the defendant of a complete defense to the charge of first-degree murder and to the imposition of the death penalty.  We wrote: “Whatever may be the essential nature of the change, it is one which, to the defendant, involves the difference between life and death, and the retroactive character of the change cannot be denied.” <citedDecision>Id., at 224</citedDecision> .  “In the case before us the Constitution of Missouri so changes the rule of evidence, that what was conclusive evidence of innocence of the higher grade of murder when the crime was committed, namely, a judicial conviction for a lower grade of homicide, is not received as evidence at all, or, if received, is given no weight in behalf of the offender.  It also changes the punishment, for, whereas the law as it stood when the homicide was committed was that, when convicted of murder in the second degree, he could never be tried or punished by death for murder in the first degree, the new law enacts *56 that he may be so punished, notwithstanding the former conviction.” <citedDecision>Id., at 228</citedDecision> .  Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 843 (1898), involved an offense committed while Utah was a Territory, but the case was tried after Utah became a State.  At the time of the offense, the defendant was entitled to a trial by a 12-person jury, but under the new State’s law only 8 jurors were required.  We held that this retrospective procedural change deprived Thompson of “a substantial right belonging to him when the offense was committed,” and therefore violated the Ex Post Facto Clause.  “We are of opinion that the State did not acquire upon its admission into the Union the power to provide, in respect of felonies committed within its limits while it was a Territory, that they should be tried otherwise than by a jury such as is provided by the Constitution of the United States.  When Thompson’s crime was committed, it was his constitutional right to demand that his liberty should not be taken from him except by the joint action of the court and the unanimous verdict of a jury of twelve persons.  To hold that a State could deprive him of his liberty by the concurrent action of a court and eight jurors, would recognize the power of the State not only to do what the United States in respect of Thompson’s crime could not, at any time, have done by legislation, but to take from the accused a substantial right belonging to him when the offence was committed.  “It is not necessary to review the numerous cases in which the courts have determined whether particular statutes come within the constitutional prohibition of ex post facto laws.  It is sufficient now to say that a statute belongs to that class which by its necessary operation and ‘in its relation to the offence, or its consequences, alters the situation of the accused to his disadvantage.’ United States v. Hall, 2 Wash. C. C. 366 ; Kring v. Missouri, <citedDecision>107 U. S. 221, 228</citedDecision> ; Medley, Petitioner, 134 U. S. *57 160, 171 .  Of course, a statute is not of that class unless it materially impairs the right of the accused to have the question of his guilt determined according to the law as it was when the offence was committed.” Id., at 350-351.  In Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U. S. 167 (1925), we made it clear that the question whether a particular procedural change has a sufficiently drastic impact on a defendant to be characterized as “substantial” is a matter of degree.  In that case we held that the rule applied in Kring and Thompson did not preclude the retrospective application of a rule allowing two codefendants to be tried jointly for a noncapital offense.  We summarized our earlier cases construing the Ex Post Facto Clause and explained: “The constitutional prohibition and the judicial interpretation of it rest upon the notion that laws, whatever their form, which purport to make innocent acts criminal after the event, or to aggravate an offense, are harsh and oppressive, and that the criminal quality attributable to an act, either by the legal definition of the offense or by the nature or amount of the punishment imposed for its commission, should not be altered by legislative enactment, after the fact, to the disadvantage of the accused.” 269 U. S., at 170 .  “And there may be procedural changes which operate to deny to the accused a defense available under the laws in force at the time of the commission of his offense, or which otherwise affect him in such a harsh and arbitrary manner as to fall within the constitutional prohibition.  Kring v. Missouri, <citedDecision>107 U. S. 221</citedDecision> ; Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 .  But it is now well settled that statutory changes in the mode of trial or the rules of evidence, which do not deprive the accused of a defense and which operate only in a limited and unsubstantial manner to his disadvantage, are not prohibited.” Ibid. *58 “Just what alterations of procedure will be held to be of sufficient moment to transgress the constitutional prohibition cannot be embraced within a formula or stated in a general proposition.  The distinction is one of degree.  But the constitutional provision was intended to secure substantial personal rights against arbitrary and oppressive legislation, see Malloy v. South Carolina, 237 U. S. 180, 183 , and not to limit the legislative control of remedies and modes of procedure which do not affect matters of substance.” Id., at 171.  h — I » — I The foregoing cases make it clear that the mere fact that this case involves a procedural change in Texas law is not sufficient to exclude it from the coverage of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  But it is equally clear that our analysis should focus on the impact of the change upon the “right belonging to [the defendant] when the offense was committed.” Thompson, 170 U. S., at 351 .  In this case, neither the defendant’s right to a fair trial nor his right to be protected against unauthorized or excessive punishment has been impaired in the slightest by the new Texas rule.

 See, e. g., Ex parte McIver, 586 S. W. 2d 851, 854 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979); Ocker v. State, 477 S. W. 2d 288, 290 (Tex. Crim. App. 1972).  However, until the Court of Criminal Appeals decided Bogany , there was some doubt both as to whether that general rule would apply to the error in this case and as to whether the sentence imposed by the jury in this case was in fact unlawful.  See, e. g., Adams v. State, 642 S. W. 2d 211, 213-214 (Tex. App. 1982) (reforming jury’s sentence); Bogany v. State, 646 S. W. 2d 663, 664-665 (Tex. App.) (stating that jury’s sentence could be reformed), rev’d, 661 S. W. 2d 957 (Tex. Crim. App. 1983); id., at 960 (McCormick, J., dissenting) (contending that supplementary fine was authorized by law).  For purposes of this opinion, I assume that both the substantive limitation upon respondent’s sentence and the procedural limitation on the remedial powers of reviewing courts were law at the time that respondent’s offense was committed.  The Missouri Supreme Court relied upon the reasoning of the St. Louis Court of Appeals.  See State v. Kring, 74 Mo. 612, 631 (1881).  The relevant passage from the Court of Appeals opinion was quoted (and then disavowed) by this Court in Kring v. Missouri, <citedDecision>107 U. S. 221, 223-224</citedDecision> (1883): ‘“Formerly it was held in Missouri (State v. Ross, 29 Mo. 32 ) that, when a conviction is had of murder in the second degree on an indictment charging murder in the first degree, if this be set aside, the defendant cannot again be tried for murder in the first degree.  A change introduced by sect. 23 of art. 2 of the Constitution of 1875 has abrogated this rule.  On the oral argument something was said by counsel for the defendant to the effect that under the old rule defendant could not be put on his trial for murder in the first degree, and that he could not be affected by the change of the constitutional provision, the crime having been committed whilst the old constitution was in force.  There is, however, nothing in this; this change is a change not in crimes, but in criminal procedure, and such changes are not ex post facto.  Gut v. State, 9 Wall. 35 ; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 id. 326.”’ In Mallett v. North Carolina, 181 U. S. 589 (1901), the unrelated intervening error was an incorrect decision by the intermediate appellate court; in this case, it was the imposition of a supplementary fine in addition to the life sentence.  In Mallett , the restriction upon the review process prohibited the State from taking an appeal; in this case, it prohibits the courts from saving the conviction and sentence by removing the improper supplement.  Indeed, this case is a fortiori by comparison to Mallett .
