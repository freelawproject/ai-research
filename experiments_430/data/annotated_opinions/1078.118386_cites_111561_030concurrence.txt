**Concurrence Opinion**
 For attribution of indoctrination is a relative question.  If the government is offering assistance to recipients who provide, so to speak, a broad range of indoctrination, the government itself is not thought responsible for any particular indoctrination.  To put the point differently, if the government, seeking to further some legitimate secular purpose, offers aid on the same terms, without regard to religion, to all who adequately further that purpose, then it is fair to say that any aid going to a religious recipient only has the effect of furthering that secular purpose.” Ante, at 809-810 (citation omitted).  I agree with Justice Souter that the plurality, by taking such a stance, “appears to take evenhandedness neutrality and in practical terms promote it to a single and sufficient test for the establishment constitutionality of school aid.” Post, at 900 (dissenting opinion).  I do not quarrel with the plurality’s recognition that neutrality is an important reason for upholding government-aid programs against Establishment Clause challenges.  Our cases have described neutrality in precisely this mannei’, and we have emphasized a program’s neutrality repeatedly in our decisions approving various forms of school aid.  See, e. g., Agostini, supra, at 228, 231-282 ; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U. S. 1, 10 (1993); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Servs. for Blind, <citedDecision>474 U. S. 481, 487-488</citedDecision> (1986); <citedDecision>id., at 493</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring *839 in judgment); Mueller v. Allen, 463 U. S. 388, 397-399 (1983).  Nevertheless, we have never held that a government-aid program passes constitutional muster solely because of the neutral criteria it employs as a basis for distributing aid.  For example, in Agostini , neutrality was only one of several factors we considered in determining that New York City’s Title I program did not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.  See 521 U. S., at 226-228 (noting lack of evidence of inculcation of religion by Title I instructors, legal requirement that Title I services be supplemental to regular curricula, and that no Title I funds reached religious schools’ coffers).  Indeed, given that the aid in Agostini had secular content and was distributed on the basis of wholly neutral criteria, our consideration of additional factors demonstrates that the plurality’s rule does not accurately describe our recent Establishment Clause jurisprudence.  See also Zobrest, swpra, at 10,12-13 (noting that no government funds reached religious school’s coffers, aid did not relieve school of expense it otherwise would have assumed, and aid was not distributed to school but to the child).  Justice Souter provides a comprehensive review of our Establishment Clause cases on government aid to religious institutions that is useful for its explanation of the various ways in which we have used the term “neutrality” in our decisions.

 See Agostini, supra, at 226-227 (“[N]o evidence has ever shown that any New York City Title I instructor teaching on parochial school premises attempted to inculcate religion in students”); Allen, supra, at 248 (“Nothing in this record supports the proposition that all textbooks, whether they deal with mathematics, physics, foreign languages, history, or literature, are used by the parochial schools to teach religion”).  Of course, our focus on the lack of such evidence would have been entirely unnecessary if we had believed that the Establishment Clause permits the actual diversion of secular government aid to religious indoctrination.  Our decision in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U. S. 589 (1988), also demonstrates that actual diversion is constitutionally impermissible.  After eonclud- *841 ing that the government-aid program in question was constitutional on its face, we remanded the case so that the District Court could determine, after further factual development, whether aid recipients had used the government aid to support their religious objectives.  See id., at 621-622 ; id., at 624 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (“[T]he only purpose of further inquiring whether any particular grantee institution is pervasively sectarian is as a preliminary step to demonstrating that the funds are in fact being used to further religion”).  The remand would have been unnecessary if, as the plurality contends, actual diversion were irrelevant under the Establishment Clause.  The plurality bases its holding that actual diversion is permissible on <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest.  Ante, at 820-821.  Those decisions, however, rested on a significant factual premise missing from this ease, as well as from the majority of cases thus far considered by the Court involving Establishment Clause challenges to school aid programs.  Specifically, we decided <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest on the understanding that the aid was provided directly to the individual student who, in turn, made the choice of where to put that aid to use.  See Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> ; Zobrest, 609 U. S., at 10, 12.  Accordingly, our approval of the aid in both eases relied to a significant extent on the fact that “[a]ny aid .  .  .  that ultimately flows to religious institutions does so only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients.” <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 487</citedDecision> ; see Zobrest, supra, at 10 (“[A] government-paid interpreter will be present in a sectarian school only as a result of the private decision of individual parents”).  This characteristic of both programs made them less like a direct subsidy, which would be impermissible under the Establishment Clause, and more akin to the government issuing a paycheck to an employee who, in turn, donates a portion of that cheek to a religious institution.  See, <citedDecision>e.  g., Witters, supra, at 486-487</citedDecision> ; see also Rosenberger, supra, at 848 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (discussing Witters).  *842 Recognizing this distinction, the plurality nevertheless finds <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest — to the extent those decisions might permit the use of government aid for religious purposes — relevant in any ease involving a neutral, per-capita-aid program.  See ante, at 880-831.  Like Justice Souter, I do not believe that we should treat a per-eapita-aid program the same as the true private-choice programs considered in <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest .  See post, at 902.  First, when the government provides aid directly to the student beneficiary, that student can attend a religious school and yet retain control over whether the secular government aid will be applied toward the religious education.  The fact that aid flows to the religious school and is used for the advancement of religion is therefore wholly dependent on the student’s private decision.  See Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 848 (O’Con-nor, J., concurring) (discussing importance of private choice in Witters)', Witters, <citedDecision>474 U. S., at 488</citedDecision> (“[T]he fact that aid goes to individuals means that the decision to support religious education is made by the individual, not by the State”); <citedDecision>id., at 493</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (“The aid to religion at issue here is the result of petitioner’s private choice”).  It is for this reason that in Agostini we relied on <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and.  Zobrest to reject the rule “that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid,” 521 U. S., at 225 , yet also rested our approval of New York City’s Title I program in part on the lack of evidence of actual diversion, id., at 226-227 .  Second, I believe the distinction between a per capita school aid program and a true private-choice program is significant for purposes of endorsement.  See, e. g., Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U. S. 668, 692 (1984) (O’Connor, J., concurring).  In terms of public perception, a government program of direct aid to religious schools based on the number of students attending each school differs meaningfully from the government distributing aid directly to individual students *843 who, in turn, decide to use the aid at the same religious schools.  In the former example, if the religious school uses the aid to inculcate religion in its students, it is reasonable to say that the government has communicated a message of endorsement.  Because the religious indoctrination is supported by government assistance, the reasonable observer would naturally perceive the aid program as government support for the advancement of religion.  That the amount of aid received by the school is based on the school’s enrollment does not separate the government from the endorsement of the religious message.  The aid formula does not— and could not — indicate to a reasonable observer that the inculcation of religion is endorsed only by the individuals attending the religious school, who each affirmatively choose to direct the secular government aid to the school and its religious mission.  No such choices have been made.  In contrast, when government aid supports a school’s religious mission only because of independent decisions made by numerous individuals to guide their secular aid to that school, “[n]o reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts ... an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice or belief.” <citedDecision>Witters, supra, at 493</citedDecision> (O’Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Rather, endorsement of the religious message is reasonably attributed to the individuals who select the path of the aid.  Finally, the distinction between a per-capita-aid program and a true private-choice program is important when considering aid that consists of direct monetary subsidies.  This Court has “recognized special Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions.” Rosenberger, 515 U. S., at 842 ; see also ibid, (collecting cases).  If, as the plurality contends, a per-capita-aid program is identical in relevant constitutional respects to a true private-choice program, then there is no reason that, under the plurality’s reasoning, the government should be precluded from providing direct money payments *844 to religious organizations (including churches) based on the number of persons belonging to each organization.  And, because actual diversion is permissible under the plurality’s holding, the participating religious organizations (including churches) could use that aid to support religious indoctrination.  To be sure, the plurality does not actually hold that its theory extends to direct money payments.

 First, we explained that the Court had since abandoned “the presumption erected in Meek and Ball that the placement of public employees on parochial school grounds inevitably results in the impermissible effect of state-sponsored indoctrination or constitutes a symbolic union between government and religion.” Id., at 223.  Rather, relying on Zobrest , we explained that in the absence of evidence showing that teachers were actually using the Title I aid to inculcate religion, we would presume that the instructors would comply with the program’s secular restrictions.  See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 223-224, 226-227 .  The Title I services were required by statute to be “ 'secular, neutral, and nonideological.’ ” Id., at 210 (quoting 20U.S.C.  § 6321(a)(2)).  Second, we noted that the Court had “departed from the rule relied on in Ball that all government aid that directly assists the educational function of religious schools is invalid.” Agostini, supra, at 225 .  Relying on <citedDecision>Witters</citedDecision> and Zobrest , we noted that our cases had taken a more forgiving view of neutral government programs that make aid available generally without regard to the religious or nonreligious character of the recipient school.  See Agostini, 521 U. S., at 225-226 .  With respect to the specific Title I pro *848 gram at issue, we noted several factors that precluded us from finding an impermissible financing of religious indoctrination: the aid was “provided to students at whatever school they choose to attend,” the services were “by law supplemental to the regular curricula” of the benefited schools, “[n]o Title I funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools,” and there was no evidence of Title I instructors having “attempted to inculcate religion in students.” Id., at 226-228 .  Relying on the same factors, we also concluded that the New York City program could not “reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion.” Id., at 235 .  Although we found it relevant that Title I services could not be provided on a sehoolwide basis, we also explained that this fact was likely a sufficient rather than a necessary condition of the program’s constitutionality.  We were not “willing to conclude that the constitutionality of an aid program depends on the number of sectarian school students who happen to receive the otherwise neutral aid.” Id., at 229 .  The Chapter 2 program at issue here bears the same hallmarks of the New York City Title I program that we found important in Agostini .
