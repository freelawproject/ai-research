## Acting Case: Western Union Telegraph Company v. Texas, 105 U.S. 460
## 
### Initial Detection
Passage 1 indicates the Western Union Telegraph Company v. Texas directly cites the Target Case as legal precedent.

### Analysis of Explicit Negative Actions
The Acting Case does not explicitly state that the Target Case has been overruled, reversed, or otherwise explicitly negated. In fact, it upholds the Target Case by citing it as a precedent.

### Analysis of Implicit Negative Actions
The Acting Case does not implicitly overrule the Target Case. It aligns with the Target Case's reasoning and applies it to a similar scenario.

### Confidence and Rationale
I am certain that the Target Case has not been overruled, as the Acting Case relies it as a precedent and aligns with its reasoning.

### Note
Please read the passage carefully and focus only on the discussion related to the Target Case.


### Target Case
The Target Case mentioned in this passage is: `<targetCase>Indian Motocycle Co. v. United States, 283 U.S. 570</targetCase>` 


### Analysis & Rationale
The Acting Case acknowledges the existence and relevance of the Target Case by citing it and discussing its holding. However, I did not find any Explicit or Implicit Negative Actions indicating that the Target Case has been overruled. On the contrary, the passage appears to align with the reasoning in the Target Case, citing it as a principle in the discussion. 

Therefore, I conclude that the Target Case has not been overruled.

### Target Case
Curry v. McCanless, 307 U.S. 357


### Rationale and Confidence Level Computation
The passage demonstrates a clear intent to overrule the Target Case, Curry v. McCanless, with an Explicit Negative Action. The passage states, ""the Wachovia case must be overruled,"" directly referencing and overruling the Target Case. This statement leaves no ambiguity, and thus the confidence level is high.
