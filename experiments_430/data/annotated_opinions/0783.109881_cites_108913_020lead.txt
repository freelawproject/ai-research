Mr. Justice Brennan delivered the opinion of the Court. Petitioners, a class of female employees of the Department of Social Services and of the Board of Education of the city of New York, commenced this action under 42 U. S. C. § 1983 in July 1971.  1 The gravamen of the complaint was that the *661 Board and the Department had as a matter of official policy compelled pregnant employees to take unpaid leaves of absence before such leaves were required for medical reasons.  2 Cf. Cleveland Board of Education v. LaFleur, <citedDecision>414 U. S. 632</citedDecision> (1974).  The suit sought injunctive relief and backpay for periods of unlawful forced leave.  Named as defendants in the action were the Department and its Commissioner, the Board and its Chancellor, and the city of New York and its Mayor.  In each case, the individual defendants were sued solely in their official capacities.  3 On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court for the Southern District of New York held moot petitioners’ claims for injunctive and declaratory relief since the city of New York and the Board, after the filing of the complaint, had changed their policies relating to maternity leaves so that no pregnant employee would have to take leave unless she was medically unable to continue to perform her job.  394 F. Supp. 853, 855 (1975).  No one now challenges this conelu *662 sion.  The court did conclude, however, that the acts complained of were unconstitutional under <citedDecision>LaFleur, supra.</citedDecision> 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  Nonetheless plaintiffs’ prayers for backpay were denied because any such damages would come ultimately from the city of New York and, therefore, to hold otherwise would be to “circumvenft]” the immunity conferred on municipalities by Monroe v. Pape, 365 U. S. 167 (1961).  See 394 F. Supp., at 855 .  On appeal, petitioners renewed their arguments that the Board of Education 4 was not a “municipality” within the meaning of Monroe v. Pape, supra, and that, in any event, the District Court had erred in barring a damages award against the individual defendants.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected both contentions.  The court first held that the Board of Education was not a “person” under § 1983 because “it performs a vital governmental function .  .

 The plaintiffs further alleged that the Board had a policy of requiring women to take maternity leave after the seventh month of pregnancy unless that month fell in the last month of the school year, in which case the teacher could remain through the end of the school term. Amended Complaint ¶¶ 39, 42, 45, App. 18-19, 21.  This allegation was denied.  Answer ¶¶ 18, 22, App. 35, 37.  Amended Complaint ¶ 24, App. 11-12.  Petitioners conceded that the Department of Social Services enjoys the same status as New York City for Monroe purposes.  See 532 F. 2d, at 263 .  Milliken v. Bradley, 433 U.

Pape insofar as it holds that the doctrine of respondeat superior is not a basis for rendering municipalities *664 liable under § 1983 for the constitutional torts of their employees.  See Part II, infra.  We expressly declined to consider “policy considerations” for or against municipal liability.  See 365 U. S., at 191.  Mr. Justice Douglas, the author of Monroe, has suggested that the municipal exclusion might more properly rest on a theory that Congress sought to prevent the financial ruin that civil rights liability might impose on municipalities.
