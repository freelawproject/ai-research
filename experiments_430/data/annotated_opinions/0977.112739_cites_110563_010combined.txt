 who do no more than communicate with customers in the State by mail or common carrier as part of a general interstate business." We have continued to cite Bellas Hess with approval ever since.  For example, in Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252, 263 (1989), we expressed "doubt that termination of an interstate telephone call, by itself, provides a substantial enough nexus for a State to tax a call. See National Bellas Hess .  .  .  (receipt of mail provides insufficient nexus)." See also D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988); Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 609, 626</citedDecision> (1981); Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 445 U. S., at 437 ; National Geographic Society, 430 U. S., at 559 .  For these reasons, we disagree with the State Supreme Court's conclusion *312 that our decision in Complete Auto undercut the Bellas Hess rule.  The State of North Dakota relies less on Complete Auto and more on the evolution of our due process jurisprudence.  The State contends that the nexus requirements imposed by the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are equivalent and that if, as we concluded above, a mail-order house that lacks a physical presence in the taxing State nonetheless satisfies the due process "minimum contacts" test, then that corporation also meets the Commerce Clause "substantial nexus" test.  We disagree.  Despite the similarity in phrasing, the nexus requirements of the Due Process and Commerce Clauses are not identical.  The two standards are animated by different constitutional concerns and policies.

 No matter how we evaluate the burdens that use taxes impose on interstate commerce, Congress remains free to disagree with our conclusions.  See Prudential Insurance Co. v. Benjamin, 328 U. S. 408 (1946).  Indeed, in recent years Congress has considered legislation that would "overrule" the Bellas Hess rule.  [11] Its decision not to take action in this direction may, of course, have been dictated by respect for our holding in Bellas Hess that the Due Process Clause prohibits States from imposing such taxes, but today we have put that problem to rest. Accordingly, Congress is now free to decide whether, when, and to what extent the States may burden interstate mail-order concerns with a duty to collect use taxes.  Indeed, even if we were convinced that Bellas Hess was inconsistent with our Commerce Clause jurisprudence, "this very fact [might] giv[e us] pause and counse[l] withholding our hand, at least for now.  Congress has the power to protect interstate commerce from intolerable or even undesirable burdens." Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, <citedDecision>453 U. S., at 637</citedDecision> (White, J., concurring).  In this situation, it *319 may be that "the better part of both wisdom and valor is to respect the judgment of the other branches of the Government." <citedDecision>Id., at 638</citedDecision> .  The judgment of the Supreme Court of North Dakota is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  It is so ordered.  Justice Scalia, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Thomas join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.  National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., 386 U. S. 753 (1967), held that the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Constitution prohibit a State from imposing the duty of use-tax collection and payment upon a seller whose only connection with the State is through common carrier or the United States mail.  I agree with the Court that the Due Process Clause holding of Bellas Hess should be overruled.  Even before Bellas Hess, we had held, correctly I think, that state regulatory jurisdiction could be asserted on the basis of contacts with the State through the United States mail.

 And given the estimated loss in revenue to States of more than $3.2 billion this year alone, see Brief for Respondent 9, it is a sure bet that the vagaries of "physical presence" will be tested to their fullest in our courts.  The majority next explains that its "bright-line" rule encourages "settled expectations" and business investment.  Ante, at 316.  Though legal certainty promotes business confidence, the mail-order business has grown exponentially despite the long line of our post- Bellas Hess precedents that signaled the demise of the physical-presence requirement.  Moreover, the Court's seeming but inadequate justification of encouraging settled expectations in fact connotes a substantive economic decision to favor out-of-state direct marketers to the detriment of other retailers.  By justifying the Bellas Hess rule in terms of "the mail-order industry's dramatic growth over the last quarter century," ante, at 316, the Court is effectively imposing its own economic preferences in deciding this case. The Court's invitation to Congress to legislate in this area signals that its preferences are not immutable, but its approach is different from past instances in which we have deferred to state legislatures when they enacted tax obligations on the States' shares of interstate commerce.  See, e. g., Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U. S. 252 (1989); Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 609</citedDecision> (1981).  Finally, the Court accords far greater weight to stare decisis than was given to that principle in Complete Auto itself.  As that case demonstrates, we have not been averse to overruling our precedents under the Commerce Clause when they have become anachronistic in light of later decisions.  See Complete Auto, 430 U. S., at 288-289 .  One typically invoked rationale for stare decisis an unwillingness to upset settled expectationsis particularly weak in this case. It is unreasonable for companies such as Quill to invoke a "settled expectation" in conducting affairs without being taxed.  Neither Quill nor any of its amici point to any investment decisions *332 or reliance interests that suggest any unfairness in overturning Bellas Hess.  And the costs of compliance with the rule, in light of today's modern computer and software technology, appear to be nominal.

 See n. 8, infra .  [2]  The court also suggested that, in view of the fact that the "touchstone of Due Process is fundamental fairness" and that the "very object" of the Commerce Clause is protection of interstate business against discriminatory local practices, it would be ironic to exempt Quill from this burden and thereby allow it to enjoy a significant competitive advantage over local retailers.  470 N. W. 2d, at 214-215 .  [3] Felt & Tarrant Mfg. Co. v. Gallagher, 306 U. S. 62 (1939).  [4] Nelson v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 312 U. S. 359 (1941).  [5]  Under our current Commerce Clause jurisprudence, "with certain restrictions, interstate commerce may be required to pay its fair share of state taxes." D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 31 (1988); see also Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 609, 623-624</citedDecision> (1981) ("It was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of [the] state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing business") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  [6]  North Dakota's use tax illustrates well how a state tax might unduly burden interstate commerce.  On its face, North Dakota law imposes a collection duty on every vendor who advertises in the State three times in a single year.  Thus, absent the Bellas Hess rule, a publisher who included a subscription card in three issues of its magazine, a vendor whose radio advertisements were heard in North Dakota on three occasions, and a corporation whose telephone sales force made three calls into the State, all would be subject to the collection duty.  What is more significant, similar obligations might be imposed by the Nation's 6,000-plus taxing jurisdictions.  See National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue of Ill., 386 U. S. 753, 759-760 (1967) (noting that the "many variations in rates of tax, in allowable exemptions, and in administrative and record-keeping requirements could entangle [a mail-order house] in a virtual welter of complicated obligations") (footnotes omitted); see also Shaviro, An Economic and Political Look at Federalism in Taxation, 90 Mich. L. Rev. 895 , 925-926 (1992).  [7]  We have sometimes stated that the " Complete Auto test, while responsive to Commerce Clause dictates, encompasses as well .

[2]  Similarly, I am unconvinced by the majority's reliance on subsequent decisions that have cited Bellas Hess.  See ante, at 311.  In D. H. Holmes Co. v. McNamara, 486 U. S. 24, 33 (1988), for example, we distinguished Bellas Hess on the basis of the company's "significant economic presence in Louisiana, its many connections with the State, and the direct benefits it receives from Louisiana in conducting its business." We then went on to note that the situation presented was much more analogous to that in National Geographic Society v. California Bd. of Equalization, 430 U. S. 551 (1977).  See 486 U. S., at 33-34 .  In Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Montana, <citedDecision>453 U. S. 609, 626</citedDecision> (1981), the Court cited Bellas Hess not to revalidate the physical-presence requirement, but rather to establish that a "nexus" must exist to justify imposition of a state tax. And finally, in Mobil Oil Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes of Vt., 445 U. S. 425, 437 (1980), the Court cited Bellas Hess for the due process requirements necessary to sustain a tax. In my view, these citations hardly signal the continuing support of Bellas Hess that the majority seems to find persuasive.  [3]  Instead of remanding for consideration of whether Quill's ownership of software constitutes sufficient physical presence under its new Commerce Clause nexus requirement, the majority concludes as a matter of law that it does not.  See ante, at 315, n. 8.  In so doing, the majority rebuffs North Dakota's challenge without setting out any clear standard for what meets the Commerce Clause physical-presence nexus standard and without affording the State an opportunity on remand to attempt to develop facts or otherwise to argue that Quill's presence is constitutionally sufficient.  [4]  For the federal rule, see Flora v. United States, 357 U. S. 63 (1958); see generally J. Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation § 58A.05 (1992).  North Dakota appears to follow the same principle.  See First Bank of Buffalo v. Conrad, 350 N. W. 2d 580, 586 (N. D. 1984) (citing 72 Am. Jur. 2d § 1087).
