<p id="AMn">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p id="b686-8">Basing his complaint on the Illinois wrongful death statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appellant administrator brought this action in the Wisconsin state court to recover damages for the death of Harold Hughes, who was fatally injured in an automobile accident in Illinois. The allegedly negligent driver and an insurance company were named as defendants. On their motion the trial court entered summary judgment “dismissing the complaint on the merits.” It held that a Wisconsin statute, which creates a right of action only for deaths caused in that state, establishes a local public policy against Wisconsin’s entertaining suits brought under the wrongful death acts of other states.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Wisconsin Supreme Court affirmed, notwithstanding the contention that the local statute so construed violated the Full Faith and Credit Clause of Art. IV, § 1 of the Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The case is properly here on appeal under 28 U. S. C. § 1257.</p>
<p id="b687-4"><page-number citation-index="1" label="611">*611</page-number>We are called upon to decide the narrow question whether Wisconsin, over the objection raised, can close the doors of its courts to the cause of action created by the Illinois wrongful death act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior decisions have established that the Illinois statute is a “public act” within the provision of Art. IV, § 1 that “Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts ... of every other State.” <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is also settled that Wisconsin cannot escape this constitutional obligation to enforce the rights and duties validly created under the laws of other states by the simple device of removing jurisdiction from courts otherwise competent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have recognized, however, that full faith and credit does not automatically compel a forum state to subordinate its own statutory policy to a conflicting public act of another state; rather, it is for this Court to choose in each case between the competing public policies involved.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The clash of interests in cases of this type has usually been described as a conflict be<page-number citation-index="1" label="612">*612</page-number>tween the public policies of two or more states.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The more basic conflict involved in the present appeal, however, is as follows: On the one hand is the strong unifying principle embodied in the Full Faith and Credit Clause looking toward maximum enforcement in each state of the obligations or rights created or recognized by the statutes of sister states;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> on the other hand is the policy of Wisconsiri, as interpreted by its highest court, against permitting Wisconsin courts to entertain this wrongful death action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>
<p id="b688-6">We hold that Wisconsin’s policy must give way. That state has no real feeling of antagonism against wrongful death suits in general.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To the contrary, a forum is regularly provided for cases of this nature, the exclusionary rule extending only so far as to bar actions for death not caused locally.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Wisconsin policy, moreover, cannot <page-number citation-index="1" label="613">*613</page-number>be considered as an application of the <em>jorum non con-veniens </em>doctrine, whatever effect that doctrine might be given if its use resulted in denying enforcement to public acts of other states. Even if we assume that Wisconsin could refuse, by reason of particular circumstances, to hear foreign controversies to which nonresidents were parties,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the present case is not one lacking a close relationship with the state. For not only were appellant, the decedent and the individual defendant all residents of Wisconsin, but also appellant was appointed administrator and the corporate defendant was created under Wisconsin laws. We also think it relevant, although not crucial here, that Wisconsin may well be the only jurisdiction in which service could be had as an original matter on the insurance company defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And while in the present case jurisdiction over the individual defendant apparently could be had in Illinois by substituted service,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> in other cases Wisconsin’s exclusionary statute might amount to a deprivation of all opportunity to enforce valid death claims created by another state.</p>
<p id="b689-5">Under these circumstances, we conclude that Wisconsin’s statutory policy which excludes this Illinois cause of action is forbidden by the national policy of the Full Faith and Credit Clause.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The judgment is <page-number citation-index="1" label="614">*614</page-number>reversed and the cause is remanded to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>

<p id="b689-9"> In certain previous cases, <em>e. g., Pacific Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commission, </em>306 U. S. 493, 502; <em>Alaska Packers Assn. </em>v. <em>Commission, </em>294 U.

Subsequent to these decisions the Judicial Code was revised so as to provide: <em>“Such Acts </em><page-number citation-index="1" label="614">*614</page-number>[of the legislature of any state] . . . and judicial proceedings . . . shall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United States ... as they have ... in the courts of such State . . . from which they are taken.” (Italics added.) 28 U.
