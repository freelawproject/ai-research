[1] Section 6 [2] throws additional light on the meaning of these words.  When the phrase was used by Congress to describe allowable rates, it had relation to something ascertainable.  The rates were not left to the whim of the Commission.  The rates fixed would produce an annual return and that annual return was to be compared with a theoretical just and reasonable return, all risks considered, on the fair value of the property used and useful in the public service at the time of the determination.  Such an abstract test is not precise.  The agency charged with its determination has a wide range before it could properly be said by a court that the agency had disregarded statutory standards or had confiscated the property of the utility for public use.  Cf. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, <citedDecision>134 U.S. 418, 461-66</citedDecision> , dissent.  This is as Congress intends.  Rates are left to an experienced agency particularly competent by training to appraise the amount required.  The decision as to a reasonable return had not been a source of great difficulty, for borrowers and lenders reached such agreements daily in a multitude of situations; and although the determination of fair value had been troublesome, its essentials had been worked out in fairness to investor and consumer by the time of the enactment *622 of this Act.  Cf. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission, 289 U.S. 287 , 304 et seq. The results were well known to Congress and had that body desired to depart from the traditional concepts of fair value and earnings, it would have stated its intention plainly.  Helvering v. Griffiths, 318 U.S. 371 .  It was already clear that when rates are in dispute, "earnings produced by rates do not afford a standard for decision."

 The Natural Gas Act of 1938 should receive application in the light of this analysis, and MR. JUSTICE JACKSON has, I believe, drawn relevant inferences regarding the duty of the Federal Power Commission in fixing natural gas rates.  His exposition seems to me unanswered, and I shall say only a few words to emphasize my basic agreement with him.  For our society the needs that are met by public utilities are as truly public services as the traditional governmental functions of police and justice.  They are not less so when these services are rendered by private enterprise under governmental regulation.  Who ultimately determines the ways of regulation, is the decisive aspect in the public supervision of privately-owned utilities.  Foreshadowed nearly sixty years ago, Railroad Commission Cases, 116 U.S. 307, 331 , it was decided more than fifty years ago that the final say under the Constitution lies with the judiciary and not the legislature.  Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, <citedDecision>134 U.S. 418</citedDecision> .  While legal issues touching the proper distribution of governmental powers under the Constitution may always be raised, Congressional acquiescence to date in the doctrine of Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. <citedDecision>Minnesota, supra</citedDecision> , may fairly be claimed.  But in any event that issue is not here in controversy.  As pointed out in the opinions of my brethren, Congress has given only limited authority to the Federal Power Commission and made the exercise of that authority subject to judicial review.  The Commission is authorized to fix rates chargeable for natural gas.  But the rates that it can fix must be "just and reasonable." ยง 5 of the Natural Gas Act, 15 U.S.C. ยง 717 (d).  Instead of making the Commission's rate determinations final, Congress *626 specifically provided for court review of such orders.
