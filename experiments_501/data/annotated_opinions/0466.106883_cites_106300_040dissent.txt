**Dissenting Opinion**
 Putting to one side the fact that the case now before us is not a federal case, the vital fact remains that this case does not involve the deliberate interrogation of a defendant after the initiation of judicial proceedings against him.  The Court disregards this basic differenbe between the present case and Massiah’s, with the bland assertion that “that fact should make no difference.” Ante, p. 485.  It is “that fact,” I submit, which makes all the difference.  Under our system of criminal justice the institution of formal, meaningful judicial proceedings, by way of indictment, information, or arraignment, marks the *494 point at which a criminal investigation has ended and adversary proceedings have commenced.  It is at this point that the constitutional guarantees attach which pertain to a criminal trial. Among those guarantees are the right to a speedy trial, the right of confrontation, and the right to trial by jury.  Another is the guarantee of the assistance of counsel.  Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335 ; Hamilton v. Alabama, <citedDecision>368 U. S. 52</citedDecision> ; White v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 .  The confession which the Court today holds inadmissible was a voluntary one.  It was given during the course of a perfectly legitimate police investigation of an unsolved murder.  The Court says that what happened during this investigation “affected” the trial. I had always supposed that the whole purpose of a police investigation of a murder was to “affect” the trial of the murderer, and that it would be only an incompetent, unsuccessful, or corrupt investigation which would not do so. The Court further says that the Illinois police officers did not advise the petitioner of his “constitutional rights” before he confessed to the murder.  This Court has never held that the Constitution requires the police to give any “advice” under circumstances such as these.  Supported by no stronger authority than its own rhetoric, the Court today converts a routine police investigation of an unsolved murder into a distorted analogue of a judicial trial. It imports into this investigation constitutional concepts historically applicable only after the onset of formal prosecutorial proceedings.  By doing so, I think the Court perverts those precious constitutional guarantees, and frustrates the vital interests of society in preserving the legitimate and proper function of honest and purposeful police investigation.

 The decision is thus another major step in the direction of the goal which the Court seemingly has in mind — to bar from evidence all admissions obtained from an individual suspected of crime, whether involuntarily made or not.  It does of course put us one step “ahead” of the English judges who have had the good sense to leave the matter a discretionary one with the trial court. * I reject this step and *496 the invitation to go farther which the Court has now issued.  By abandoning the voluntary-involuntary test for admissibility of confessions, the Court seems driven by the notion that it is uncivilized law enforcement to use an accused’s own admissions against him at his trial. It attempts to find a home for this new and nebulous rule of due process by attaching it to the right to counsel guaranteed in the federal system by the Sixth Amendment and binding upon the States by virtue of the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Gideon v. Wainwright, supra. The right to counsel now not only entitles the accused to counsel’s advice and aid in preparing for trial but stands as an impenetrable barrier to any interrogation once the accused has become a suspect.  From that very moment apparently his right to counsel attaches, a rule wholly unworkable and impossible to administer unless police cars are equipped with public defenders and undercover agents and police informants have defense counsel at their side.  I would not abandon the Court’s prior cases defining with some care and analysis the circumstances requiring the presence or aid of counsel and substitute the amorphous and wholly unworkable principle that counsel is constitutionally required whenever he would or could be helpful.  Hamilton v. Alabama, <citedDecision>368 U. S. 52; White </citedDecision> v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 59 ; Gideon v. *497 Wainwright, supra. These cases dealt with the requirement of counsel at proceedings in which definable rights could be won or lost, not with stages where probative evidence might be obtained.  Under this new approach one might just as well argue that a potential defendant is constitutionally entitled to a lawyer before, not after, he commits a crime, since it is then that crucial incriminating evidence is put within the reach of the Government by the would-be accused.  Until now there simply has been no right guaranteed by the Federal Constitution to be free from the use at trial of a voluntary admission made prior to indictment.  It is incongruous to assume that the provision for counsel in the Sixth Amendment was meant to amend or supersede the self-incrimination provision of the Fifth Amendment, which is now applicable to the States.  Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1 .  That amendment addresses itself to the very issue of incriminating admissions of an accused and resolves it by proscribing only compelled statements.  Neither the Framers, the constitutional language, a century of decisions of this Court nor Professor Wigmore provides an iota of support for the idea that an accused has an absolute constitutional right not to answer even in the absence of compulsion — the constitutional right not to incriminate himself by making voluntary disclosures.
