Case of interest: Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority (1936)
-----------------------
Kentucky v. Dennison is the product of another time. The conception of the relation between the States and the Federal Government there announced is fundamentally incompatible with more than a century of constitutional development. Yet this decision has stood while the world of which it was a part has passed away. We conclude that it may stand no longer. The decision of the Court of Appeals is
Reversed.
JUSTICE O'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE POWELL joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I join Parts I, II-A, II-C, and III of the Court's opinion. Because the Court ultimately resolves this case under the *231 Extradition Act, 18 U.S. C. ยง 3182, I do not find Part II-B, and its statements concerning the Extradition Clause of the Constitution, necessary to the decision of this case. Accordingly, I do not subscribe to that part of the Court's opinion. See, e. g., Jean v. Nelson, 472 U.S. 846, 854 (1985); Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 361, n. 10 (1983); Ashwander v. TVA, <caseOfInterest>297 U.S. 288</caseOfInterest>, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).
JUSTICE SCALIA, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.
I concur in the result, and in the portions of the Court's opinion applying 18 U.S. C. ยง 3182 and overruling Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 How. 66 (1861), insofar as it interpreted the predecessor of that statute. I note that no party before us has asserted the lack of power of Congress to require extradition from a State to a Territory.
