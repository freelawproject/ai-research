 Writing in 1628, Lord Coke observed that “it hath beene resolved *44 by the Justices that a wife cannot be produced either against or for her husband.” 1 E. Coke, A Commentarie upon Little-ton 6b (1628).  See, generally, 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 2227 (McNaughton rev. 1961).  This spousal disqualification sprang from two canons of medieval jurisprudence: first, the rule that an accused was not permitted to testify in his own behalf because of his interest in the proceeding; second, the concept that husband and wife were one, and that since the woman had no recognized separate legal existence, the husband was that one.  From those two now long-abandoned doctrines, it followed that what was inadmissible from the lips of the defendant-husband was also inadmissible from his wife.  Despite its medieval origins, this rule of spousal disqualification remained intact in most common-law jurisdictions well into the 19th century.  See id., § 2333.  It was applied by this Court in Stein v. Bowman, <citedDecision>13 Pet. 209, 220-223</citedDecision> (1839), in Graves v. United States, 150 U. S. 118 (1893), and again in Jin Fuey Moy v. United States, 254 U. S. 189, 195 (1920), where it was deemed so well established a proposition as to “hardly requir[e] mention.” Indeed, it was not until 1933, in Funk v. United States, 290 U. S. 371 , that this Court abolished the testimonial disqualification in the federal courts, so as to permit the spouse of a defendant to testify in the defendant’s behalf.  Funk , however, left undisturbed the rule that either spouse could prevent the other from giving adverse testimony.  Id., at 373 .  The rule thus evolved into one of privilege rather than one of absolute disqualification.  See J. Maguire, Evidence, Common Sense and Common Law 78-92 (1947).  The modern justification for this privilege against adverse spousal testimony is its perceived role in fostering the harmony and sanctity of the marriage relationship.  Notwithstanding this benign purpose, the rule was sharply criticized.

 .  .  has a right to every man’s evidence.’ ” United States v. Bryan, 339 U. S. 323, 331 (1950).  As such, they must be strictly construed and accepted “only to the very limited extent that permitting a refusal to testify or excluding relevant evidence has a public good transcending the normally predominant principle of utilizing all rational means for ascertaining truth.” Elkins v. United States, 364 U. S. 206, 234 (1960) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).  Accord, United States v. Nixon, 418 U. S. 683, *51 709-710 (1974).  Here we must decide whether the privilege against adverse spousal testimony promotes sufficiently important interests to outweigh the need for probative evidence in the administration of criminal justice.  It is essential to remember that the Hawkins privilege is not needed to protect information privately disclosed between husband and wife in the confidence of the marital relationship— once described by this Court as “the best solace of human existence.” <citedDecision>Stein</citedDecision> v. Bowman, <citedDecision>13 Pet., at 223</citedDecision> .  Those confidences are privileged under the independent rule protecting confidential marital communications.  Blau v. United States, 340 U. S. 332 (1951); see n. 5, supra. The Hawkins privilege is invoked, not to exclude private marital communications, but rather to exclude evidence of criminal acts and of communications made in the presence of third persons.  No other testimonial privilege sweeps so broadly.  The privileges between priest and penitent, attorney and client, and physician and patient limit protection to private communications.  These privileges are rooted in the imperative need for confidence and trust.  The priest-penitent privilege recognizes the human need to disclose to a spiritual counselor, in total and absolute confidence, what are believed to be flawed acts or thoughts and to receive priestly consolation and guidance in return.
**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring in the judgment. Although agreeing with much of what the Court has to say, I cannot join an opinion that implies that “reason and experience” have worked a vast change since the Hawkins case was decided in 1958. In that case the Court upheld the privilege of a defendant in a criminal case to prevent adverse spousal testimony, in an all-but-unanimous opinion by Mr. Justice Black. Today the Court, in another all-but-unanimous opinion, obliterates that privilege because of the pur- *54 ported change in perception that “reason and experience” have'wrought. The fact of the matter is that the Court in this case simply accepts the very same arguments that the Court rejected when the Government first made them in the Hawkins case in 1958. I thought those arguments were valid then, 1 and I think so now. The Court is correct when it says that “[t]he ancient foundations for so sweeping a privilege have long since disappeared.” Ante, at 52. But those foundations had disappeared well before 1958; their disappearance certainly did not occur in the few years that have elapsed between the Hawkins decision and this one. To paraphrase what Mr. Justice Jackson once said in another context, there is reason to believe that today’s opinion of the Court will be of greater interest to students of human psychology than to students of law. 2 “The rule of evidence we are here asked to re-examine has been called a ‘sentimental relic.’ It was bom of two concepts long since rejected: that a criminal defendant was incompetent to testify in his own case, and that in law husband and wife were one. What thus began as a disqualification of either spouse from testifying at all yielded gradually to the policy of admitting all relevant evidence, until it has now become simply a privilege of the criminal defendant to prevent his spouse from testifying against him. “Any rule that impedes the discovery of truth in a court of law impedes as well the doing of justice. When such a rule is the product of a con-ceptualism long ago discarded, is universally criticized by scholars, and has been qualified or abandoned in many jurisdictions, it should receive the most careful scrutiny. Surely ‘reason and experience’ require that we do more than indulge in mere assumptions, perhaps naive assumptions, as to the importance of this ancient rule to the interests of domestic tranquillity.” Hawkins v. United States, 358 U. S. 74, 81-82 (concurring opinion) (citations and footnotes omitted). See Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U. S. 306, 325 (dissenting opinion).
