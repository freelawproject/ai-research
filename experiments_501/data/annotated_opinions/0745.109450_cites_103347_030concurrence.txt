**Concurrence Opinion**
Mr. Justice Stewart, concurring.  In Thornhill v. Alabama, <citedDecision>310 U. S. 88</citedDecision> , the Court observed that “[fjreedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.” <citedDecision>Id., at 102</citedDecision> .  Shortly after the Thorn-hill decision, the Court identified a single category of communications that is constitutionally unprotected: communications “which by their very utterance inflict *776 injury.” Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U. S. 568, 572 .  Yet only a month after Chaplinsky , and without reference to that decision, the Court stated in Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U. S. 52, 54 , that “the Constitution imposes no such restraint on government as respects purely commercial advertising.” For more than 30 years this “casual, almost offhand” statement in Chrestensen has operated to exclude commercial speech from the protection afforded by the First Amendment to other types of communication.  Cammarano v. United States, 358 U. S. 498, 514 (Douglas, J., concurring).  1 Today the Court ends the anomalous situation created by Chrestensen and holds that a communication which does no more than propose a commercial transaction is not “wholly outside the protection of the First Amendment.” Ante, at 761.  But since it is a cardinal principle of the First Amendment that “government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content,” 2 the Court's decision calls into immediate question the constitutional legitimacy of every state and federal law regulating false or deceptive advertising.  I write separately to explain why I think today’s decision does not preclude such governmental regulation.
